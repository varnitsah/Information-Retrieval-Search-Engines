17676449	beyond  by john galsworthy     che faro senza    to thomas hardy    beyond     part i   i   at the door of st georges registry office charles clare winton strolled forward in the wake of the taxicab that was bearing his daughter away with the fiddler fellow she had married his sense of decorum forbade his walking with nurse bettythe only other witness of the wedding a stout woman in a highly emotional condition would have been an incongruous companion to his slim upright figure moving with just that unexaggerated swing and balance becoming to a lancer of the old school even if he has been on the retired list for sixteen years  poor betty he thought of her with irritated sympathyshe need not have given way to tears on the doorstep she might well feel lost now gyp was gone but not so lost as himself his palegloved handthe one real hand he had for his right hand had been amputated at the wristtwisted vexedly at the small grizzling moustache lifting itself from the corners of his firm lips on this grey february day he wore no overcoat faithful to the absolute almost shamefaced quietness of that wedding he had not even donned black coat and silk hat but wore a blue suit and a hard black felt the instinct of a soldier and hunting man to exhibit no sign whatever of emotion did not desert him this dark day of his life but his greyhazel eyes kept contracting staring fiercely contracting again and at moments as if overpowered by some deep feeling they darkened and seemed to draw back in his head his face was narrow and weathered and thincheeked with a cleancut jaw small ears hair darker than the moustache but touched at the side wings with greythe face of a man of action selfreliant resourceful and his bearing was that of one who has always been a bit of a dandy and paid attention to form yet been conscious sometimes that there were things beyond a man who preserving all the precision of a type yet had in him a streak of something that was not typical such often have tragedy in their pasts  making his way towards the park he turned into mount street there was the house still though the street had been very different thenthe house he had passed up and down up and down in the fog like a ghost that november afternoon like a castout dog in such awful unutterable agony of mind twentythree years ago when gyp was born and then to be told at the doorhe with no right to enter he loving as he believed man never loved womanto be told at the door that she was deaddead in bearing what he and she alone knew was their child up and down in the fog hour after hour knowing her time was upon her and at last to be told that of all fates that befall man surely the most awful is to love too much  queer that his route should take him past the very house today after this new bereavement accursed luckthat gout which had sent him to wiesbaden last september accursed luck that gyp had ever set eyes on this fellow fiorsen with his fatal fiddle certainly not since gyp had come to live with him fifteen years ago had he felt so forlorn and fit for nothing tomorrow he would get back to mildenham and see what hard riding would do without gypto be without gyp a fiddler a chap who had never been on a horse in his life and with his crutchhandled cane he switched viciously at the air as though carving a man in two  his club near hyde park corner had never seemed to him so desolate from sheer force of habit he went into the cardroom the afternoon had so darkened that electric light already burned and there were the usual dozen of players seated among the shaded gleams falling decorously on darkwood tables on the backs of chairs on cards and tumblers the little gilded coffeecups the polished nails of fingers holding cigars a crony challenged him to piquet he sat down listless that threelegged whistbridgehad always offended his fastidiousnessa mangled short cut of a game poker had something blatant in it piquet though out of fashion remained for him the only game worth playingthe only game which still had style he held good cards and rose the winner of five pounds that he would willingly have paid to escape the boredom of the bout where would they be by now past newbury gyp sitting opposite that swedish fellow with his greenish wildcats eyes something furtive and so foreign about him a messif he were any judge of horse or man thank god he had tied gyps money upevery farthing and an emotion that was almost jealousy swept him at the thought of the fellows arms round his softhaired darkeyed daughterthat pretty willowy creature so like in face and limb to her whom he had loved so desperately  eyes followed him when he left the cardroom for he was one who inspired in other men a kind of admirationnone could say exactly why many quite as noted for general good sportsmanship attracted no such attention was it style or was it the streak of something not quite typicalthe brand left on him by the past  abandoning the club he walked slowly along the railings of piccadilly towards home that house in bury street st jamess which had been his london abode since he was quite youngone of the few in the street that had been left untouched by the general passion for puffing down and building up which had spoiled half london in his opinion  a man more silent than anything on earth with the soft quick dark eyes of a woodcock and a long greenish knitted waistcoat black cutaway and tight trousers strapped over his boots opened the door  i shant go out again markey mrs markey must give me some dinner anythingll do  markey signalled that he had heard and those brown eyes under eyebrows meeting and forming one long dark line took his master in from head to heel he had already nodded last night when his wife had said the govnor would take it hard retiring to the back premises he jerked his head toward the street and made a motion upward with his hand by which mrs markey an astute woman understood that she had to go out and shop because the govnor was dining in when she had gone markey sat down opposite betty gyps old nurse the stout woman was still crying in a quiet way it gave him the fair hump for he felt inclined to howl like a dog himself after watching her broad rosy tearful face in silence for some minutes he shook his head and with a gulp and a tremor of her comfortable body betty desisted one paid attention to markey  winton went first into his daughters bedroom and gazed at its emptied silken order its deserted silver mirror twisting viciously at his little moustache then in his sanctum he sat down before the fire without turning up the light anyone looking in would have thought he was asleep but the drowsy influence of that deep chair and cosy fire had drawn him back into the longago what unhappy chance had made him pass her house today   some say there is no such thing as an affinity no caseof a man at leastmade bankrupt of passion by a single love in theory it may be so in fact there are such menneckornothing men quiet and selfcontained the last to expect that nature will play them such a trick the last to desire such surrender of themselves the last to know when their fate is on them who could have seemed to himself and indeed to others less likely than charles clare winton to fall over head and ears in love when he stepped into the belvoir hunt ballroom at grantham that december evening twentyfour years ago a keen soldier a dandy a firstrate man to hounds already almost a proverb in his regiment for coolness and for a sort of courteous disregard of women as among the minor things of lifehe had stood there by the door in no hurry to dance taking a survey with an air that just did not give an impression of side because it was not at all put on andbeholdshe had walked past him and his world was changed for ever was it an illusion of light that made her whole spirit seem to shine through a halfstartled glance or a little trick of gait a swaying seductive balance of body was it the way her hair waved back or a subtle scent as of a flower what was it the wife of a squire of those parts with a house in london her name it doesnt mattershe has been long enough dead there was no excusenot an illtreated woman an ordinary humdrum marriage of three years standing no children an amiable good fellow of a husband fifteen years older than herself inclined already to be an invalid no excuse yet in one month from that night winton and she were lovers not only in thought but in deed a thing so utterly beyond good form and his sense of what was honourable and becoming in an officer and gentleman that it was simply never a question of weighing pro and con the cons had it so completely and yet from that first evening he was hers she his for each of them the one thought was how to be with the other if sowhy did they not at least go off together not for want of his beseeching and no doubt if she had survived gyps birth they would have gone but to face the prospect of ruining two men as it looked to her had till then been too much for that softhearted creature death stilled her struggle before it was decided there are women in whom utter devotion can still go hand in hand with a doubting soul such are generally the most fascinating for the power of hard and prompt decision robs women of mystery of the subtle atmosphere of change and chance though she had but one part in four of foreign blood she was not at all english but winton was english to his backbone english in his sense of form and in that curious streak of wholehearted desperation that will break form to smithereens in one department and leave it untouched in every other of its owners life to have called winton a crank would never have occurred to any onehis hair was always perfectly parted his boots glowed he was hard and reticent accepting and observing every canon of wellbred existence yet in that his one infatuation he was as lost to the world and its opinion as the longesthaired lentileater of us all though at any moment during that one year of their love he would have risked his life and sacrificed his career for a whole day in her company he never by word or look compromised her he had carried his punctilious observance of her honour to a point more bitter than death consenting even to her covering up the tracks of their childs coming paying that gamblers debt was by far the bravest deed of his life and even now its memory festered  to this very room he had come back after hearing she was dead this very room which he had refurnished to her taste so that even now with its satinwood chairs little dainty jacobean bureau shaded old brass candelabra divan it still had an air exotic to bachelordom there on the table had been a letter recalling him to his regiment ordered on active service if he had realized what he would go through before he had the chance of trying to lose his life out there he would undoubtedly have taken that life sitting in this very chair before the firethe chair sacred to her and memory he had not the luck he wished for in that little warmen who dont care whether they live or die seldom have he secured nothing but distinction when it was over he went on with a few more lines in his face a few more wrinkles in his heart soldiering shooting tigers pigsticking playing polo riding to hounds harder than ever giving nothing away to the world winning steadily the curious uneasy admiration that men feel for those who combine reckless daring with an icecool manner since he was less of a talker even than most of his kind and had never in his life talked of women he did not gain the reputation of a womanhater though he so manifestly avoided them after six years service in india and egypt he lost his right hand in a charge against dervishes and had perforce to retire with the rank of major aged thirtyfour for a long time he had hated the very thought of the childhis child in giving birth to whom the woman he loved had died then came a curious change of feeling and for three years before his return to england he had been in the habit of sending home odds and ends picked up in the bazaars to serve as toys in return he had received twice annually at least a letter from the man who thought himself gyps father these letters he read and answered the squire was likable and had been fond of her and though never once had it seemed possible to winton to have acted otherwise than he did he had all the time preserved a just and formal sense of the wrong he had done this man he did not experience remorse but he had always an irksome feeling as of a debt unpaid mitigated by knowledge that no one had ever suspected and discounted by memory of the awful torture he had endured to make sure against suspicion  when plus distinction and minus his hand he was at last back in england the squire had come to see him the poor man was failing fast from brights disease winton entered again that house in mount street with an emotion to stifle which required more courage than any cavalry charge but one whose heart as he would have put it is in the right place does not indulge the quaverings of his nerves and he faced those rooms where he had last seen her faced that lonely little dinner with her husband without sign of feeling he did not see little ghita or gyp as she had nicknamed herself for she was already in her bed and it was a whole month before he brought himself to go there at an hour when he could see the child if he would the fact is he was afraid what would the sight of this little creature stir in him when betty the nurse brought her in to see the soldier gentleman with the leather hand who had sent her those funny toys she stood calmly staring with her large deepbrown eyes being seven her little brownvelvet frock barely reached the knees of her thin brownstockinged legs planted one just in front of the other as might be the legs of a small brown bird the oval of her gravely wondering face was warm cream colour without red in it except that of the lips which were neither full nor thin and had a little tuck the tiniest possible dimple at one corner her hair of warm dark brown had been specially brushed and tied with a narrow red ribbon back from her forehead which was broad and rather low and this added to her gravity her eyebrows were thin and dark and perfectly arched her little nose was perfectly straight her little chin in perfect balance between round and point she stood and stared till winton smiled then the gravity of her face broke her lips parted her eyes seemed to fly a little and wintons heart turned over within himshe was the very child of her that he had lost and he said in a voice that seemed to him to tremble  well gyp  thank you for my toys i like them  he held out his hand and she gravely put her small hand into it a sense of solace as if some one had slipped a finger in and smoothed his heart came over winton gently so as not to startle her he raised her hand a little bent and kissed it it may have been from his instant recognition that here was one as sensitive as child could be or the way many soldiers acquire from dealing with their menthose simple shrewd childrenor some deeper instinctive sense of ownership between them whatever it was from that moment gyp conceived for him a rushing admiration one of those headlong affections children will sometimes take for the most unlikely persons  he used to go there at an hour when he knew the squire would be asleep between two and five after he had been with gyp walking in the park riding with her in the row or on wet days sitting in her lonely nursery telling stories while stout betty looked on half hypnotized a rather queer and doubting look on her comfortable faceafter such hours he found it difficult to go to the squires study and sit opposite him smoking those interviews reminded him too much of past days when he had kept such desperate check on himselftoo much of the old inward chafing against the other mans legal ownershiptoo much of the debt owing but winton was tripleproofed against betrayal of feeling the squire welcomed him eagerly saw nothing felt nothing was grateful for his goodness to the child well well he had died in the following spring and winton found that he had been made gyps guardian and trustee since his wifes death the squire had muddled his affairs his estate was heavily mortgaged but winton accepted the position with an almost savage satisfaction and from that moment schemed deeply to get gyp all to himself the mount street house was sold the lincolnshire place let she and nurse betty were installed at his own huntingbox mildenham in this effort to get her away from all the squires relations he did not scruple to employ to the utmost the power he undoubtedly had of making people feel him unapproachable he was never impolite to any of them he simply froze them out having plenty of money himself his motives could not be called in question in one year he had isolated her from all except stout betty he had no qualms for gyp was no more happy away from him than he from her he had but one bad halfhour it came when he had at last decided that she should be called by his name if not legally at least by custom round mildenham it was to markey he had given the order that gyp was to be little miss winton for the future when he came in from hunting that day betty was waiting in his study she stood in the centre of the emptiest part of that rather dingy room as far as possible away from any good or chattel how long she had been standing there heaven only knew but her round rosy face was confused between awe and resolution and she had made a sad mess of her white apron her blue eyes met wintons with a sort of desperation  about what markey told me sir my old master wouldnt have liked it sir  touched on the raw by this reminder that before the world he had been nothing to the loved one that before the world the squire who had been nothing to her had been everything winton said icily  indeed you will be good enough to comply with my wish all the same  the stout womans face grew very red she burst out breathless  yes sir but ive seen what ive seen i never said anything but ive got eyes if miss gyps to take your name sir then tonguesll wag and my dear dead mistress  but at the look on his face she stopped with her mouth open  you will be kind enough to keep your thoughts to yourself if any word or deed of yours gives the slightest excuse for talkyou go understand me you go and you never see gyp again in the meantime you will do what i ask gyp is my adopted daughter  she had always been a little afraid of him but she had never seen that look in his eyes or heard him speak in that voice and she bent her full moon of a face and went with her apron crumpled as apron had never been and tears in her eyes and winton at the window watching the darkness gather the leaves flying by on a souwesterly wind drank to the dregs a cup of bitter triumph he had never had the right to that dead foreverloved mother of his child he meant to have the child if tongues must wag let them this was a defeat of all his previous precaution a deep victory of natural instinct and his eyes narrowed and stared into the darkness   ii   in spite of his victory over all human rivals in the heart of gyp winton had a rival whose strength he fully realized perhaps for the first time now that she was gone and he before the fire was brooding over her departure and the past not likely that one of his decisive type whose life had so long been bound up with swords and horses would grasp what music might mean to a little girl such ones he knew required to be taught scales and in a cottage near a wood with other melodies he took care not to go within sound of them so that he had no conception of the avidity with which gyp had mopped up all and more than all her governess could teach her he was blind to the rapture with which she listened to any stray music that came its way to mildenhamto carols in the christmas dark to certain hymns and one special nunc dimittis in the village church attended with a hopeless regularity to the horn of the hunter far out in the quivering dripping coverts even to markeys whistling which was full and strangely sweet  he could share her love of dogs and horses take an anxious interest in her way of catching bumblebees in the hollow of her hand and putting them to her small delicate ears to hear them buzz sympathize with her continual ravages among the flowerbeds in the oldfashioned garden full of lilacs and laburnums in spring pinks roses cornflowers in summer dahlias and sunflowers in autumn and always a little neglected and overgrown a little squeezed in and elbowed by the more important surrounding paddocks he could sympathize with her attempts to draw his attention to the song of birds but it was simply not in him to understand how she loved and craved for music she was a cloudy little creature up and down in moodrather like a brown lady spaniel that she had now gay as a butterfly now brooding as night any touch of harshness she took to heart fearfully she was the strangest compound of pride and selldisparagement the qualities seemed mixed in her so deeply that neither she nor any one knew of which her cloudy fits were the result being so sensitive she fancied things terribly things that others did to her and thought nothing of often seemed to her conclusive evidence that she was not loved by anybody which was dreadfully unjust because she wanted to love everyonenearly then suddenly she would feel if they dont love me i dont care i dont want anything of anybody presently all would blow away just like a cloud and she would love and be gay until something fresh perhaps not at all meant to hurt her would again hurt her horribly in reality the whole household loved and admired her but she was one of those delicatetreading beings born with a skin too few whoand especially in childhoodsuffer from themselves in a world born with a skin too many  to wintons extreme delight she took to riding as a duck to water and knew no fear on horseback she had the best governess he could get her the daughter of an admiral and therefore in distressed circumstances and later on a tutor for her music who came twice a week all the way from londona sardonic man who cherished for her even more secret admiration than she for him in fact every male thing fell in love with her at least a little unlike most girls she never had an epoch of awkward plainness but grew like a flower evenly steadily winton often gazed at her with a sort of intoxication the turn of her head the way those perfectly shaped wonderfully clear brown eyes would fly the set of her straight round neck the very shaping of her limbs were all such poignant reminders of what he had so loved and yet for all that likeness to her mother there was a difference both in form and character gyp had as it were an extra touch of breeding more chiselling in body more fastidiousness in soul a little more poise a little more sheer grace in mood more variance in mind more clarity and mixed with her sweetness a distinct spice of scepticism which her mother had lacked  in modern times there are no longer toasts or she would have been one with both the hunts though delicate in build she was not frail and when her blood was up would go all day and come in so bonetired that she would drop on to the tiger skin before the fire rather than face the stairs life at mildenham was lonely save for wintons hunting cronies and they but few for his spiritual dandyism did not gladly suffer the average country gentleman and his frigid courtesy frightened women  besides as betty had foreseen tongues did wagthose tongues of the countryside avid of anything that might spice the tedium of dull lives and brains and though no breath of gossip came to wintons ears no women visited at mildenham save for the friendly casual acquaintanceships of churchyard huntingfield and local racemeetings gyp grew up knowing hardly any of her own sex this dearth developed her reserve kept her backward in sexperception gave her a faint unconscious contempt for mencreatures always at the beck and call of her smile and so easily disquieted by a little frowngave her also a secret yearning for companions of her own gender any girl or woman that she did chance to meet always took a fancy to her because she was so nice to them which made the transitory nature of these friendships tantalizing she was incapable of jealousies or backbiting let men beware of suchthere is coiled in their fibre a secret fascination  gyps moral and spiritual growth was not the sort of subject that winton could pay much attention to it was preeminently a matter one did not talk about outward forms such as going to church should be preserved manners should be taught her by his own example as much as possible beyond this nature must look after things his view had much real wisdom she was a quick and voracious reader bad at remembering what she read and though she had soon devoured all the books in wintons meagre library including byron whytemelville and humboldts cosmos they had not left too much on her mind the attempts of her little governess to impart religion were somewhat arid of result and the interest of the vicar gyp with her instinctive spice of scepticism soon put into the same category as the interest of all the other males she knew she felt that he enjoyed calling her my dear and patting her shoulder and that this enjoyment was enough reward for his exertions  tucked away in that little old dark manor house whose stables alone were up to datethree hours from london and some thirty miles from the wash it must be confessed that her upbringing lacked modernity about twice a year winton took her up to town to stay with his unmarried sister rosamund in curzon street those weeks if they did nothing else increased her natural taste for charming clothes fortified her teeth and fostered her passion for music and the theatre but the two main nourishments of the modern girldiscussion and gamesshe lacked utterly moreover those years of her life from fifteen to nineteen were before the social resurrection of 1906 and the world still crawled like a winter fly on a windowpane winton was a tory aunt rosamund a tory everybody round her a tory the only spiritual development she underwent all those years of her girlhood was through her headlong love for her father after all was there any other way in which she could really have developed only love makes fruitful the soul the sense of form that both had in such high degree prevented much demonstration but to be with him do things for him to admire and credit him with perfection and since she could not exactly wear the same clothes or speak in the same clipped quiet decisive voice to dislike the clothes and voices of other menall this was precious to her beyond everything if she inherited from him that fastidious sense of form she also inherited his capacity for putting all her eggs in one basket and since her company alone gave him real happiness the current of love flowed over her heart all the time though she never realized it abundant love for somebody was as necessary to her as water running up the stems of flowers abundant love from somebody as needful as sunshine on their petals and wintons somewhat frequent little runs to town to newmarket or where not were always marked in her by a fall of the barometer which recovered as his return grew near  one part of her education at all events was not neglectedcultivation of an habitual sympathy with her poorer neighbours without concerning himself in the least with problems of sociology winton had by nature an open hand and heart for cottagers and abominated interference with their lives and so it came about that gyp who by nature also never set foot anywhere without invitation was always hearing the words step in miss gyp step in and sit down lovey and a good many words besides from even the boldest and baddest characters there is nothing like a soft and pretty face and sympathetic listening for seducing the hearts of the people  so passed the eleven years till she was nineteen and winton fortysix then under the wing of her little governess she went to the huntball she had revolted against appearing a fluffy miss wanting to be considered at once fullfledged so that her dress perfect in fit was not white but palest maizecolour as if she had already been to dances she had all wintons dandyism and just so much more as was appropriate to her sex with her dark hair wonderfully fluffed and coiled waving across her forehead her neck bare for the first time her eyes really flying and a demeanour perfectly coolas though she knew that light and movement covetous looks soft speeches and admiration were her birthrightshe was more beautiful than even winton had thought her at her breast she wore some sprigs of yellow jasmine procured by him from towna flower of whose scent she was very fond and that he had never seen worn in ballrooms that swaying delicate creature warmed by excitement reminded him in every movement and by every glance of her eyes of her whom he had first met at just such a ball as this and by the carriage of his head the twist of his little moustache he conveyed to the world the pride he was feeling  that evening held many sensations for gypsome delightful one confused one unpleasant she revelled in her success admiration was very dear to her she passionately enjoyed dancing loved feeling that she was dancing well and giving pleasure but twice over she sent away her partners smitten with compassion for her little governess sitting there against the wallall alone with no one to take notice of her because she was elderly and roundabout poor darling and to that loyal persons horror she insisted on sitting beside her all through two dances nor would she go in to supper with anyone but winton returning to the ballroom on his arm she overheard an elderly woman say oh dont you know of course he really is her father and an elderly man answer ah that accounts for itquite so with those eyes at the back of the head which the very sensitive possess she could see their inquisitive cold slightly malicious glances and knew they were speaking of her and just then her partner came for her  really is her father the words meant too much to be grasped this evening of full sensations they left a little bruise somewhere but softened and anointed just a sense of confusion at the back of her mind and very soon came that other sensation so disillusioning that all else was crowded out it was after a dancea splendid dance with a goodlooking man quite twice her age they were sitting behind some palms he murmuring in his mellow flown voice admiration for her dress when suddenly he bent his flushed face and kissed her bare arm above the elbow if he had hit her he could not have astonished or hurt her more it seemed to her innocence that he would never have done such a thing if she had not said something dreadful to encourage him without a word she got up gazed at him a moment with eyes dark from pain shivered and slipped away she went straight to winton from her face all closed up tightened lips and the familiar little droop at their corners he knew something dire had happened and his eyes boded ill for the person who had hurt her but she would say nothing except that she was tired and wanted to go home and so with the little faithful governess who having been silent perforce nearly all the evening was now full of conversation they drove out into the frosty night winton sat beside the chauffeur smoking viciously his fur collar turned up over his ears his eyes stabbing the darkness under his round lowdrawn fur cap who had dared upset his darling and within the car the little governess chattered softly and gyp shrouded in lace in her dark corner sat silent seeing nothing but the vision of that insult sad end to a lovely night  she lay awake long hours in the darkness while a sort of coherence was forming in her mind those words really is her father and that mans kissing of her bare arm were a sort of revelation of sexmystery hardening the consciousness that there was something at the back of her life a child so sensitive had not of course quite failed to feel the spiritual draughts around her but instinctively she had recoiled from more definite perceptions the time before winton came was all so faintbetty toys short glimpses of a kind invalidish man called papa as in that word there was no depth compared with the word dad bestowed on winton so there had been no depth in her feelings towards the squire when a girl has no memory of her mother how dark are many things none except betty had ever talked of her mother there was nothing sacred in gyps associations no faiths to be broken by any knowledge that might come to her isolated from other girls she had little realisation even of the conventions still she suffered horribly lying there in the darkfrom bewilderment from thorns dragged over her skin rather than from a stab in the heart the knowledge of something about her conspicuous doubtful provocative of insult as she thought grievously hurt her delicacy those few wakeful hours made a heavy mark she fell asleep at last still all in confusion and woke up with a passionate desire to know all that morning she sat at her piano playing refusing to go out frigid to betty and the little governess till the former was reduced to tears and the latter to wordsworth after tea she went to wintons study that dingy little room where he never studied anything with leather chairs and books whichexcept mr jorrocks byron those on the care of horses and the novels of whytemelvillewere never read with prints of superequine celebrities his sword and photographs of gyp and of brother officers on the walls two bright spots there were indeedthe fire and the little bowl that gyp always kept filled with flowers  when she came gliding in like that a slender rounded figure her creamy darkeyed oval face all cloudy she seemed to winton to have grown up of a sudden he had known all day that something was coming and had been cudgelling his brains finely from the fervour of his love for her he felt an anxiety that was almost fear what could have happened last nightthat first night of her entrance into societymeddlesome gossiping society she slid down to the floor against his knee he could not see her face could not even touch her for she had settled down on his right side he mastered his tremors and said  well gyptired  no  a little bit  no  was it up to what you thought last night  yes  the logs hissed and crackled the long flames ruffled in the chimneydraught the wind roared outsidethen so suddenly that it took his breath away  dad are you really and truly my father  when that which one has always known might happen at last does happen how little one is prepared in the few seconds before an answer that could in no way be evaded winton had time for a tumult of reflection a less resolute character would have been caught by utter mental blankness then flung itself in panic on yes or no but winton was incapable of losing his head he would not answer without having faced the consequences of his reply to be her father was the most warming thing in his life but if he avowed it how far would he injure her love for him what did a girl know how make her understand what would her feeling be about her dead mother how would that dead loved one feel what would she have wished  it was a cruel moment and the girl pressed against his knee with face hidden gave him no help impossible to keep it from her now that her instinct was roused silence too would answer for him and clenching his hand on the arm of his chair he said  yes gyp your mother and i loved each other he felt a quiver go through her would have given much to see her face what even now did she understand well it must be gone through with and he said  what made you ask  she shook her head and murmured  im glad  grief shock even surprise would have roused all his loyalty to the dead all the old stubborn bitterness and he would have frozen up against her but this acquiescent murmur made him long to smooth it down  nobody has ever known she died when you were born it was a fearful grief to me if youve heard anything its just gossip because you go by my name your mother was never talked about but its best you should know now youre grown up people dont often love as she and i loved you neednt be ashamed  she had not moved and her face was still turned from him she said quietly  im not ashamed am i very like her  yes more than i could ever have hoped  very low she said  then you dont love me for myself  winton was but dimly conscious of how that question revealed her nature its power of piercing instinctively to the heart of things its sensitive pride and demand for utter and exclusive love to things that go too deep one opposes the bulwark of obtuseness and smiling he simply said  what do you think  then to his dismay he perceived that she was cryingstruggling against it so that her shoulder shook against his knee he had hardly ever known her cry not in all the disasters of unstable youth and she had received her full meed of knocks and tumbles he could only stroke that shoulder and say  dont cry gyp dont cry  she ceased as suddenly as she had begun got up and before he too could rise was gone  that evening at dinner she was just as usual he could not detect the slightest difference in her voice or manner or in her goodnight kiss and so a moment that he had dreaded for years was over leaving only the faint shame which follows a breach of reticence on the spirits of those who worship it while the old secret had been quite undisclosed it had not troubled him disclosed it hurt him but gyp in those twentyfour hours had left childhood behind for good her feeling toward men had hardened if she did not hurt them a little they would hurt her the sexinstinct had come to life to winton she gave as much love as ever even more perhaps but the dew was off   iii   the next two years were much less solitary passed in more or less constant gaiety his confession spurred winton on to the fortification of his daughters position he would stand no nonsense would not have her looked on askance there is nothing like style for carrying the defences of societyonly it must be the genuine thing whether at mildenham or in london under the wing of his sister there was no difficulty gyp was too pretty winton too cool his quietness too formidable she had every advantage society only troubles itself to make front against the visibly weak  the happiest time of a girls life is that when all appreciate and covet her and she herself is free as aira queen of hearts for none of which she hankers or if not the happiest at all events it is the gayest time what did gyp care whether hearts ached for hershe knew not love as yet perhaps would never know the pains of unrequited love intoxicated with life she led her many admirers a pretty dance treating them with a sort of bravura she did not want them to be unhappy but she simply could not take them seriously never was any girl so heartfree she was a queer mixture in those days would give up any pleasure for winton and most for betty or her aunther little governess was gonebut of nobody else did she seem to take account accepting all that was laid at her feet as the due of her looks her dainty frocks her music her good riding and dancing her talent for amateur theatricals and mimicry winton whom at least she never failed watched that glorious fluttering with quiet pride and satisfaction he was getting to those years when a man of action dislikes interruption of the grooves into which his activity has fallen he pursued his hunting racing cardplaying and his very stealthy alms and services to lame ducks of his old regiment their families and other unfortunateshappy in knowing that gyp was always as glad to be with him as he to be with her hereditary gout too had begun to bother him  the day that she came of age they were up in town and he summoned her to the room in which he now sat by the fire recalling all these things to receive an account of his stewardship he had nursed her greatly embarrassed inheritance very carefully till it amounted to some twenty thousand pounds he had never told her of itthe subject was dangerous and since his own means were ample she had not wanted for anything when he had explained exactly what she owned shown her how it was invested and told her that she must now open her own banking account she stood gazing at the sheets of paper whose items she had been supposed to understand and her face gathered the look which meant that she was troubled without lifting her eyes she asked  does it all come fromhim  he had not expected that and flushed under his tan  no eight thousand of it was your mothers  gyp looked at him and said  then i wont take the restplease dad  winton felt a sort of crabbed pleasure what should be done with that money if she did not take it he did not in the least know but not to take it was like her made her more than ever his daughtera kind of final victory he turned away to the window from which he had so often watched for her mother there was the corner she used to turn in one minute surely she would be standing there colour glowing in her cheeks her eyes soft behind her veil her breast heaving a little with her haste waiting for his embrace there she would stand drawing up her veil he turned round difficult to believe it was not she and he said  very well my love but you will take the equivalent from me instead the other can be put by some one will benefit some day  at those unaccustomed words my love from his undemonstrative lips the colour mounted in her cheeks and her eyes shone she threw her arms round his neck  she had her fill of music in those days taking piano lessons from a monsieur harmost a greyhaired native of liege with mahogany cheeks and the touch of an angel who kept her hard at it and called her his little friend there was scarcely a concert of merit that she did not attend or a musician of mark whose playing she did not know and though fastidiousness saved her from squirming in adoration round the feet of those prodigious performers she perched them all on pedestals men and women alike and now and then met them at her aunts house in curzon street  aunt rosamund also musical so far as breeding would allow stood for a good deal to gyp who had built up about her a romantic story of love wrecked by pride from a few words she had once let drop she was a tall and handsome woman a year older than winton with a long aristocratic face deepblue rather shining eyes a gentlemanly manner warm heart and one of those indescribable not unmelodious drawls that one connects with an unshakable sense of privilege she in turn was very fond of gyp and what passed within her mind by no means devoid of shrewdness as to their real relationship remained ever discreetly hidden she was so far again as breeding would allow something of a humanitarian and rebel loving horses and dogs and hating cats except when they had four legs the girl had just that softness which fascinates women who perhaps might have been happier if they had been born men not that rosamund winton was of an aggressive typeshe merely had the resolute catch hold of your tail old fellow spirit so often found in englishwomen of the upper classes a cheery soul given to long coats and waistcoats stocks and a crutchhandled stick shelike her brotherhad style but more sense of humourvaluable in musical circles at her house the girl was practically compelled to see fun as well as merit in all those prodigies haloed with hair and filled to overflowing with music and themselves and since gyps natural sense of the ludicrous was extreme she and her aunt could rarely talk about anything without going into fits of laughter  winton had his first really bad attack of gout when gyp was twentytwo and terrified lest he might not be able to sit a horse in time for the opening meets he went off with her and markey to wiesbaden they had rooms in the wilhelmstrasse overlooking the gardens where leaves were already turning that gorgeous september the cure was long and obstinate and winton badly bored gyp fared much better attended by the silent markey she rode daily on the neroberg chafing at regulations which reduced her to specified tracks in that majestic wood where the beeches glowed once or even twice a day she went to the concerts in the kurhaus either with her father or alone  the first time she heard fiorsen play she was alone unlike most violinists he was tall and thin with great pliancy of body and swift sway of movement his face was pale and went strangely with hair and moustache of a sort of dirtgold colour and his thin cheeks with very broad high cheekbones had little narrow scraps of whisker those little whiskers seemed to gyp awfulindeed he seemed rather awful altogetherbut his playing stirred and swept her in the most uncanny way he had evidently remarkable technique and the emotion the intense wayward feeling of his playing was chiselled by that technique as if a flame were being frozen in its swaying when he stopped she did not join in the tornado of applause but sat motionless looking up at him quite unconstrained by all those people he passed the back of his hand across his hot brow shoving up a wave or two of that queercoloured hair then with a rather disagreeable smile he made a short supple bow or two and she thought what strange eyes he haslike a great cats surely they were green fierce yet shy almost furtivemesmeric certainly the strangest man she had ever seen and the most frightening he seemed looking straight at her and dropping her gaze she clapped when she looked again his face had lost that smile for a kind of wistfulness he made another of those little supple bows straight at herit seemed to gypand jerked his violin up to his shoulder hes going to play to me she thought absurdly he played without accompaniment a little tune that seemed to twitch the heart when he finished this time she did not look up but was conscious that he gave one impatient bow and walked off  that evening at dinner she said to winton  i heard a violinist today dad the most wonderful playinggustav fiorsen is that swedish do you thinkor what  winton answered  very likely what sort of a bounder was he to look at i used to know a swede in the turkish armynice fellow too  tall and thin and whitefaced with bumpy cheekbones and hollows under them and queer green eyes oh and little goldy sidewhiskers  by jove it sounds the limit  gyp murmured with a smile  yes i think perhaps he is  she saw him next day in the gardens they were sitting close to the schiller statue winton reading the times to whose advent he looked forward more than he admitted for he was loath by confessions of boredom to disturb gyps manifest enjoyment of her stay while perusing the customary comforting animadversions on the conduct of those rascally radicals who had just come into power and the account of a newmarket meeting he kept stealing sidelong glances at his daughter  certainly she had never looked prettier daintier shown more breeding than she did out here among these germans with their thick pasterns and all the cosmopolitan hairyheeled crowd in this godforsaken place the girl unconscious of his stealthy regalement was letting her clear eyes rest in turn on each figure that passed on the movements of birds and dogs watching the sunlight glisten on the grass burnish the copper beeches the limetrees and those tall poplars down there by the water the doctor at mildenham once consulted on a bout of headache had called her eyes perfect organs and certainly no eyes could take things in more swiftly or completely she was attractive to dogs and every now and then one would stop in two minds whether or no to put his nose into this foreign girls hand from a flirtation of eyes with a great dane she looked up and saw fiorsen passing in company with a shorter square man having very fashionable trousers and a corseted waist the violinists tall thin loping figure was tightly buttoned into a brownishgrey frockcoat suit he wore a rather broadbrimmed grey velvety hat in his buttonhole was a white flower his clothtopped boots were of patent leather his tie was bunched out at the ends over a soft whitelinen shirtaltogether quite a dandy his most strange eyes suddenly swept down on hers and he made a movement as if to put his hand to his hat  why he remembers me thought gyp that thinwaisted figure with head set just a little forward between rather high shoulders and its long stride curiously suggested a leopard or some lithe creature he touched his short companions arm muttered something turned round and came back she could see him staring her way and knew he was coming simply to look at her she knew too that her father was watching and she felt that those greenish eyes would waver before his starethat stare of the englishman of a certain class which never condescends to be inquisitive they passed gyp saw fiorsen turn to his companion slightly tossing back his head in their direction and heard the companion laugh a little flame shot up in her  winton said  rumlooking johnnies one sees here  that was the violinist i told you offiorsen  oh ah but he had evidently forgotten  the thought that fiorsen should have picked her out of all that audience for remembrance subtly flattered her vanity she lost her ruffled feeling though her father thought his dress awful it was really rather becoming he would not have looked as well in proper english clothes once at least during the next two days she noticed the short square young man who had been walking with him and was conscious that he followed her with his eyes  and then a certain baroness von maisen a cosmopolitan friend of aunt rosamunds german by marriage halfdutch halffrench by birth asked her if she had heard the swedish violinist fiorsen he would be she said the best violinist of the day ifand she shook her head finding that expressive shake unquestioned the baroness pursued her thoughts  ah these musicians he wants saving from himself if he does not halt soon he will be lost pity a great talent  gyp looked at her steadily and asked  does he drink then  pas mal but there are things besides drink ma chere  instinct and so much life with winton made the girl regard it as beneath her to be shocked she did not seek knowledge of life but refused to shy away from it or be discomfited and the baroness to whom innocence was piquant went on  des femmestoujours des femmes cest grand dommage it will spoil his spirit his sole chance is to find one woman but i pity her sapristi quelle vie pour elle  gyp said calmly  would a man like that ever love  the baroness goggled her eyes  i have known such a man become a slave i have known him running after a woman like a lamb while she was deceiving him here and there on ne peut jamais dire ma belle il y a des choses que vous ne savez pas encore she took gyps hand and yet one thing is certain with those eyes and those lips and that figure you have a time before you  gyp withdrew her hand smiled and shook her head she did not believe in love  ah but you will turn some heads no fear as you english say there is fatality in those pretty brown eyes  a girl may be pardoned who takes as a compliment the saying that her eyes are fatal the words warmed gyp uncontrollably lighthearted in these days just as she was warmed when people turned to stare at her the soft air the mellowness of this gay place much music a sense of being a rara avis among people who by their heavier type enhanced her own had produced in her a kind of intoxication making her what the baroness called un peu folle she was always breaking into laughter having that precious feeling of twisting the world round her thumb which does not come too often in the life of one who is sensitive everything to her just then was either funny or lovely and the baroness conscious of the girls chic genuinely attracted by one so pretty took care that she saw all the people perhaps more than all that were desirable  to women and artists between whom there is ever a certain kinship curiosity is a vivid emotion besides the more a man has conquered the more precious field he is for a womans conquest to attract a man who has attracted many what is it but a proof that ones charm is superior to that of all those others the words of the baroness deepened in gyp the impression that fiorsen was impossible but secretly fortified the faint excitement she felt that he should have remembered her out of all that audience later on they bore more fruit than that but first came that queer incident of the flowers  coming in from a ride a week after she had sat with winton under the schiller statue gyp found on her dressingtable a bunch of gloire de dijon and la france roses plunging her nose into them she thought how lovely who sent me these there was no card all that the german maid could say was that a boy had brought them from a flower shop fur fraulein vinton it was surmised that they came from the baroness in her bodice at dinner and to the concert after gyp wore one la france and one gloire de dijona daring mixture of pink and orange against her oystercoloured frock which delighted her who had a passion for experiments in colour they had bought no programme all music being the same to winton and gyp not needing any when she saw fiorsen come forward her cheeks began to colour from sheer anticipation  he played first a minuet by mozart then the cesar franck sonata and when he came back to make his bow he was holding in his hand a gloire de dijon and a la france rose involuntarily gyp raised her hand to her own roses his eyes met hers he bowed just a little lower then quite naturally put the roses to his lips as he was walking off the platform gyp dropped her hand as if it had been stung then with the swift thought oh thats schoolgirlish she contrived a little smile but her cheeks were flushing should she take out those roses and let them fall her father might see might notice fiorsensput two and two together he would consider she had been insulted had she she could not bring herself to think so it was too pretty a compliment as if he wished to tell her that he was playing to her alone the baronesss words flashed through her mind he wants saving from himself pity a great talent it was a great talent there must be something worth saving in one who could play like that they left after his last solo gyp put the two roses carefully back among the others  three days later she went to an afternoon at home at the baroness von maisens she saw him at once over by the piano with his short square companion listening to a voluble lady and looking very bored and restless all that overcast afternoon still and with queer lights in the sky as if rain were coming gyp had been feeling out of mood a little homesick now she felt excited she saw the short companion detach himself and go up to the baroness a minute later he was brought up to her and introducedcount rosek gyp did not like his face there were dark rings under the eyes and he was too perfectly selfpossessed with a kind of cold sweetness but he was very agreeable and polite and spoke english well he wasit seemeda pole who lived in london and seemed to know all that was to be known about music miss wintonhe believedhad heard his friend fiorsen play but not in london no that was odd he had been there some months last season faintly annoyed at her ignorance gyp answered  yes but i was in the country nearly all last summer  he had a great success i shall take him back it is best for his future what do you think of his playing  in spite of herself for she did not like expanding to this sphinxlike little man gyp murmured  oh simply wonderful of course  he nodded and then rather suddenly said with a peculiar little smile  may i introduce him gustavmiss winton  gyp turned there he was just behind her bowing and his eyes had a look of humble adoration which he made no attempt whatever to conceal gyp saw another smile slide over the poles lips and she was alone in the bay window with fiorsen the moment might well have fluttered a girls nerves after his recognition of her by the schiller statue after that episode of the flowers and what she had heard of him but life had not yet touched either her nerves or spirit she only felt amused and a little excited close to he had not so much that look of an animal behind bars and he certainly was in his way a dandy beautifully washedalways an important thingand having some pleasant essence on his handkerchief or hair of which gyp would have disapproved if he had been english he wore a diamond ring also which did not somehow seem bad form on that particular little finger his height his broad cheekbones thick but not long hair the hungry vitality of his face figure movements annulled those evidences of femininity he was male enough rather too male speaking with a queer crisp accent he said  miss winton you are my audience here i play to youonly to you  gyp laughed  you laugh at me but you need not i play for you because i admire you i admire you terribly if i sent you those flowers it was not to be rude it was my gratitude for the pleasure of your face his voice actually trembled and looking down gyp answered  thank you it was very kind of you i want to thank you for your playing it is beautifulreally beautiful  he made her another little bow  when i go back to london will you come and hear me  i should think any one would go to hear you if they had the chance  he gave a short laugh  bah here i do it for money i hate this place it bores mebores me was that your father sitting with you under the statue  gyp nodded suddenly grave she had not forgotten the slighting turn of his head  he passed his hand over his face as if to wipe off its expression  he is very english but youof no countryyou belong to all  gyp made him an ironical little bow  no i should not know your countryyou are neither of the north nor of the south you are just woman made to be adored i came here hoping to meet you i am extremely happy miss winton i am your very devoted servant  he was speaking very fast very low with an agitated earnestness that surely could not be put on but suddenly muttering these people he made her another of his little bows and abruptly slipped away the baroness was bringing up another man the chief thought left by that meeting was is that how he begins to everyone she could not quite believe it the stammering earnestness of his voice those humbly adoring looks then she remembered the smile on the lips of the little pole and thought but he must know im not silly enough just to be taken in by vulgar flattery  too sensitive to confide in anyone she had no chance to ventilate the curious sensations of attraction and repulsion that began fermenting in her feelings defying analysis mingling and quarrelling deep down in her heart it was certainly not love not even the beginning of that but it was the kind of dangerous interest children feel in things mysterious out of reach yet within reach if only they dared and the tug of music was there and the tug of those words of the baroness about salvationthe thought of achieving the impossible reserved only for the woman of supreme charm for the true victress but all these thoughts and feelings were as yet in embryo she might never see him again and she certainly did not know whether she even wanted to   iv   gyp was in the habit of walking with winton to the kochbrunnen where with other patientfolk he was required to drink slowly for twenty minutes every morning while he was imbibing she would sit in a remote corner of the garden and read a novel in the reclam edition as a daily german lesson  she was sitting there the morning after the athome at the baroness von maisens reading turgenevs torrents of spring when she saw count rosek sauntering down the path with a glass of the waters in his hand instant memory of the smile with which he had introduced fiorsen made her take cover beneath her sunshade she could see his patentleathered feet and wellturned pegtoptrousered legs go by with the gait of a man whose waist is corseted the certainty that he wore those prerogatives of womanhood increased her dislike how dare men be so effeminate yet someone had told her that he was a good rider a good fencer and very strong she drew a breath of relief when he was past and for fear he might turn and come back closed her little book and slipped away but her figure and her springing step were more unmistakable than she knew  next morning on the same bench she was reading breathlessly the scene between gemma and sanin at the window when she heard fiorsens voice behind her say  miss winton  he too held a glass of the waters in one hand and his hat in the other  i have just made your fathers acquaintance may i sit down a minute  gyp drew to one side on the bench and he sat down  what are you reading  a story called torrents of spring  ah the finest ever written where are you  gemma and sanin in the thunderstorm  wait you have madame polozov to come what a creation how old are you miss winton  twentytwo  you would be too young to appreciate that story if you were not you but you know muchby instinct what is your christian nameforgive me  ghita  ghita not soft enough  i am always called gyp  gypah gyp yes gyp  he repeated her name so impersonally that she could not be angry  i told your father i have had the pleasure of meeting you he was very polite  gyp said coldly  my father is always polite  like the ice in which they put champagne  gyp smiled she could not help it  and suddenly he said  i suppose they have told you that i am a mauvais sujet gyp inclined her head he looked at her steadily and said it is true but i could be bettermuch  she wanted to look at him but could not a queer sort of exultation had seized on her this man had power yet she had power over him if she wished she could make him her slave her dog chain him to her she had but to hold out her hand and he would go on his knees to kiss it she had but to say come and he would come from wherever he might be she had but to say be good and he would be good it was her first experience of power and it was intoxicating butbut gyp could never be selfconfident for long over her most victorious moments brooded the shadow of distrust as if he read her thought fiorsen said  tell me to do somethinganything i will do it miss winton  thengo back to london at once you are wasting yourself here you know you said so  he looked at her bewildered and upset and muttered  you have asked me the one thing i cant do missmiss gyp  pleasenot that its like a servant  i am your servant  is that why you wont do what i ask you  you are cruel  gyp laughed  he got up and said with sudden fierceness  i am not going away from you do not think it bending with the utmost swiftness he took her hand put his lips to it and turned on his heel  gyp uneasy and astonished stared at her hand still tingling from the pressure of his bristly moustache then she laughed againit was just foreign to have your hand kissedand went back to her book without taking in the words   was ever courtship more strange than that which followed it is said that the cat fascinates the bird it desires to eat here the bird fascinated the cat but the bird too was fascinated gyp never lost the sense of having the whiphand always felt like one giving alms or extending favour yet had a feeling of being unable to get away which seemed to come from the very strength of the spell she laid on him the magnetism with which she held him reacted on herself thoroughly sceptical at first she could not remain so he was too utterly morose and unhappy if she did not smile on him too alive and excited and grateful if she did the change in his eyes from their ordinary restless fierce and furtive expression to humble adoration or wistful hunger when they looked at her could never have been simulated and she had no lack of chance to see that metamorphosis wherever she went there he was if to a concert he would be a few paces from the door waiting for her entrance if to a confectioners for tea as likely as not he would come in every afternoon he walked where she must pass riding to the neroberg  except in the gardens of the kochbrunnen when he would come up humbly and ask to sit with her five minutes he never forced his company or tried in any way to compromise her experience no doubt served him there but he must have had an instinct that it was dangerous with one so sensitive there were other moths too round that bright candle and they served to keep his attentions from being too conspicuous did she comprehend what was going on understand how her defences were being sapped grasp the danger to retreat that lay in permitting him to hover round her not really it all served to swell the triumphant intoxication of days when she was ever more and more in love with living more and more conscious that the world appreciated and admired her that she had power to do what others couldnt  was not fiorsen with his great talent and his dubious reputation proof of that and he excited her whatever else one might be in his moody vivid company one would not be dull one morning he told her something of his life his father had been a small swedish landowner a very strong man and a very hard drinker his mother the daughter of a painter she had taught him the violin but died while he was still a boy when he was seventeen he had quarrelled with his father and had to play his violin for a living in the streets of stockholm a wellknown violinist hearing him one day took him in hand then his father had drunk himself to death and he had inherited the little estate he had sold it at oncefor follies as he put it crudely yes miss winton i have committed many follies but they are nothing to those i shall commit the day i do not see you any more and with that disturbing remark he got up and left her she had smiled at his words but within herself she felt excitement scepticism compassion and something she did not understand at all in those days she understood herself very little  but how far did winton understand how far see what was going on he was a stoic but that did not prevent jealousy from taking alarm and causing him twinges more acute than those he still felt in his left foot he was afraid of showing disquiet by any dramatic change or he would have carried her off a fortnight at least before his cure was over he knew too well the signs of passion that long loping wolfish fiddling fellow with the broad cheekbones and little sidewhiskers good god and greenish eyes whose looks at gyp he secretly marked down roused his complete distrust perhaps his inbred english contempt for foreigners and artists kept him from direct action he could not take it quite seriously gyp his fastidious perfect gyp succumbing even a little to a fellow like that never his jealous affection too could not admit that she would neglect to consult him in any doubt or difficulty he forgot the sensitive secrecy of girls forgot that his love for her had ever shunned words her love for him never indulged in confidences nor did he see more than a little of what there was to see and that little was doctored by fiorsen for his eyes shrewd though they were nor was there in all so very much except one episode the day before they left and of that he knew nothing  that last afternoon was very still a little mournful it had rained the night before and the soaked treetrunks the soaked fallen leaves gave off a faint liquoricelike perfume in gyp there was a feeling as if her spirit had been suddenly emptied of excitement and delight was it the day or the thought of leaving this place where she had so enjoyed herself after lunch when winton was settling his accounts she wandered out through the long park stretching up the valley the sky was broodinggrey the trees were still and melancholy it was all a little melancholy and she went on and on across the stream round into a muddy lane that led up through the outskirts of a village on to the higher ground whence she could return by the main road why must things come to an end for the first time in her life she thought of mildenham and hunting without enthusiasm she would rather stay in london there she would not be cut off from music from dancing from people and all the exhilaration of being appreciated on the air came the shrilly hollow droning of a thresher and the sound seemed exactly to express her feelings a pigeon flew over white against the leaden sky some birchtrees that had gone golden shivered and let fall a shower of drops it was lonely here and suddenly two little boys bolted out of the hedge nearly upsetting her and scurried down the road something had startled them gyp putting up her face to see felt on it soft pinpoints of rain her frock would be spoiled and it was one she was fond ofdovecoloured velvety not meant for weather she turned for refuge to the birchtrees it would be over directly perhaps muffled in distance the whining drone of that thresher still came travelling deepening her discomfort then in the hedge whence the boys had bolted down a man reared himself above the lane and came striding along toward her he jumped down the bank among the birchtrees and she saw it was fiorsenpanting dishevelled pale with heat he must have followed her and climbed straight up the hillside from the path she had come along in the bottom before crossing the stream his artistic dandyism had been harshly treated by that scramble she might have laughed but instead she felt excited a little scared by the look on his hot pale face he said breathlessly  i have caught you so you are going tomorrow and never told me you thought you would slip awaynot a word for me are you always so cruel well i will not spare you either  crouching suddenly he took hold of her broad ribbon sash and buried his face in it gyp stood tremblingthe action had not stirred her sense of the ridiculous he circled her knees with his arms  oh gyp i love youi love youdont send me awaylet me be with you i am your dogyour slave oh gyp i love you  his voice moved and terrified her men had said i love you several times during those last two years but never with that lostsoul ring of passion never with that look in the eyes at once fiercely hungry and so supplicating never with that restless eager timid touch of hands she could only murmur  please get up  but he went on  love me a little only a littlelove me oh gyp  the thought flashed through gyp to how many has he knelt i wonder his face had a kind of beauty in its abandonmentthe beauty that comes from yearningand she lost her frightened feeling he went on with his stammering murmur i am a prodigal i know but if you love me i will no longer be i will do great things for you oh gyp if you will some day marry me not now when i have proved oh gyp you are so sweetso wonderful  his arms crept up till he had buried his face against her waist without quite knowing what she did gyp touched his hair and said again  no please get up  he got up then and standing near with his hands hard clenched at his sides whispered  have mercy speak to me  she could not all was strange and mazed and quivering in her her spirit straining away drawn to him fantastically confused she could only look into his face with her troubled dark eyes and suddenly she was seized and crushed to him she shrank away pushing him back with all her strength he hung his head abashed suffering with eyes shut lips trembling and her heart felt again that quiver of compassion she murmured  i dont know i will tell you laterlaterin england  he bowed folding his arms as if to make her feel safe from him and when regardless of the rain she began to move on he walked beside her a yard or so away humbly as though he had never poured out those words or hurt her lips with the violence of his kiss  back in her room taking off her wet dress gyp tried to remember what he had said and what she had answered she had not promised anything but she had given him her address both in london and the country unless she resolutely thought of other things she still felt the restless touch of his hands the grip of his arms and saw his eyes as they were when he was kissing her and once more she felt frightened and excited  he was playing at the concert that eveningher last concert and surely he had never played like thatwith a despairing beauty a sort of frenzied rapture listening there came to her a feelinga feeling of fatalitythat whether she would or no she could not free herself from him   v   once back in england gyp lost that feeling or very nearly her scepticism told her that fiorsen would soon see someone else who seemed all he had said she was how ridiculous to suppose that he would stop his follies for her that she had any real power over him but deep down she did not quite believe this it would have wounded her belief in herself too mucha belief so subtle and intimate that she was not conscious of it belief in that something about her which had inspired the baroness to use the word fatality  winton who breathed again hurried her off to mildenham he had bought her a new horse they were in time for the last of the cubbing and for a week at least the passion for riding and the sight of hounds carried all before it then just as the real business of the season was beginning she began to feel dull and restless mildenham was dark the autumn winds made dreary noises her little brown spaniel very old who seemed only to have held on to life just for her return died she accused herself terribly for having left it so long when it was failing thinking of all the days lass had been watching for her to come homeas betty with that love of woeful recital so dear to simple hearts took good care to make plainshe felt as if she had been cruel for events such as these gyp was both too tenderhearted and too hard on herself she was quite ill for several days the moment she was better winton in dismay whisked her back to aunt rosamund in town he would lose her company but if it did her good took her out of herself he would be content running up for the weekend three days later he was relieved to find her decidedly perkedup and left her again with the easier heart  it was on the day after he went back to mildenham that she received a letter from fiorsen forwarded from bury street he wasit saidjust returning to london he had not forgotten any look she had ever given him or any word she had spoken he should not rest till he could see her again for a long time the letter ended before i first saw you i was like the deadlost all was bitter apples to me now i am a ship that comes from the whirlpools to a warm blue sea now i see again the evening star i kiss your hands and am your faithful slavegustav fiorsen these words which from any other man would have excited her derision renewed in gyp that fluttered feeling the pleasurable frightened sense that she could not get away from his pursuit  she wrote in answer to the address he gave her in london to say that she was staying for a few days in curzon street with her aunt who would be glad to see him if he cared to come in any afternoon between five and six and signed herself ghita winton she was long over that little note its curt formality gave her satisfaction was she really mistress of herselfand him able to dispose as she wished yes and surely the note showed it  it was never easy to tell gyps feelings from her face even winton was often baffled her preparation of aunt rosamund for the reception of fiorsen was a masterpiece of casualness when he duly came he too seemed doubly alive to the need for caution only gazing at gyp when he could not be seen doing so but going out he whispered not like thisnot like this i must see you alonei must she smiled and shook her head but bubbles had come back to the wine in her cup  that evening she said quietly to aunt rosamund  dad doesnt like mr fiorsencant appreciate his playing of course  and this most discreet remark caused aunt rosamund avidin a wellbred wayof music to omit mention of the intruder when writing to her brother the next two weeks he came almost every day always bringing his violin gyp playing his accompaniments and though his hungry stare sometimes made her feel hot she would have missed it  but when winton next came up to bury street she was in a quandary to confess that fiorsen was here having omitted to speak of him in her letters not to confess and leave him to find it out from aunt rosamund which was worse seized with panic she did neither but told her father she was dying for a gallop hailing that as the best of signs he took her forthwith back to mildenham and curious were her feelingslighthearted compunctious as of one who escapes yet knows she will soon be seeking to return the meet was rather far next day but she insisted on riding to it since old pettance the superannuated jockey charitably employed as extra stable help at mildenham was to bring on her second horse there was a good scentingwind with rain in the offing and outside the covert they had a corner to themselveswinton knowing a trick worth two of the fields atlarge they had slipped there luckily unseen for the knowing were given to following the onehanded horseman in faded pink who on his bangtailed black mare had a knack of getting so well away one of the whips a little dark fellow with smouldery eyes and suckedin weathered cheeks dashed out of covert rode past saluting and dashed in again a jay came out with a screech dived and doubled back a hare made off across the fallowthe lightbrown lopping creature was barely visible against the brownish soil pigeons very high up flew over and away to the next wood the shrilling voices of the whips rose from the covertdepths and just a whimper now and then from the hounds swiftly wheeling their noses among the fern and briers  gyp crisping her fingers on the reins drewin deep breaths it smelled so sweet and soft and fresh under that sky pied of blue and of white and lightgrey swiftmoving cloudsnot half the wind down here that there was up there just enough to be carrying off the beech and oak leaves loosened by frost two days before if only a fox would break this side and they could have the first fields to themselves it was so lovely to be alone with hounds one of these came trotting out a pretty young creature busy and unconcerned raising its tanandwhite head its mild reproachful deepbrown eyes at wintons looin trix what a darling a burst of music from the covert and the darling vanished among the briers  gyps new brown horse pricked its ears a young man in a grey cutaway buff cords and jackboots on a low chestnut mare came slipping round the covert ohdid that mean they were all coming impatiently she glanced at this intruder who raised his hat a little and smiled that smile faintly impudent was so infectious that gyp was melted to a slight response then she frowned he had spoiled their lovely loneliness who was he he looked unpardonably serene and happy sitting there she did not remember his face at all yet there was something familiar about it he had taken his hat offa broad face very well cut and cleanshaved with dark curly hair extraordinary clear eyes a bold cool merry look where had she seen somebody like him  a tiny sound from winton made her turn her head the foxstealing out beyond those further bushes breathless she fixed her eyes on her fathers face it was hard as steel watching not a sound not a quiver as if horse and man had turned to metal was he never going to give the viewhalloo then his lips writhed and out it came gyp cast a swift smile of gratitude at the young man for having had taste and sense to leave that to her father and again he smiled at her there were the first hounds streaming outone on the othermusic and feather why didnt dad go they would all be round this way in a minute  then the black mare slid past her and with a bound her horse followed the young man on the chestnut was away on the left only the huntsman and one whipbeside their three selves glorious the brown horse went too fast at that first fence and winton called back steady gyp steady him but she couldnt and it didnt matter grass three fields of grass oh what a lovely foxgoing so straight and each time the brown horse rose she thought perfect i can ride oh i am happy and she hoped her father and the young man were looking there was no feeling in the world like this with a leader like dad hounds moving free good going and the field distanced better than dancing betteryes better than listening to music if one could spend ones life galloping sailing over fences if it would never stop the new horse was a darling though he did pull  she crossed the next fence level with the young man whose low chestnut mare moved with a stealthy action his hat was crammed down now and his face very determined but his lips still had something of that smile gyp thought hes got a good seatvery strong only he looks like thrusting nobody rides like dadso beautifully quiet indeed wintons seat on a horse was perfection all done with such a minimum expenditure the hounds swung round in a curve now she was with them really with them what a pacecracking no fox could stand this long  and suddenly she caught sight of him barely a field ahead scurrying desperately brush down and the thought flashed through her oh dont lets catch you go on fox go on get away were they really all after that little hunted red thinga hundred great creatures horses and men and women and dogs and only that one little fox but then came another fence and quickly another and she lost feelings of shame and pity in the exultation of flying over them a minute later the fox went to earth within a few hundred yards of the leading hound and she was glad she had been in at deaths beforehorrid but it had been a lovely gallop and breathless smiling rapturously she wondered whether she could mop her face before the field came up without that young man noticing  she could see him talking to her father and taking out a wisp of a handkerchief that smelled of cyclamen she had a good scrub round when she rode up the young man raised his hat and looking full at her said you did go his voice rather highpitched had in it a spice of pleasant laziness gyp made him an ironical little bow and murmured my new horse you mean he broke again into that irrepressible smile but all the same she knew that he admired her and she kept thinking where have i seen someone like him  they had two more runs but nothing like that first gallop nor did she again see the young man whose nameit seemedwas summerhay son of a certain lady summerhay at widrington ten miles from mildenham  all that long silent jog home with winton in fading daylight she felt very happysaturated with air and elation the trees and fields the haystacks gates and ponds beside the lanes grew dim lights came up in the cottage windows the air smelled sweet of wood smoke and for the first time all day she thought of fiorsen thought of him almost longingly if he could be there in the cosy old drawingroom to play to her while she lay backdrowsing dreaming by the fire in the scent of burning cedar logsthe mozart minuet or that little heartcatching tune of poise played the first time she heard him or a dozen other of the things he played unaccompanied that would be the most lovely ending to this lovely day just the glow and warmth wanting to make all perfectthe glow and warmth of music and adoration  and touching the mare with her heel she sighed to indulge fancies about music and fiorsen was safe here far away from him she even thought she would not mind if he were to behave again as he had under the birchtrees in the rain at wiesbaden it was so good to be adored her old mare ridden now six years began the series of contented snuffles that signified she smelt home here was the last turn and the loom of the short beechtree avenue to the housethe old manorhouse comfortable roomy rather dark with wide shallow stairs ah she was tired and it was drizzling now she would be nicely stiff tomorrow in the light coming from the open door she saw markey standing and while fishing from her pocket the usual lumps of sugar heard him say mr fiorsen sirgentleman from wiesbadento see you  her heart thumped what did this mean why had he come how had he dared how could he have been so treacherous to her ah but he was ignorant of course that she had not told her father a veritable judgment on her she ran straight in and up the stairs the voice of betty your baths ready miss gyp roused her and crying oh betty darling bring me up my tea she ran into the bathroom she was safe there and in the delicious heat of the bath faced the situation better  there could be only one meaning he had come to ask for her and suddenly she took comfort better so there would be no more secrecy from dad and he would stand between her and fiorsen ifif she decided not to marry him the thought staggered her had she without knowing it got so far as this yes and further it was all no good fiorsen would never accept refusal even if she gave it but did she want to refuse  she loved hot baths but had never stayed in one so long life was so easy there and so difficult outside bettys knock forced her to get out at last and let her in with tea and the message would miss gyp please to go down when she was ready   vi   winton was staggered with a glance at gyps vanishing figure he said curtly to markey where have you put this gentleman but the use of the word this was the only trace he showed of his emotions in that little journey across the hall he entertained many extravagant thoughts arrived at the study he inclined his head courteously enough waiting for fiorsen to speak the fiddler still in his furlined coat was twisting a squash hat in his hands in his own peculiar style he was impressive but why couldnt he look you in the face or if he did why did he seem about to eat you  you knew i was returned to london major winton  then gyp had been seeing the fellow without letting him know the thought was chill and bitter to winton he must not give her away however and he simply bowed he felt that his visitor was afraid of his frigid courtesy and he did not mean to help him over that fear he could not of course realize that this ascendancy would not prevent fiorsen from laughing at him behind his back and acting as if he did not exist no real contest in fact was possible between men moving on such different planes neither having the slightest respect for the others standards or beliefs  fiorsen who had begun to pace the room stopped and said with agitation  major winton your daughter is the most beautiful thing on earth i love her desperately i am a man with a future though you may not think it i have what future i like in my art if only i can marry her i have a little money toonot much but in my violin there is all the fortune she can want  wintons face expressed nothing but cold contempt that this fellow should take him for one who would consider money in connection with his daughter simply affronted him  fiorsen went on  you do not like methat is clear i saw it the first moment you are an english gentlemanhe pronounced the words with a sort of ironyi am nothing to you yet in my world i am something i am not an adventurer will you permit me to beg your daughter to be my wife he raised his hands that still held the hat involuntarily they had assumed the attitude of prayer  for a second winton realized that he was suffering that weakness went in a flash and he said frigidly  i am obliged to you sir for coming to me first you are in my house and i dont want to be discourteous but i should be glad if you would be good enough to withdraw and take it that i shall certainly oppose your wish as best i can  the almost childish disappointment and trouble in fiorsens face changed quickly to an expression fierce furtive mocking and then shifted to despair  major winton you have loved you must have loved her mother i suffer  winton who had turned abruptly to the fire faced round again  i dont control my daughters affections sir she will do as she wishes i merely say it will be against my hopes and judgment if she marries you i imagine youve not altogether waited for my leave i was not blind to the way you hung about her at wiesbaden mr fiorsen  fiorsen answered with a twisted miserable smile  poor wretches do what they can may i see her let me just see her  was it any good to refuse she had been seeing the fellow already without his knowledge keeping from himhimall her feelings whatever they were and he said  ill send for her in the meantime perhaps youll have some refreshment  fiorsen shook his head and there followed half an hour of acute discomfort winton in his mudstained clothes before the fire supported it better than his visitor that child of nature after endeavouring to emulate his hosts quietude renounced all such efforts with an expressive gesture fidgeted here fidgeted there tramped the room went to the window drew aside the curtains and stared out into the dark came back as if resolved again to confront winton then baffled by that figure so motionless before the fire flung himself down in an armchair and turned his face to the wall winton was not cruel by nature but he enjoyed the writhings of this fellow who was endangering gyps happiness endangering surely not possible that she would accept him yet if not why had she not told him and he too suffered  then she came he had expected her to be pale and nervous but gyp never admitted being naughty till she had been forgiven her smiling face had in it a kind of warning closeness she went up to fiorsen and holding out her hand said calmly  how nice of you to come  winton had the bitter feeling that hehewas the outsider well he would speak plainly there had been too much underhand doing  mr fiorsen has done us the honour to wish to marry you ive told him that you decide such things for yourself if you accept him it will be against my wish naturally  while he was speaking the glow in her cheeks deepened she looked neither at him nor at fiorsen winton noted the rise and fall of the lace on her breast she was smiling and gave the tiniest shrug of her shoulders and suddenly smitten to the heart he walked stiffly to the door it was evident that she had no use for his guidance if her love for him was not worth to her more than this fellow but there his resentment stopped he knew that he could not afford wounded feelings could not get on without her married to the greatest rascal on earth he would still be standing by her wanting her companionship and love she represented too much in the present andthe past with sore heart indeed he went down to dinner  fiorsen was gone when he came down again what the fellow had said or she had answered he would not for the world have asked gulfs between the proud are not lightly bridged and when she came up to say goodnight both their faces were as though coated with wax  in the days that followed she gave no sign uttered no word in any way suggesting that she meant to go against his wishes fiorsen might not have existed for any mention made of him but winton knew well that she was moping and cherishing some feeling against himself and this he could not bear so one evening after dinner he said quietly  tell me frankly gyp do you care for that chap  she answered as quietly  in a wayyes  is that enough  i dont know dad  her lips had quivered and wintons heart softened as it always did when he saw her moved he put his hand out covered one of hers and said  i shall never stand in the way of your happiness gyp but it must be happiness can it possibly be that i dont think so you know what they said of him out there  yes  he had not thought she knew and his heart sank  thats pretty bad you know and is he of our world at all  gyp looked up  do you think i belong to our world dad  winton turned away she followed slipping her hand under his arm  i didnt mean to hurt but its true isnt it i dont belong among society people they wouldnt have me you knowif they knew about what you told me ever since that ive felt i dont belong to them im nearer him music means more to me than anything  winton gave her hand a convulsive grip a sense of coming defeat and bereavement was on him  if your happiness went wrong gyp i should be most awfully cut up  but why shouldnt i be happy dad  if you were i could put up with anyone but i tell you i cant believe you would be i beg you my dearfor gods sake make sure ill put a bullet into the man who treats you badly  gyp laughed then kissed him but they were silent at bedtime he said  well go up to town tomorrow  whether from a feeling of the inevitable or from the forlorn hope that seeing more of the fellow might be the only chance of curing herhe put no more obstacles in the way  and the queer courtship began again by christmas she had consented still under the impression that she was the mistress not the slavethe cat not the bird once or twice when fiorsen let passion out of hand and his overbold caresses affronted her she recoiled almost with dread from what she was going toward but in general she lived elated intoxicated by music and his adoration withal remorseful that she was making her father sad she was but little at mildenham and he in his unhappiness was there nearly all the time riding extra hard and leaving gyp with his sister aunt rosamund though under the spell of fiorsens music had agreed with her brother that fiorsen was impossible but nothing she said made any effect on gyp it was new and startling to discover in this soft sensitive girl such a vein of stubbornness opposition seemed to harden her resolution and the good ladys natural optimism began to persuade her that gyp would make a silk purse out of that sows ear yet after all the man was a celebrity in his way  it was settled for february a house with a garden was taken in st johns wood the last month went as all such last months go in those intoxicating pastimes the buying of furniture and clothes if it were not for that who knows how many engagement knots would slip   and today they had been married to the last winton had hardly believed it would come to that he had shaken the hand of her husband and kept pain and disappointment out of his face knowing well that he deceived no one thank heaven there had been no church no weddingcake invitations congratulations fallals of any kindhe could never have stood them not even rosamundwho had influenzato put up with  lying back in the recesses of that old chair he stared into the fire  they would be just about at torquay by nowjust about music who would have thought noises made out of string and wood could have stolen her away from him yes they would be at torquay by now at their hotel and the first prayer winton had uttered for years escaped his lips  let her be happy let her be happy  then hearing markey open the door he closed his eyes and feigned sleep     part ii   i   when a girl first sits opposite the man she has married of what does she think not of the issues and emotions that lie in wait they are too overwhelming she would avoid them while she can gyp thought of her frock a mushroomcoloured velvet cord not many girls of her class are married without fallals as winton had called them not many girls sit in the corner of their reserved firstclass compartments without the excitement of having been supreme centre of the world for some flattering hours to buoy them up on that train journey with no memories of friends behaviour speech appearance to chat of with her husband so as to keep thought away for gyp her dress first worn that day bettys breakdown the faces blank as hats of the registrar and clerk were about all she had to distract her she stole a look at her husband clothed in blue serge just opposite her husband mrs gustav fiorsen no people might call her that to herself she was ghita winton ghita fiorsen would never seem right and not confessing that she was afraid to meet his eyes but afraid all the same she looked out of the window a dull bleak dismal day no warmth no sun no music in itthe thames as grey as lead the willows on its banks forlorn  suddenly she felt his hand on hers she had not seen his face like that beforeyes once or twice when he was playinga spirit shining though she felt suddenly secure if it stayed like that thenhis hand rested on her knee his face changed just a little the spirit seemed to waver to be fading his lips grew fuller he crossed over and sat beside her instantly she began to talk about their house where they were going to put certain thingspresents and all that he too talked of the house but every now and then he glanced at the corridor and muttered it was pleasant to feel that the thought of her possessed him through and through but she was tremulously glad of that corridor life is mercifully made up of little things and gyp was always able to live in the moment in the hours they had spent together up to now he had been like a starved man snatching hasty meals now that he had her to himself for good he was another creature altogetherlike a boy out of school and kept her laughing nearly all the time  presently he got down his practise violin and putting on the mute played looking at her over his shoulder with a droll smile she felt happy much warmer at heart now and when his face was turned away she looked at him he was so much better looking now than when he had those little whiskers one day she had touched one of them and said ah if only these wings could fly next morning they had flown his face was not one to be easily got used to she was not used to it yet any more than she was used to his touch when it grew dark and he wanted to draw down the blinds she caught him by the sleeve and said  no no theyll know were honeymooners  well my gyp and are we not  but he obeyed only as the hours went on his eyes seemed never to let her alone  at torquay the sky was clear and starry the wind brought whiffs of seascent into their cab lights winked far out on a headland and in the little harbour all bluish dark many little boats floated like tame birds he had put his arm round her and she could feel his hand resting on her heart she was grateful that he kept so still when the cab stopped and they entered the hall of the hotel she whispered  dont lets let them see  still mercifully little things inspecting the three rooms getting the luggage divided between dressingroom and bedroom unpacking wondering which dress to put on for dinner stopping to look out over the dark rocks and the sea where the moon was coming up wondering if she dared lock the door while she was dressing deciding that it would be silly dressing so quickly fluttering when she found him suddenly there close behind her beginning to do up her hooks those fingers were too skilful it was the first time she had thought of his past with a sort of hurt pride and fastidiousness when he had finished he twisted her round held her away looked at her from head to foot and said below his breath  mine  her heart beat fast then but suddenly he laughed slipped his arm about her and danced her twice round the room he let her go demurely down the stairs in front of him saying  they shant seemy gyp oh they shant see we are old married people tired of each othervery  at dinner it amused him at firsther too a littleto keep up this farce of indifference but every now and then he turned and stared at some inoffensive visitor who was taking interest in them with such fierce and genuine contempt that gyp took alarm whereon he laughed when she had drunk a little wine and he had drunk a good deal the farce of indifference came to its end he talked at a great rate now slying nicknaming the waiters and mimicking the people aroundhappy thrusts that made her smile but shiver a little lest they should be heard or seen their heads were close together across the little table they went out into the lounge coffee came and he wanted her to smoke with him she had never smoked in a public room but it seemed stiff and missish to refuseshe must do now as his world did and it was another little thing she wanted little things all the time wanted them she drew back a windowcurtain and they stood there side by side the sea was deep blue beneath bright stars and the moon shone through a ragged pinetree on a little headland though she stood five feet six in her shoes she was only up to his mouth he sighed and said beautiful night my gyp and suddenly it struck her that she knew nothing of what was in him and yet he was her husband husbandfunny word not pretty she felt as a child opening the door of a dark room and clutching his arm said  look theres a sailingboat whats it doing out there at night another little thing any little thing  presently he said  come upstairs ill play to you  up in their sittingroom was a piano butnot possible tomorrow they would have to get another tomorrow the fire was hot and he took off his coat to play in one of his shirtsleeves there was a rent she thought with a sort of triumph i shall mend that it was something definite actuala little thing there were lilies in the room that gave a strong sweet scent he brought them up to her to sniff and while she was sniffing stooped suddenly and kissed her neck she shut her eyes with a shiver he took the flowers away at once and when she opened her eyes again his violin was at his shoulder for a whole hour he played and gyp in her creamcoloured frock lay back listening she was tired not sleepy it would have been nice to have been sleepy her mouth had its little sad tuck or dimple at the corner her eyes were deep and darka cloudy child his gaze never left her face he played and played and his own fitful face grew clouded at last he put away the violin and said  go to bed gyp youre tired  obediently she got up and went into the bedroom with a sick feeling in her heart and as near the fire as she could get she undressed with desperate haste and got to bed an ageit seemedshe lay there shivering in her flimsy lawn against the cold sheets her eyes not quite closed watching the flicker of the firelight she did not thinkcould notjust lay stiller than the dead the door creaked she shut her eyes had she a heart at all it did not seem to beat she lay thus with eyes shut till she could bear it no longer by the firelight she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed could just see his facelike a facea facewhere seen ah yesa pictureof a wild man crouching at the feet of iphigeniaso humble so hungryso lost in gazing she gave a little smothered sob and held out her hand   ii   gyp was too proud to give by halves and in those early days she gave fiorsen everything excepther heart she earnestly desired to give that too but hearts only give themselves perhaps if the wild man in him maddened by beauty in its power had not so ousted the spirit man her heart might have gone with her lips and the rest of her he knew he was not getting her heart and it made him in the wildness of his nature and the perversity of a man go just the wrong way to work trying to conquer her by the senses not the soul  yet she was not unhappyit cannot be said she was unhappy except for a sort of lost feeling sometimes as if she were trying to grasp something that kept slipping slipping away she was glad to give him pleasure she felt no repulsionthis was mans nature only there was always that feeling that she was not close when he was playing with the spiritlook on his face she would feel now now surely i shall get close to him but the look would go how to keep it there she did not know and when it went her feeling went too  their little suite of rooms was at the very end of the hotel so that he might play as much as he wished while he practised in the mornings she would go into the garden which sloped in rockterraces down to the sea wrapped in fur she would sit there with a book she soon knew each evergreen or flower that was coming outaubretia and laurustinus a little white flower whose name was uncertain and one starperiwinkle the air was often soft the birds sang already and were busy with their weddings and twice at least spring came in her heartthat wonderful feeling when first the whole being scents new life preparing in the earth and the windthe feeling that only comes when spring is not yet and one aches and rejoices all at once seagulls often came over her craning down their greedy bills and uttering cries like a kittens mewing  out here she had feelings that she did not get with him of being at one with everything she did not realize how tremendously she had grown up in these few days how the ground bass had already come into the light music of her life living with fiorsen was opening her eyes to much beside mere knowledge of mans nature with her perhaps fatal receptivity she was already soaking up the atmosphere of his philosophy he was always in revolt against accepting things because he was expected to but like most executant artists he was no reasoner just a mere instinctive kicker against the pricks he would lose himself in delight with a sunset a scent a tune a new caress in a rush of pity for a beggar or a blind man a rush of aversion from a man with large feet or a long nose of hatred for a woman with a flat chest or an expression of sanctimony he would swing along when he was walking or dawdle dawdle he would sing and laugh and make her laugh too till she ached and half an hour later would sit staring into some pit of darkness in a sort of powerful brooding of his whole being insensibly she shared in this deep drinking of sensation but always gracefully fastidiously never losing sense of other peoples feelings  in his loveraptures he just avoided setting her nerves on edge because he never failed to make her feel his enjoyment of her beauty that perpetual consciousness too of not belonging to the proper and respectable which she had tried to explain to her father made her set her teeth against feeling shocked but in other ways he did shock her she could not get used to his utter oblivion of peoples feelings to the ferocious contempt with which he would look at those who got on his nerves and make halfaudible comments just as he had commented on her own father when he and count rosek passed them by the schiller statue she would visibly shrink at those remarks though they were sometimes so excruciatingly funny that she had to laugh and feel dreadful immediately after she saw that he resented her shrinking it seemed to excite him to run amuck the more but she could not help it once she got up and walked away he followed her sat on the floor beside her knees and thrust his head like a great cat under her hand  forgive me my gyp but they are such brutes who could help it now tell mewho could except my gyp and she had to forgive him but one evening when he had been really outrageous during dinner she answered  no i cant its you that are the brute you were a brute to them  he leaped up with a face of furious gloom and went out of the room it was the first time he had given way to anger with her gyp sat by the fire very disturbed chiefly because she was not really upset at having hurt him surely she ought to be feeling miserable at that  but when at ten oclock he had not come back she began to flutter in earnest she had said a dreadful thing and yet in her heart she did not take back her judgment he really had been a brute she would have liked to soothe herself by playing but it was too late to disturb people and going to the window she looked out over the sea feeling beaten and confused this was the first time she had given free rein to her feeling against what winton would have called his bounderism if he had been english she would never have been attracted by one who could trample so on other peoples feelings what then had attracted her his strangeness wildness the mesmeric pull of his passion for her his music nothing could spoil that in him the sweep the surge and sigh in his playing was like the sea out there dark and surfedged beating on the rocks or the sea deepcoloured in daylight with white gulls over it or the sea with those sinuous paths made by the wandering currents the subtle smiling silent sea holding in suspense its unfathomable restlessness waiting to surge and spring again that was what she wanted from himnot his embraces not even his adoration his wit or his queer lithe comeliness touched with felinity no only that in his soul which escaped through his fingers into the air and dragged at her soul if when he came in she were to run to him throw her arms round his neck make herself feel close lose herself in him why not it was her duty why not her delight too but she shivered some instinct too deep for analysis something in the very heart of her nerves made her recoil as if she were afraid literally scared of letting herself go of lovingthe subtlest instinct of selfpreservation against something fatal against being led on beyondyes it was like that curious instinctive sinking which some feel at the mere sight of a precipice a dread of going near lest they should be drawn on and over by resistless attraction  she passed into their bedroom and began slowly to undress to go to bed without knowing where he was what doing thinking seemed already a little odd and she sat brushing her hair slowly with the silverbacked brushes staring at her own pale face whose eyes looked so very large and dark at last there came to her the feeling i cant help it i dont care and getting into bed she turned out the light it seemed queer and lonely there was no fire and then without more ado she slept  she had a dream of being between fiorsen and her father in a railwaycarriage out at sea with the water rising higher and higher swishing and sighing awakening always like a dog to perfect presence of mind she knew that he was playing in the sittingroom playingat what time of night she lay listening to a quivering gibbering tune that she did not know should she be first to make it up or should she wait for him twice she half slipped out of bed but both times as if fate meant her not to move he chose that moment to swell out the sound and each time she thought no i cant its just the same now he doesnt care how many people he wakes up he does just what he likes and cares nothing for anyone and covering her ears with her hands she continued to lie motionless  when she withdrew her hands at last he had stopped then she heard him coming and feigned sleep but he did not spare even sleep she submitted to his kisses without a word her heart hardening within hersurely he smelled of brandy next morning he seemed to have forgotten it all but gyp had not she wanted badly to know what he had felt where he had gone but was too proud to ask  she wrote twice to her father in the first week but afterwards except for a postcard now and then she never could why tell him what she was doing in company of one whom he could not bear to think of had he been right to confess that would hurt her pride too much but she began to long for london the thought of her little house was a green spot to dwell on when they were settled in and could do what they liked without anxiety about peoples feelings it would be all right perhaps when he could start again really working and she helping him all would be different her new house and so much to do her new garden and fruittrees coming into blossom she would have dogs and cats would ride when dad was in town aunt rosamund would come friends evenings of music dances still perhapshe danced beautifully and loved it as she did and his concertsthe elation of being identified with his success but above all the excitement of making her home as dainty as she could with daring experiments in form and colour and yet at heart she knew that to be already looking forward banning the present was a bad sign  one thing at all events she enjoyedsailing they had blue days when even the march sun was warm and there was just breeze enough he got on excellently well with the old salt whose boat they used for he was at his best with simple folk whose lingo he could understand about as much as they could understand his  in those hours gyp had some real sensations of romance the sea was so blue the rocks and wooded spurs of that southern coast so dreamy in the bright landhaze oblivious of the old salt he would put his arm round her out there she could swallow down her sense of form and be grateful for feeling nearer to him in spirit she made loyal efforts to understand him in these weeks that were bringing a certain disillusionment the elemental part of marriage was not the trouble if she did not herself feel passion she did not resent his when after one of those embraces his mouth curled with a little bitter smile as if to say yes much you care for me she would feel compunctious and yet aggrieved but the trouble lay deeperthe sense of an insuperable barrier and always that deep instinctive recoil from letting herself go she could not let herself be known and she could not know him why did his eyes often fix her with a stare that did not seem to see her what made him in the midst of serious playing break into some furious or desolate little tune or drop his violin what gave him those long hours of dejection following the maddest gaiety above all what dreams had he in those rare moments when music transformed his strange pale face or was it a mere physical illusionhad he any dreams the heart of another is a dark forestto all but the one who loves  one morning he held up a letter  ah ha paul rosek went to see our house a pretty doves nest he calls it  the memory of the poles sphinxlike sweetish face and eyes that seemed to know so many secrets always affected gyp unpleasantly she said quietly  why do you like him gustav  like him oh he is useful a good judge of music andmany things  i think he is hateful  fiorsen laughed  hateful why hateful my gyp he is a good friend and he admires youoh he admires you very much he has success with women he always says jai une technique merveilleuse pour seduire une femme  gyp laughed  ugh hes like a toad i think  ah i shall tell him that he will be flattered  if you do if you give me awayi  he jumped up and caught her in his arms his face was so comically compunctious that she calmed down at once she thought over her words afterwards and regretted them all the same rosek was a sneak and a cold sensualist she was sure and the thought that he had been spying at their little house tarnished her anticipations of homecoming  they went to town three days later while the taxi was skirting lords cricketground gyp slipped her hand into fiorsens she was brimful of excitement the trees were budding in the gardens that they passed the almondblossom comingyes really coming they were in the road now five seven ninethirteen two more there it was nineteen in white figures on the leafgreen railings under the small green lilac buds yes and their almondblossom was out too she could just catch a glimpse over those tall railings of the low white house with its green outside shutters she jumped out almost into the arms of betty who stood smiling all over her broad flushed face while from under each arm peered forth the head of a black devil with pricked ears and eyes as bright as diamonds  betty what darlings  major wintons present my dearmaam  giving the stout shoulders a hug gyp seized the black devils and ran up the path under the trellis while the scotchterrier pups squeezed against her breast made confused small noises and licked her nose and ears through the square hall she ran into the drawingroom which opened out on to the lawn and there in the french window stood spying back at the spickandspan room where everything was of course placed just wrong the colouring white ebony and satinwood looked nicer even than she had hoped out in the gardenher own gardenthe peartrees were thickening but not in blossom yet a few daffodils were in bloom along the walls and a magnolia had one bud opened and all the time she kept squeezing the puppies to her enjoying their young warm fluffy savour and letting them kiss her she ran out of the drawingroom up the stairs her bedroom the dressingroom the spare room the bathroomshe dashed into them all oh it was nice to be in your own place to besuddenly she felt herself lifted off the ground from behind and in that undignified position her eyes flying she turned her face till he could reach her lips   iii  to wake and hear the birds at early practise and feel that winter is overis there any pleasanter moment  that first morning in her new house gyp woke with the sparrow or whatever the bird which utters the first cheeps and twitters soon eclipsed by so much that is more important in birdsong it seemed as if all the feathered creatures in london must be assembled in her garden and the old verse came into her head        all dear natures children sweet       lie at bride and bridegrooms feet       blessing their sense       not a creature of the air       bird melodious or bird fair       be absent hence   she turned and looked at her husband he lay with his head snoozled down into the pillow so that she could only see his thick rumpled hair and a shiver went through her exactly as if a strange man were lying there did he really belong to her and she to himfor good and was this their housetogether it all seemed somehow different more serious and troubling in this strange bed of this strange room that was to be so permanent careful not to wake him she slipped out and stood between the curtains and the window light was all in confusion yet away low down behind the trees the rose of dawn still clung one might almost have been in the country but for the faint rumorous noises of the town beginning to wake and that film of groundmist which veils the feet of london mornings she thought i am mistress in this house have to direct it allsee to everything and my pups oh what do they eat  that was the first of many hours of anxiety for she was very conscientious her fastidiousness desired perfection but her sensitiveness refused to demand it of othersespecially servants why should she harry them  fiorsen had not the faintest notion of regularity she found that he could not even begin to appreciate her struggles in housekeeping and she was much too proud to ask his help or perhaps too wise since he was obviously unfit to give it to live like the birds of the air was his motto gyp would have liked nothing better but for that one must not have a house with three servants several meals two puppydogs and no great experience of how to deal with any of them  she spoke of her difficulties to no one and suffered the more with bettywho boneconservative admitted fiorsen as hardly as she had once admitted wintonshe had to be very careful but her great trouble was with her father though she longed to see him she literally dreaded their meeting he first cameas he had been wont to come when she was a tiny girlat the hour when he thought the fellow to whom she now belonged would most likely be out her heart beat when she saw him under the trellis she opened the door herself and hung about him so that his shrewd eyes should not see her face and she began at once to talk of the puppies whom she had named don and doff they were perfect darlings nothing was safe from them her slippers were completely done for they had already got into her chinacabinet and gone to sleep there he must come and see all over  hooking her arm into his and talking all the time she took him upstairs and down and out into the garden to the studio or musicroom at the end which had an entrance to itself on to a back lane this room had been the great attraction fiorsen could practice there in peace winton went along with her very quietly making a shrewd comment now and then at the far end of the garden looking over the wall down into that narrow passage which lay between it and the back of another garden he squeezed her arm suddenly and said  well gyp what sort of a time  the question had come at last  oh rather lovelyin some ways but she did not look at him nor he at her see dad the cats have made quite a path there  winton bit his lips and turned from the wall the thought of that fellow was bitter within him she meant to tell him nothing meant to keep up that lighthearted lookwhich didnt deceive him a bit  look at my crocuses its really spring today  it was even a bee or two had come the tiny leaves had a transparent look too thin as yet to keep the sunlight from passing through them the purple delicateveined crocuses with little flames of orange blowing from their centres seemed to hold the light as in cups a wind without harshness swung the boughs a dry leaf or two still rustled round here and there and on the grass and in the blue sky and on the almondblossom was the first spring brilliance gyp clasped her hands behind her head  lovelyto feel the spring  and winton thought shes changed she had softened quickenedmore depth of colour in her more gravity more sway in her body more sweetness in her smile butwas she happy  a voice said  ah what a pleasure  the fellow had slunk up like the great cat he was and it seemed to winton that gyp had winced  dad thinks we ought to have dark curtains in the musicroom gustav  fiorsen made a bow  yes yeslike a london club  winton watching was sure of supplication in her face and forcing a smile he said  you seem very snug here glad to see you again gyp looks splendid  another of those bows he so detested mountebank never never would he be able to stand the fellow but he must not would not show it and as soon as he decently could he went taking his lonely way back through this region of which his knowledge was almost limited to lords cricketground with a sense of doubt and desolation an irritation more than ever mixed with the resolve to be always at hand if the child wanted him  he had not been gone ten minutes before aunt rosamund appeared with a crutchhandled stick and a gentlemanly limp for she too indulged her ancestors in gout a desire for exclusive possession of their friends is natural to some people and the good lady had not known how fond she was of her niece till the girl had slipped off into this marriage she wanted her back to go about with and make much of as before and her wellbred drawl did not quite disguise this feeling  gyp could detect fiorsen subtly mimicking that drawl and her ears began to burn the puppies afforded a diversiontheir points noses boldness and food held the danger in abeyance for some minutes then the mimicry began again when aunt rosamund had taken a somewhat sudden leave gyp stood at the window of her drawingroom with the mask off her face fiorsen came up put his arm round her from behind and said with a fierce sigh  are they coming oftenthese excellent people  gyp drew back from him against the wall  if you love me why do you try to hurt the people who love me too  because i am jealous i am jealous even of those puppies  and shall you try to hurt them  if i see them too much near you perhaps i shall  do you think i can be happy if you hurt things because they love me  he sat down and drew her on to his knee she did not resist but made not the faintest return to his caresses the first timethe very first friend to come into her own new home it was too much  fiorsen said hoarsely  you do not love me if you loved me i should feel it through your lips i should see it in your eyes oh love me gyp you shall  but to say to love stand and deliver was not the way to touch gyp it seemed to her mere illbred stupidity she froze against him in soul all the more that she yielded her body when a woman refuses nothing to one whom she does not really love shadows are already falling on the bridehouse and fiorsen knew it but his selfcontrol about equalled that of the two puppies  yet on the whole these first weeks in her new home were happy too busy to allow much room for doubting or regret several important concerts were fixed for may she looked forward to these with intense eagerness and pushed everything that interfered with preparation into the background as though to make up for that instinctive recoil from giving her heart of which she was always subconscious she gave him all her activities without calculation or reserve she was ready to play for him all day and every day just as from the first she had held herself at the disposal of his passion to fail him in these ways would have tarnished her opinion of herself but she had some free hours in the morning for he had the habit of lying in bed till eleven and was never ready for practise before twelve in those early hours she got through her orders and her shoppingthat pursuit which to so many women is the only real sporta chase of the ideal a pitting of ones taste and knowledge against that of the world at large a secret passion even in the beautiful for making oneself and ones house more beautiful gyp never went shopping without that faint thrill running up and down her nerves she hated to be touched by strange fingers but not even that stopped her pleasure in turning and turning before long mirrors while the saleswoman or man with admiration at first crocodilic and then genuine ran the tips of fingers over those curves smoothing and pinning and uttering the word moddam  on other mornings she would ride with winton who would come for her leaving her again at her door after their outings one day after a ride in richmond park where the horsechestnuts were just coming into flower they had late breakfast on the veranda of a hotel before starting for home some fruittrees were still in blossom just below them and the sunlight showering down from a blue sky brightened to silver the windings of the river and to gold the budding leaves of the oaktrees winton smoking his afterbreakfast cigar stared down across the tops of those trees toward the river and the wooded fields beyond stealing a glance at him gyp said very softly  did you ever ride with my mother dad  only oncethe very ride weve been today she was on a black mare i had a chestnut yes in that grove on the little hill which they had ridden through that morning he had dismounted and stood beside her  gyp stretched her hand across the table and laid it on his  tell me about her dear was she beautiful  yes  dark tall  very like you gyp a littlea littlehe did not know how to describe that differencea little more foreignlooking perhaps one of her grandmothers was italian you know  how did you come to love her suddenly  as suddenly ashe drew his hand away and laid it on the veranda railas that sun came on my hand  gyp said quietly as if to herself  yes i dont think i understand thatyet  winton drew breath through his teeth with a subdued hiss  did she love you at first sight too  he blew out a long puff of smoke  one easily believes what one wants tobut i think she did she used to say so  and how long  only a year  gyp said very softly  poor darling dad and suddenly she added i cant bear to think i killed heri cant bear it  winton got up in the discomfort of these sudden confidences a blackbird startled by the movement ceased his song gyp said in a hard voice  no i dont want to have any children  without that i shouldnt have had you gyp  no but i dont want to have them and i donti dont want to love like that i should be afraid  winton looked at her for a long time without speaking his brows drawn down frowning puzzled as though over his own past  love he said it catches you and youre gone when it comes you welcome it whether its to kill you or not shall we start back my child  when she got home it was not quite noon she hurried over her bath and dressing and ran out to the musicroom its walls had been hung with willesden scrim gilded over the curtains were silvergrey there was a divan covered with silverandgold stuff and a beaten brass fireplace it was a study in silver and gold save for two touches of fantasya screen round the pianohead covered with brilliantly painted peacocks tails and a blue persian vase in which were flowers of various hues of red  fiorsen was standing at the window in a fume of cigarette smoke he did not turn round gyp put her hand within his arm and said  so sorry dear but its only just halfpast twelve  his face was as if the whole world had injured him  pity you came back very nice riding im sure  could she not go riding with her own father what insensate jealousy and egomania she turned away without a word and sat down at the piano she was not good at standing injusticenot good at all the scent of brandy too was mixed with the fumes of his cigarette drink in the morning was so uglyreally horrid she sat at the piano waiting he would be like this till he had played away the fumes of his ill mood and then he would come and paw her shoulders and put his lips to her neck yes but it was not the way to behave not the way to make her love him and she said suddenly  gustav what exactly have i done that you dislike  you have had a father  gyp sat quite still for a few seconds and then began to laugh he looked so like a sulky child standing there he turned swiftly on her and put his hand over her mouth she looked up over that hand which smelled of tobacco her heart was doing the grand ecart within her this way in compunction that way in resentment his eyes fell before hers he dropped his hand  well shall we begin she said  he answered roughly no and went out into the garden  gyp was left dismayed disgusted was it possible that she could have taken part in such a horrid little scene she remained sitting at the piano playing over and over a single passage without heeding what it was   iv   so far they had seen nothing of rosek at the little house she wondered if fiorsen had passed on to him her remark though if he had he would surely say he hadnt she had learned that her husband spoke the truth when convenient not when it caused him pain about music or any art however he could be implicitly relied on and his frankness was appalling when his nerves were ruffled  but at the first concert she saw roseks unwelcome figure on the other side of the gangway two rows back he was talking to a young girl whose face short and beautifully formed had the opaque transparency of alabaster with her round blue eyes fixed on him and her lips just parted she had a slightly vacant look her laugh too was just a little vacant and yet her features were so beautiful her hair so smooth and fair her colouring so pale and fine her neck so white and round the poise of her body so perfect that gyp found it difficult to take her glance away she had refused her aunts companionship it might irritate fiorsen and affect his playing to see her with that stiff english creature she wanted too to feel again the sensations of wiesbaden there would be a kind of sacred pleasure in knowing that she had helped to perfect sounds which touched the hearts and senses of so many listeners she had looked forward to this concert so long and she sat scarcely breathing abstracted from consciousness of those about her soft and still radiating warmth and eagerness  fiorsen looked his worst as ever when first coming before an audiencecold furtive defensive defiant half turned away with those long fingers tightening the screws touching the strings it seemed queer to think that only six hours ago she had stolen out of bed from beside him wiesbaden no this was not like wiesbaden and when he played she had not the same emotions she had heard him now too often knew too exactly how he produced those sounds knew that their fire and sweetness and nobility sprang from fingers ear brainnot from his soul nor was it possible any longer to drift off on those currents of sound into new worlds to hear bells at dawn and the dews of evening as they fell to feel the divinity of wind and sunlight the romance and ecstasy that at wiesbaden had soaked her spirit came no more she was watching for the weak spots the passages with which he had struggled and she had struggled she was distracted by memories of petulance black moods and sudden caresses and then she caught his eye the look was like yet how unlike those looks at wiesbaden it had the old lovehunger but had lost the adoration its spiritual essence and she thought is it my fault or is it only because he has me now to do what he likes with it was all another disillusionment perhaps the greatest yet but she kindled and flushed at the applause and lost herself in pleasure at his success at the interval she slipped out at once for her first visit to the artists room the mysterious enchantment of a peep behind the scenes he was coming down from his last recall and at sight of her his look of bored contempt vanished lifting her hand he kissed it gyp felt happier than she had since her marriage her eyes shone and she whispered  beautiful  he whispered back  so do you love me gyp  she nodded and at that moment she did or thought so  then people began to come amongst them her old musicmaster monsieur harmost grey and mahogany as ever who after a merveilleux tres fort or two to fiorsen turned his back on him to talk to his old pupil  so she had married fiorsendear dear that was extraordinary but extraordinary and what was it like to be always with hima little funnynot so and how was her music it would be spoiled now ah what a pity no she must come to him then yes come again all the time he patted her arm as if playing the piano and his fingers that had the touch of an angel felt the firmness of her flesh as though debating whether she were letting it deteriorate he seemed really to have missed his little friend to be glad at seeing her again and gyp who never could withstand appreciation smiled at him more people came she saw rosek talking to her husband and the young alabaster girl standing silent her lips still a little parted gazing up at fiorsen a perfect figure though rather short a dovelike face whose exquisitely shaped justopened lips seemed to be demanding sugarplums she could not be more than nineteen who was she  a voice said almost in her ear  how do you do mrs fiorsen i am fortunate to see you again at last  she was obliged to turn if gustav had given her away one would never know it from this velvetmasked creature with his suave watchfulness and ready composure who talked away so smoothly what was it that she so disliked in him gyp had acute instincts the natural intelligence deep in certain natures not over intellectual but whose feelers are too delicate to be deceived and for something to say she asked  who is the girl you were talking to count rosek her face is so lovely  he smiled exactly the smile she had so disliked at wiesbaden following his glance she saw her husband talking to the girl whose lips at that moment seemed more than ever to ask for sugarplums  a young dancer daphne wingshe will make a name a dove flying so you admire her madame gyp  gyp said smiling  shes very prettyi can imagine her dancing beautifully  will you come one day and see her she has still to make her debut  gyp answered  thank you i dont know i love dancing of course  good i will arrange it  and gyp thought no no i dont want to have anything to do with you why do i not speak the truth why didnt i say i hate dancing  just then a bell sounded people began hurrying away the girl came up to rosek  miss daphne wingmrs fiorsen  gyp put out her hand with a smilethis girl was certainly a picture miss daphne wing smiled too and said with the intonation of those who have been carefully corrected of an accent  oh mrs fiorsen how beautifully your husband playsdoesnt he  it was not merely the careful speech but something lacking when the perfect mouth movedspirit sensibility who could say and gyp felt sorry as at blight on a perfect flower with a friendly nod she turned away to fiorsen who was waiting to go up on to the platform was it at her or at the girl he had been looking she smiled at him and slid away in the corridor rosek in attendance said  why not this evening come with gustav to my rooms she shall dance to us and we will all have supper she admires you madame gyp she will love to dance for you  gyp longed for the simple brutality to say i dont want to come i dont like you but all she could manage was  thank you ii will ask gustav  once in her seat again she rubbed the cheek that his breath had touched a girl was singing nowone of those faces that gyp always admired reddishgold hair blue eyesthe very antithesis of herselfand the song was the bens of jura that strange outpouring from a heart broken by love        and my heart reft of its own sun   tears rose in her eyes and the shiver of some very deep response passed through her what was it dad had said love catches you and youre gone  she who was the result of love like that did not want to love  the girl finished singing there was little applause yet she had sung beautifully and what more wonderful song in the world was it too tragic too painful too strangenot pretty enough gyp felt sorry for her her head ached now she would so have liked to slip away when it was all over but she had not the needful rudeness she would have to go through with this evening at roseks and be gay and why not why this shadow over everything but it was no new sensation that of having entered by her own free will on a life which for all effort would not give her a feeling of anchorage or home of her own accord she had stepped into the cage  on the way to roseks rooms she disguised from fiorsen her headache and depression he was in one of his boyoutofschool moods elated by applause mimicking her old master the idolatries of his worshippers rosek the girl dancers upturned expectant lips and he slipped his arm round gyp in the cab crushing her against him and sniffing at her cheek as if she had been a flower  rosek had the first floor of an oldtime mansion in russell square the smell of incense or some kindred perfume was at once about one and on the walls of the dark hall electric light burned in jars of alabaster picked up in the east the whole place was in fact a sanctum of the collectors spirit its owner had a passion for blackthe walls divans pictureframes even some of the tilings were black with glimmerings of gold ivory and moonlight on a round black table there stood a golden bowl filled with moonlightcoloured velvety palm and honesty from a black wall gleamed out the ivory mask of a fauns face from a dark niche the little silver figure of a dancing girl it was beautiful but deathly and gyp though excited always by anything new keenly alive to every sort of beauty felt a longing for air and sunlight it was a relief to get close to one of the blackcurtained windows and see the westering sun shower warmth and light on the trees of the square gardens she was introduced to a mr and mrs gallant a darkfaced cynicallooking man with clever malicious eyes and one of those large cornucopias of women with avid blue stares the little dancer was not there she had gone to put on nothing rosek informed them  he took gyp the round of his treasures scarabs rops drawings deathmasks chinese pictures and queer old flutes with an air of displaying them for the first time to one who could truly appreciate and she kept thinking of that saying une technique merveilleuse her instinct apprehended the refined boneviciousness of this place where nothing save perhaps taste would be sacred it was her first glimpse into that giltedged bohemia whence the generosities the elans the struggles of the true bohemia are as rigidly excluded as from the spheres where bishops moved but she talked and smiled and no one could have told that her nerves were crisping as if at contact with a corpse while showing her those alabaster jars her host had laid his hand softly on her wrist and in taking it away he let his fingers with a touch softer than a kittens paw ripple over the skin then put them to his lips ah there it wasthethe technique a desperate desire to laugh seized her and he saw itoh yes he saw it he gave her one look passed that same hand over his smooth face andbeholdit showed as before unmortified unconscious a deadly little man  when they returned to the salon as it was called miss daphne wing in a black kimono whence her face and arms emerged more like alabaster than ever was sitting on a divan beside fiorsen she rose at once and came across to gyp  oh mrs fiorsenwhy did everything she said begin with ohisnt this room lovely its perfect for dancing i only brought cream and flamecolour they go so beautifully with black  she threw back her kimono for gyp to inspect her dressa girdled creamcoloured shift which made her ivory arms and neck seem more than ever dazzling and her mouth opened as if for a sugarplum of praise then lowering her voice she murmured  do you know im rather afraid of count rosek  why  oh i dont know hes so critical and smooth and he comes up so quietly i do think your husband plays wonderfully oh mrs fiorsen you are beautiful arent you gyp laughed what would you like me to dance first a waltz of chopins  yes i love chopin  then i shall i shall dance exactly what you like because i do admire you and im sure youre awfully sweet oh yes you are i can see that and i think your husbands awfully in love with you i should be if i were a man you know ive been studying five years and i havent come out yet but now count roseks going to back me i expect itll be very soon will you come to my first night mother says ive got to be awfully careful she only let me come this evening because you were going to be here would you like me to begin  she slid across to rosek and gyp heard her say  oh mrs fiorsen wants me to begin a chopin waltz please the one that goes like this  rosek went to the piano the little dancer to the centre of the room gyp sat down beside fiorsen  rosek began playing his eyes fixed on the girl and his mouth loosened from compression in a sweetish smile miss daphne wing was standing with her fingertips joined at her breasta perfect statue of ebony and palest wax suddenly she flung away the black kimono a thrill swept gyp from head to foot she could dancethat common little girl every movement of her round sinuous body of her bare limbs had the ecstasy of natural genius controlled by the quivering balance of a really fine training a dove flying so she was her face had lost its vacancy or rather its vacancy had become divine having that looknot lost but gone beforewhich dance demands yes she was a gem even if she had a common soul tears came up in gyps eyes it was so lovelylike a dove when it flings itself up in the wind breasting on up upwings bent back poised abandonment freedomchastened shaped controlled  when after the dance the girl came and sat down beside her she squeezed her hot little hand but the caress was for her art not for this moist little person with the lips avid of sugarplums  oh did you like it im so glad shall i go and put on my flamecolour now  the moment she was gone comment broke out freely the dark and cynical gallant thought the girls dancing like a certain napierkowska whom he had seen in moscow without her firethe touch of passion would have to be supplied she wanted love love and suddenly gyp was back in the concerthall listening to that other girl singing the song of a broken heart        thy kiss dear love      like watercress gathered fresh from cool streams   love in this abodeof fauns heads deep cushions silver dancing girls love she had a sudden sense of deep abasement what was she herself but just a feast for a mans senses her home what but a place like this miss daphne wing was back again gyp looked at her husbands face while she was dancing his lips how was it that she could see that disturbance in him and not care if she had really loved him to see his lips like that would have hurt her but she might have understood perhaps and forgiven now she neither quite understood nor quite forgave   and that night when he kissed her she murmured  would you rather it were that girlnot me  that girl i could swallow her at a draft but you my gypi want to drink for ever  was that true if she had loved himhow good to hear   v   after this gyp was daily more and more in contact with high bohemia that curious composite section of society which embraces the neck of music poetry and the drama she was a success but secretly she felt that she did not belong to it nor in truth did fiorsen who was much too genuine a bohemian and artist and mocked at the gallants and even the roseks of this life as he mocked at winton aunt rosamund and their world life with him had certainly one effect on gyp it made her feel less and less a part of that old orthodox wellbred world which she had known before she married him but to which she had confessed to winton she had never felt that she belonged since she knew the secret of her birth she was in truth much too impressionable too avid of beauty and perhaps too naturally critical to accept the dictates of their factandformgoverned routine only of her own accord she would never have had initiative enough to step out of its circle loosened from those roots unable to attach herself to this new soil and not spiritually leagued with her husband she was more and more lonely her only truly happy hours were those spent with winton or at her piano or with her puppies she was always wondering at what she had done longing to find the deep the sufficient reason for having done it but the more she sought and longed the deeper grew her bewilderment her feeling of being in a cage of late too another and more definite uneasiness had come to her  she spent much time in her garden where the blossoms had all dropped lilac was over acacias coming into bloom and blackbirds silent  winton who by careful experiment had found that from halfpast three to six there was little or no chance of stumbling across his soninlaw came in nearly every day for tea and a quiet cigar on the lawn he was sitting there with gyp one afternoon when betty who usurped the functions of parlourmaid whenever the whim moved her brought out a card on which were printed the words miss daphne wing  bring her out please betty dear and some fresh tea and buttered toastplenty of buttered toast yes and the chocolates and any other sweets there are betty darling  betty with that expression which always came over her when she was called darling withdrew across the grass and gyp said to her father  its the little dancer i told you of dad now youll see something perfect only shell be dressed its a pity  she was the occasion had evidently exercised her spirit in warm ivory shrouded by leafgreen chiffon with a girdle of tiny artificial leaves and a lightly covered head encircled by other green leaves she was somewhat like a nymph peering from a bower if rather too arresting it was charming and after all no frock could quite disguise the beauty of her figure she was evidently nervous  oh mrs fiorsen i thought you wouldnt mind my coming i did so want to see you again count rosek said he thought i might its all fixed for my comingout oh how do you do and with lips and eyes opening at winton she sat down in the chair he placed for her gyp watching his expression felt inclined to laugh dad and daphne wing and the poor girl so evidently anxious to make a good impression presently she asked  have you been dancing at count roseks again lately  oh yes havent youdidnt youi and she stopped  the thought flashed through gyp so gustavs been seeing her and hasnt told me but she said at once  ah yes of course i forgot when is the night of your comingout  next friday week fancy the octagon isnt it splendid theyve given me such a good engagement i do so want you and mr fiorsen to come though  gyp smiling murmured  of course we will my father loves dancing too dont you dad  winton took his cigar from his mouth  when its good he said urbanely  oh mine is good isnt it mrs fiorsen i mean i have workedever since i was thirteen you know i simply love it i think you would dance beautifully mrs fiorsen youve got such a perfect figure i simply love to see you walk  gyp flushed and said  do have one of these miss wingtheyve got whole raspberries inside  the little dancer put one in her mouth  oh but please dont call me miss wing i wish youd call me daphne mr fioreverybody does  conscious of her fathers face gyp murmured  its a lovely name wont you have another these are apricot  theyre perfect you know my first dress is going to be all orangeblossom mr fiorsen suggested that but i expect he told you perhaps you suggested it really did you gyp shook her head count rosek says the world is waiting for me she paused with a sugarplum halfway to her lips and added doubtfully do you think thats true  gyp answered with a soft i hope so  he says im something new it would be nice to think that he has great taste so has mr fiorsen hasnt he  conscious of the compression in the lips behind the smoke of her fathers cigar and with a sudden longing to get up and walk away gyp nodded  the little dancer placed the sweet in her mouth and said complacently  of course he has because he married you  then seeming to grow conscious of wintons eyes fixed so intently on her she became confused swallowed hastily and said  oh isnt it lovely herelike the country im afraid i must go its my practicetime its so important for me not to miss any now isnt it and she rose  winton got up too gyp saw the girls eyes lighting on his rigid hand grow round and rounder and from her walking past the side of the house the careful voice floated back  oh i do hope but what could not be heard  sinking back in her chair gyp sat motionless bees were murmurous among her flowers pigeons murmurous among the trees the sunlight warmed her knees and her stretchedout feet through the openwork of her stockings the maids laughter the delicious growling of the puppies at play in the kitchen came drifting down the garden with the distant cry of a milkman up the road all was very peaceful but in her heart were such curious baffled emotions such strange tangled feelings this moment of enlightenment regarding the measure of her husbands frankness came close on the heels of the moment fate had chosen for another revelation for clinching within her a fear felt for weeks past she had said to winton that she did not want to have a child in those conscious that their birth has caused death or even too great suffering there is sometimes this hostile instinct she had not even the consolation that fiorsen wanted children she knew that he did not and now she was sure one was coming but it was more than that she had not reached and knew she could not reach that point of spiritunion which alone makes marriage sacred and the sacrifices demanded by motherhood a joy she was fairly caught in the web of her foolish and presumptuous mistake so few months of marriageand so sure that it was a failure so hopeless for the future in the light of this new certainty it was terrifying a hard natural fact is needed to bring a yearning and bewildered spirit to knowledge of the truth disillusionment is not welcome to a womans heart the less welcome when it is disillusionment with self as much as with another her great dedicationher scheme of life she had been going towhatsave fiorsen from himself it was laughable she had only lost herself already she felt in prison and by a child would be all the more bound to some women the knowledge that a thing must be brings assuagement of the nerves gyp was the opposite of those to force her was the way to stiver up every contrary emotion she might will herself to acquiesce butone cannot change ones nature  and so while the pigeons cooed and the sunlight warmed her feet she spent the bitterest moments of her lifeso far pride came to her help she had made a miserable mess of it but no one must knowcertainly not her father who had warned her so desperately she had made her bed and she would have to lie on it  when winton came back he found her smiling and said  i dont see the fascination gyp  dont you think her face really rather perfect  common  yes but that drops off when shes dancing  winton looked at her from under halfclosed eyelids  with her clothes what does fiorsen think of her  gyp smiled  does he think of her i dont know  she could feel the watchful tightening of his face and suddenly he said  daphne wing by george  the words were a masterpiece of resentment and distrust his daughter in peril fromsuch as that  after he was gone gyp sat on till the sun had quite vanished and the dew was stealing through her thin frock she would think of anything anybody except herself to make others happy was the way to be happyor so they said she would trymust try bettyso stout and with that rheumatism in her legdid she ever think of herself or aunt rosamund with her perpetual rescuings of lost dogs lame horses and penniless musicians and dad for all his manoftheworld ways was he not always doing little things for the men of his old regiment always thinking of her too and what he could do to give her pleasure to love everybody and bring them happiness was it not possible only people were hard to love different from birds and beasts and flowers to love which seemed natural and easy  she went up to her room and began to dress for dinner which of her frocks did he like best the pale lowcut amber or that white soft one with the coffeedipped lace she decided on the latter scrutinizing her supple slender image in the glass a shudder went through her that would all go she would be like those women taking careful exercise in the streets who made her wonder at their hardihood in showing themselves it wasnt fair that one must become unsightly offensive to the eye in order to bring life into the world some women seemed proud to be like that how was that possible she would never dare to show herself in the days coming  she finished dressing and went downstairs it was nearly eight and fiorsen had not come in when the gong was struck she turned from the window with a sigh and went in to dinner that sigh had been relief she ate her dinner with the two pups beside her sent them off and sat down at her piano she played chopinstudies waltzes mazurkas preludes a polonaise or two and betty who had a weakness for that composer sat on a chair by the door which partitioned off the back premises having opened it a little she wished she could go and take a peep at her pretty in her white frock with the candleflames on each side and those lovely lilies in the vase close by smelling beautiful and one of the maids coming too near she shooed her angrily away  it grew late the tray had been brought up the maids had gone to bed gyp had long stopped playing had turned out ready to go up and by the french window stood gazing out into the dark how warm it waswarm enough to draw forth the scent of the jessamine along the garden wall not a star there always seemed so few stars in london a sound made her swing round something tall was over there in the darkness by the open door she heard a sigh and called out frightened  is that you gustav  he spoke some words that she could not understand shutting the window quickly she went toward him light from the hall lit up one side of his face and figure he was pale his eyes shone strangely his sleeve was all white he said thickly  little ghost and then some words that must be swedish it was the first time gyp had ever come to close quarters with drunkenness and her thought was simply how awful if anybody were to seehow awful she made a rush to get into the hall and lock the door leading to the back regions but he caught her frock ripping the lace from her neck and his entangled fingers clutched her shoulder she stopped dead fearing to make a noise or pull him over and his other hand clutched her other shoulder so that he stood steadying himself by her why was she not shocked smitten to the ground with grief and shame and rage she only felt what am i to do how get him upstairs without anyone knowing and she looked up into his faceit seemed to her so pathetic with its shining eyes and its staring whiteness that she could have burst into tears she said gently  gustav its all right lean on me well go up  his hands that seemed to have no power or purpose touched her cheeks mechanically caressing more than disgust she felt that awful pity putting her arm round his waist she moved with him toward the stairs if only no one heard if only she could get him quietly up and she murmured  dont talk youre not well lean on me hard  he seemed to make a big effort his lips puffed out and with an expression of pride that would have been comic if not so tragic he muttered something  holding him close with all her strength as she might have held one desperately loved she began to mount it was easier than she had thought only across the landing now into the bedroom and then the danger would be over done he was lying across the bed and the door shut then for a moment she gave way to a fit of shivering so violent that she could hear her teeth chattering yet could not stop them she caught sight of herself in the big mirror her pretty lace was all torn her shoulders were red where his hands had gripped her holding himself up she threw off her dress put on a wrapper and went up to him he was lying in a sort of stupor and with difficulty she got him to sit up and lean against the bedrail taking off his tie and collar she racked her brains for what to give him sal volatile surely that must be right it brought him to himself so that he even tried to kiss her at last he was in bed and she stood looking at him his eyes were closed he would not see if she gave way now but she would not cryshe would not one sob camebut that was all well there was nothing to be done now but get into bed too she undressed and turned out the light he was in a stertorous sleep and lying there with eyes wide open staring into the dark a smile came on her lipsa very strange smile she was thinking of all those preposterous young wives she had read of who blushing trembling murmur into the ears of their young husbands that they have somethingsomething to tell them   vi   looking at fiorsen next morning still sunk in heavy sleep her first thought was he looks exactly the same and suddenly it seemed queer to her that she had not been and still was not disgusted it was all too deep for disgust and somehow too natural she took this new revelation of his unbridled ways without resentment besides she had long known of this taste of hisone cannot drink brandy and not betray it  she stole noiselessly from bed noiselessly gathered up his boots and clothes all tumbled on to a chair and took them forth to the dressingroom there she held the garments up to the early light and brushed them then noiseless stole back to bed with needle and thread and her lace no one must know not even he must know for the moment she had forgotten that other thing so terrifically important it came back to her very sudden very sickening so long as she could keep it secret no one should know that eitherhe least of all  the morning passed as usual but when she came to the musicroom at noon she found that he had gone out she was just sitting down to lunch when betty with the broad smile which prevailed on her moonface when someone had tickled the right side of her announced  count rosek  gyp got up startled  say that mr fiorsen is not in betty butbut ask if he will come and have some lunch and get a bottle of hock up please  in the few seconds before her visitor appeared gyp experienced the sort of excitement one has entering a field where a bull is grazing  but not even his severest critics could accuse rosek of want of tact he had hoped to see gustav but it was charming of her to give him luncha great delight  he seemed to have put off as if for her benefit his corsets and some at all events of his offending looksseemed simpler more genuine his face was slightly browned as if for once he had been taking his due of air and sun he talked without cynical submeanings was most appreciative of her charming little house and even showed some warmth in his sayings about art and music gyp had never disliked him less but her instincts were on the watch after lunch they went out across the garden to see the musicroom and he sat down at the piano he had the deep caressing touch that lies in fingers of steel worked by a real passion for tone gyp sat on the divan and listened she was out of his sight there and she looked at him wondering he was playing schumanns child music how could one who produced such fresh idyllic sounds have sinister intentions and presently she said  count rosek  madame  will you please tell me why you sent daphne wing here yesterday  i send her  yes  but instantly she regretted having asked that question he had swung round on the musicstool and was looking full at her his face had changed  since you ask me i thought you should know that gustav is seeing a good deal of her  he had given the exact answer she had divined  do you think i mind that  a flicker passed over his face he got up and said quietly  i am glad that you do not  why glad  she too had risen though he was little taller than herself she was conscious suddenly of how thick and steely he was beneath his dapper garments and of a kind of snaky willpower in his face her heart beat faster  he came toward her and said  i am glad you understand that it is over with gustavfinished he stopped dead seeing at once that he had gone wrong and not knowing quite where gyp had simply smiled a flush coloured his cheeks and he said  he is a volcano soon extinguished you see i know him better you should know him too why do you smile  why is it better i should know  he went very pale and said between his teeth  that you may not waste your time there is love waiting for you  but gyp still smiled  was it from love of me that you made him drunk last night  his lips quivered  gyp gyp turned but with the merest change of front he had put himself between her and the door you never loved him that is my excuse you have given him too much alreadymore than he is worth ah god i am tortured by you i am possessed  he had gone white through and through like a flame save for his smouldering eyes she was afraid and because she was afraid she stood her ground should she make a dash for the door that opened into the little lane and escape that way then suddenly he seemed to regain control but she could feel that he was trying to break through her defences by the sheer intensity of his gazeby a kind of mesmerism knowing that he had frightened her  under the strain of this duel of eyes she felt herself beginning to sway to get dizzy whether or no he really moved his feet he seemed coming closer inch by inch she had a horrible feelingas if his arms were already round her  with an effort she wrenched her gaze from his and suddenly his crisp hair caught her eyes surelysurely it was curled with tongs a kind of spasm of amusement was set free in her heart and almost inaudibly the words escaped her lips une technique merveilleuse his eyes wavered he uttered a little gasp his lips fell apart gyp walked across the room and put her hand on the bell she had lost her fear without a word he turned and went out into the garden she watched him cross the lawn gone she had beaten him by the one thing not even violent passions can withstandridicule almost unconscious ridicule then she gave way and pulled the bell with nervous violence the sight of the maid in her trim black dress and spotless white apron coming from the house completed her restoration was it possible that she had really been frightened nearly failing in that encounter nearly dominated by that manin her own house with her own maids down there at hand and she said quietly  i want the puppies please  yes maam  over the garden the day brooded in the firstgathered warmth of summer midjune of a fine year the air was drowsy with hum and scent  and gyp sitting in the shade while the puppies rolled and snapped searched her little world for comfort and some sense of safety and could not find it as if there were all round her a hot heavy fog in which things lurked and where she kept erect only by pride and the will not to cry out that she was struggling and afraid   fiorsen leaving his house that morning had walked till he saw a taxicab leaning back therein with hat thrown off he caused himself to be driven rapidly at random this was one of his habits when his mind was not at easean expensive idiosyncrasy illafforded by a pocket that had holes the swift motion and titillation by the perpetual close shaving of other vehicles were sedative to him he needed sedatives this morning to wake in his own bed without the least remembering how he had got there was no more new to him than to many another man of twentyeight but it was new since his marriage if he had remembered even less he would have been more at ease but he could just recollect standing in the dark drawingroom seeing and touching a ghostly gyp quite close to him and somehow he was afraid and when he was afraidlike most peoplehe was at his worst  if she had been like all the other women in whose company he had eaten passionfruit he would not have felt this carking humiliation if she had been like them at the pace he had been going since he obtained possession of her he would already have finished as rosek had said and he knew well enough that he had not finished he might get drunk might be looseended in every way but gyp was hooked into his senses and for all that he could not get near her into his spirit her very passivity was her strength the secret of her magnetism in her he felt some of that mysterious sentiency of nature which even in yielding to mans fevers lies apart with a faint smilethe uncapturable smile of the woods and fields by day or night that makes one ache with longing he felt in her some of the unfathomable soft vibrating indifference of the flowers and trees and streams of the rocks of birdsongs and the eternal hum under sunshine or starshine her dark halfsmiling eyes enticed him inspired an unquenchable thirst and his was one of those natures which encountering spiritual difficulty at once jib off seek anodynes try to bandage wounded egoism with excessa spoiled child with the desperations and the inherent pathos the something repulsive and the something lovable that belong to all such having wished for this moon and got her he now did not know what to do with her kept taking great bites at her with a feeling all the time of getting further and further away at moments he desired revenge for his failure to get near her spiritually and was ready to commit follies of all kinds he was only kept in control at all by his work for he did work hard though even there something was lacking he had all the qualities of making good except the moral backbone holding them together which alone could give him his rightfulas he thoughtpreeminence it often surprised and vexed him to find that some contemporary held higher rank than himself  threading the streets in his cab he mused  did i do anything that really shocked her last night why didnt i wait for her this morning and find out the worst and his lips twisted awryfor to find out the worst was not his forte meditation seeking as usual a scapegoat lighted on rosek like most egoists addicted to women he had not many friends rosek was the most constant but even for him fiorsen had at once the contempt and fear that a man naturally uncontrolled and yet of greater scope has for one of less talent but stronger willpower he had for him too the feeling of a wayward child for its nurse mixed with the need that an artist especially an executant artist feels for a connoisseur and patron with welllined pockets  curse paul he thought he must knowhe does knowthat brandy of his goes down like water trust him he saw i was getting silly he had some game on where did i go after how did i get home and again did i hurt gyp if the servants had seenthat would be the worst that would upset her fearfully and he laughed then he had a fresh access of fear he didnt know her never knew what she was thinking or feeling never knew anything about her and he thought angrily thats not fair i dont hide myself from her i am as free as nature i let her see everything what did i do that maid looked very queerly at me this morning and suddenly he said to the driver bury street st jamess he could find out at all events whether gyp had been to her fathers the thought of winton ever afflicted him and he changed his mind several times before the cab reached that little street but so swiftly that he had not time to alter his instructions to the driver a light sweat broke out on his forehead while he was waiting for the door to be opened  mrs fiorsen here  no sir  not been here this morning  no sir  he shrugged away the thought that he ought to give some explanation of his question and got into the cab again telling the man to drive to curzon street if she had not been to that aunt rosamund either it would be all right she had not there was no one else she would go to and with a sigh of relief he began to feel hungry having had no breakfast he would go to roseks borrow the money to pay his cab and lunch there but rosek was not in he would have to go home to get the cab paid the driver seemed to eye him queerly now as though conceiving doubts about the fare  going in under the trellis fiorsen passed a man coming out who held in his hand a long envelope and eyed him askance  gyp who was sitting at her bureau seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her chequebook she did not turn round and fiorsen paused how was she going to receive him  is there any lunch he said  she reached out and rang the bell he felt sorry for himself he had been quite ready to take her in his arms and say forgive me little gyp im sorry  betty answered the bell  please bring up some lunch for mr fiorsen  he heard the stout woman sniff as she went out she was a part of his ostracism and with sudden rage he said  what do you want for a husbanda bourgeois who would die if he missed his lunch  gyp turned round to him and held out her chequebook  i dont in the least mind about meals but i do about this he read on the counterfoil  messrs travers  sanborn tailors account rendered l54 35s 7d are there many of these gustav  fiorsen had turned the peculiar white that marked deep injury to his sellesteem he said violently  well what of that a bill did you pay it you have no business to pay my bills  the man said if it wasnt paid this time hed sue you her lips quivered i think owing money is horrible its undignified are there many others please tell me  i shall not tell you what is it to you  it is a lot to me i have to keep this house and pay the maids and everything and i want to know how i stand i am not going to make debts thats hateful  her face had a hardness that he did not know he perceived dimly that she was different from the gyp of this hour yesterdaythe last time when in possession of his senses he had seen or spoken to her the novelty of her revolt stirred him in strange ways wounded his selfconceit inspired a curious fear and yet excited his senses he came up to her said softly  money curse money kiss me with a certain amazement at the sheer distaste in her face he heard her say  its childish to curse money i will spend all the income i have but i will not spend more and i will not ask dad  he flung himself down in a chair  ho ho virtue  nopride  he said gloomily  so you dont believe in me you dont believe i can earn as much as i wantmore than you haveany time you never have believed in me  i think you earn now as much as you are ever likely to earn  that is what you think i dont want moneyyour money i can live on nothing any time i have done itoften  hssh  he looked round and saw the maid in the doorway  please sir the driver says can he have his fare or do you want him again twelve shillings  fiorsen stared at her a moment in the way thatas the maid often saidmade you feel like a silly  no pay him  the girl glanced at gyp answered yes sir and went out  fiorsen laughed he laughed holding his sides it was droll coming on the top of his assertion too droll and looking up at her he said  that was good wasnt it gyp  but her face had not abated its gravity and knowing that she was even more easily tickled by the incongruous than himself he felt again that catch of fear something was different yes something was really different  did i hurt you last night  she shrugged her shoulders and went to the window he looked at her darkly jumped up and swung out past her into the garden and almost at once the sound of his violin furiously played in the musicroom came across the lawn  gyp listened with a bitter smile money too but what did it matter she could not get out of what she had done she could never get out tonight he would kiss her and she would pretend it was all right and so it would go on and on well it was her own fault taking twelve shillings from her purse she put them aside on the bureau to give the maid and suddenly she thought perhaps hell get tired of me if only he would get tired that was a long way the furthest she had yet gone   vii   they who have known the doldrumshow the sails of the listless ship droop and the hope of escape dies day by daymay understand something of the life gyp began living now on a ship even doldrums come to an end but a young woman of twentythree who has made a mistake in her marriage and has only herself to blame looks forward to no end unless she be the new woman which gyp was not having settled that she would not admit failure and clenched her teeth on the knowledge that she was going to have a child she went on keeping things sealed up even from winton to fiorsen she managed to behave as usual making material life easy and pleasant for himplaying for him feeding him well indulging his amorousness it did not matter she loved no one else to count herself a martyr would be silly her malaise successfully concealed was deeperof the spirit the subtle utter discouragement of one who has done for herself clipped her own wings  as for rosek she treated him as if that little scene had never taken place the idea of appealing to her husband in a difficulty was gone for ever since the night he came home drunk and she did not dare to tell her father he wouldwhat would he not do but she was always on her guard knowing that rosek would not forgive her for that dart of ridicule his insinuations about daphne wing she put out of mind as she never could have if she had loved fiorsen she set up for herself the idol of pride and became its faithful worshipper only winton and perhaps betty could tell she was not happy fiorsens debts and irresponsibility about money did not worry her much for she paid everything in the houserent wages food and her own dressand had so far made ends meet and what he did outside the house she could not help  so the summer wore on till concerts were over and it was supposed to be impossible to stay in london but she dreaded going away she wanted to be left quiet in her little house it was this which made her tell fiorsen her secret one night after the theatre he had begun to talk of a holiday sitting on the edge of the settee with a glass in his hand and a cigarette between his lips his cheeks white and hollow from too much london went a curious dull red he got up and stared at her gyp made an involuntary movement with her hands  you neednt look at me its true  he put down glass and cigarette and began to tramp the room and gyp stood with a little smile not even watching him suddenly he clasped his forehead and broke out  but i dont want it i wont have itspoiling my gyp then quickly going up to her with a scared face i dont want it im afraid of it dont have it  in gyps heart came the same feeling as when he had stood there drunk against the wallcompassion rather than contempt of his childishness and taking his hand she said  all right gustav it shant bother you when i begin to get ugly ill go away with betty till its over  he went down on his knees  oh no oh no oh no my beautiful gyp  and gyp sat like a sphinx for fear that she too might let slip those words oh no  the windows were open and moths had come in one had settled on the hydrangea plant that filled the hearth gyp looked at the soft white downy thing whose head was like a tiny owls against the bluish petals looked at the purplegrey tiles down there and the stuff of her own frock in the shaded gleam of the lamps and all her love of beauty rebelled called up by his oh no she would be unsightly soon and suffer pain and perhaps die of it as her own mother had died she set her teeth listening to that grownup child revolting against what he had brought on her and touched his hand protectingly  it interested even amused her this night and next day to watch his treatment of the disconcerting piece of knowledge for when at last he realized that he had to acquiesce in nature he began as she had known he would to jib away from all reminder of it she was careful not to suggest that he should go away without her knowing his perversity but when he proposed that she should come to ostend with him and rosek she answered after seeming deliberation that she thought she had better notshe would rather stay at home quite quietly but he must certainly go and get a good holiday  when he was really gone peace fell on gyppeace such as one feels having no longer the tight banded sensations of a fever to be without that strange disorderly presence in the house when she woke in the sultry silence of the next morning she utterly failed to persuade herself that she was missing him missing the sound of his breathing the sight of his rumpled hair on the pillow the outline of his long form under the sheet her heart was devoid of any emptiness or ache she only felt how pleasant and cool and tranquil it was to lie there alone she stayed quite late in bed it was delicious with window and door wide open and the puppies running in and out to lie and doze off or listen to the pigeons cooing and the distant sounds of traffic and feel in command once more of herself body and soul now that she had told fiorsen she had no longer any desire to keep her condition secret feeling that it would hurt her father to learn of it from anyone but herself she telephoned to tell him she was alone and asked if she might come to bury street and dine with him  winton had not gone away because between goodwood and doncaster there was no racing that he cared for one could not ride at this time of year so might just as well be in london in fact august was perhaps the pleasantest of all months in town the club was empty and he could sit there without some old bore buttonholing him little boncarte the fencingmaster was always free for a boutwinton had long learned to make his left hand what his right hand used to be the turkish baths in jermyn street were nearly void of their fat clients he could saunter over to covent garden buy a melon and carry it home without meeting any but the most inferior duchesses in piccadilly on warm nights he could stroll the streets or the parks smoking his cigar his hat pushed back to cool his forehead thinking vague thoughts recalling vague memories he received the news that his daughter was alone and free from that fellow with something like delight where should he dine her mrs markey was on her holiday why not blafards quietsmall roomsnot too respectablequite fairly coolgood things to eat yes blafards  when she drove up he was ready in the doorway his thin brown face with its keen halfveiled eyes the picture of composure but feeling at heart like a schoolboy off for an exeat how pretty she was lookingthough pale from londonher dark eyes her smile and stepping quickly to the cab he said  no im getting indining at blafards gypa night out  it gave him a thrill to walk into that little restaurant behind her and passing through its low red rooms to mark the diners turn and stare with envytaking him perhaps for a different sort of relation he settled her into a far corner by a window where she could see the people and be seen he wanted her to be seen while he himself turned to the world only the short back wings of his glossy greyish hair he had no notion of being disturbed in his enjoyment by the sight of hivites and amorites or whatever they might be lapping champagne and shining in the heat for secretly he was living not only in this evening but in a certain evening of the past when in this very corner he had dined with her mother his face then had borne the brunt hers had been turned away from inquisition but he did not speak of this to gyp  she drank two full glasses of wine before she told him her news he took it with the expression she knew so welltightening his lips and staring a little upward then he said quietly  when  november dad  a shudder not to be repressed went through winton the very month and stretching his hand across the table he took hers and pressed it tightly  itll be all right child im glad  clinging to his hand gyp murmured  im not but i wont be frightenedi promise  each was trying to deceive the other and neither was deceived but both were good at putting a calm face on things besides this was a night outfor her the first since her marriageof freedom of feeling somewhat as she used to feel with all before her in a ballroom of a world for him the unfettered resumption of a dear companionship and a stealthy revel in the past after his so hes gone to ostend and his thought he would they never alluded to fiorsen but talked of horses of mildenhamit seemed to gyp years since she had been thereof her childish escapades and looking at him quizzically she asked  what were you like as a boy dad aunt rosamund says that you used to get into white rages when nobody could go near you she says you were always climbing trees or shooting with a catapult or stalking things and that you never told anybody what you didnt want to tell them and werent you desperately in love with your nurserygoverness  winton smiled how long since he had thought of that first affection miss huntley helena huntleywith crinkly brown hair and blue eyes and fascinating frocks he remembered with what grief and sense of bitter injury he heard in his first schoolholidays that she was gone and he said  yes yes by jove what a time ago and my fathers going off to india he never came back killed in that first afghan business when i was fond i was fond but i didnt feel things like younot half so sensitive no not a bit like you gyp  and watching her unconscious eyes following the movements of the waiters never staring but taking in all that was going on he thought prettiest creature in the world  well he said what would you like to do nowdrop into a theatre or musichall or what  gyp shook her head it was so hot could they just drive and then perhaps sit in the park that would be lovely it had gone dark and the air was not quite so exhausteda little freshness of scent from the trees in the squares and parks mingled with the fumes of dung and petrol winton gave the same order he had given that long past evening knightsbridge gate it had been a hansom then and the night air had blown in their faces instead of as now in these infernal taxis down the back of ones neck they left the cab and crossed the row passed the end of the long water up among the trees there on two chairs covered by wintons coat they sat side by side no dew was falling yet the heavy leaves hung unstirring the air was warm sweetsmelling blotted against trees or on the grass were other couples darker than the darkness very silent all was quiet save for the neverceasing hum of traffic from wintons lips the cigar smoke wreathed and curled he was dreaming the cigar between his teeth trembled a long ash fell mechanically he raised his hand to brush it offhis right hand a voice said softly in his ear  isnt it delicious and warm and gloomy black  winton shivered as one shivers recalled from dreams and carefully brushing off the ash with his left hand he answered  yes very jolly my cigars out though and i havent a match  gyps hand slipped through his arm  all these people in love and so dark and whisperyit makes a sort of strangeness in the air dont you feel it  winton murmured  no moon tonight  again they were silent a puff of wind ruffled the leaves the night for a moment seemed full of whispering then the sound of a giggle jarred out and a girls voice  oh chuck it arry  gyp rose  i feel the dew now dad can we walk on  they went along paths so as not to wet her feet in her thin shoes and they talked the spell was over the night again but a common london night the park a space of parching grass and gravel the people just clerks and shopgirls walking out   viii   fiorsens letters were the source of one long smile to gyp he missed her horribly if only she were thereand so forthblended in the queerest way with the impression that he was enjoying himself uncommonly there were requests for money and careful omission of any real account of what he was doing out of a balance running rather low she sent him remittances this was her holiday too and she could afford to pay for it she even sought out a shop where she could sell jewelry and with a certain malicious joy forwarded him the proceeds it would give him and herself another week  one night she went with winton to the octagon where daphne wing was still performing remembering the girls squeaks of rapture at her garden she wrote next day asking her to lunch and spend a lazy afternoon under the trees  the little dancer came with avidity she was pale and droopy from the heat but happily dressed in liberty silk with a plain turndown straw hat they lunched off sweetbreads ices and fruit and then with coffee cigarettes and plenty of sugarplums settled down in the deepest shade of the garden gyp in a low wicker chair daphne wing on cushions and the grass once past the exclamatory stage she seemed a great talker laying bare her little soul with perfect liberality and gypexcellent listenerenjoyed it as one enjoys all confidential revelations of existences very different from ones own especially when regarded as a superior being  of course i dont mean to stay at home any longer than i can help only its no good going out into lifethis phrase she often usedtill you know where you are in my profession one has to be so careful of course people think its worse than it is father gets fits sometimes but you know mrs fiorsen homes awful we have muttonyou know what mutton isits really awful in your bedroom in hot weather and theres nowhere to practise what i should like would be a studio it would be lovely somewhere down by the river or up here near you that would be lovely you know im putting by as soon as ever i have two hundred pounds i shall skip what i think would be perfectly lovely would be to inspire painters and musicians i dont want to be just a common turnballet business year after year and that i want to be something rather special but mothers so silly about me she thinks i oughtnt to take any risks at all i shall never get on that way it is so nice to talk to you mrs fiorsen because youre young enough to know what i feel and im sure youd never be shocked at anything you see about men ought one to marry or ought one to take a lover they say you cant be a perfect artist till youve felt passion but then if you marry that means mutton over again and perhaps babies and perhaps the wrong man after all ugh but then on the other hand i dont want to be raffish i hate raffish peoplei simply hate them what do you think its awfully difficult isnt it  gyp perfectly grave answered  that sort of thing settles itself i shouldnt bother beforehand  miss daphne wing buried her perfect chin deeper in her hands and said meditatively  yes i rather thought that too of course i could do either now but you see i really dont care for men who are not distinguished im sure i shall only fall in love with a really distinguished man thats what you didisnt itso you must understand i think mr fiorsen is wonderfully distinguished  sunlight piercing the shade suddenly fell warm on gyps neck where her blouse ceased and fortunately stilled the medley of emotion and laughter a little lower down she continued to look gravely at daphne wing who resumed  of course mother would have fits if i asked her such a question and i dont know what father would do only it is important isnt it one may go all wrong from the start and i do really want to get on i simply adore my work i dont mean to let love stand in its way i want to make it help you know count rosek says my dancing lacks passion i wish youd tell me if you think it does i should believe you  gyp shook her head  im not a judge  daphne wing looked up reproachfully  oh im sure you are if i were a man i should be passionately in love with you ive got a new dance where im supposed to be a nymph pursued by a faun its so difficult to feel like a nymph when you know its only the balletmaster do you think i ought to put passion into that you see im supposed to be flying all the time but it would be much more subtle wouldnt it if i could give the impression that i wanted to be caught dont you think so  gyp said suddenly  yes i think it would do you good to be in love  miss daphnes mouth fell a little open her eyes grew round she said  you frightened me when you said that you looked so differentsointense  a flame indeed had leaped up in gyp this fluffy flabby talk of love set her instincts in revolt she did not want to love she had failed to fall in love but whatever love was like it did not bear talking about how was it that this little suburban girl when she once got on her toes could twirl ones emotions as she did  dyou know what i should simply revel in daphne wing went on to dance to you here in the garden some night it must be wonderful to dance out of doors and the grass is nice and hard now only i suppose it would shock the servants do they look out this way gyp shook her head i could dance over there in front of the drawingroom window only it would have to be moonlight i could come any sunday ive got a dance where im supposed to be a lotus flowerthat would do splendidly and theres my real moonlight dance that goes to chopin i could bring my dresses and change in the musicroom couldnt i she wriggled up and sat crosslegged gazing at gyp and clasping her hands oh may i  her excitement infected gyp a desire to give pleasure the queerness of the notion and her real love of seeing this girl dance made her say  yes next sunday  daphne wing got up made a rush and kissed her her mouth was soft and she smelled of orange blossom but gyp recoiled a littleshe hated promiscuous kisses somewhat abashed miss daphne hung her head and said  you did look so lovely i couldnt help it really  and gyp gave her hand the squeeze of compunction  they went indoors to try over the music of the two dances and soon after daphne wing departed full of sugarplums and hope  she arrived punctually at eight oclock next sunday carrying an exiguous green linen bag which contained her dresses she was subdued and now that it had come to the point evidently a little scared lobster salad hock and peaches restored her courage she ate heartily it did not apparently matter to her whether she danced full or empty but she would not smoke  its bad for the she checked herself  when they had finished supper gyp shut the dogs into the back premises she had visions of their rending miss wings draperies or calves then they went into the drawingroom not lighting up that they might tell when the moonlight was strong enough outside though it was the last night of august the heat was as great as evera deep unstirring warmth the climbing moon shot as yet but a thin shaft here and there through the heavy foliage they talked in low voices unconsciously playing up to the nature of the escapade as the moon drew up they stole out across the garden to the musicroom gyp lighted the candles  can you manage  miss daphne had already shed half her garments  oh im so excited mrs fiorsen i do hope i shall dance well  gyp stole back to the house it being sunday evening the servants had been easily disposed of she sat down at the piano turning her eyes toward the garden a blurred white shape flitted suddenly across the darkness at the far end and became motionless as it might be a whiteflowering bush under the trees miss daphne had come out and was waiting for the moon gyp began to play she pitched on a little sicilian pastorale that the herdsmen play on their pipes coming down from the hills softly from very far rising rising swelling to full cadence and failing failing away again to nothing the moon rose over the trees its light flooded the face of the house down on to the grass and spread slowly back toward where the girl stood waiting it caught the border of sunflowers along the garden wall with a stroke of magical unearthly colourgold that was not gold  gyp began to play the dance the pale blurr in the darkness stirred the moonlight fell on the girl now standing with arms spread holding out her draperya white winged statue then like a gigantic moth she fluttered forth blanched and noiseless flew over the grass spun and hovered the moonlight etched out the shape of her head painted her hair with pallid gold in the silence with that unearthly gleam of colour along the sunflowers and on the girls head it was as if a spirit had dropped into the garden and was fluttering to and fro unable to get out  a voice behind gyp said my god whats this an angel  fiorsen was standing hallway in the darkened room staring out into the garden where the girl had halted transfixed before the window her eyes as round as saucers her mouth open her limbs rigid with interest and affright suddenly she turned and gathering her garment fled her limbs gleaming in the moonlight  and gyp sat looking up at the apparition of her husband she could just see his eyes straining after that flying nymph miss daphnes faun why even his ears were pointed had she never noticed before how like a faun he was yeson her weddingnight and she said quietly  daphne wing was rehearsing her new dance so youre back why didnt you let me know are you all rightyou look splendid  fiorsen bent down and clutched her by the shoulders  my gyp kiss me  but even while his lips were pressed on hers she felt rather than saw his eyes straying to the garden and thought he would like to be kissing that girl  the moment he had gone to get his things from the cab she slipped out to the musicroom  miss daphne was dressed and stuffing her garments into the green linen bag she looked up and said piteously  oh does he mind its awful isnt it  gyp strangled her desire to laugh  its for you to mind  oh i dont if you dont how did you like the dance  lovely when youre readycome along  oh i think id rather go home please it must seem so funny  would you like to go by this back way into the lane you turn to the right into the road  oh yes please it would have been better if he could have seen the dance properly wouldnt it what will he think  gyp smiled and opened the door into the lane when she returned fiorsen was at the window gazing out was it for her or for that flying nymph   ix   september and october passed there were more concerts not very well attended fiorsens novelty had worn off nor had his playing sweetness and sentiment enough for the big public there was also a financial crisis it did not seem to gyp to matter everything seemed remote and unreal in the shadow of her coming time unlike most mothers to be she made no garments no preparations of any kind why make what might never be needed she played for fiorsen a great deal for herself not at all read many bookspoetry novels biographiestaking them in at the moment and forgetting them at once as one does with books read just to distract the mind winton and aunt rosamund by tacit agreement came on alternate afternoons and winton almost as much under that shadow as gyp herself would take the evening train after leaving her and spend the next day racing or cubhunting returning the morning of the day after to pay his next visit he had no dread just then like that of an unoccupied day face to face with anxiety  betty who had been present at gyps birth was in a queer state the obvious desirability of such events to one of motherly type defrauded by fate of children was terribly impinged on by that old memory and a solicitude for her pretty far exceeding what she would have had for a daughter of her own what a peony regards as a natural happening to a peony she watches with awe when it happens to the lily that other single lady of a certain age aunt rosamund the very antithesis to bettya long thin nose and a mere button a sense of divine rights and no sense of rights at all a drawl and a comforting wheeze length and circumference decision and the curtsey to providence humour and none dyspepsia and the digestion of an ostrich with other oppositionsaunt rosamund was also uneasy as only one could be who disapproved heartily of uneasiness and habitually joked and drawled it into retirement  but of all those round gyp fiorsen gave the most interesting display he had not even an elementary notion of disguising his state of mind and his state of mind was weirdly wistfully primitive he wanted gyp as she had been the thought that she might never become herself again terrified him so at times that he was forced to drink brandy and come home only a little less far gone than that first time gyp had often to help him go to bed on two or three occasions he suffered so that he was out all night to account for this she devised the formula of a room at count roseks where he slept when music kept him late so as not to disturb her whether the servants believed her or not she never knew nor did she ever ask him where he wenttoo proud and not feeling that she had the right  deeply conscious of the unaesthetic nature of her condition she was convinced that she could no longer be attractive to one so easily upset in his nerves so intolerant of ugliness as to deeper feelings about herhad he any he certainly never gave anything up or sacrificed himself in any way if she had loved she felt she would want to give up everything to the loved one but thenshe would never love and yet he seemed frightened about her it was puzzling but perhaps she would not be puzzled much longer about that or anything for she often had the feeling that she would die how could she be going to live grudging her fate what would give her strength to go through with it and at times she felt as if she would be glad to die life had defrauded her or she had defrauded herself of life was it really only a year since that glorious days hunting when dad and she and the young man with the clear eyes and the irrepressible smile had slipped away with the hounds ahead of all the fieldthe fatal day fiorsen descended from the clouds and asked for her an overwhelming longing for mildenham came on her to get away there with her father and betty  she went at the beginning of november  over her departure fiorsen behaved like a tired child that will not go to bed he could not bear to be away from her and so forth but when she had gone he spent a furious bohemian evening at about five he woke with an awful cold feeling in my heart as he wrote to gyp next dayan awful feeling my gyp i walked up and down for hours in reality half an hour at most how shall i bear to be away from you at this time i feel lost next day he found himself in paris with rosek i could not stand he wrote the sight of the streets of the garden of our room when i come back i shall stay with rosek nearer to the day i will come i must come to you but gyp when she read the letter said to winton dad when it comes dont send for him i dont want him here  with those letters of his she buried the last remnants of her feeling that somewhere in him there must be something as fine and beautiful as the sounds he made with his violin and yet she felt those letters genuine in a way pathetic and with real feeling of a sort  from the moment she reached mildenham she began to lose that hopelessness about herself and for the first time had the sensation of wanting to live in the new life within her she first felt it going into her old nursery where everything was the same as it had been when she first saw it a child of eight there was her old red dolls house the whole side of which opened to display the various floors the worn venetian blinds the rattle of whose fall had sounded in her ears so many hundred times the high fender near which she had lain so often on the floor her chin on her hands reading grimm or alice in wonderland or histories of england here too perhaps this new child would live amongst the old familiars and the whim seized her to face her hour in her old nursery not in the room where she had slept as a girl she would not like the daintiness of that room deflowered let it stay the room of her girlhood but in the nurserythere was safety comfort and when she had been at mildenham a week she made betty change her over  no one in that house was half so calm to look at in those days as gyp betty was not guiltless of sitting on the stairs and crying at odd moments mrs markey had never made such bad soups markey so far forgot himself as frequently to talk winton lamed a horse trying an impossible jump that he might get home the quicker and once back was like an unquiet spirit if gyp were in the room he would make the pretence of wanting to warm his feet or hand just to stroke her shoulder as he went back to his chair his voice so measured and dry had a ring in it that too plainly disclosed the anxiety of his heart gyp always sensitive to atmosphere felt cradled in all the love about her wonderful that they should all care so much what had she done for anyone that people should be so sweethe especially whom she had so grievously distressed by her wretched marriage she would sit staring into the fire with her wide dark eyes unblinking as an owls at nightwondering what she could do to make up to her father whom already once she had nearly killed by coming into life and she began to practise the bearing of the coming pain trying to project herself into this unknown suffering so that it should not surprise from her cries and contortions  she had one dream over and over again of sinking and sinking into a feather bed growing hotter and more deeply walled in by that which had no stay in it yet through which her body could not fall and reach anything more solid once after this dream she got up and spent the rest of the night wrapped in a blanket and the eiderdown on the old sofa where as a child they had made her lie flat on her back from twelve to one every day betty was aghast at finding her there asleep in the morning gyps face was so like the childface she had seen lying there in the old days that she bundled out of the room and cried bitterly into the cup of tea it did her good going back with the tea she scolded her pretty for sleeping out there with the fire out too  but gyp only said  betty darling the teas awfully cold please get me some more   x   from the day of the nurses arrival winton gave up hunting he could not bring himself to be out of doors for more than half an hour at a time distrust of doctors did not prevent him having ten minutes every morning with the old practitioner who had treated gyp for mumps measles and the other blessings of childhood the old fellowhis name was rivershawwas a most peculiar survival he smelled of mackintosh had round purplish cheeks a rim of hair which people said he dyed and bulging grey eyes slightly bloodshot he was short in body and wind drank port wine was suspected of taking snuff read the times spoke always in a husky voice and used a very small brougham with a very old black horse but he had a certain low cunning which had defeated many ailments and his reputation for assisting people into the world stood extremely high every morning punctually at twelve the crunch of his little broughams wheels would be heard winton would get up and taking a deep breath cross the hall to the diningroom extract from a sideboard a decanter of port a biscuitcanister and one glass he would then stand with his eyes fixed on the door till in due time the doctor would appear and he could say  well doctor how is she  nicely quite nicely  nothing to make one anxious  the doctor puffing out his cheeks with eyes straying to the decanter would murmur  cardiac condition capitala littleumnot to matter taking its course these things  and winton with another deep breath would say  glass of port doctor  an expression of surprise would pass over the doctors face  cold dayah perhaps and he would blow his nose on his purpleandred bandanna  watching him drink his port winton would mark  we can get you at any time cant we  and the doctor sucking his lips would answer  never fear my dear sir little miss gypold friend of mine at her service day and night never fear  a sensation of comfort would pass through winton which would last quite twenty minutes after the crunching of the wheels and the mingled perfumes of him had died away  in these days his greatest friend was an old watch that had been his fathers before him a gold repeater from switzerland with a chipped dialplate and a case worn wondrous thin and smootha favourite of gyps childhood he would take it out about every quarter of an hour look at its face without discovering the time finger it all smooth and warm from contact with his body and put it back then he would listen there was nothing whatever to listen to but he could not help it apart from this his chief distraction was to take a foil and make passes at a leather cushion set up on the top of a low bookshelf in these occupations varied by constant visits to the room next the nursery whereto save her the stairsgyp was now established and by excursions to the conservatory to see if he could not find some new flower to take her he passed all his time save when he was eating sleeping or smoking cigars which he had constantly to be relighting  by gyps request they kept from him knowledge of when her pains began after that first bout was over and she was lying half asleep in the old nursery he happened to go up the nursea bonny creatureone of those free independent economic agents that now aboundmet him in the sittingroom accustomed to the fuss and botheration of men at such times she was prepared to deliver him a little lecture but in approaching she became affected by the look on his face and realizing somehow that she was in the presence of one whose selfcontrol was proof she simply whispered  its beginning but dont be anxiousshes not suffering just now we shall send for the doctor soon shes very plucky and with an unaccustomed sensation of respect and pity she repeated dont be anxious sir  if she wants to see me at any time i shall be in my study save her all you can nurse  the nurse was left with a feeling of surprise at having used the word sir she had not done such a thing sincesince and pensive she returned to the nursery where gyp said at once  was that my father i didnt want him to know  the nurse answered mechanically  thats all right my dear  how long do you think beforebefore itll begin again nurse id like to see him  the nurse stroked her hair  soon enough when its all over and comfy men are always fidgety  gyp looked at her and said quietly  yes you see my mother died when i was born  the nurse watching those lips still pale with pain felt a queer pang she smoothed the bedclothes and said  thats nothingit often happensthat is i meanyou know it has no connection whatever  and seeing gyp smile she thought well i am a fool  if by any chance i dont get through i want to be cremated i want to go back as quick as i can i cant bear the thought of the other thing will you remember nurse i cant tell my father that just now it might upset him but promise me  and the nurse thought that cant be done without a will or something but id better promise its a morbid fancy and yet shes not a morbid subject either and she said  very well my dear only youre not going to do anything of the sort thats flat  gyp smiled again and there was silence till she said  im awfully ashamed wanting all this attention and making people miserable ive read that japanese women quietly go out somewhere by themselves and sit on a gate  the nurse still busy with the bedclothes murmured abstractedly  yes thats a very good way but dont you fancy youre half the trouble most of them are youre very good and youre going to get on splendidly and she thought odd shes never once spoken of her husband i dont like it for this sorttoo perfect too sensitive her face touches you so  gyp murmured again  id like to see my father please and rather quick  the nurse after one swift look went out  gyp who had clinched her hands under the bedclothes fixed her eyes on the window november acorns and the leavesthe nice damp earthy smell acorns all over the grass she used to drive the old retriever in harness on the lawn covered with acorns and the dead leaves and the wind still blowing them off the treesin her brown velvetthat was a ducky dress who was it had called her once a wise little owl in that dress and suddenly her heart sank the pain was coming again wintons voice from the door said  well my pet  it was only to see how you are im all right what sort of a day is it youll go riding wont you give my love to the horses goodbye dad just for now  her forehead was wet to his lips  outside in the passage her smile like something actual on the air preceded himthe smile that had just lasted out but when he was back in the study he sufferedsuffered why could he not have that pain to bear instead  the crunch of the brougham brought his ceaseless march over the carpet to an end he went out into the hall and looked into the doctors facehe had forgotten that this old fellow knew nothing of his special reason for deadly fear then he turned back into his study the wild south wind brought wet driftleaves whirling against the panes it was here that he had stood looking out into the dark when fiorsen came down to ask for gyp a year ago why had he not bundled the fellow out neck and crop and taken her awayindia japananywhere would have done she had not loved that fiddler never really loved him monstrousmonstrous the full bitterness of having missed right action swept over winton and he positively groaned aloud he moved from the window and went over to the bookcase there in one row were the few books he ever read and he took one out life of general lee he put it back and took another a novel of whyte melvilles good for nothing sad booksad ending the book dropped from his hand and fell with a flump on the floor in a sort of icy discovery he had seen his life as it would be if for a second time he had to bear such loss she must notcould not die if she didthen for him in old times they buried a man with his horse and his dog as if at the end of a good run there was always that the extremity of this thought brought relief he sat down and for a long time stayed staring into the fire in a sort of coma then his feverish fears began again why the devil didnt they come and tell him something anythingrather than this silence this deadly solitude and waiting what was that the front door shutting wheels had that hellhound of an old doctor sneaked off he started up there at the door was markey holding in his hand some cards winton scanned them  lady summerhay mr bryan summerhay i said not at home sir  winton nodded  well  nothing at present you have had no lunch sir  what time is it  four oclock  bring in my fur coat and the port and make the fire up i want any news there is  markey nodded  odd to sit in a fur coat before a fire and the day not cold they said you lived on after death he had never been able to feel that she was living on she lived in gyp and now if gyp deathyour ownno great matter butfor her the wind was dropping with the darkness he got up and drew the curtains  it was seven oclock when the doctor came down into the hall and stood rubbing his freshly washed hands before opening the study door winton was still sitting before the fire motionless shrunk into his fur coat he raised himself a little and looked round dully  the doctors face puckered his eyelids drooped halfway across his bulging eyes it was his way of smiling nicely he said nicelya girl no complications  wintons whole body seemed to swell his lips opened he raised his hand then the habit of a lifetime catching him by the throat he stayed motionless at last he got up and said  glass of port doctor  the doctor spying at him above the glass thought this is the fiftytwo give me the sixtyeightmore body  after a time winton went upstairs waiting in the outer room he had a return of his cold dread perfectly successfulthe patient died from exhaustion the tiny squawking noise that fell on his ears entirely failed to reassure him he cared nothing for that new being suddenly he found betty just behind him her bosom heaving horribly  what is it woman dont  she had leaned against his shoulder appearing to have lost all sense of right and wrong and out of her sobbing gurgled  she looks so lovelyoh dear she looks so lovely  pushing her abruptly from him winton peered in through the justopened door gyp was lying extremely still and very white her eyes very large very dark were fastened on her baby her face wore a kind of wonder she did not see winton who stood stonequiet watching while the nurse moved about her business behind a screen this was the first time in his life that he had seen a mother with her justborn baby that look on her facegone right away somewhere right awayamazed him she had never seemed to like children had said she did not want a child she turned her head and saw him he went in she made a faint motion toward the baby and her eyes smiled winton looked at that swaddled speckled mite then bending down he kissed her hand and tiptoed away  at dinner he drank champagne and benevolence towards all the world spread in his being watching the smoke of his cigar wreathe about him he thought must send that chap a wire after all he was a fellow beingmight be suffering as he himself had suffered only two hours ago to keep him in ignoranceit wouldnt do and he wrote out the form        all well a daughterwinton   and sent it out with the order that a groom should take it in that night  gyp was sleeping when he stole up at ten oclock  he too turned in and slept like a child   xi   returning the next afternoon from the first ride for several days winton passed the station fly rolling away from the drivegate with the lighthearted disillusionment peculiar to quite empty vehicles  the sight of a fur coat and broadbrimmed hat in the hall warned him of what had happened  mr fiorsen sir gone up to mrs fiorsen  natural but a dd bore and bad perhaps for gyp he asked  did he bring things  a bag sir  get a room ready then  to dine teteatete with that fellow  gyp had passed the strangest morning in her life so far her baby fascinated her also the tug of its lips giving her the queerest sensation almost sensual a sort of meltedness an infinite warmth a desire to grip the little creature right into herwhich of course one must not do and yet neither her sense of humour nor her sense of beauty were deceived it was a queer little affair with a tuft of black hair in grace greatly inferior to a kitten its tiny pink crisped fingers with their infinitesimal nails its microscopic curly toes and solemn black eyeswhen they showed its inimitable stillness when it slept its incredible vigour when it fed were all as it were miraculous withal she had a feeling of gratitude to one that had not killed nor even hurt her so very desperatelygratitude because she had succeeded performed her part of mother perfectlythe nurse had said soshe so distrustful of herself instinctively she knew too that this was her baby not his going to take after her as they called it how it succeeded in giving that impression she could not tell unless it were the passivity and dark eyes of the little creature then from one till three they had slept together with perfect soundness and unanimity she awoke to find the nurse standing by the bed looking as if she wanted to tell her something  someone to see you my dear  and gyp thought he i cant think quickly i ought to think quicklyi want to but i cant her face expressed this for the nurse said at once  i dont think youre quite up to it yet  gyp answered  yes only not for five minutes please  her spirit had been very far away she wanted time to get it back before she saw himtime to know in some sort what she felt now what this mite lying beside her had done for her and him the thought that it was his toothis tiny helpless beingseemed unreal no it was not his he had not wanted it and now that she had been through the torture it was hers not hisnever his the memory of the night when she first yielded to the certainty that the child was coming and he had come home drunk swooped on her and made her shrink and shudder and put her arm round her baby it had not made any difference onlyback came the old accusing thought from which these last days she had been free but i married himi chose to marry him i cant get out of that and she felt as if she must cry out to the nurse keep him away i dont want to see him oh please im tired she bit the words back and presently with a very faint smile said  now im ready  she noticed first what clothes he had onhis newest suit dark grey with little lighter linesshe had chosen it herself that his tie was in a bow not a sailors knot and his hair brighter than usualas always just after being cut and surely the hair was growing down again in front of his ears then gratefully almost with emotion she realized that his lips were quivering his whole face quivering he came in on tiptoe stood looking at her a minute then crossed very swiftly to the bed very swiftly knelt down and taking her hand turned it over and put his face to it the bristles of his moustache tickled her palm his nose flattened itself against her fingers and his lips kept murmuring words into the hand with the moist warm touch of his lips gyp knew he was burying there all his remorse perhaps the excesses he had committed while she had been away from him burying the fears he had felt and the emotion at seeing her so white and still she felt that in a minute he would raise a quite different face and it flashed through her if i loved him i wouldnt mind what he didever why dont i love him theres something loveable why dont i  he did raise his face his eyes lighted on the baby and he grinned  look at this he said is it possible oh my gyp what a funny one oh oh oh he went off into an ecstasy of smothered laughter then his face grew grave and slowly puckered into a sort of comic disgust gyp too had seen the humours of her baby of its queer little reddish pudge of a face of its twentyseven black hairs and the dribble at its almost invisible mouth but she had also seen it as a miracle she had felt it and there surged up from her all the old revolt and more against his lack of consideration it was not a funny oneher baby it was not ugly or if it were she was not fit to be told of it her arm tightened round the warm bundled thing against her fiorsen put his finger out and touched its cheek  it is realso it is mademoiselle fiorsen tk tk  the baby stirred and gyp thought if i loved i wouldnt even mind his laughing at my baby it would be different  dont wake her she whispered she felt his eyes on her knew that his interest in the baby had ceased as suddenly as it came that he was thinking how long before i have you in my arms again he touched her hair and suddenly she had a fainting sinking sensation that she had never yet known when she opened her eyes again the economic agent was holding something beneath her nose and making sounds that seemed to be the words well i am a dd fool repeatedly expressed fiorsen was gone  seeing gyps eyes once more open the nurse withdrew the ammonia replaced the baby and saying now go to sleep withdrew behind the screen like all robust personalities she visited on others her vexations with herself but gyp did not go to sleep she gazed now at her sleeping baby now at the pattern of the wallpaper trying mechanically to find the bird caught at intervals amongst its brownandgreen foliageone bird in each alternate square of the pattern so that there was always a bird in the centre of four other birds and the bird was of green and yellow with a red beak   on being turned out of the nursery with the assurance that it was all rightonly a little faint fiorsen went downstairs disconsolate the atmosphere of this dark house where he was a stranger an unwelcome stranger was insupportable he wanted nothing in it but gyp and gyp had fainted at his touch no wonder he felt miserable he opened a door what room was this a piano the drawingroom ugh no firewhat misery he recoiled to the doorway and stood listening not a sound grey light in the cheerless room almost dark already in the hall behind him what a life these english livedworse than the winter in his old country home in sweden where at all events they kept good fires and suddenly all his being revolted stay here and face that fatherand that image of a servant stay here for a night of this gyp was not his gyp lying there with that baby beside her in this hostile house smothering his footsteps he made for the outer hall there were his coat and hat he put them on his bag he could not see it no matter they could send it after him he would write to hersay that her fainting had upset himthat he could not risk making her faint againcould not stay in the house so near her yet so far she would understand and there came over him a sudden wave of longing gyp he wanted her to be with her to look at her and kiss her and feel her his own again and opening the door he passed out on to the drive and strode away miserable and sick at heart all the way to the station through the darkening lanes and in the railway carriage going up he felt that aching wretchedness only in the lighted street driving back to roseks did he shake it off a little at dinner and after drinking that special brandy he nearly lost it but it came back when he went to bed till sleep relieved him with its darkness and dreams   xii   gyps recovery proceeded at first with a sure rapidity which delighted winton as the economic agent pointed out she was beautifully made and that had a lot to do with it  before christmas day she was already out and on christmas morning the old doctor by way of present pronounced her fit and ready to go home when she liked that afternoon she was not so well and next day back again upstairs nothing seemed definitely wrong only a sort of desperate lassitude as if the knowledge that to go back was within her power only needing her decision had been too much for her and since no one knew her inward feelings all were puzzled except winton the nursing of her child was promptly stopped  it was not till the middle of january that she said to him  i must go home dad  the word home hurt him and he only answered  very well gyp when  the house is quite ready i think i had better go tomorrow hes still at roseks i wont let him know two or three days there by myself first would be better for settling baby in  very well ill take you up  he made no effort to ascertain her feelings toward fiorsen he knew too well  they travelled next day reaching london at halfpast two betty had gone up in the early morning to prepare the way the dogs had been with aunt rosamund all this time gyp missed their greeting but the installation of betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be the nursery absorbed all her first energies light was just beginning to fail when still in her fur she took a key of the musicroom and crossed the garden to see how all had fared during her ten weeks absence what a wintry garden how different from that languorous warm moonlit night when daphne wing had come dancing out of the shadow of the dark trees how bare and sharp the boughs against the grey darkening skyand not a song of any bird not a flower she glanced back at the house cold and white it looked but there were lights in her room and in the nursery and someone just drawing the curtains now that the leaves were off one could see the other houses of the road each different in shape and colour as is the habit of london houses it was cold frosty gyp hurried down the path four little icicles had formed beneath the window of the musicroom they caught her eye and passing round to the side she broke one off there must be a fire in there for she could see the flicker through the curtains not quite drawn thoughtful ellen had been airing it but suddenly she stood still there was more than a fire in there through the chink in the drawn curtains she had seen two figures seated on the divan something seemed to spin round in her head she turned to rush away then a kind of superhuman coolness came to her and she deliberately looked in he and daphne wing his arm was round her neck the girls face riveted her eyes it was turned a little back and up gazing at him the lips parted the eyes hypnotized adoring and her arm round him seemed to shiverwith cold with ecstasy  again that something went spinning through gyps head she raised her hand for a second it hovered close to the glass then with a sick feeling she dropped it and turned away  never never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her never they were safe from any scene she would makesafe in their nest and blindly across the frosty grass through the unlighted drawingroom she went upstairs to her room locked the door and sat down before the fire pride raged within her she stuffed her handkerchief between her teeth and lips she did it unconsciously her eyes felt scorched from the fireflames but she did not trouble to hold her hand before them  suddenly she thought suppose i had loved him and laughed the handkerchief dropped to her lap and she looked at it with wonderit was bloodstained she drew back in the chair away from the scorching of the fire and sat quite still a smile on her lips that girls eyes like a little adoring dogsthat girl who had fawned on her so she had got her distinguished man she sprang up and looked at herself in the glass shuddered turned her back on herself and sat down again in her own house why not herein this room why not before her eyes not yet a year married it was almost funnyalmost funny and she had her first calm thought i am free  but it did not seem to mean anything had no value to a spirit so bitterly stricken in its pride she moved her chair closer to the fire again why had she not tapped on the window to have seen that girls face ashy with fright to have seen himcaughtcaught in the room she had made beautiful for him the room where she had played for him so many hours the room that was part of the house that she paid for how long had they used it for their meetingssneaking in by that door from the back lane perhaps even before she went awayto bear his child and there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of outragea spiritual tugofwar so deep that it was dumb unconsciousto decide whether her baby would be all hers or would have slipped away from her heart and be a thing almost abhorrent  she huddled nearer the fire feeling cold and physically sick and suddenly the thought came to her if i dont let the servants know im here they might go out and see what i saw had she shut the drawingroom window when she returned so blindly perhaps already in a fever she rang the bell and unlocked the door the maid came up  please shut the drawingroom window ellen and tell betty im afraid i got a little chill travelling im going to bed ask her if she can manage with baby and she looked straight into the girls face it wore an expression of concern even of commiseration but not that fluttered look which must have been there if she had known  yes mm ill get you a hotwater bottle mm would you like a hot bath and a cup of hot tea at once  gyp nodded anythinganything and when the maid was gone she thought mechanically a cup of hot tea how quaint what should it be but hot  the maid came back with the tea she was an affectionate girl full of that admiring love servants and dogs always felt for gyp imbued too with the instinctive partisanship which stores itself one way or the other in the hearts of those who live in houses where the atmosphere lacks unity to her mind the mistress was much too good for hima foreignerand such abits mannershe hadnt any and no good would come of it not if you took her opinion  and ive turned the water in mm will you have a little mustard in it  again gyp nodded and the girl going downstairs for the mustard told cook there was that about the mistress that makes you quite pathetic the cook who was fingering her concertina for which she had a passion answered  she ides up her feelins same as they all does thank eaven she havent got that drawl though that er old aunt asalways makes me feel to want to say buck up old dear you aint alf so precious as all that  and when the maid ellen had taken the mustard and gone she drew out her concertina to its full length and with cautionary softness began to practise home sweet home  to gyp lying in her hot bath those muffled strains just mounted not quite as a tune rather as some faraway humming of large flies the heat of the water the pungent smell of the mustard and that droning hum slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling she looked at her body silverwhite in the yellowish water with a dreamy sensation some day she too would love strange feeling she had never had before strange indeed that it should come at such a moment breaking through the old instinctive shrinking yes some day love would come to her there floated before her brain the adoring look on daphne wings face the shiver that had passed along her arm and pitifulness crept into her hearta halfbitter halfadmiring pitifulness why should she grudgeshe who did not love the sounds like the humming of large flies grew deeper more vibrating it was the cook in her passion swelling out her music on the phrase        be it neever so humble       theres noo place like home    xiii   that night gyp slept peacefully as though nothing had happened as though there were no future at all before her she woke into misery her pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered would force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life but the struggle between motherinstinct and revolt was still going on within her she was really afraid to see her baby and she sent word to betty that she thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the afternoon  she got up at noon and stole downstairs she had not realized how violent was her struggle over his child till she was passing the door of the room where it was lying if she had not been ordered to give up nursing that struggle would never have come her heart ached but a demon pressed her on and past the door downstairs she just pottered round dusting her china putting in order the books which after housecleaning the maid had arranged almost too carefully so that the first volumes of dickens and thackeray followed each other on the top shell and the second volumes followed each other on the bottom shelf and all the time she thought dully why am i doing this what do i care how the place looks it is not my home it can never be my home  for lunch she drank some beef tea keeping up the fiction of her indisposition after that she sat down at her bureau to write something must be decided there she sat her forehead on her hand and nothing camenot one wordnot even the way to address him just the date and that was all at a ring of the bell she started up she could not see anybody but the maid only brought a note from aunt rosamund and the dogs who fell frantically on their mistress and instantly began to fight for her possession she went on her knees to separate them and enjoin peace and goodwill and their little avid tongues furiously licked her cheeks under the eager touch of those wet tongues the band round her brain and heart gave way she was overwhelmed with longing for her baby nearly a day since she had seen herwas it possible nearly a day without sight of those solemn eyes and crinkled toes and fingers and followed by the dogs she went upstairs  the house was invisible from the musicroom and spurred on by thought that until fiorsen knew she was back those two might be there in each others arms any moment of the day or night gyp wrote that evening   dear gustavwe are backgyp   what else in the world could she say he would not get it till he woke about eleven with the instinct to take all the respite she could and knowing no more than before how she would receive his return she went out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and trying not to think returning at teatime she went straight up to her baby and there heard from betty that he had come and gone out with his violin to the musicroom  bent over the child gyp needed all her selfcontrolbut her selfcontrol was becoming great soon the girl would come fluttering down that dark narrow lane perhaps at this very minute her fingers were tapping at the door and he was opening it to murmur no shes back ah then the girl would shrink the rapid whisperingsome other meetingplace lips to lips and that look on the girls face till she hurried away from the shut door in the darkness disappointed and he on that silverandgold divan gnawing his moustache his eyescatlikestaring at the fire and then perhaps from his violin would come one of those swaying bursts of sound with tears in them and the wind in them that had of old bewitched her she said  open the window just a little betty dearits hot  there it was rising falling music why did it so move one even when as now it was the voice of insult and suddenly she thought he will expect me to go out there again and play for him but i will not never  she put her baby down went into her bedroom and changed hastily into a teagown for the evening ready to go downstairs a little shepherdess in china on the mantelshelf attracted her attention and she took it in her hand she had bought it three and more years ago when she first came to london at the beginning of that time of girlgaiety when all life seemed a long cotillion and she its leader its cool daintiness made it seem the symbol of another world a world without depths or shadows a world that did not feela happy world  she had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawingroom window she got up from the teatable to let him in why do faces gazing in through glass from darkness always look hungrysearching appealing for what you have and they have not and while she was undoing the latch she thought what am i going to say i feel nothing the ardour of his gaze voice hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic even more comically false his look of disappointment when she said  please take care im still brittle then she sat down again and asked  will you have some tea  tea i have you back and you ask me if i will have tea gyp do you know what i have felt like all this time no you dont know you know nothing of medo you  a smile of sheer irony formed on her lipswithout her knowing it was there she said  have you had a good time at count roseks and without her will against her will the words slipped out im afraid youve missed the musicroom  his stare wavered he began to walk up and down  missed missed everything i have been very miserable gyp youve no idea how miserable yes miserable miserable miserable with each repetition of that word his voice grew gayer and kneeling down in front of her he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind her waist ah my gyp i shall be a different being now  and gyp went on smiling between that and stabbing these false raptures to the heart there seemed to be nothing she could do the moment his hands relaxed she got up and said  you know theres a baby in the house  he laughed  ah the baby id forgotten lets go up and see it  gyp answered  you go  she could feel him thinking perhaps it will make her nice to me he turned suddenly and went  she stood with her eyes shut seeing the divan in the musicroom and the girls arm shivering then going to the piano she began with all her might to play a chopin polonaise  that evening they dined out and went to the tales of hoffmann by such devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to do during the drive home in the dark cab she shrank away into her corner pretending that his arm would hurt her dress her exasperated nerves were already overstrung twice she was on the very point of crying out i am not daphne wing but each time pride strangled the words in her throat and yet they would have to come what other reason could she find to keep him from her room  but when in her mirror she saw him standing behind herhe had crept into the bedroom like a catfierceness came into her she could see the blood rush up in her own white face and turning round she said  no gustav go out to the musicroom if you want a companion  he recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly and gyp turning back to her mirror went on quietly taking the pins out of her hair for fully a minute she could see him leaning there moving his head and hands as though in pain then to her surprise he went and a vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance she lay awake a long time watching the fireglow brighten and darken on the ceiling tunes from the tales of hoffmann running in her head thoughts and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain falling asleep at last she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand and one of them was daphne wing she woke with a start the fire still burned and by its light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed just as he had on their weddingnightthe same hungry yearning in his face and an arm outstretched before she could speak he began  oh gyp you dont understand all that is nothingit is only you i wantalways i am a fool who cannot control himself think its a long time since you went away from me  gyp said in a hard voice  i didnt want to have a child  he said quickly  no but now you have it you are glad dont be unmerciful my gyp it is like you to be merciful that girlit is all overi sweari promise  his hand touched her foot through the soft eiderdown gyp thought why does he come and whine to me like this he has no dignitynone and she said  how can you promise you have made the girl love you i saw her face  he drew his hand back  you saw her  yes  he was silent staring at her presently he began again  she is a little fool i do not care for the whole of her as much as i care for your one finger what does it matter what one does in that way if one does not care the soul not the body is faithful a man satisfies appetiteit is nothing  gyp said  perhaps not but it is something when it makes others miserable  has it made you miserable my gyp  his voice had a ring of hope she answered startled  i noher  her ho it is an experience for herit is life it will do her no harm  no nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure  at that bitter retort he kept silence a long time now and then heaving a long sigh his words kept sounding in her heart the soul not the body is faithful was he after all more faithful to her than she had ever been could ever bewho did not love had never loved him what right had she to talk who had married him out of vanity out ofwhat  and suddenly he said  gyp forgive  she uttered a sigh and turned away her face  he bent down against the eiderdown she could hear him drawing long sobbing breaths and in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness a sort of pity stirred her what did it matter she said in a choked voice  very well i forgive   xiv   the human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things gyp never really believed that daphne wing was of the past her sceptical instinct told her that what fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very different from what he would do under stress of opportunity carefully put within his reach  since her return rosek had begun to come again very careful not to repeat his mistake but not deceiving her at all though his selfcontrol was as great as fiorsens was small she felt he had not given up his pursuit of her and would take very good care that daphne wing was afforded every chance of being with her husband but pride never let her allude to the girl besides what good to speak of her they would both lierosek because he obviously saw the mistaken line of his first attack fiorsen because his temperament did not permit him to suffer by speaking the truth  having set herself to endure she found she must live in the moment never think of the future never think much of anything fortunately nothing so conduces to vacuity as a baby she gave herself up to it with desperation it was a good baby silent somewhat understanding in watching its face and feeling it warm against her gyp succeeded daily in getting away into the hypnotic state of mothers and cows that chew the cud but the baby slept a great deal and much of its time was claimed by betty those hours and they were many gyp found difficult she had lost interest in dress and household elegance keeping just enough to satisfy her fastidiousness money too was scarce under the drain of fiorsens irregular requirements if she read she began almost at once to brood she was cut off from the musicroom had not crossed its threshold since her discovery aunt rosamunds efforts to take her into society were fruitlessall the effervescence was out of that and though her father came he never stayed long for fear of meeting fiorsen in this condition of affairs she turned more and more to her own music and one morning after she had come across some compositions of her girlhood she made a resolution that afternoon she dressed herself with pleasure for the first time for months and sallied forth into the february frost  monsieur edouard harmost inhabited the ground floor of a house in the marylebone road he received his pupils in a large back room overlooking a little sooty garden a walloon by extraction and of great vitality he grew old with difficulty having a soft corner in his heart for women and a passion for novelty even for new music that was unappeasable any fresh discovery would bring a tear rolling down his mahogany cheeks into his clipped grey beard the while he played singing wheezily to elucidate the wondrous novelty or moved his head up and down as if pumping  when gyp was shown into this wellremembered room he was seated his yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair grieving over a pupil who had just gone out he did not immediately rise but stared hard at gyp  ah he said at last my little old friend she has come back now that is good and patting her hand he looked into her face which had a warmth and brilliance rare to her in these days then making for the mantelpiece he took therefrom a bunch of parma violets evidently brought by his last pupil and thrust them under her nose take them take themthey were meant for me nowhow much have you forgotten come and seizing her by the elbow he almost forced her to the piano take off your furs sit down  and while gyp was taking off her coat he fixed on her his prominent brown eyes that rolled easily in their slightly bloodshot whites under squared eyelids and cliffs of brow she had on what fiorsen called her hummingbird blousedark blue shot with peacock and old rose and looked very warm and soft under her fur cap monsieur harmosts stare seemed to drink her in yet that stare was not unpleasant having in it only the rather sad yearning of old men who love beauty and know that their time for seeing it is getting short  play me the carnival he said we shall soon see  gyp played twice he nodded once he tapped his fingers on his teeth and showed her the whites of his eyeswhich meant that will have to be very different and once he grunted when she had finished he sat down beside her took her hand in his and examining the fingers began  yes yes soon again spoiling yourself playing for that fiddler trop sympathique the backbone the backbonewe shall improve that now four hours a day for six weeksand we shall have something again  gyp said softly  i have a baby monsieur harmost  monsieur harmost bounded  what that is a tragedy gyp shook her head you like it a baby does it not squall  very little  mon dieu well well you are still as beautiful as ever that is something now what can you do with this baby could you get rid of it a little this is serious this is a talent in danger a fiddler and a baby cest beaucoup cest trop  gyp smiled and monsieur harmost whose exterior covered much sensibility stroked her hand  you have grown up my little friend he said gravely never mind nothing is wasted but a baby and he chirruped his lips well courage we shall do things yet  gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips the scent of latakia tobacco that had soaked into things and of old books and music a dark smell like monsieur harmosts complexion the old brown curtains the sooty little back garden beyond with its catruns and its one stunted sumach tree the darkbrown stare of monsieur harmosts rolling eyes brought back that time of happiness when she used to come week after week full of gaiety and importance and chatter away basking in his brusque admiration and in music all with the glamourous feeling that she was making him happy and herself happy and going to play very finely some day  the voice of monsieur harmost softly gruff as if he knew what she was feeling increased her emotion her breast heaved under the hummingbird blouse water came into her eyes and more than ever her lips quivered he was saying  come come the only thing we cannot cure is age you were right to come my child music is your proper air if things are not all what they ought to be you shall soon forget in musicin music we can get away after all my little friend they cannot take our dreams from usnot even a wife not even a husband can do that come we shall have good times yet  and gyp with a violent effort threw off that sudden weakness from those who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour she left monsieur harmost that afternoon infected by his passion for music poetic justiceon which all homeopathy is foundedwas at work to try and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it to music she now gave all the hours she could spare she went to him twice a week determining to get on but uneasy at the expense for monetary conditions were ever more embarrassed at home she practised steadily and worked hard at composition she finished several songs and studies during the spring and summer and left still more unfinished monsieur harmost was tolerant of these efforts seeming to know that harsh criticism or disapproval would cut her impulse down as frost cuts the life of flowers besides there was always something fresh and individual in her things he asked her one day  what does your husband think of these  gyp was silent a moment  i dont show them to him  she never had she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she composed dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself frail enough plant already the only person besides her master to whom she confided her efforts wasstrangely enoughrosek but he had surprised her one day copying out some music and said at once i knew i was certain you composed ah do play it to me i am sure you have talent the warmth with which he praised that little caprice was surely genuine and she felt so grateful that she even played him others and then a song for him to sing from that day he no longer seemed to her odious she even began to have for him a certain friendliness to be a little sorry watching him pale trim and sphinxlike in her drawingroom or garden getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his desire he had never again made love to her but she knew that at the least sign he would his face and his invincible patience made him pathetic to her women such as gyp cannot actively dislike those who admire them greatly she consulted him about fiorsens debts there were hundreds of pounds owing it seemed and in addition much to rosek himself the thought of these debts weighed unbearably on her why did he how did he get into debt like this what became of the money he earned his fees this summer were good enough there was such a feeling of degradation about debt it was somehow so underbred to owe money to all sorts of people was it on that girl on other women that he spent it all or was it simply that his nature had holes in every pocket  watching fiorsen closely that spring and early summer she was conscious of a change a sort of loosening something in him had given wayas when in winding a watch the key turns on and on the ratchet being broken yet he was certainly working hardperhaps harder than ever she would hear him across the garden going over and over a passage as if he never would be satisfied but his playing seemed to her to have lost its fire and sweep to be stale and as if disillusioned it was all as though he had said to himself whats the use in his face too there was a change she knewshe was certain that he was drinking secretly was it his failure with her was it the girl was it simply heredity from a harddrinking ancestry  gyp never faced these questions to face them would mean useless discussion useless admission that she could not love him useless asseveration from him about the girl which she would not believe useless denials of all sorts hopeless  he was very irritable and seemed especially to resent her music lessons alluding to them with a sort of sneering impatience she felt that he despised them as amateurish and secretly resented it he was often impatient too of the time she gave to the baby his own conduct with the little creature was like all the rest of him he would go to the nursery much to bettys alarm and take up the baby be charming with it for about ten minutes then suddenly dump it back into its cradle stare at it gloomily or utter a laugh and go out sometimes he would come up when gyp was there and after watching her a little in silence almost drag her away  suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him and ever more and more from her sense that instead of saving him she was as it were pushing him downhillironical nemesis for vanitygyp was ever more and more compliant to his whims trying to make up but this compliance when all the time she felt further and further away was straining her to breakingpoint hers was a nature that goes on passively enduring till something snaps after thatno more  those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought when moisture gathers far away coming nearer nearer till at last the deluge bursts and sweeps the garden   xv   the tenth of july that year was as the first day of summer there had been much fine weather but always easterly or northerly now after a broken rainy fortnight the sun had come in full summer warmth with a gentle breeze drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom in the garden under the trees at the far end betty sewed at a garment and the baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep gyp stood before a bed of pansies and sweet peas how monkeyish the pansies faces the sweet peas too were like tiny bright birds fastened to green perches swaying with the wind and their little green tridents growing out from the queer flat stems resembled the antennae of insects each of these bright frail growing things had life and individuality like herself  the sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn rosek was coming from the drawingroom window rather startled gyp looked at him over her shoulder what had brought him at eleven oclock in the morning he came up to her bowed and said  i came to see gustav hes not up yet it seems i thought i would speak to you first can we talk  hesitating just a second gyp drew off her gardeninggloves  of course here or in the drawingroom  rosek answered  in the drawingroom please  a faint tremor passed through her but she led the way and seated herself where she could see betty and the baby rosek stood looking down at her his stillness the sweetish gravity of his wellcut lips his spotless dandyism stirred in gyp a kind of unwilling admiration  what is it she said  bad business im afraid something must be done at once i have been trying to arrange things but they will not wait they are even threatening to sell up this house  with a sense of outrage gyp cried  nearly everything here is mine  rosek shook his head  the lease is in his nameyou are his wife they can do it i assure you a sort of shadow passed over his face and he added i cannot help him any morejust now  gyp shook her head quickly  noof course you ought not to have helped him at all i cant bear he bowed and she stopped ashamed how much does he owe altogether  about thirteen hundred pounds it isnt much of course but there is something else  worse  rosek nodded  i am afraid to tell you you will think again perhaps that i am trying to make capital out of it i can read your thoughts you see i cannot afford that you should think that this time  gyp made a little movement as though putting away his words  no tell me please  rosek shrugged his shoulders  there is a man called wagge an undertakerthe father of someone you know  daphne wing  yes a child is coming they have made her tell it means the cancelling of her engagements of courseand other things  gyp uttered a little laugh then she said slowly  can you tell me please what this mrwagge can do  again rosek shrugged his shoulders  he is rabida rabid man of his class is dangerous a lot of money will be wanted i should thinksome blood perhaps  he moved swiftly to her and said very low  gyp it is a year since i told you of this you did not believe me then i told you too that i loved you i love you more now a hundred times dont move i am going up to gustav  he turned and gyp thought he was really going but he stopped and came back past the line of the window the expression of his face was quite changed so hungry that for a moment she felt sorry for him and that must have shown in her face for he suddenly caught at her and tried to kiss her lips she wrenched back and he could only reach her throat but that he kissed furiously letting her go as suddenly he bent his head and went out without a look  gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand dumbly mechanically thinking what have i done to be treated like this what have i done no answer came and such rage against men flared up that she just stood there twisting her gardengloves in her hands and biting the lips he would have kissed then going to her bureau she took up her address book and looked for the name wing 88 frankland street fulham unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair she put her chequebook into it then taking care to make no sound she passed into the hall caught up her sunshade and went out closing the door without noise  she walked quickly toward baker street her gardeninghat was right enough but she had come out without gloves and must go into the first shop and buy a pair in the choosing of them she forgot her emotions for a minute out in the street again they came back as bitterly as ever and the day was so beautifulthe sun bright the sky blue the clouds dazzling white from the top of her bus she could see all its brilliance there rose up before her the memory of the man who had kissed her arm at the first ball and nowthis but mixed with her rage a sort of unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for that girl that silly sugarplum girl brought to such a pass byher husband these feelings sustained her through that voyage to fulham she got down at the nearest corner walked up a widish street of narrow grey houses till she came to number eightyeight on that newly scrubbed step waiting for the door to open she very nearly turned and fled what exactly had she come to do  the door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock mutton the smell of muttonthere it was just as the girl had said  is missmiss daphne wing at home  in that peculiar ive given it up voice of domestics in small households the servant answered  yes miss diseys in dyou want to see er what nyme  gyp produced her card the maid looked at it at gyp and at two brownpainted doors as much as to say where will you have it then opening the first of them she said  tyke a seat please ill fetch her  gyp went in in the middle of what was clearly the diningroom she tried to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea the table against which her hand rested was covered with red baize no doubt to keep the stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood on the mahogany sideboard reposed a cruetstand and a green dish of very red apples a bambooframed talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood before a fireplace filled with pampasgrass dyed red the chairs were of red morocco the curtains a brownishred the walls green and on them hung a set of landseer prints the peculiar sensation which red and green in juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to gyps distress and suddenly her eyes lighted on a little deepblue china bowl it stood on a black stand on the mantelpiece with nothing in it to gyp in this room of red and green with the smell of mutton creeping in that bowl was like the crystallized whiff of another world daphne wingnot daisy waggehad surely put it there and somehow it touched heremblem of stifled beauty emblem of all that the girl had tried to pour out to her that august afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago thin eastern china good and really beautiful a wonder they allowed it to pollute this room  a sigh made her turn round with her back against the door and a white scared face the girl was standing gyp thought she has suffered horribly and going impulsively up to her she held out her hand  daphne wing sighed out oh mrs fiorsen and bending over that hand kissed it gyp saw that her new glove was wet then the girl relapsed her feet a little forward her head a little forward her back against the door gyp who knew why she stood thus was swept again by those two emotionsrage against men and fellow feeling for one about to go through what she herself had just endured  its all right she said gently only whats to be done  daphne wing put her hands up over her white face and sobbed she sobbed so quietly but so terribly deeply that gyp herself had the utmost difficulty not to cry it was the sobbing of real despair by a creature bereft of hope and strength above all of lovethe sort of weeping which is drawn from desolate suffering souls only by the touch of fellow feeling and instead of making gyp glad or satisfying her sense of justice it filled her with more rage against her husbandthat he had taken this girls infatuation for his pleasure and then thrown her away she seemed to see him discarding that clinging dovefair girl for cloying his senses and getting on his nerves discarding her with caustic words to abide alone the consequences of her infatuation she put her hand timidly on that shaking shoulder and stroked it for a moment the sobbing stopped and the girl said brokenly  oh mrs fiorsen i do love him so at those naive words a painful wish to laugh seized on gyp making her shiver from head to foot daphne wing saw it and went on i knowi knowits awful but i doand now hehe her quiet but really dreadful sobbing broke out again and again gyp began stroking and stroking her shoulder and i have been so awful to you oh mrs fiorsen do forgive me please  all gyp could find to answer was  yes yes thats nothing dont crydont cry  very slowly the sobbing died away till it was just a long shivering but still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down gyp felt paralyzed the unhappy girl the red and green room the smell of muttoncreeping  at last a little of that white face showed the lips no longer craving for sugarplums murmured  its you hehereally loves all the time and you dont love himthats whats so funnyandandi cant understand it oh mrs fiorsen if i could see himjust see him he told me never to come again and i havent dared i havent seen him for three weeksnot since i told him about it what shall i do what shall i do  his being her own husband seemed as nothing to gyp at that moment she felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to crawl back to a man who had spurned her unconsciously she had drawn herself up and pressed her lips together the girl who followed every movement said piteously  i dont seem to have any pride i dont mind what he does to me or what he says if only i can see him  gyps revolt yielded to her pity she said  how long before  three months  three monthsand in this state of misery  i think i shall do something desperate now that i cant dance and they know its too awful if i could see him i wouldnt mind anything but i knowi know hell never want me again oh mrs fiorsen i wish i was dead i do  a heavy sigh escaped gyp and bending suddenly she kissed the girls forehead still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair as when she asked whether she ought to love or not as when she came mothlike from the treeshade into the moonlight spun and fluttered with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her gyp turned away feeling that she must relieve the strain and pointing to the bowl said  you put that there im sure its beautiful  the girl answered with piteous eagerness  oh would you like it do take it count rosek gave it me she started away from the door oh thats papa hell be coming in  gyp heard a man clear his throat and the rattle of an umbrella falling into a stand the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the sideboard steadied her then the door opened and mr wagge entered short and thick in black frock coat and trousers and a greyish beard he stared from one to the other he looked what he was an englishman and a chapelgoer nourished on sherry and mutton who could and did make his own way in the world his features coloured as from a deep liverishness were thick like his body and not illnatured except for a sort of anger in his small rather piggy grey eyes he said in a voice permanently gruff but impregnated with a species of professional ingratiation  yees whom ave i  mrs fiorsen  ow the sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly he twisted a chair round and said  take a seat wont you  gyp shook her head  in mr wagges face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more primitive emotion taking out a large blackedged handkerchief he blew his nose passed it freely over his visage and turning to his daughter muttered  go upstairs  the girl turned quickly and the last glimpse of her white face whipped up gyps rage against men when the door was shut mr wagge cleared his throat the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously thick linings  he said more gruffly than ever  may i ask what as given us the honour  i came to see your daughter  his little piggy eyes travelled from her face to her feet to the walls of the room to his own watchchain to his hands that had begun to rub themselves together back to her breast higher than which they dared not mount their infinite embarrassment struck gyp she could almost hear him thinking now how can i discuss it with this attractive young female wife of the scoundrel whos ruined my daughter delicatethats what it is then the words burst hoarsely from him  this is an unpleasant business maam i dont know what to say reelly i dont its awkward its very awkward  gyp said quietly  your daughter is desperately unhappy and that cant be good for her just now  mr wagges thick figure seemed to writhe pardon me maam he spluttered but i must call your husband a scoundrel im sorry to be impolite but i must do it if i had im ere i dont know that i should be able to control myselfi dont indeed gyp made a movement of her gloved hands which he seemed to interpret as sympathy for he went on in a stream of husky utterance its a delicate thing before a lady and she the injured party but one has feelings from the first i said this dancin was in the face of providence but women have no more sense than an egg her mother she would have it and now shes got it career indeed pretty career daughter of mine i tell you maam im angry theres no other word for itim angry if that scoundrel comes within reach of me i shall mark imim not a young man but i shall mark im an what to say to you im sure i dont know that my daughter should beave like that well its made a difference to me an now i suppose her namell be dragged in the mud i tell you frankly i oped you wouldnt hear of it because after all the girls got her punishment and this divorcecourtits not niceits a horrible thing for respectable people and mind you i wont see my girl married to that scoundrel not if you do divorce im no shell have her disgrace for nothing  gyp who had listened with her head a little bent raised it suddenly and said  therell be no public disgrace mr wagge unless you make it yourself if you send daphnedaisyquietly away somewhere till her troubles over no one need know anything  mr wagge whose mouth had opened slightly and whose breathing could certainly have been heard in the street took a step forward and said  do i understand you to say that youre not goin to take proceedings maam  gyp shuddered and shook her head  mr wagge stood silent slightly moving his face up and down  well he said at length its more than she deserves but i dont disguise its a relief to me and i must say in a young lady like you andand handsome it shows a christian spirit again gyp shivered and shook her head it does youll allow me to say so as a man old enough to be your fatherand a regular attendant  he held out his hand gyp put her gloved hand into it  im very very sorry please be nice to her  mr wagge recoiled a little and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing his hands together and looking from side to side  im a domestic man he said suddenly a domestic man in a serious line of life and i never thought to have anything like this in my familynever its beenwell i cant tell you what its been  gyp took up her sunshade she felt that she must get away at any moment he might say something she could not bearand the smell of mutton rising fast  i am sorry she said again goodbye and moved past him to the door she heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it and thought if onlyoh please let him be silent till i get outside mr wagge passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door his little piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly  well he said im very glad to have the privilege of your acquaintance and if i may say so you aveyou ave my earty sympathy goodday  the door once shut behind her gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly away her cheeks were burning and with a craving for protection she put up her sunshade but the girls white face came up again before her and the sound of her words  oh mrs fiorsen i wish i was dead i do   xvi   gyp walked on beneath her sunshade making unconsciously for the peace of trees her mind was a whirl of impressionsdaphne wings figure against the door mr wagges puggy greybearded countenance the red pampasgrass the blue bowl roseks face swooping at her her last glimpse of her baby asleep under the trees  she reached kensington gardens turned into that walk renowned for the beauty of its flowers and the plainness of the people who frequent it and sat down on a bench it was near the luncheonhour nursemaids dogs perambulators old gentlemenall were hurrying a little toward their food they glanced with critical surprise at this pretty young woman leisured and lonely at such an hour trying to find out what was wrong with her as one naturally does with beautybow legs or something for sure to balance a face like that but gyp noticed none of them except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing for months she had resolutely cultivated insensibility resolutely refused to face reality the barrier was forced now and the flood had swept her away proceedings mr wagge had said to those who shrink from letting their secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends the notion of a public exhibition of troubles simply never comes and it had certainly never come to gyp with a bitter smile she thought im better off than she is after all suppose i loved him too no i neverneverwant to love women who love suffer too much  she sat on that bench a long time before it came into her mind that she was due at monsieur harmosts for a music lesson at three oclock it was well past two already and she set out across the grass the summer day was full of murmurings of bees and flies cooings of blissful pigeons the soft swish and stir of leaves and the scent of lime blossom under a sky so blue with few white clouds slow and calm and full why be unhappy and one of those spotty spaniel dogs that have broad heads with frizzy topknots and are always rascals smelt at her frock and moved round and round her hoping that she would throw her sunshade on the water for him to fetch this being in his view the only reason why anything was carried in the hand  she found monsieur harmost fidgeting up and down the room whose opened windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia  ah he said i thought you were not coming you look pale are you not well is it the heat orhe looked hard into her facehas someone hurt you my little friend gyp shook her head ah yes he went on irritably you tell me nothing you tell nobody nothing you close up your pretty face like a flower at night at your age my child one should make confidences a secret grief is to music as the east wind to the stomach put off your mask for once he came close to her tell me your troubles it is a long time since i have been meaning to ask come we are only once young i want to see you happy  but gyp stood looking down would it be relief to pour her soul out would it his brown eyes questioned her like an old dogs she did not want to hurt one so kind and yetimpossible  monsieur harmost suddenly sat down at the piano resting his hands on the keys he looked round at her and said  i am in love with you you know old men can be very much in love but they know it is no goodthat makes them endurable still we like to feel of use to youth and beauty it gives us a little warmth come tell me your grief he waited a moment then said irritably well well we go to music then  it was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner but today he stood as if prepared to be exceptionally severe and gyp played whether from overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch better than she had ever played the chopin polonaise in a flat that song of revolution which had always seemed so unattainable went as if her fingers were being worked for her when she had finished monsieur harmost bending forward lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it she felt the scrub of his little bristly beard and raised her face with a deep sigh of satisfaction a voice behind them said mockingly  bravo  there by the door stood fiorsen  congratulations madame i have long wanted to see you under the inspiration of yourmaster  gyps heart began to beat desperately monsieur harmost had not moved a faint grin slowly settled in his beard but his eyes were startled  fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand  to this old pantaloon you come to give your heart howhat a lover  gyp saw the old man quiver she sprang up and cried  you brute  fiorsen ran forward stretching out his arms toward monsieur harmost as if to take him by the throat  the old man drew himself up monsieur he said you are certainly drunk  gyp slipped between right up to those outstretched hands till she could feel their knuckles against her had he gone mad would he strangle her but her eyes never moved from his and his began to waver his hands dropped and with a kind of moan he made for the door  monsieur harmosts voice behind her said  before you go monsieur give me some explanation of this imbecility  fiorsen spun round shook his fist and went out muttering they heard the front door slam gyp turned abruptly to the window and there in her agitation she noticed little outside things as one does in moments of bewildered anger even into that back yard summer had crept the leaves of the sumachtree were glistening in a threecornered little patch of sunlight a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was basking the voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a side street she was conscious that monsieur harmost was standing very still with a hand pressed to his mouth and she felt a perfect passion of compunction and anger that kind and harmless old manto be so insulted this was indeed the culmination of all gustavs outrages she would never forgive him this for he had insulted her as well beyond what pride or meekness could put up with she turned and running up to the old man put both her hands into his  im so awfully sorry goodbye dear dear monsieur harmost i shall come on friday and before he could stop her she was gone  she dived into the traffic but just as she reached the pavement on the other side felt her dress plucked and saw fiorsen just behind her she shook herself free and walked swiftly on was he going to make a scene in the street again he caught her arm she stopped dead faced round on him and said in an icy voice  please dont make scenes in the street and dont follow me like this if you want to talk to me you canat home  then very calmly she turned and walked on but he was still following her some paces off she did not quicken her steps and to the first taxicab driver that passed she made a sign and saying  bury streetquick got in she saw fiorsen rush forward too late to stop her he threw up his hand and stood still his face deadly white under his broadbrimmed hat she was far too angry and upset to care  from the moment she turned to the window at monsieur harmosts she had determined to go to her fathers she would not go back to fiorsen and the one thought that filled her mind was how to get betty and her baby nearly four dad was almost sure to be at his club and leaning out she said no hyde park corner please  the hall porter who knew her after calling to a pageboy major wintonsharp now came specially out of his box to offer her a seat and the times  gyp sat with it on her knee vaguely taking in her surroundingsa thin old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner a whitecalved footman crossing with a teatray a number of hats on pegs the greenbaize board with its white rows of tapelike paper and three members standing before it one of them a tall stout goodhumouredlooking man in pincenez and a white waistcoat becoming conscious removed his straw hat and took up a position whence without staring he could gaze at her and gyp knew without ever seeming to glance at him that he found her to his liking she saw her fathers unhurried figure passing that little group all of whom were conscious now and eager to get away out of this sanctum of masculinity she met him at the top of the low steps and said  i want to talk to you dad  he gave her a quick look selected his hat and followed to the door in the cab he put his hand on hers and said  now my dear  but all she could get out was  i want to come back to you i cant go on there itsitsive come to an end  his hand pressed hers tightly as if he were trying to save her the need for saying more gyp went on  i must get baby im terrified that hell try to keep her to get me back  is he at home  i dont know i havent told him that im going to leave him  winton looked at his watch and asked  does the baby ever go out as late as this  yes after tea its cooler  ill take this cab on then you stay and get the room ready for her dont worry and dont go out till i return  and gyp thought how wonderful of him not to have asked a single question  the cab stopped at the bury street door she took his hand put it to her cheek and got out he said quietly  do you want the dogs  yesoh yes he doesnt care for them  all right therell be time to get you in some things for the night after i come back i shant run any risks today make mrs markey give you tea  gyp watched the cab gather way again saw him wave his hand then with a deep sigh half anxiety half relief she rang the bell   xvii   when the cab debouched again into st james street winton gave the order quick as you can one could think better going fast a little red had come into his brown cheeks his eyes under their halfdrawn lids had a keener light his lips were tightly closed he looked as he did when a fox was breaking cover gyp could do no wrong or if she could he would stand by her in it as a matter of course but he was going to take no risksmake no frontal attack time for that later if necessary he had better nerves than most people and that kind of steely determination and resource which makes many englishmen of his class formidable in small operations he kept his cab at the door rang and asked for gyp with a kind of pleasure in his ruse  shes not in yet sir mr fiorsens in  ah and baby  yes sir  ill come in and see her in the garden  yes sir  dogs there too  yes sir and will you have tea please sir  no thanks how to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip and yet avoid suspicion of collusion with gyp and he added unless mrs fiorsen comes in  passing out into the garden he became aware that fiorsen was at the diningroom window watching him and decided to make no sign that he knew this the baby was under the trees at the far end and the dogs came rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of him winton went leisurely up to the perambulator and saluting betty looked down at his grandchild she lay under an awning of muslin for fear of flies and was awake her solemn large brown eyes already like gyps regarded him with gravity clucking to her once or twice as is the custom he moved so as to face the house in this position he had betty with her back to it and he said quietly  im here with a message from your mistress betty keep your head dont look round but listen to me shes at bury street and going to stay there she wants you and baby and the dogs the stout womans eyes grew round and her mouth opened winton put his hand on the perambulator steady now go out as usual with this thing its about your time and wait for me at the turning to regents park ill come on in my cab and pick you all up dont get flurried dont take anything do exactly as you usually would understand  it is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to receive such an order without question her colour and the heaving of that billowy bosom made winton add quickly  now betty pull yourself together gyp wants you ill tell you all about it in the cab  the poor woman still heaving vaguely could only stammer  yes sir poor little thing what about its nightthings and miss gyps  conscious of that figure still at the window winton made some passes with his fingers at the baby and said  never mind them as soon as you see me at the drawingroom window get ready and go eyes front betty dont look round ill cover your retreat dont fail gyp now pull yourself together  with a sigh that could have been heard in kensington betty murmured very well sir oh dear and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet with nods as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the baby winton saluted and began his march again towards the house he carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that as if examining the flowers but noted all the same that fiorsen had receded from the window rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he were gone and he placed himself before a rosebush where at that reappearance he could make a sign of recognition sure enough he came and winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the drawingroom window he went quickly into the hall listened a second and opened the diningroom door fiorsen was pacing up and down pale and restless he came to a standstill and stared haggardly at winton who said  how are you gyp not in  no  something in the sound of that no touched winton with a vaguea very vaguecompunction to be left by gyp then his heart hardened again the fellow was a rotterhe was sure of it had always been sure  baby looks well he said  fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again  where is gyp i want her to come in i want her  winton took out his watch  its not late and suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he was playing to get the baby to make gyp safeyes but somehow not this pretence that he knew nothing about it he turned on his heel and walked out it imperilled everything but he couldnt help it he could not stay and go on prevaricating like this had that woman got clear he went back into the drawingroom there they werejust passing the side of the house five minutes and they would be down at the turning he stood at the window waiting if only that fellow did not come in through the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down the diningroom what a long time a minute was three had gone when he heard the diningroom door opened and fiorsen crossing the hall to the front door what was he after standing there as if listening and suddenly he heard him sigh it was just such a sound as many times in the longpast days had escaped himself waiting listening for footsteps in parched and sickening anxiety did this fellow then really lovealmost as he had loved and in revolt at spying on him like this he advanced and said  well i wont wait any longer  fiorsen started he had evidently supposed himself alone and winton thought by jove he does look bad  goodbye he said but the words give my love to gyp perished on their way up to his lips  goodbye fiorsen echoed and winton went out under the trellis conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the halfopened door betty was nowhere in sight she must have reached the turning his mission had succeeded but he felt no elation round the corner he picked up his convoy and with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi journeyed on at speed he had said he would explain in the cab but the only remark he made was  youll all go down to mildenham tomorrow  and betty who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years ago eyed his profile without daring to ask questions before he reached home winton stopped at a postoffice and sent this telegram   gyp and the baby are with me letter followswinton   it salved a conscience on which that fellows figure in the doorway weighed besides it was necessary lest fiorsen should go to the police the rest must wait till he had talked with gyp  there was much to do and it was late before they dined and not till markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk  close to the open windows where markey had placed two hydrangea plantsjust bought on his own responsibility in token of silent satisfactiongyp began she kept nothing back recounting the whole miserable fiasco of her marriage when she came to daphne wing and her discovery in the musicroom she could see the glowing end of her fathers cigar move convulsively that insult to his adored one seemed to winton so inconceivable that for a moment he stopped her recital by getting up to pace the room in her own househer own house andafter that she had gone on with him he came back to his chair and did not interrupt again but his stillness almost frightened her  coming to the incidents of the day itself she hesitated must she tell him too of rosekwas it wise or necessary the allornothing candour that was part of her nature prevailed and she went straight on and save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe winton made no sign when she had finished he got up and slowly extinguished the end of his cigar against the windowsill then looking at her lying back in her chair as if exhausted he said by god and turned his face away to the window  at that hour before the theatres rose a lull brooded in the london streets in this quiet narrow one the towns hum was only broken by the clack of a halfdrunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along for home and the strains of a street musicians fiddle trying to make up for a blank day the sound vaguely irritated winton reminding him of those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated to have them at the point of a sword or pistolto teach them a lesson he heard her say  dad i should like to pay his debts then things would be as they were when i married him  he emitted an exasperated sound he did not believe in heaping coals of fire  i want to make sure too that the girl is all right till shes over her trouble perhaps i could use some of thatthat other money if mine is all tied up  it was sheer anger not disapproval of her impulse that made him hesitate money and revenge would never be associated in his mind gyp went on  i want to feel as if id never let him marry me perhaps his debts are all part of thatwho knows please  winton looked at her how likewhen she said that please how likeher figure sunk back in the old chair and the face lifted in shadow a sort of exultation came to him he had got her backhad got her back   xviii   fiorsens bedroom wasas the maid would remarka proper pigstyuntil he was out of it and it could be renovated each day he had a talent for disorder so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone to bed in it clothes and shoes brushes water tumblers breakfasttray newspapers french novels and cigaretteendsnone were ever where they should have been and the stale fumes from the many cigarettes he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it was to take him tea and shavingwater when on that first real summer day the maid had brought rosek up to him he had been lying a long time on his back dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green sunblinds this hour before he rose was his creative moment when he could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering of late he had been stale and wretched all that side of him dull but this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy that vibrating halfdreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind pierces through to new expression hearing the maids knock and her murmured count rosek to see you sir he thought what the devil does he want a larger nature drifting without control in contact with a smaller one who knows his own mind exactly will instinctively be irritable though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after  and pushing the cigarettebox toward rosek he turned away his head it would be money he had come about orthat girl that girlhe wished she was dead soft clinging creature a baby god what a fool he had beenah what a fool such absurdity unheard of first gypthen her he had tried to shake the girl off as well try to shake off a burr how she clung he had been patientoh yespatient and kind but how go on when one was tiredtired of herand wanting only gyp only his own wife that was a funny thing and now when for an hour or two he had shaken free of worry had been feeling happyyes happythis fellow must come and stand there with his face of a sphinx and he said pettishly  well paul sit down what troubles have you brought  rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down he struck even fiorsen by his unsmiling pallor  you had better look out for mr wagge gustav he came to me yesterday he has no music in his soul  fiorsen sat up  satan take mr wagge what can he do  i am not a lawyer but i imagine he can be unpleasantthe girl is young  fiorsen glared at him and said  why did you throw me that cursed girl  rosek answered a little too steadily  i did not my friend  what you did what was your game you never do anything without a game you know you did come what was your game  you like pleasure i believe  fiorsen said violently  look here i have done with your friendshipyou are no friend to me i have never really known you and i should not wish to it is finished leave me in peace  rosek smiled  my dear that is all very well but friendships are not finished like that moreover you owe me a thousand pounds  well i will pay it roseks eyebrows mounted i will gyp will lend it to me  oh is gyp so fond of you as that i thought she only loved her musiclessons  crouching forward with his knees drawn up fiorsen hissed out  dont talk of gyp get out of this i will pay you your thousand pounds  rosek still smiling answered  gustav dont be a fool with a violin to your shoulder you are a man withoutyou are a child lie quiet my friend and think of mr wagge but you had better come and talk it over with me goodbye for the moment calm yourself and flipping the ash off his cigarette on to the tray by fiorsens elbow he nodded and went  fiorsen who had leaped out of bed put his hand to his head the cursed fellow cursed be every one of themthe father and the girl rosek and all the other sharks he went out on to the landing the house was quite still below rosek had gonegood riddance he called gyp no answer he went into her room its superlative daintiness struck his fancy a scent of cyclamen he looked out into the garden there was the baby at the end and that fat woman no gyp never in when she was wanted wagge he shivered and going back into his bedroom took a brandybottle from a locked cupboard and drank some it steadied him he locked up the cupboard again and dressed  going out to the musicroom he stopped under the trees to make passes with his fingers at the baby sometimes he felt that it was an adorable little creature with its big dark eyes so like gyps sometimes it excited his disgusta discoloured brat this morning while looking at it he thought suddenly of the other that was comingand grimaced catching bettys stare of horrified amazement at the face he was making at her darling he burst into a laugh and turned away into the musicroom  while he was keying up his violin gyps conduct in never having come there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust the girlwho cared about the wretched girl as if she made any real difference it was all so much deeper than that gyp had never loved him never given him what he wanted never quenched his thirst of her that was the heart of it no other woman he had ever had to do with had been like thatkept his thirst unquenched no he had always tired of them before they tired of him she gave him nothing reallynothing had she no heart or did she give it elsewhere what was that paul had said about her musiclessons and suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing absolutely nothing of where she went or what she did she never told him anything musiclessons every day nearly she went out was away for hours the thought that she might go to the arms of another man made him put down his violin with a feeling of actual sickness why not that deep and fearful whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy so truly terrible was at its full in such a nature as fiorsens he drew a long breath and shuddered the remembrance of her fastidious pride her candour above all her passivity cut in across his fear no not gyp  he went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus tumblers and a syphon and pouring out some brandy drank it steadied him and he began to practise he took a passage from brahms violin concerto and began to play it over and over suddenly he found he was repeating the same flaws each time he was not attending the fingering of that thing was ghastly musiclessons why did she take them waste of time and moneyshe would never be anything but an amateur ugh unconsciously he had stopped playing had she gone there today it was past lunchtime perhaps she had come in  he put down his violin and went back to the house no sign of her the maid came to ask if he would lunch no was the mistress to be in she had not said he went into the diningroom ate a biscuit and drank a brandy and soda it steadied him lighting a cigarette he came back to the drawingroom and sat down at gyps bureau how tidy on the little calendar a pencilcross was set against todaywednesday another against friday what for musiclessons he reached to a pigeonhole and took out her addressbook hharmost 305a marylebone road and against it the words in pencil 3 pm  three oclock so that was her hour his eyes rested idly on a little old coloured print of a bacchante with flowing green scarf shaking a tambourine at a naked cupid who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands was gazing up at her he turned it over on the back was written in a pointed scriggly hand to my little friende h fiorsen drew smoke deep down into his lungs expelled it slowly and went to the piano he opened it and began to play staring vacantly before him the cigarette burned nearly to his lips he went on scarcely knowing what he played at last he stopped and sat dejected a great artist often nowadays he did not care if he never touched a violin again tired of standing up before a sea of dull faces seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands one against the other sick of the sameness of it all besidesbesides were his powers beginning to fail what was happening to him of late  he got up went into the diningroom and drank some brandy gyp could not bear his drinking well she shouldnt be out so muchtaking musiclessons musiclessons nearly three oclock if he went for once and saw what she really didwent and offered her his escort home an attention it might please her better anyway than waiting here until she chose to come in with her face all closed up he drank a little more brandyever so littletook his hat and went not far to walk but the sun was hot and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy a maidservant opened the door to him  i am mr fiorsen mrs fiorsen here  yes sir will you wait  why did she look at him like that ugly girl how hateful ugly people were when she was gone he reopened the door of the waitingroom and listened  chopin the polonaise in a flat good could that be gyp very good he moved out down the passage drawn on by her playing and softly turned the handle the music stopped he went in   when winton had left him an hour and a half later that afternoon fiorsen continued to stand at the front door swaying his body to and fro the brandynurtured burst of jealousy which had made him insult his wife and old monsieur harmost had died suddenly when gyp turned on him in the street and spoke in that icy voice since then he had felt fear increasing every minute would she forgive to one who always acted on the impulse of the moment so that he rarely knew afterward exactly what he had done or whom hurt gyps selfcontrol had ever been mysterious and a little frightening where had she gone why did she not come in anxiety is like a ball that rolls downhill gathering momentum suppose she did not come back but she mustthere was the babytheir baby  for the first time the thought of it gave him unalloyed satisfaction he left the door and after drinking a glass to steady him flung himself down on the sofa in the drawingroom and while he lay there the brandy warm within him he thought i will turn over a new leaf give up drink give up everything send the baby into the country take gyp to paris berlin vienna romeanywhere out of this england anywhere away from that father of hers and all these stiff dull folk she will like thatshe loves travelling yes they would be happy delicious nightsdelicious daysair that did not weigh you down and make you feel that you must drinkreal inspirationreal music the acrid woodsmoke scent of paris streets the glistening cleanness of the thiergarten a serenading song in a florence back street fireflies in the summer dusk at sorrentohe had intoxicating memories of them all slowly the warmth of the brandy died away and despite the heat he felt chill and shuddery he shut his eyes thinking to sleep till she came in but very soon he opened them becausea thing usual with him of latehe saw such ugly thingsfaces vivid changing as he looked growing ugly and uglier becoming all holesholeshorrible holescorruptionmatted twisted dark humantreeroots of faces horrible he opened his eyes for when he did that they always went it was very silent no sound from above no sound of the dogs he would go up and see the baby  while he was crossing the hall there came a ring he opened the door himself a telegram he tore the envelope   gyp and the baby are with me letter followswinton   he gave a short laugh shut the door in the boys face and ran upstairs whyheaven knew there was nobody there now nobody did it mean that she had really left himwas not coming back he stopped by the side of gyps bed and flinging himself forward lay across it burying his face and he sobbed as men will unmanned by drink had he lost her never to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them never to soak his senses in her loveliness he leaped up with the tears still wet on his face lost her absurd that calm prim devilish englishman her fatherhe was to blamehe had worked it allstealing the baby  he went downstairs and drank some brandy it steadied him a little what should he do letter follows drink and wait go to bury street no drink enjoy himself  he laughed and catching up his hat went out walking furiously at first then slower and slower for his head began to whirl and taking a cab was driven to a restaurant in soho he had eaten nothing but a biscuit since his breakfast always a small matter and ordered soup and a flask of their best chiantisolids he could not face more than two hours he sat white and silent perspiration on his forehead now and then grinning and flourishing his fingers to the amusement and sometimes the alarm of those sitting near but for being known there he would have been regarded with suspicion about halfpast nine there being no more wine he got up put a piece of gold on the table and went out without waiting for his change  in the streets the lamps were lighted but daylight was not quite gone he walked unsteadily toward piccadilly a girl of the town passed and looked up at him staring hard he hooked his arm in hers without a word it steadied him and they walked on thus together suddenly he said  well girl are you happy the girl stopped and tried to disengage her arm a rather frightened look had come into her darkeyed powdered face fiorsen laughed and held it firm when the unhappy meet they walk together come on you are just a little like my wife will you have a drink  the girl shook her head and with a sudden movement slipped her arm out of this madmans and dived away like a swallow through the pavement traffic fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back the second time today she had slipped from his grasp passers looked at him amazed the ugly devils and with a grimace he turned out of piccadilly past st jamess church making for bury street they wouldnt let him in of coursenot they but he would look at the windows they had flowerboxesflowerboxes and suddenly he groaned aloudhe had thought of gyps figure busy among the flowers at home missing the right turning he came in at the bottom of the street a fiddler in the gutter was scraping away on an old violin fiorsen stopped to listen poor devil pagliacci going up to the mandark lame very shabby he took out some silver and put his other hand on the mans shoulder  brother he said lend me your fiddle heres money for you come lend it to me i am a great violinist  vraiment monsieur  ah vraiment voyons donnezun instantvous verrez  the fiddler doubting but hypnotized handed him the fiddle his dark face changed when he saw this stranger fling it up to his shoulder and the ways of his fingers with bow and strings fiorsen had begun to walk up the street his eyes searching for the flowerboxes he saw them stopped and began playing che faro he played it wonderfully on that poor fiddle and the fiddler who had followed at his elbow stood watching him uneasy envious but a little entranced sapristi this tall pale monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk and the hollow chest played like an angel ah but it was not so easy as all that to make money in the streets of this sacred town you might play like forty angels and not a copper he had begun another tunelike little pluckings at your hearttres jolitout a fait ecoeurant ah there it wasa monsieur as usual closing the window drawing the curtains always same thing the violin and the bow were thrust back into his hands and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were after himnot badly drunk that one and not a sou thrown down with an uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not understand the lame dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest corner and for two streets at least did not stop then counting the silver fiorsen had put into his hand and carefully examining his fiddle he used the word bigre and started for home    xix   gyp hardly slept at all three times she got up and stealing to the door looked in at her sleeping baby whose face in its new bed she could just see by the nightlights glow the afternoon had shaken her nerves nor was bettys method of breathing while asleep conducive to the slumber of anything but babies it was so hot too and the sound of the violin still in her ears by that little air of poise she had known for certain it was fiorsen and her fathers abrupt drawing of the curtains had clinched that certainty if she had gone to the window and seen him she would not have been half so deeply disturbed as she was by that echo of an old emotion the link which yesterday she thought broken for good was reforged in some mysterious way the sobbing of that old fiddle had been his way of saying forgive me forgive to leave him would have been so much easier if she had really hated him but she did not however difficult it may be to live with an artist to hate him is quite as difficult an artist is so flexibleonly the rigid can be hated she hated the things he did and him when he was doing them but afterward again could hate him no more than she could love him and that wasnot at all resolution and a sense of the practical began to come back with daylight when things were hopeless it was far better to recognize it and harden ones heart  winton whose night had been almost as sleeplessto play like a beggar in the street under his windows had seemed to him the limitannounced at breakfast that he must see his lawyer make arrangements for the payment of fiorsens debts and find out what could be done to secure gyp against persecution some deed was probably necessary he was vague on all such matters in the meantime neither gyp nor the baby must go out gyp spent the morning writing and rewriting to monsieur harmost trying to express her chagrin but not saying that she had left fiorsen  her father came back from westminster quiet and angry he had with difficulty been made to understand that the baby was fiorsens property so that if the fellow claimed it legally they would be unable to resist the point opened the old wound forced him to remember that his own daughter had once belonged to anotherfather he had told the lawyer in a measured voice that he would see the fellow damned first and had directed a deed of separation to be prepared which should provide for the complete payment of fiorsens existing debts on condition that he left gyp and the baby in peace after telling gyp this he took an opportunity of going to the extempore nursery and standing by the babys cradle until then the little creature had only been of interest as part of gyp now it had for him an existence of its ownthis tiny darkeyed creature lying there watching him so gravely clutching his finger suddenly the baby smilednot a beautiful smile but it made on winton an indelible impression  wishing first to settle this matter of the deed he put off going down to mildenham but not trusting those two scoundrels a yardfor he never failed to bracket rosek and fiorsenhe insisted that the baby should not go out without two attendants and that gyp should not go out alone he carried precaution to the point of accompanying her to monsieur harmosts on the friday afternoon and expressed a wish to go in and shake hands with the old fellow it was a queer meeting those two had as great difficulty in finding anything to say as though they were denizens of different planets and indeed there are two planets on this earth when after a minute or so of the friendliest embarrassment he had retired to wait for her gyp sat down to her lesson  monsieur harmost said quietly  your letter was very kind my little friendand your father is very kind but after all it was a compliment your husband paid me his smile smote gyp it seemed to sum up so many resignations so you stay again with your father and looking at her very hard with his melancholy brown eyes when will you find your fate i wonder  never  monsieur harmosts eyebrows rose  ah he said you think no that is impossible he walked twice very quickly up and down the room then spinning round on his heel said sharply well we must not waste your fathers time to work  wintons simple comment in the cab on the way home was  nice old chap  at bury street they found gyps agitated parlourmaid going to do the musicroom that morning she had found the master sitting on the sofa holding his head and groaning awful hes not been at home maam since youyou went on your visit so i didnt know what to do i ran for cook and we got him up to bed and not knowing where youd be maam i telephoned to count rosek and he camei hope i didnt do wrongand he sent me down to see you the doctor says his brains on the touch and go and he keeps askin for you maam so i didnt know what to do  gyp pale to the lips said  wait here a minute ellen and went into the diningroom winton followed she turned to him at once and said  oh dad what am i to do his brain it would be too awful to feel id brought that about  winton grunted gyp went on  i must go and see if its really that i couldnt bear it im afraid i must go dad  winton nodded  well ill come too he said the girl can go back in the cab and say were on the way  taking a parting look at her baby gyp thought bitterly my fate this is my fate and no getting out of it on the journey she and winton were quite silentbut she held his hand tight while the cook was taking up to rosek the news of their arrival gyp stood looking out at her garden two days and six hours only since she had stood there above her pansies since at this very spot rosek had kissed her throat slipping her hand through wintons arm she said  dad please dont make anything of that kiss he couldnt help himself i suppose what does it matter too  a moment later rosek entered before she could speak winton was saying  thank you for letting us know sir but now that my daughter is here there will be no further need for your kind services goodday  at the cruel curtness of those words gyp gave the tiniest start forward she had seen them go through roseks armour as a sword through brown paper he recovered himself with a sickly smile bowed and went out winton followedprecisely as if he did not trust him with the hats in the hall when the outer door was shut he said  i dont think hell trouble you again  gyps gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion after all his offence had only been that of loving her  fiorsen had been taken to her room which was larger and cooler than his own and the maid was standing by the side of the bed with a scared face gyp signed to her to go he opened his eyes presently  gyp oh gyp is it you the devilish awful things i seedont go away again oh gyp with a sob he raised himself and rested his forehead against her and gyp feltas on the first night he came home drunka merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal  its all right all right she murmured im going to stay dont worry about anything keep quite quiet and youll soon be well  in a quarter of an hour he was asleep his wasted look went to her heart and that expression of terror which had been coming and going until he fell asleep anything to do with the brain was so horrible only too clear that she must staythat his recovery depended on her she was still sitting there motionless when the doctor came and seeing him asleep beckoned her out he looked a kindly man with two waistcoats the top one unbuttoned and while he talked he winked at gyp involuntarily and with each wink gyp felt that he ripped the veil off one more domestic secret sleep was the ticketthe very ticket for him had something on his mindyes andera little given tobrandy ah all that must stop stomach as well as nerves affected seeing thingsnasty thingssure sign perhaps not a very careful life before marriage and marriedhow long his kindly appreciative eyes swept gyp from top to toe year and a half quite so hard worker at his violin too no doubt musicians always a little inclined to be immoderatetoo much sense of beautyburn the candle at both ends she must see to that she had been away had she notstaying with her father yes butno one like a wife for nursing as to treatment well one would shove in a dash of what he would prescribe night and morning perfect quiet no stimulant a little cup of strong coffee without milk if he seemed low keep him in bed at present no worry no excitement young man still plenty of vitality as to herself no undue anxiety tomorrow they would see whether a night nurse would be necessary above all no violin for a month no alcoholin every way the strictest moderation and with a last and friendliest wink leaning heavily on that word moderation he took out a stylographic pen scratched on a leaf of his notebook shook gyps hand smiled whimsically buttoned his upper waistcoat and departed  gyp went back to her seat by the bed irony she whose only desire was to be let go free was mainly responsible for his breakdown but for her there would be nothing on his mind for he would not be married brooding morbidly she asked herselfhis drinking debts even the girlhad she caused them too and when she tried to free him and herselfthis was the result was there something fatal about her that must destroy the men she had to do with she had made her father unhappy monsieur harmostrosek and her husband even before she married how many had tried for her love and gone away unhappy and getting up she went to a mirror and looked at herself long and sadly   xx   three days after her abortive attempt to break away gyp with much heartsearching wrote to daphne wing telling her of fiorsens illness and mentioning a cottage near mildenham whereif she liked to goshe would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity and finally begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken dancecontracts  next morning she found mr wagge with a tall crapebanded hat in his blackgloved hands standing in the very centre of her drawingroom he was staring into the garden as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of that warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the sunflowers and his daughter had danced out there she had a perfect view of his thick red neck in its turndown collar crossed by a black bow over a shiny white shirt and holding out her hand she said  how do you do mr wagge it was kind of you to come  mr wagge turned his pug face wore a downcast expression  i hope i see you well maam pretty place you ave ere im fond of flowers myself theyve always been my obby  theyre a great comfort in london arent they  yees i should think you might grow the dahlia here and having thus obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire satisfied some obscurer desire to flatter he went on my girl showed me your letter i didnt like to write in such a delicate matter id rather be vivey vocey very kind in your position im sure i appreciate it i always try to do the christian thing myself flesh passes you never know when you may have to take your turn i said to my girl id come and see you  im very glad i hoped perhaps you would  mr wagge cleared his throat and went on in a hoarser voice  i dont want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your presence especially as i read hes indisposed but really i hardly know how to bear the situation i cant bring myself to think of money in relation to that matter all the same its a serious loss to my daughter very serious loss ive got my family pride to think of my daughters name wellits my own and though i say it im respecteda regular attendanti think i told you sometimes i assure you i feel i cant control myself and its only thatand you if i may say so that keeps me in check  during this speech his blackgloved hands were clenching and unclenching and he shifted his broad shining boots gyp gazed at them not daring to look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from christianity to shekels from his honour to the world from his anger to herself and she said  please let me do what i ask mr wagge i should be so unhappy if i mightnt do that little something  mr wagge blew his nose  its a delicate matter he said i dont know where my duty lays i dont reelly  gyp looked up then  the great thing is to save daisy suffering isnt it  mr wagges face wore for a moment an expression of affront as if from the thought sufferin you must leave that to her father then it wavered the curious furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a moment into his little eyes he averted them and coughed gyp said softly  to please me  mr wagges readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist he answered in a voice that he strove to make bland  if you put it in that way i dont reelly know ow to refuse but it must be quite between you and mei cant withdraw my attitude  gyp murmured  no of course thank you so much and youll let me know about everything later i mustnt take up your time now and she held out her hand  mr wagge took it in a lingering manner  well i have an appointment he said a gentleman at campden hill he starts at twelve im never late goodmorning  when she had watched his square black figure pass through the outer gate busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves she went upstairs and washed her face and hands   for several days fiorsen wavered but his collapse had come just in time and with every hour the danger lessened at the end of a fortnight of a perfectly white life there remained nothing to do in the words of the doctor but to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes and shove in sea air gyp had locked up all brandyand violins she could control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness but she passed some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby betty and the dogs and definitely took up life in her little house again his debts had been paid including the thousand pounds to rosek and the losses of daphne wing the girl had gone down to that cottage where no one had ever heard of her to pass her time in lonely grief and terror with the aid of a black dress and a gold band on her third finger  august and the first half of september were spent near bude fiorsens passion for the sea a passion gyp could share kept him singularly moderate and free from restiveness he had been thoroughly frightened and such terror is not easily forgotten they stayed in a farmhouse where he was at his best with the simple folk and his best could be charming he was always trying to get his mermaid as he took to calling gyp away from the baby getting her away to himself along the grassy cliffs and among the rocks and yellow sands of that free coast his delight was to find every day some new nook where they could bathe and dry themselves by sitting in the sun and very like a mermaid she was on a seaweedy rock with her feet close together in a little pool her fingers combing her drowned hair and the sun silvering her wet body if she had loved him it would have been perfect but though close to nature like thisthere are men to whom towns are poisonhe was so much more easy to bear even to like her heart never opened to him never fluttered at his voice or beat more quickly under his kisses one cannot regulate these things the warmth in her eyes when they looked at her baby and the coolness when they looked at him was such that not even a man and he an egoist could help seeing and secretly he began to hate that tiny rival and she began to notice that he did  as soon as the weather broke he grew restless craving his violin and they went back to town in robust healthall three during those weeks gyp had never been free of the feeling that it was just a lull of forces held up in suspense and the moment they were back in their house this feeling gathered density and darkness as rain gathers in the sky after a fine spell she had often thought of daphne wing and had written twice getting in return one naive and pathetic answer   dear mrs fiorsen  oh it is kind of you to write because i know what you must be feeling about me and it was so kind of you to let me come here i try not to think about things but of course i cant help it and i dont seem to care what happens now mother is coming down here later on sometimes i lie awake all night listening to the wind dont you think the wind is the most melancholy thing in the world i wonder if i shall die i hope i shall oh i do really goodbye dear mrs fiorsen i shall never forgive myself about you  your grateful  daphne wing   the girl had never once been mentioned between her and fiorsen since the night when he sat by her bed begging forgiveness she did not know whether he ever gave the little dancer and her trouble a thought or even knew what had become of her but now that the time was getting near gyp felt more and more every day as if she must go down and see her she wrote to her father who after a dose of harrogate with aunt rosamund was back at mildenham winton answered that the nurse was there and that there seemed to be a woman presumably the mother staying with her but that he had not of course made direct inquiry could not gyp come down he was alone and cubbing had begun it was like him to veil his longings under such dry statements but the thought of giving him pleasure and of a gallop with hounds fortified intensely her feeling that she ought to go now that baby was so well and fiorsen still not drinking she might surely snatch this little holiday and satisfy her conscience about the girl since the return from cornwall she had played for him in the musicroom just as of old and she chose the finish of a morning practice to say  gustav i want to go to mildenham this afternoon for a week fathers lonely  he was putting away his violin but she saw his neck grow red  to him no he will steal you as he stole the baby let him have the baby if he likes not you no  gyp who was standing by the piano kept silence at this unexpected outburst but revolt blazed up in her she never asked him anything he should not refuse this he came up behind and put his arms round her  my gyp i want you herei am lonely too dont go away  she tried to force his arms apart but could not and her anger grew she said coldly  theres another reason why i must go  no no no good reasonto take you from me  there is the girl who is just going to have your child is staying near mildenham and i want to see how she is  he let go of her then and recoiling against the divan sat down and gyp thought im sorry i didnt mean tobut it serves him right  he muttered in a dull voice  oh i hoped she was dead  yes for all you care she might be im going but you neednt be afraid that i shant come back i shall be back today week i promise  he looked at her fixedly  yes you dont break your promises you will not break it but suddenly he said again gyp dont go  i must  he got up and caught her in his arms  say you love me then  but she could not it was one thing to put up with embraces quite another to pretend that when at last he was gone she sat smoothing her hair staring before her with hard eyes thinking herewhere i saw him with that girl what animals men are   late that afternoon she reached mildenham winton met her at the station and on the drive up they passed the cottage where daphne wing was staying it stood in front of a small coppice a creepered plainfronted little brick house with a garden still full of sunflowers tenanted by the old jockey pettance his widowed daughter and her three small children that talkative old scoundrel as winton always called him was still employed in the mildenham stables and his daughter was laundress to the establishment gyp had secured for daphne wing the same free independent economic agent who had watched over her own event the same old doctor too was to be the presiding deity there were no signs of life about the cottage and she would not stop too eager to be at home again to see the old rooms and smell the old savour of the house to get to her old mare and feel its nose nuzzling her for sugar it was so good to be back once more feeling strong and well and able to ride the smile of the inscrutable markey at the front door was a joy to her even the darkness of the hall where a gleam of last sunlight fell across the skin of wintons first tiger on which she had so often sunk down dead tired after hunting ah it was nice to be at home  in her mares box old pettance was putting a last touch to cleanliness his shaven skintight wicked old face smiled deeply he said in honeyed tones  good evenin miss beautiful evenin maam and his little burning brown eyes just touched by age regarded her lovingly  well pettance how are you and hows annie and how are the children and hows this old darling  wonderful miss artful as a kitten carry you like a bird tomorrow if youre goin out  how are her legs  and while gyp passed her hand down those iron legs the old mare examined her down the back of her neck  they avent filled not once since she come inshe was out all july and august but ive kept er well at it since in opes you might be comin  they feel splendid and still bending down gyp asked and how is your lodgerthe young lady i sent you  well maam shes very young and these very young ladies they get a bit excited you know at such times i should say sheve

class of coursethats where it is but this ere nursewell you know miss she wont ave no nonsense so there we are and of course youre bound to ave ighsteria a bitlosin her usband as young as that  gyp

in the next roomoh yes at nighttimewhen youre a widder at that age you cant expect nothin else i remember when i was ridin in ireland for captain oneill there was a young woman  gyp thought i mustnt let him get offor i shall be late for dinner and she said  oh pettance who bought the young brown horse  mr bryn summeray maam over at widrington for an unter and ack in town miss  summerhay ah with a touch of the whip to her memory gyp recalled the young man with the clear eyes and teasing smile on the chestnut mare the bold young man who reminded her of somebody and she added  thatll be a good home for him i should think  oh yes miss good omenice gentleman too he come over here to see it and asked after you i told im you was a married lady now miss ah he said she rode beautiful and he

glad hes got my horse   xxi   still glowing from her morning in the saddle gyp started out next day at noon on her visit to the old scoundrels cottage it was one of those lingering mellow mornings of late september when the air just warmed through lifts off the stubbles and the hedgerows are not yet dried of dew the short cut led across two fields a narrow strip of village common where linen was drying on gorse bushes coming into bloom and one field beyond she met no one crossing the road she passed into the cottagegarden where sunflowers and michaelmas daisies in great profusion were tangled along the low redbrick gardenwalls under some poplar trees yellowflecked already a single empty chair with a book turned face downward stood outside an open window smoke wreathing from one chimney was the only sign of life but standing undecided before the halfopen door gyp was conscious as it were of too much stillness of something unnatural about the silence she was just raising her hand to knock when she heard the sound of smothered sobbing peeping through the window she could just see a woman dressed in green evidently mrs wagge seated at a table crying into her handkerchief at that very moment too a low moaning came from the room above gyp recoiled then making up her mind she went in and knocked at the room where the woman in green was sitting after fully half a minute it was opened and mrs wagge stood there the nose and eyes and cheeks of that thinnish acid face were red and in her green dress and with her greenish hair for it was going grey and she put on it a yellow lotion smelling of cantharides she seemed to gyp just like one of those green apples that turn reddish so unnaturally in the sun she had rubbed over her face which shone in streaks and her handkerchief was still crumpled in her hand it was horrible to come so fresh and glowing into the presence of this poor woman evidently in bitter sorrow and a desperate desire came over gyp to fly it seemed dreadful for anyone connected with him who had caused this trouble to be coming here at all but she said as softly as she could  mrs wagge please forgive mebut is there any news i amit was i who got daphne down here  the woman before her was evidently being torn this way and that but at last she answered with a sniff  ititwas born this morningdead gyp gasped to have gone through it all for that every bit of motherfeeling in her rebelled and sorrowed but her reason said better so much better and she murmured  how is she  mrs wagge answered with profound dejection  badvery bad i dont know im sure what to saymy feelings are all anyhow and thats the truth its so dreadfully upsetting altogether  is my nurse with her  yes shes there shes a very headstrong woman but capable i dont deny daisys very weak oh it is upsetting and now i suppose therell have to be a burial there really seems no end to it and all because ofof that man and mrs wagge turned away again to cry into her handkerchief  feeling she could never say or do the right thing to the poor lady gyp stole out at the bottom of the stairs she hesitated whether to go up or no at last she mounted softly it must be in the front room that the bereaved girl was lyingthe girl who but a year ago had debated with such naive selfimportance whether or not it was her duty to take a lover gyp summoned courage to tap gently the economic agent opened the door an inch but seeing who it was slipped her robust and handsome person through into the corridor  you my dear she said in a whisper thats nice  how is she  fairly wellconsidering you know about it  yes can i see her  i hardly think so i cant make her out shes got no spirit not an ounce she doesnt want to get well i believe its the man i expect and looking at gyp with her fine blue eyes she asked is that it is he tired of her  gyp met her gaze better than she had believed possible  yes nurse  the economic agent swept her up and down its a pleasure to look at you youve got quite a colour for you after all i believe it might do her good to see you come in  gyp passed in behind her and stood gazing not daring to step forward what a white face with eyes closed with fair hair still damp on the forehead with one white hand lying on the sheet above her heart what a frail madonna of the sugarplums on the whole of that bed the only colour seemed the gold hoop round the weddingfinger  the economic agent said very quietly  look my dear ive brought you a nice visitor  daphne wings eyes and lips opened and closed again and the awful thought went through gyp poor thing she thought it was going to be him and its only me then the white lips said  oh mrs fiorsen its youit is kind of you and the eyes opened again but very little and differently  the economic agent slipped away gyp sat down by the bed and timidly touched the hand  daphne wing looked at her and two tears slowly ran down her cheeks  its over she said just audibly and theres nothing nowit was dead you know i dont want to live oh mrs fiorsen why cant they let me die too  gyp bent over and kissed the hand unable to bear the sight of those two slowly rolling tears daphne wing went on  you are good to me i wish my poor little baby hadnt  gyp knowing her own tears were wetting that hand raised herself and managed to get out the words  bear up think of your work  dancing ho she gave the least laugh ever heard it seems so long ago  yes but now itll all come back to you again better than ever  daphne wing answered by a feeble sigh  there was silence gyp thought shes falling asleep  with eyes and mouth closed like that and all alabaster white the face was perfect purged of its little commonnesses strange freak that this white flower of a face could ever have been produced by mr and mrs wagge  daphne wing opened her eyes and said  oh mrs fiorsen i feel so weak and i feel much more lonely now theres nothing anywhere  gyp got up she felt herself being carried into the mood of the girls heart and was afraid it would be seen daphne wing went on  do you know when nurse said shed brought a visitor i thought it was him but im glad now if he had looked at me like he didi couldnt have borne it  gyp bent down and put her lips to the damp forehead faint very faint there was still the scent of orangeblossom  when she was once more in the garden she hurried away but instead of crossing the fields again turned past the side of the cottage into the coppice behind and sitting down on a log her hands pressed to her cheeks and her elbows to her breast she stared at the sunlit bracken and the flies chasing each other over it love was it always something hateful and tragic that spoiled lives crisscross one darting on another taking her almost before she knew she was seized then darting away and leaving her wanting to be seized again or darting on her who when seized was fatal to the darter yet had never wanted to be seized or darting one on the other for a moment then both breaking away too soon did never two dart at each other seize and cling and ever after be one love it had spoiled her fathers life and daphne wings never came when it was wanted always came when it was not malevolent wanderer alighting here there tiring of the spirit before it tired of the body or of the body before it tired of the spirit better to have nothing to do with itfar better if one never loved one would never feel lonelylike that poor girl and yet nothere was no and yet who that was free would wish to become a slave a slavelike daphne wing a slavelike her own husband to his want of a wife who did not love him a slave like her father had beenstill was to a memory and watching the sunlight on the bracken gyp thought love keep far from me i dont want you i shall never want you   every morning that week she made her way to the cottage and every morning had to pass through the hands of mrs wagge the good lady had got over the upsetting fact that gyp was the wife of that villain and had taken a fancy to her confiding to the economic agent who confided it to gyp that she was very distangeyand such pretty eyes quite italian she was one of those numberless persons whose passion for distinction was just a little too much for their passionate propriety it was that worship of distinction which had caused her to have her young daughters talent for dancing fostered who knew to what it might lead in these days at great length she explained to gyp the infinite care with which she had always brought daisy up like a ladyand now this is the result and she would look piercingly at gyps hair or ears at her hands or her instep to see how it was done the burial worried her dreadfully im using the name of daisy wing she was christened daisy and the wings professional so that takes them both in and its quite the truth but i dont think anyone would connect it would they about the fathers name do you think i might say the late mr joseph wing this once you see it never was alive and i must put something if theyre not to guess the truth and that i couldnt bear mr wagge would be so distressed its in his own line you see oh it is upsetting  gyp murmured desperately  oh yes anything  though the girl was so deathly white and spiritless it soon became clear that she was going to pull through with each day a little more colour and a little more commonness came back to her and gyp felt instinctively that she would in the end return to fulham purged of her infatuation a little harder perhaps a little deeper  late one afternoon toward the end of her week at mildenham gyp wandered again into the coppice and sat down on that same log an hour before sunset the light shone level on the yellowing leaves all round her a startled rabbit pelted out of the bracken and pelted back again and from the far edge of the little wood a jay cackled harshly shifting its perch from tree to tree gyp thought of her baby and of that which would have been its halfbrother and now that she was so near having to go back to fiorsen she knew that she had not been wise to come here to have been in contact with the girl to have touched as it were that trouble had made the thought of life with him less tolerable even than it was before only the longing to see her baby made return seem possible ah wellshe would get used to it all again but the anticipation of his eyes fixed on her then sliding away from the meeting with her eyes of allof all that would begin again suddenly made her shiver she was very near to loathing at that moment he the father of her baby the thought seemed ridiculous and strange that little creature seemed to bind him to her no more than if it were the offspring of some chance encounter some pursuit of nymph by faun no it was hers alone and a sudden feverish longing to get back to it overpowered all other thought this longing grew in her so all night that at breakfast she told her father swallowing down whatever his feeling may have been he said  very well my child ill come up with you  putting her into the cab in london he asked  have you still got your key of bury street good remember gypany time day or nightthere it is for you  she had wired to fiorsen from mildenham that she was coming and she reached home soon after three he was not in and what was evidently her telegram lay unopened in the hall tremulous with expectation she ran up to the nursery the pathetic sound of some small creature that cannot tell what is hurting it or why met her ears she went in disturbed yet with the halftriumphant thought perhaps thats for me  betty very flushed was rocking the cradle and examining the babys face with a perplexed frown seeing gyp she put her hand to her side and gasped  oh be joyful oh my dear i am glad i cant do anything with baby since the morning whenever she wakes up she cries like that and till today shes been a little model hasnt she there there  gyp took up the baby whose black eyes fixed themselves on her mother in a momentary contentment but at the first movement she began again her fretful plaint betty went on  shes been like that ever since this morning mr fiorsens been in more than once maam and the fact is baby dont like it he stares at her so but this morning i thoughtwelli thought youre her father its time she was getting used to you so i let them be a minute and when i came backi was only just across to the bathroomhe was comin out lookin quite fierce and white and babyoh screamin and except for sleepin shes hardly stopped cryin since  pressing the baby to her breast gyp sat very still and queer thoughts went through her mind  how has he been betty she said  betty plaited her apron her moonface was troubled  well she said i think hes been drinkin oh im sure he hasive smelt it about him the third day it began and night before last he came in dreadfully latei could hear him staggerin about abusing the stairs as he was comin up oh dearit is a pity  the baby who had been still enough since she lay in her mothers lap suddenly raised her little voice again gyp said  betty i believe something hurts her arm she cries the moment shes touched there is there a pin or anything just see take her things off ohlook  both the tiny arms above the elbow were circled with dark marks as if they had been squeezed by ruthless fingers the two women looked at each other in horror and under her breath gyp said he  she had flushed crimson her eyes filled but dried again almost at once and looking at her face now gone very pale and those lips tightened to a line betty stopped in her outburst of ejaculation when they had wrapped the babys arm in remedies and cottonwool gyp went into her bedroom and throwing herself down on her bed burst into a passion of weeping smothering it deep in her pillow  it was the crying of sheer rage the brute not to have control enough to stop short of digging his claws into that precious mite just because the poor little thing cried at that cats stare of his the brute the devil and he would come to her and whine about it and say my gyp i never meanthow should i know i was hurting her crying was sowhy should she cry at me i was upset i wasnt thinking she could hear him pleading and sighing to her to forgive him but she would notnot this time he had hurt a helpless thing once too often her fit of crying ceased and she lay listening to the tick of the clock and marshalling in her mind a hundred little evidences of his malevolence toward her babyhis own baby how was it possible was he really going mad and a fit of such chilly shuddering seized her that she crept under the eider down to regain warmth in her rage she retained enough sense of proportion to understand that he had done this just as he had insulted monsieur harmost and her fatherand othersin an ungovernable access of nerveirritation just as perhaps one day he would kill someone but to understand this did not lessen her feeling her baby such a tiny thing she hated him at last and she lay thinking out the coldest the cruellest the most cutting things to say she had been too longsuffering  but he did not come in that evening and too upset to eat or do anything she went up to bed at ten oclock when she had undressed she stole across to the nursery she had a longing to have the baby with hera feeling that to leave her was not safe she carried her off still sleeping and locking her doors got into bed having warmed a nest with her body for the little creature she laid it there and then for a long time lay awake expecting every minute to hear him return she fell asleep at last and woke with a start there were vague noises down below or on the stairs it must be he she had left the light on in her room and she leaned over to look at the babys face it was still sleeping drawing its tiny breaths peacefully little dogshivers passing every now and then over its face gyp shaking back her dark plaits of hair sat up by its side straining her ears  yes he was coming up and by the sounds he was not sober she heard a loud creak and then a thud as if he had clutched at the banisters and fallen she heard muttering too and the noise of boots dropped swiftly the thought went through her if he were quite drunk he would not have taken them off at allnor if he were quite sober does he know im back then came another creak as if he were raising himself by support of the banisters and thenor was it fancyshe could hear him creeping and breathing behind the door thenno fancy this timehe fumbled at the door and turned the handle in spite of his state he must know that she was back had noticed her travellingcoat or seen the telegram the handle was tried again then after a pause the handle of the door between his room and hers was fiercely shaken she could hear his voice too as she knew it when he was flown with drink thick a little drawling  gyplet me ingyp  the blood burned up in her cheeks and she thought no my friend youre not coming in  after that sounds were more confused as if he were now at one door now at the other then creakings as if on the stairs again and after that no sound at all  for fully half an hour gyp continued to sit up straining her ears where was he what doing on her overexcited nerves all sorts of possibilities came crowding he must have gone downstairs again in that halfdrunken state where would his baffled frenzies lead him and suddenly she thought that she smelled burning it went and came again she got up crept to the door noiselessly turned the key and pulling it open a few inches sniffed  all was dark on the landing there was no smell of burning out there suddenly a hand clutched her ankle all the blood rushed from her heart she stifled a scream and tried to pull the door to but his arm and her leg were caught between and she saw the black mass of his figure lying fulllength on its face like a vice his hand held her he drew himself up on to his knees on to his feet and forced his way through panting but in utter silence gyp struggled to drive him out his drunken strength seemed to come and go in gusts but hers was continuous greater than she had ever thought she had and she panted  go go out of my roomyouyouwretch  then her heart stood still with horror for he had slued round to the bed and was stretching his hands out above the baby she heard him mutter  ahhhyouin my placeyou  gyp flung herself on him from behind dragging his arms down and clasping her hands together held him fast he twisted round in her arms and sat down on the bed in that moment of his collapse gyp snatched up her baby and fled out down the dark stairs hearing him stumbling groping in pursuit she fled into the diningroom and locked the door she heard him run against it and fall down snuggling her baby who was crying now inside her nightgown next to her skin for warmth she stood rocking and hushing it trying to listen there was no more sound by the hearth whence a little heat still came forth from the ashes she cowered down with cushions and the thick white felt from the diningtable she made the baby snug and wrapping her shivering self in the tablecloth sat staring wideeyed before herand always listening there were sounds at first then none a long long time she stayed like that before she stole to the door she did not mean to make a second mistake she could hear the sound of heavy breathing and she listened to it till she was quite certain that it was really the breathing of sleep then stealthily she opened and looked he was over there lying against the bottom chair in a heavy drunken slumber she knew that sleep so well he would not wake from it  it gave her a sort of evil pleasure that they would find him like that in the morning when she was gone she went back to her baby and with infinite precaution lifted it still sleeping cushion and all and stole past him up the stairs that under her bare feet made no sound once more in her locked room she went to the window and looked out it was just before dawn her garden was grey and ghostly and she thought the last time i shall see you goodbye  then with the utmost speed she did her hair and dressed she was very cold and shivery and put on her fur coat and cap she hunted out two jerseys for the baby and a certain old camelshair shawl she took a few little things she was fondest of and slipped them into her wristbag with her purse put on her hat and a pair of gloves she did everything very swiftly wondering all the time at her own power of knowing what to take when she was quite ready she scribbled a note to betty to follow with the dogs to bury street and pushed it under the nursery door then wrapping the baby in the jerseys and shawl she went downstairs the dawn had broken and from the long narrow window above the door with spikes of iron across it grey light was striking into the hall gyp passed fiorsens sleeping figure safely and for one moment stopped for breath he was lying with his back against the wall his head in the hollow of an arm raised against a stair and his face turned a little upward that face which hundreds of times had been so close to her own and something about this crumpled body about his tumbled hair those cheekbones and the hollows beneath the pale lips just parted under the dirtgold of his moustachesomething of lost divinity in all that inert figureclutched for a second at gyps heart only for a second it was over this time no morenever again and turning very stealthily she slipped her shoes on undid the chain opened the front door took up her burden closed the door softly behind her and walked away     part iii   i   gyp was going up to town she sat in the corner of a firstclass carriage alone her father had gone up by an earlier train for the annual june dinner of his old regiment and she had stayed to consult the doctor concerning little gyp aged nearly nineteen months to whom teeth were making life a burden  her eyes wandered from window to window obeying the faint excitement within her all the winter and spring she had been at mildenham very quiet riding much and pursuing her music as best she could seeing hardly anyone except her father and this departure for a spell of london brought her the feeling that comes on an april day when the sky is blue with snowwhite clouds when in the fields the lambs are leaping and the grass is warm for the first time so that one would like to roll in it at widrington a porter entered carrying a kitbag an overcoat and some golfclubs and round the door a little group such as may be seen at any english wayside station clustered filling the air with their clean slightly drawling voices gyp noted a tall woman whose blonde hair was going grey a young girl with a foxterrier on a lead a young man with a scotch terrier under his arm and his back to the carriage the girl was kissing the scotch terriers head  goodbye old ossy was he nice tumbo keep down youre not going  goodbye dear boy dont work too hard  the young mans answer was not audible but it was followed by irrepressible gurgles and a smothered  oh bryan you aregoodbye dear ossy goodbye goodbye the young man who had got in made another unintelligible joke in a rather highpitched voice which was somehow familiar and again the gurgles broke forth then the train moved gyp caught a side view of him waving his hat from the carriage window it was her acquaintance of the huntingfieldthe mr bryn summeray as old pettance called him who had bought her horse last year seeing him pull down his overcoat to bank up the old scotch terrier against the jolting of the journey she thought i like men who think first of their dogs his round head with curly hair broad brow and those cleancut lips gave her again the wonder where have i seen someone like him he raised the window and turned round  how would you likeoh how dyou do we met out hunting you dont remember me i expect  yes perfectly and you bought my horse last summer how is he  in great form i forgot to ask what you called him ive named him hotspurhell never be steady at his fences i remember how he pulled with you that day  they were silent smiling as people will in remembrance of a good run  then looking at the dog gyp said softly  he looks rather a darling how old  twelve beastly when dogs get old  there was another little silence while he contemplated her steadily with his clear eyes  i came over to call oncewith my mother november the year before last somebody was ill  yesi  badly  gyp shook her head  i heard you were married the little drawl in his voice had increased as though covering the abruptness of that remark gyp looked up  yes but my little daughter and i live with my father again what came over heras they sayto be so frank she could not have told  he said simply  ah ive often thought it queer ive never seen you since what a run that was  perfect was that your mother on the platform  yesand my sister edith extraordinary deadalive place widrington i expect mildenham isnt much better  its very quiet but i like it  by the way i dont know your name now  fiorsen  oh yes the violinist lifes a bit of a gamble isnt it  gyp did not answer that odd remark did not quite know what to make of this audacious young man whose hazel eyes and lazy smile were queerly lovable but whose face in repose had such a broad gravity he took from his pocket a little red book  do you know these i always take them travelling finest things ever written arent they  the bookshakespeares sonnetswas open at that which begins        let me not to the marriage of true minds         admit impediments  love is not love       which alters when it alteration finds         or bends with the remover to remove   gyp read on as far as the lines        loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks         within his bending sickles compass come       love alters not with his brief hours and weeks         but bears it out even to the edge of doom   and looked out of the window the train was passing through a country of fields and dykes where the sun far down in the west shone almost level over wide whitishgreen space and the spotted cattle browsed or stood by the ditches lazily flicking their tufted tails a shaft of sunlight flowed into the carriage filled with dust motes and handing the little book back through that streak of radiance she said softly  yes thats wonderful do you read much poetry  more law im afraid but it is about the finest thing in the world isnt it  no i think music  are you a musician  only a little  you look as if you might be  what a little  no i should think you had it badly  thank you and you havent it at all  i like opera  the hybrid formand the lowest  thats why it suits me dont you like it though  yes thats why im going up to london  really are you a subscriber  this season  so am i jollyi shall see you  gyp smiled it was so long since she had talked to a man of her own age so long since she had seen a face that roused her curiosity and admiration so long since she had been admired the sunshaft shifted by a westward trend of the train bathed her from the knees up and its warmth increased her lighthearted sense of being in luckabove her fate instead of under it  astounding how much can be talked of in two or three hours of a railway journey and what a friendly afterwarmth clings round those hours does the difficulty of making oneself heard provoke confidential utterance or is it the isolation or the continual vibration that carries friendship faster and further than will a spasmodic acquaintanceship of weeks but in that long talk he was far the more voluble there was too much of which she could not speak besides she liked to listen his slightly drawling voice fascinated herhis audacious often witty way of putting things and the irrepressible bubble of laughter that would keep breaking from him he disclosed his past such as it was freelypublicschool and college life efforts at the bar ambitions tastes even his scrapes and in this spontaneous unfolding there was perpetual flattery gyp felt through it all as pretty women will a sort of subtle admiration presently he asked her if she played piquet  yes i play with my father nearly every evening  shall we have a game then  she knew he only wanted to play because he could sit nearer joined by the evening paper over their knees hand her the cards after dealing touch her hand by accident look in her face and this was not unpleasant for she in turn liked looking at his face which had what is called charmthat something light and unepiscopal entirely lacking to so many solid handsome admirable faces  but even railway journeys come to an end and when he gripped her hand to say goodbye she gave his an involuntary little squeeze standing at her cab window with his hat raised the old dog under his arm and a look of frank rather wistful admiration on his face he said  i shall see you at the opera then and in the row perhaps and i may come along to bury street some time maynt i  nodding to those friendly words gyp drove off through the sultry london evening her father was not back from the dinner and she went straight to her room after so long in the country it seemed very close in bury street she put on a wrapper and sat down to brush the trainsmoke out of her hair  for months after leaving fiorsen she had felt nothing but relief only of late had she begun to see her new position as it wasthat of a woman married yet not married whose awakened senses have never been gratified whose spirit is still waiting for unfoldment in love who however disillusioned iseven if in secret from herselfmore and more surely seeking a real mate with every hour that ripens her heart and beauty tonightgazing at her face reflected intent and mournful in the mirrorshe saw that position more clearly in all its aridity than she had ever seen it what was the use of being pretty no longer use to anyone not yet twentysix and in a nunnery with a shiver but not of cold she drew her wrapper close this time last year she had at least been in the main current of life not a mere derelict and yetbetter far be like this than go back to him whom memory painted always standing over her sleeping baby with his arms stretched out and his fingers crooked like claws  after that earlymorning escape fiorsen had lurked after her for weeks in town at mildenham followed them even to scotland where winton had carried her off but she had not weakened in her resolution a second time and suddenly he had given up pursuit and gone abroad since thennothing had come from him save a few wild or maudlin letters written evidently during drinkingbouts even they had ceased and for four months she had heard no word he had got over her it seemed wherever he wasrussia swedenwho knewwho cared  she let the brush rest on her knee thinking again of that walk with her baby through empty silent streets in the early misty morning last october of waiting deadtired outside here on the pavement ringing till they let her in often since she had wondered how fear could have worked her up to that weird departure she only knew that it had not been unnatural at the time her father and aunt rosamund had wanted her to try for a divorce and no doubt they had been right but her instincts had refused still refused to let everyone know her secrets and sufferingsstill refused the hollow pretence involved that she had loved him when she never had no it had been her fault for marrying him without love        love is not love       which alters when it alteration finds   what ironygiving her that to readif her fellow traveller had only known  she got up from before the mirror and stood looking round her room the room she had always slept in as a girl so he had remembered her all this time it had not seemed like meeting a stranger they were not strangers now anyway and suddenly on the wall before her she saw his face or if not what was so like that she gave a little gasp of course how stupid of her not to have known at once there in a brown frame hung a photograph of the celebrated botticelli or masaccio head of a young man in the national gallery she had fallen in love with it years ago and on the wall of her room it had been ever since that broad face the clear eyes the bold cleancut mouth the audacityonly the live face was english not italian had more humour more breeding less poetrysomething old georgian about it how he would laugh if she told him he was like that peasant acolyte with fluffedout hair and a little ruching round his neck and smiling gyp plaited her own hair and got into bed  but she could not sleep she heard her father come in and go up to his room heard the clocks strike midnight and one and two and always the dull roar of piccadilly she had nothing over her but a sheet and still it was too hot there was a scent in the room as of honeysuckle where could it come from she got up at last and went to the window there on the windowsill behind the curtains was a bowl of jessamine her father must have brought it up for herjust like him to think of that  and burying her nose in those white blossoms she was visited by a memory of her first ballthat evening of such delight and disillusionment perhaps bryan summerhay had been thereall that time ago if he had been introduced to her then if she had happened to dance with him instead of with that man who had kissed her arm might she not have felt different toward all men and if he had admired herand had not everyone that nightmight she not have liked perhaps more than liked him in return or would she have looked on him as on all her swains before she met fiorsen so many moths fluttering round a candle foolish to singe themselves not to be taken seriously perhaps she had been bound to have her lesson to be humbled and brought low  taking a sprig of jessamine and holding it to her nose she went up to that picture in the dim light she could just see the outline of the face and the eyes gazing at her the scent of the blossom penetrated her nerves in her heart something faintly stirred as a leaf turns over as a wing flutters and blossom and all she clasped her hands over her breast where again her heart quivered with that faint shy tremor  it was late noearly when she fell asleep and had a strange dream she was riding her old mare through a field of flowers she had on a black dress and round her head a crown of bright pointed crystals she sat without saddle her knee curled up perched so lightly that she hardly felt the mares back and the reins she held were long twisted stems of honeysuckle singing as she rode her eyes flying here and there over the field up to the sky she felt happier lighter than thistledown while they raced along the old mare kept turning her head and biting at the honeysuckle flowers and suddenly that chestnut face became the face of summerhay looking back at her with his smile she awoke sunlight through the curtains where she had opened them to find the flowers was shining on her   ii   very late that same night summerhay came out of the little chelsea house which he inhabited and walked toward the river in certain moods men turn insensibly toward any space where nature rules a littledowns woods waterswhere the sky is free to the eye and one feels the broad comradeship of primitive forces a man is alone when he loves alone when he dies nobody cares for one so absorbed and he cares for nobody nonot he summerhay stood by the riverwall and looked up at the stars through the planetree branches every now and then he drew a long breath of the warm unstirring air and smiled without knowing that he smiled and he thought of little of nothing but a sweetish sensation beset his heart a kind of quivering lightness his limbs he sat down on a bench and shut his eyes he saw a faceonly a face the lights went out one by one in the houses opposite no cabs passed now and scarce a passenger was afoot but summerhay sat like a man in a trance the smile coming and going on his lips and behind him the air that ever stirs above the river faintly moved with the tide flowing up  it was nearly three just coming dawn when he went in and instead of going to bed sat down to a case in which he was junior on the morrow and worked right on till it was time to ride before his bath and breakfast he had one of those constitutions not uncommon among barristersfostered perhaps by ozone in the courts of lawthat can do this sort of thing and take no harm indeed he worked best in such long spurts of vigorous concentration with real capacity and a liking for his work this young man was certainly on his way to make a name though in the intervals of energy no one gave a more complete impression of imperturbable drifting on the tides of the moment altogether he was rather a paradox he chose to live in that little chelsea house which had a scrap of garden rather than in the temple or st jamess because he often preferred solitude and yet he was an excellent companion with many friends who felt for him the affectionate distrust inspired by those who are prone to fits and starts of work and play conviviality and loneliness to women he was almost universally attractive but if he had scorched his wings a little once or twice he had kept heartfree on the whole he was it must be confessed a bit of a gambler the sort of gambler who gets in deep and then by a plucky lucky plunge gets out again until some day perhapshe stays there his father a diplomatist had been dead fifteen years his mother was well known in the semiintellectual circles of society he had no brothers two sisters and an income of his own such was bryan summerhay at the age of twentysix his wisdomteeth to cut his depths unplumbed  when he started that morning for the temple he had still a feeling of extraordinary lightness in his limbs and he still saw that faceits perfect regularity its warm pallor and dark smiling eyes rather wide apart its fine small closeset ears and the sweep of the blackbrown hair across the low brow or was it something much less definite he sawan emanation or expression a trick a turn an indwelling grace a something that appealed that turned and touched him whatever it was it would not let him be and he did not desire that it should for this was in his character if he saw a horse that he liked he put his money on whatever it ran if charmed by an opera he went over and over again if by a poem he almost learned it by heart and while he walked along the riverhis usual routehe had queer and unaccustomed sensations now melting now pugnacious and he felt happy  he was rather late and went at once into court in wig and gown that something old georgian about him was very visible a beautyspot or two a fullskirted velvet coat a sword and snuffbox with that grey wig or its equivalent and there would have been a perfect eighteenthcentury specimen of the less bucolic stampthe same strong light build breadth of face brown pallor clean and unpinched cut of lips the same slight insolence and devilmaycaredom the same clear glance and bubble of vitality it was almost a pity to have been born so late  except that once or twice he drew a face on blottingpaper and smeared it over he remained normally attentive to his lud and the matters in hand all day conducted without error the examination of two witnesses and with terror the crossexamination of one lunched at the courts in perfect amity with the sucking barrister on the other side of the case for they had neither as yet reached that maturity which enables an advocate to call his enemy his friend and treat him with considerable asperity though among his acquaintances summerhay always provoked badinage in which he was scarcely ever defeated yet in chambers and court on circuit at his club in society or the huntingfield he had an unfavourable effect on the grosser sort of stories there are menby no means strikingly moralwho exercise this blighting influence they are generally what the french call spirituel and often have rather desperate loveaffairs which they keep very closely to themselves  when at last in chambers he had washed off that special reek of clothes and parchment faraway herrings and distemper which clings about the law dipping his whole curly head in water and towelling vigorously he set forth alone along the embankment his hat tilted up smoking a cigar it was nearly seven just this time yesterday he had got into the train just this time yesterday turned and seen the face which had refused to leave him since fever recurs at certain hours just so did the desire to see her mount within him becoming an obsession because it was impossible to gratify it one could not call at seven oclock the idea of his club where at this time of day he usually went seemed flat and stale until he remembered that he might pass up bury street to get to it but near charing cross a hand smote him on the shoulder and the voice of one of his intimates said  halo bryan  odd that he had never noticed before how vacuous this fellow waswith his talk of politics and racing of this ass and that asssubjects hitherto of primary importance and stopping suddenly he drawled out  look here old chap you go on see you at the clubpresently  why whats up  with his lazy smile summerhay answered  there are more things in heaven and earth horatio and turned on his heel  when his friend had disappeared he resumed his journey toward bury street he passed his boot shop where for some time he had been meaning to order two pairs and went by thinking i wonder where she goes for things her figure came to him so vividlysitting back in that corner or standing by the cab her hand in his the blood rushed up in his cheeks she had been scented like flowers andand a rainy wind he stood still before a plateglass window in confusion and suddenly muttered aloud damn it i believe i am an old gentleman passing turned so suddenly to see what he was that he ricked his neck  but summerhay still stood not taking in at all the reflected image of his frowning rueful face and of the cigar extinct between his lips then he shook his head vigorously and walked on he walked faster his mind blank as it is sometimes for a short space after a piece of sellrevelation that has come too soon for adjustment or even quite for understanding and when he began to think it was irritably and at random he had come to bury street and while he passed up it felt a queer weak sensation down the back of his legs no flowerboxes this year broke the plain front of wintons house and nothing whatever but its number and the quickened beating of his heart marked it out for summerhay from any other dwelling the moment he turned into jermyn street that beating of the heart subsided and he felt suddenly morose he entered his club at the top of st james street and passed at once into the least used room this was the library and going to the french section he took down the three musketeers and seated himself in a window with his back to anyone who might come in he had taken thishis favourite romance feeling in want of warmth and companionship but he did not read from where he sat he could throw a stone to where she was sitting perhaps except for walls he could almost reach her with his voice could certainly see her this was imbecile a woman he had only met twice imbecile he opened the book        oh no

another card her knee was touching his  the book had droppedsummerhay started  dash it hopeless and turning round in that huge armchair he snoozed down into its depths in a few minutes he was asleep he slept without a dream  it was two hours later when the same friend seeking distraction came on him and stood grinning down at that curly head and face which just then had the sleepy abandonment of a small boys maliciously he gave the chair a little kick  summerhay stirred and thought what where am i  in front of the grinning face above him floated another filmy charming he shook himself and sat up oh damn you  sorry old chap  what time is it  ten oclock  summerhay uttered an unintelligible sound and turning over on the other arm pretended to snooze down again but he slept no more instead he saw her face heard her voice and felt again the touch of her warm gloved hand   iii   at the opera that friday evening they were playing cavalleria and pagliacciworks of which gyp tolerated the first and loved the second while winton found them with faust and carmen about the only operas he could not sleep through  womens eyes which must not stare cover more space than the eyes of men which must not stare but do womens eyes have less method too seeing all things at once instead of one thing at a time gyp had seen summerhay long before he saw her seen him come in and fold his opera hat against his white waistcoat looking round as if forsomeone her eyes criticized him in this new garbhis broad head and its crisp dark shining hair his air of sturdy lazy lovable audacity he looked well in evening clothes when he sat down she could still see just a little of his profile and vaguely watching the stout santuzza and the stouter turiddu she wondered whether by fixing her eyes on him she could make him turn and see her just then he did see her and his face lighted up she smiled back why not she had not so many friends nowadays but it was rather startling to find after that exchange of looks that she at once began to want another would he like her dress was her hair nice she wished she had not had it washed that morning but when the interval came she did not look round until his voice said  how dyou do major winton oh how dyou do  winton had been told of the meeting in the train he was pining for a cigarette but had not liked to desert his daughter after a few remarks he got up and said  take my pew a minute summerhay im going to have a smoke  he went out thinking not for the first time by a thousand poor child she never sees a soul twentyfive pretty as paint and clean out of the running what the devil am i to do about her  summerhay sat down gyp had a queer feeling then as if the house and people vanished and they two were back again in the railwaycarriagealone together ten minutes to make the most of to smile and talk and enjoy the look in his eyes the sound of his voice and laugh to laugh too and be warm and nice to him why not they were friends and presently she said smiling  oh by the way theres a picture in the national gallery i want you to look at  yes which will you take me  if you like  tomorrows saturday may i meet you there what time three  gyp nodded she knew she was flushing and at that moment with the warmth in her cheeks and the smile in her eyes she had the sensation so rare and pleasant of feeling beautiful then he was gone her father was slipping back into his stall and afraid of her own face she touched his arm and murmured  dad do look at that headdress in the next row but one did you ever see anything so delicious  and while winton was stargazing the orchestra struck up the overture to pagliacci watching that heartbreaking little plot unfold gyp had something more than the old thrill as if for the first time she understood it with other than her aesthetic sense poor nedda and poor canio poor silvio her breast heaved and her eyes filled with tears within those doubled figures of the tragicomedy she seemed to see to feel that passionate lovetoo swift too strong too violent sweet and fearful within them    thou hast my heart and i am thine for ever   tonight and for ever i am thine   what is there left to me  what have i but a heart that is broken   and the clear heartaching music mocking it all down to those last words  la commedia e finita  while she was putting on her cloak her eyes caught summerhays she tried to smilecould not gave a shake of her head slowly forced her gaze away from his and turned to follow winton   at the national gallery next day she was not late by coquetry but because she had changed her dress at the last minute and because she was afraid of letting him think her eager she saw him at once standing under the colonnade looking by no means imperturbable and marked the change in his face when he caught sight of her with a little thrill she led him straight up into the first italian room to contemplate his counterfeit a top hat and modern collar did not improve the likeness but it was there still  well do you like it  yes what are you smiling at  ive had a photograph of that ever since i was fifteen so you see ive known you a long time  he stared  great scott am i like that all right i shall try and find you now  but gyp shook her head  no come and look at my very favourite picture the death of procris what is it makes one love it so procris is out of drawing and not beautiful the fauns queer and ugly what is itcan you tell  summerhay looked not at the picture but at her in aesthetic sense he was not her equal she said softly  the wonder in the fauns face procriss closed eyes the dog and the swans and the pity for what might have been  summerhay repeated  ah for what might have been did you enjoy pagliacci  gyp shivered  i think i felt it too much  i thought you did i watched you  destruction byloveseems such a terrible thing now show me your favourites i believe i can tell you what they are though  well  the admiral for one  yes what others  the two bellinis  by jove you are uncanny  gyp laughed  you want decision clarity colour and fine texture is that right heres another of my favourites  on a screen was a tiny crucifixion by da messinathe thinnest of high crosses the thinnest of simple humble suffering christs lonely and actual in the clear darkened landscape  i think that touches one more than the big idealized sort one feels it was like that oh and lookthe francescas arent they lovely  he repeated  yes lovely but his eyes said and so are you  they spent two hours among those endless pictures talking a little of art and of much besides almost as alone as in the railway carriage but when she had refused to let him walk back with her summerhay stood stockstill beneath the colonnade the sun streamed in under the pigeons preened their feathers people passed behind him and down there in the square black and tiny against the lions and the great column he took in nothing of all that what was it in her she was like no one he had ever knownnot one different from girls and women in society assimile failed still more different from anything in the halfworld he had met not the new sortcollege suffrage like no one and he knew so little of her not even whether she had ever really been in love her husbandwhere was he what was he to her the rare the mute the inexpressive she when she smiled when her eyesbut her eyes were so quick would drop before he could see right into them how beautiful she had looked gazing at that pictureher favourite so softly her lips just smiling if he could kiss them would he not go nearly mad with a deep sigh he moved down the wide grey steps into the sunlight and london throbbing overflowing with the seasons life seemed to him empty tomorrowyes tomorrow he could call   iv   after that sunday call gyp sat in the window at bury street close to a bowl of heliotrope on the windowsill she was thinking over a passage of their conversation  mrs fiorsen tell me about yourself  why what do you want to know  your marriage  i made a fearful mistakeagainst my fathers wish i havent seen my husband for months i shall never see him again if i can help it is that enough  and you love him  no  it must be like having your head in chancery cant you get it out  no  why  divorcecourt ugh i couldnt  yes i knowits hellish  was he who gripped her hand so hard and said that really the same nonchalant young man who had leaned out of the carriage window gurgling with laughter and what had made the difference she buried her face in the heliotrope whose perfume seemed the memory of his visit then going to the piano began to play she played debussy mcdowell ravel the chords of modern music suited her feelings just then and she was still playing when her father came in during these last nine months of his daughters society he had regained a distinct measure of youthfulness an extra twist in his little moustache an extra touch of dandyism in his clothes and the gloss of his short hair gyp stopped playing at once and shut the piano  mr summerhays been here dad he was sorry to miss you  there was an appreciable pause before winton answered  my dear i doubt it  and there passed through gyp the thought that she could never again be friends with a man without giving that pause then conscious that her father was gazing at her she turned and said  well was it nice in the park  thirty years ago they were all nobs and snobs now god himself doesnt know what they are  but werent the flowers nice  ahand the trees and the birdsbut by jove the humans do their best to dress the balance  what a misanthrope youre getting  id like to run a stud for twoleggers they want proper breeding what sort of a fellow is young summerhay not a bad face  she answered impassively  yes its so alive  in spite of his selfcontrol she could always read her fathers thoughts quicker than he could read hers and knew that he was struggling between the wish that she should have a good time and the desire to convey some kind of warning he said with a sigh  what does a young mans fancy turn to in summer gyp   women who have subtle instincts and some experience are able to impose their own restraint on those who at the lifting of a hand would become their lovers from that afternoon on gyp knew that a word from her would change everything but she was far from speaking it and yet except at weekends when she went back to her baby at mildenham she saw summerhay most daysin the row at the opera or at bury street she had a habit of going to st jamess park in the late afternoon and sitting there by the water was it by chance that he passed one day on his way home from chambers and that after this they sat there together constantly why make her father uneasywhen there was nothing to be uneasy aboutby letting him come too often to bury street it was so pleasant too out there talking calmly of many things while in front of them the small ragged children fished and put the fishes into clear glass bottles to eat or watch on rainy days as is the custom of man with the minor works of god  so in nature when the seasons are about to change the days pass tranquil waiting for the wind that brings in the new and was it not natural to sit under the trees by the flowers and the water the pigeons and the ducks that wonderful july for all was peaceful in gyps mind except now and then when a sort of remorse possessed her a sort of terror and a sort of troubling sweetness   v   summerhay did not wear his heart on his sleeve and when on the closingday of term he left his chambers to walk to that last meeting his face was much as usual under his grey top hat but in truth he had come to a pretty pass he had his own code of what was befitting to a gentleman it was perhaps a trifle old georgian but it included doing nothing to distress a woman all these weeks he had kept himself in hand but to do so had cost him more than he liked to reflect on the only witness of his struggles was his old scotch terrier whose dreams he had disturbed night after night tramping up and down the long backtofront sittingroom of his little house she knewmust knowwhat he was feeling if she wanted his love she had but to raise her finger and she had not raised it when he touched her when her dress disengaged its perfume or his eyes traced the slow soft movement of her breathing his head would go round and to keep calm and friendly had been torture  while he could see her almost every day this control had been just possible but now that he was about to lose herfor weekshis heart felt sick within him he had been hard put to it before the world a man passionately in love craves solitude in which to alternate between fierce exercise and that trancelike stillness when a lover simply aches or is busy conjuring her face up out of darkness or the sunlight he had managed to do his work had been grateful for having it to do but to his friends he had not given attention enough to prevent them saying whats up with old bryan always rather elusive in his movements he was now too elusive altogether for those who had been accustomed to lunch dine dance and sport with him and yet he shunned his own companygoing wherever strange faces life anything distracted him a little without demanding real attention it must be confessed that he had come unwillingly to discovery of the depth of his passion aware that it meant giving up too much but there are women who inspire feeling so direct and simple that reason does not come into play and he had never asked himself whether gyp was worth loving whether she had this or that quality such or such virtue he wanted her exactly as she was and did not weigh her in any sort of balance it is possible for men to love passionately yet know that their passion is but desire possible for men to love for sheer spiritual worth feeling that the loved one lacks this or that charm  summerhays love had no such divided consciousness about her past too he dismissed speculation he remembered having heard in the huntingfield that she was wintons natural daughter even then it had made him long to punch the head of that covertside scandalmonger the more there might be against the desirability of loving her the more he would love her even her wretched marriage only affected him in so far as it affected her happiness it did not matternothing mattered except to see her and be with her as much as she would let him and now she was going to the sea for a month and he himselfcurse itwas due in perthshire to shoot grouse a month  he walked slowly along the river dared he speak at times her face was like a childs when it expects some harsh or frightening word one could not hurt herimpossible but at times he had almost thought she would like him to speak once or twice he had caught a slow soft glancegone the moment he had sight of it  he was before his time and leaning on the river parapet watched the tide run down the sun shone on the water brightening its yellowish swirl and little black eddiesthe same water that had flowed along under the willows past eynsham past oxford under the church at clifton past moulsford past sonning and he thought my god to have her to myself one day on the riverone whole long day why had he been so pusillanimous all this time he passed his hand over his face broad faces do not easily grow thin but his felt thin to him and this gave him a kind of morbid satisfaction if she knew how he was longing how he suffered he turned away toward whitehall two men he knew stopped to bandy a jest one of them was just married they too were off to scotland for the twelfth pah how stale and flat seemed that which till then had been the acme of the whole year to him ah but if he had been going to scotland with her he drew his breath in with a sigh that nearly removed the home office  oblivious of the gorgeous sentries at the horse guards oblivious of all beauty he passed irresolute along the water making for their usual seat already in fancy he was sitting there prodding at the gravel a nervous twittering in his heart and that eternal question dare i speak asking itself within him and suddenly he saw that she was before him sitting there already his heart gave a jump no more craninghe would speak  she was wearing a maizecoloured muslin to which the sunlight gave a sort of transparency and sat leaning back her knees crossed one hand resting on the knob of her furled sunshade her face half hidden by her shady hat summerhay clenched his teeth and went straight up to her  gyp no i wont call you anything else this cant go on you know it cant you know i worship you if you cant love me ive got to break away all day all night i think and dream of nothing but you gyp do you want me to go  suppose she said yes go she made a little movement as if in protest and without looking at him answered very low  of course i dont want you to go how could i  summerhay gasped  then you do love me  she turned her face away  wait please wait a little longer when we come back ill tell you i promise  so long  a month is that long please its not easy for me she smiled faintly lifted her eyes to him just for a second please not any more now  that evening at his club through the bluish smoke of cigarette after cigarette he saw her face as she had lifted it for that one second and now he was in heaven now in hell   vi   the verandahed bungalow on the south coast built and inhabited by an artist friend of aunt rosamunds had a garden of which the chief feature was one pinetree which had strayed in advance of the wood behind the little house stood in solitude just above a low bank of cliff whence the beach sank in sandy ridges the verandah and thick pine wood gave ample shade and the beach all the sun and sea air needful to tan little gyp a fat tumbling soul as her mother had been at the same age incurably fond and fearless of dogs or any kind of beast and speaking words already that required a glossary  at night gyp looking from her bedroom through the flat branches of the pine would get a feeling of being the only creature in the world the crinkled silvery sea that lonely pinetree the cold moon the sky dark cornflower blue the hiss and sucking rustle of the surf over the beach pebbles even the salt chill air seemed lonely by day tooin the hazy heat when the clouds merged scarce drifting into the blue and the coarse seagrass tufts hardly quivered and seabirds passed close above the water with chuckle and cryit all often seemed part of a dream she bathed and grew as tanned as her little daughter a regular gypsy in her broad hat and linen frocks and yet she hardly seemed to be living down here at all for she was never free of the memory of that last meeting with summerhay why had he spoken and put an end to their quiet friendship and left her to such heartsearchings all by herself but she did not want his words unsaid only how to know whether to recoil and fly or to pass beyond the dread of letting herself go of plunging deep into the unknown depths of loveof that passion whose nature for the first time she had tremulously felt watching pagliacciand had ever since been feeling and trembling at must it really be neck or nothing did she care enough to break through all barriers fling herself into midstream when they could see each other every day it was so easy to live for the next meetingnot think of what was coming after but now with all else cut away there was only the future to think abouthers and his but need she trouble about his would he not just love her as long as he liked  then she thought of her fatherstill faithful to a memoryand felt ashamed some men loved onyeseven beyond death but sometimes she would think am i a candleflame again is he just going to burn himself what real good can i be to himi without freedom and with my baby who will grow up yet all these thoughts were in a way unreal the struggle was in herself so deep that she could hardly understand it as might be an effort to subdue the instinctive dread of a precipice and she would feel a kind of resentment against all the happy life round her these summer daysthe seabirds the sunlight and the waves the white sails far out the calm sunsteeped pinetrees her baby tumbling and smiling and softly twittering and betty and the other servantsall this life that seemed so simple and untortured  to the one post each day she looked forward terribly and yet his letters which began like hers my dear friend might have been read by anyonealmost she spent a long time over her answers she was not sleeping well and lying awake she could see his face very distinct before her closed eyesits teasing lazy smile its sudden intent gravity once she had a dream of him rushing past her down into the sea she called but without turning his head he swam out further further till she lost sight of him and woke up suddenly with a pain in her heart if you cant love me ive got to break away his face his flungback head reminded her too sharply of those words now that he was away from her would he not feel that it was best to break and forget her up there he would meet girls untouched by lifenot like herself he had everything before him could he possibly go on wanting one who had nothing before her some blueeyed girl with auburn hairthat type so superior to her ownwould sweep perhaps had already swept him away from her what then no worse than it used to be ah so much worse that she dared not think of it  then for five days no letter came and with each blank morning the ache in her grewa sharp definite ache of longing and jealousy utterly unlike the mere feeling of outraged pride when she had surprised fiorsen and daphne wing in the musicrooma hundred years ago it seemed when on the fifth day the postman left nothing but a bill for little gyps shoes and a note from aunt rosamund at harrogate where she had gone with winton for the annual cure gyps heart sank to the depths was this the end and with a blind numb feeling she wandered out into the wood where the fall of the pineneedles season after season had made of the ground one soft dark dustcoloured bed on which the sunlight traced the pattern of the pine boughs and ants rummaged about their great heaped dwellings  gyp went along till she could see no outer world for the greybrown treestems streaked with gumresin and throwing herself down on her face dug her elbows deep into the pine dust tears so rare with her forced their way up and trickled slowly to the hands whereon her chin rested no goodcrying crying only made her ill crying was no relief she turned over on her back and lay motionless the sunbeams warm on her cheeks silent here even at noon the sough of the calm sea could not reach so far the flies were few no bird sang the tall bare pine stems rose up all round like columns in a temple roofed with the dark boughs and sky cloudfleeces drifted slowly over the blue there should be peacebut in her heart there was none  a dusky shape came padding through the trees a little way off anothertwo donkeys loose from somewhere who stood licking each others necks and noses those two humble beasts so friendly made her feel ashamed why should she be sorry for herself she who had everything in life she wantedexcept lovethe love she had thought she would never want ah but she wanted it now wanted it at last with all her being  with a shudder she sprang up the ants had got to her and she had to pick them off her neck and dress she wandered back towards the beach if he had truly found someone to fill his thoughts and drive her out all the better for him she would never by word or sign show him that she missed and wanted himnever she would sooner die  she came out into the sunshine the tide was low and the wet foreshore gleamed with opal tints there were wandering tracks on the sea as of great serpents winding their way beneath the surface and away to the west the archwayed tawny rock that cut off the line of coast was like a dreamshape all was dreamy and suddenly her heart began beating to suffocation and the colour flooded up in her cheeks on the edge of the low cliff bank by the side of the path summerhay was sitting  he got up and came toward her putting her hands up to her glowing face she said  yes its me did you ever see such a gipsified object i thought you were still in scotland hows dear ossy then her selfpossession failed and she looked down  its no good gyp i must know  it seemed to gyp that her heart had given up beating she said quietly lets sit down a minute and moved under the cliff bank where they could not be seen from the house there drawing the coarse grass blades through her fingers she said with a shiver  i didnt try to make you did i i never tried  no never  its wrong  who cares no one could care who loves as i do oh gyp cant you love me i know im nothing much how quaint and boyish but its eleven weeks today since we met in the train i dont think ive had one minutes letup since  have you tried  why should i when i love you  gyp sighed relief delight painshe did not know  then what is to be done look over therethat bit of blue in the grass is my baby daughter theres herand my fatherand  and what  im afraidafraid of love bryan  at that first use of his name summerhay turned pale and seized her hand  afraidhowafraid  gyp said very low  i might love too much dont say any more now no dont lets go in and have lunch and she got up  he stayed till teatime and not a word more of love did he speak but when he was gone she sat under the pinetree with little gyp on her lap love if her mother had checked love she herself would never have been born the midges were biting before she went in after watching betty give little gyp her bath she crossed the passage to her bedroom and leaned out of the window could it have been today she had lain on the ground with tears of despair running down on to her hands away to the left of the pinetree the moon had floated up soft barely visible in the paling sky a new world an enchanted garden and between her and itwhat was there  that evening she sat with a book on her lap not reading and in her went on the strange revolution which comes in the souls of all women who are not halfmen when first they lovethe sinking of i into thou the passionate spiritual subjection the intense unconscious givingup of will in preparation for completer union  she slept without dreaming awoke heavy and oppressed too languid to bathe she sat listless on the beach with little gyp all the morning had she energy or spirit to meet him in the afternoon by the rock archway as she had promised for the first time since she was a small and naughty child she avoided the eyes of betty one could not be afraid of that stout devoted soul but one could feel that she knew too much when the time came after early tea she started out for if she did not go he would come and she did not want the servants to see him two days running  this last day of august was warm and still and had a kind of beneficencethe corn all gathered in the apples mellowing robins singing already a few slumberous soft clouds a pale blue sky a smiling sea she went inland across the stream and took a footpath back to the shore no pines grew on that side where the soil was richerof a ruddy brown the second crops of clover were already high in them humblebees were hard at work and above the whitethroated swallows dipped and soared gyp gathered a bunch of chicory flowers she was close above the shore before she saw him standing in the rock archway looking for her across the beach after the hum of the bees and flies it was very quiet hereonly the faintest hiss of tiny waves he had not yet heard her coming and the thought flashed through her if i take another step it is for ever she stood there scarcely breathing the chicory flowers held before her lips then she heard him sigh and moving quickly forward said  here i am  he turned round seized her hand and without a word they passed through the archway they walked on the hard sand side by side till he said  lets go up into the fields  they scrambled up the low cliff and went along the grassy top to a gate into a stubble field he held it open for her but as she passed caught her in his arms and kissed her lips as if he would never stop to her who had been kissed a thousand times it was the first kiss deadly pale she fell back from him against the gate then her lips still quivering her eyes very dark she looked at him distraught with passion drunk on that kiss and suddenly turning round to the gate she laid her arms on the top bar and buried her face on them a sob came up in her throat that seemed to tear her to bits and she cried as if her heart would break his timid despairing touches his voice close to her ear  gyp gyp my darling my love oh dont gyp were not of the least avail she could not stop that kiss had broken down something in her soul swept away her life up to that moment done something terrible and wonderful at last she struggled out  im sorryso sorry dontdont look at me go away a little and illill be all right  he obeyed without a word and passing through the gate sat down on the edge of the cliff with his back to her looking out over the sea  gripping the wood of the old grey gate till it hurt her hands gyp gazed at the chicory flowers and poppies that had grown up again in the stubble field at the butterflies chasing in the sunlight over the hedge toward the crinkly foam edging the quiet sea till they were but fluttering white specks in the blue  but when she had rubbed her cheeks and smoothed her face she was no nearer to feeling that she could trust herself what had happened in her was too violent too sweet too terrifying and going up to him she said  let me go home now by myself please let me go dear tomorrow  summerhay looked up  whatever you wish gypalways  he pressed her hand against his cheek then let it go and folding his arms tight resumed his meaningless stare at the sea gyp turned away she crossed back to the other side of the stream but did not go in for a long time sitting in the pine wood till the evening gathered and the stars crept out in a sky of that mauveblue which the psychic say is the soulgarment colour of the good  late that night when she had finished brushing her hair she opened her window and stepped out on to the verandah how warm how still not a sound from the sleeping housenot a breath of wind her face framed in her hair her hands and all her body felt as if on fire the moon behind the pinetree branches was filling every cranny of her brain with wakefulness the soft shiver of the wellnigh surfless sea on a rising tide rose fell rose fell the sand cliff shone like a bank of snow and all was inhabited as a moonlit night is wont to be by a magical presence a big moth went past her face so close that she felt the flutter of its wings a little night beast somewhere was scruttling in bushes or the sand suddenly across the wan grass the shadow of the pinetrunk moved it movedever so littlemoved and petrifiedgyp stared there joined to the trunk summerhay was standing his face just visible against the stem the moonlight on one cheek a hand shading his eyes he moved that hand held it out in supplication for longhow longgyp did not stir looking straight at that beseeching figure then with a feeling she had never known she saw him coming he came up to the verandah and stood looking up at her she could see all the workings of his facepassion reverence above all amazement and she heard his awed whisper  is it you gyp really you you look so youngso young   vii   from the moment of surrender gyp passed straight into a state the more enchanted because she had never believed in it had never thought that she could love as she now loved days and nights went by in a sort of dream and when summerhay was not with her she was simply waiting with a smile on her lips for the next hour of meeting just as she had never felt it possible to admit the world into the secrets of her married life so now she did not consider the world at all only the thought of her father weighed on her conscience he was back in town and she felt that she must tell him when summerhay heard this he only said all right gyp whatever you think best  and two days before her month at the bungalow was up she went leaving betty and little gyp to follow on the last day winton pale and somewhat languid as men are when they have been cured found her when he came in from the club she had put on evening dress and above the pallor of her shoulders her sunwarmed face and throat had almost the colour of a nectarine he had never seen her look like that never seen her eyes so full of light and he uttered a quiet grunt of satisfaction it was as if a flower which he had last seen in close and elegant shape had bloomed in full perfection she did not meet his gaze quite steadily and all that evening kept putting her confession off and off it was not easyfar from easy at last when he was smoking his gotobed cigarette she took a cushion and sank down on it beside his chair leaning against his knee where her face was hidden from him as on that day after her first ball when she had listened to his confession and she began  dad do you remember my saying once that i didnt understand what you and my mother felt for each other winton did not speak misgiving had taken possession of him gyp went on i know now how one would rather die than give someone up  winton drew his breath in sharply  who summerhay  yes i used to think i should never be in love but you knew better  better  in disconsolate silence he thought rapidly whats to be done what can i do get her a divorce  perhaps because of the ring in her voice or the sheer seriousness of the position he did not feel resentment as when he lost her to fiorsen love a passion such as had overtaken her mother and himself and this young man a decent fellow a good ridercomprehensible ah if the course had only been clear he put his hand on her shoulder and said  well gyp we must go for the divorce then after all  she shook her head  its too late let him divorce me if he only will  winton needed all his selfcontrol at that moment too late already sudden recollection that he had not the right to say a word alone kept him silent gyp went on  i love him with every bit of me i dont care what comeswhether its open or secret i dont care what anybody thinks  she had turned round now and if winton had doubt of her feeling he lost it this was a gyp he had never seen a glowing soft quickbreathing creature with just that lithe watchful look of the mother cat or lioness whose whelps are threatened there flashed through him a recollection of how as a child with face very tense she would ride at fences that were too big at last he said  im sorry you didnt tell me sooner  i couldnt i didnt know oh dad im always hurting you forgive me  she was pressing his hand to her cheek that felt burning hot and he thought forgive of course i forgive thats not the point the point is  and a vision of his loved one talked about besmirched bandied from mouth to mouth or elsefor her what there had been for him a holeandcorner life an underground existence of stealthy meetings kept dark above all from her own little daughter ah not that and yetwas not even that better than the other which revolted to the soul his fastidious pride in her roused in advance his fury against tongues that would wag and eyes that would wink or be uplifted in righteousness summerhays world was more or less his world scandal whichlike all parasitic growthsflourishes in enclosed spaces would have every chance and at once his brain began to search steely and quick for some way out and the expression as when a fox broke covert came on his face  nobody knows gyp  no nobody  that was something with an irritation that rose from his very soul he muttered  i cant stand it that you should suffer and that fellow fiorsen go scotfree can you give up seeing summerhay while we get you a divorce we might do it if no one knows i think you owe it to me gyp  gyp got up and stood by the window a long time without answering winton watched her face at last she said  i couldnt we might stop seeing each other it isnt that its what i should feel i shouldnt respect myself after i should feel so mean oh dad dont you see he really loved me in his way and to pretend to make out a case for myself tell about daphne wing about his drinking and baby pretend that i wanted him to love me when i got to hate it and didnt care really whether he was faithful or notand knowing all the while that ive been everything to someone else i couldnt id much rather let him know and ask him to divorce me  winton replied  and suppose he wont  then my mind would be clear anyway and we would take what we could  and little gyp  staring before her as if trying to see into the future she said slowly  some day shell understand as i do or perhaps it will be all over before she knows does happiness ever last  and going up to him she bent over kissed his forehead and went out the warmth from her lips and the scent of her remained with winton like a sensation wafted from the past  was there then nothing to be donenothing men of his stamp do not as a general thing see very deep even into those who are nearest to them but tonight he saw his daughters nature more fully perhaps than ever before no use to importune her to act against her instinctsnot a bit of use and yethow to sit and watch it allwatch his own passion with its ecstasy and its heartburnings reenacted with herperhaps for many years and the old vulgar saying passed through his mind whats bred in the bone will come out in the meat now she had given she would give with both handsbeyond measurebeyondas he himself as her mother had given ah well she was better off than his own loved one had been one must not go ahead of trouble or cry over spilled milk   viii   gyp had a wakeful night the question she herself had raised of telling fiorsen kept her thoughts in turmoil was he likely to divorce her if she did his contempt for what he called these bourgeois morals his instability the very unpleasantness and offence to his vanityall this would prevent him no he would not divorce her she was sure unless by any chance he wanted legal freedom and that was quite unlikely what then would be gained ease for her conscience but had she any right to ease her conscience if it brought harm to her lover and was it not ridiculous to think of conscience in regard to one who within a year of marriage had taken to himself a mistress and not even spared the home paid for and supported by his wife no if she told fiorsen it would only be to salve her pride wounded by doing what she did not avow besides where was he at the other end of the world for all she knew  she came down to breakfast dark under the eyes and no whit advanced toward decision neither of them mentioned their last nights talk and gyp went back to her room to busy herself with dress after those weeks away it was past noon when at a muffled knock she found markey outside her door  mr fiorsen mm  gyp beckoned him in and closed the door  in the hall mmslipped in when i answered the bell short of shoving i couldnt keep him out  gyp stood full half a minute before she said  is my father in  no mm the majors gone to the fencinclub  what did you say  said i would see so far as i was aware nobody was in shall i have a try to shift him mm  with a faint smile gyp shook her head  say no one can see him  markeys woodcock eyes under their thin dark twisting brows fastened on her dolefully he opened the door to go fiorsen was standing there and with a quick movement came in she saw markey raise his arms as if to catch him round the waist and said quietly  markeywait outside please  when the door was shut she retreated against her dressingtable and stood gazing at her husband while her heart throbbed as if it would leap through its coverings  he had grown a short beard his cheeks seemed a little fatter and his eyes surely more green otherwise he looked much as she remembered him and the first thought that passed through her was why did i ever pity him hell never fret or drink himself to deathhes got enough vitality for twenty men  his face which had worn a fixed nervous smile grew suddenly grave as her own and his eyes roved round the room in the old halffierce halffurtive way  well gyp he said and his voice shook a little at last wont you kiss me  the question seemed to gyp idiotic and suddenly she felt quite cool  if you want to speak to my father you must come later hes out  fiorsen gave one of his fierce shrugs  is it likely look gyp i returned from russia yesterday i was a great success made a lot of money out there come back to me i will be goodi swear it now i have seen you again i cant be without you ah gyp come back to me and see how good i will be i will take you abroad you and the bambina we will go to romeanywhere you likelive how you like only come back to me  gyp answered stonily  you are talking nonsense  gyp i swear to you i have not seen a womannot one fit to put beside you oh gyp be good to me once more this time i will not fail try me try me my gyp  only at this moment of his pleading whose tragic tones seemed to her both false and childish did gyp realize the strength of the new feeling in her heart and the more that feeling throbbed within her the harder her face and her voice grew she said  if that is all you came to sayplease go i will never come back to you once for all understand please  the silence in which he received her words and his expression impressed her far more than his appeal with one of his stealthy movements he came quite close and putting his face forward till it almost touched her said  you are my wife i want you back i must have you back if you do not come i will kill either you or myself  and suddenly she felt his arms knotted behind her back crushing her to him she stilled a scream then very swiftly took a resolve and rigid in his arms said  let go you hurt me sit down quietly i will tell you something  the tone of her voice made him loosen his grasp and crane back to see her face gyp detached his arms from her completely sat down on an old oak chest and motioned him to the windowseat her heart thumped pitifully cold waves of almost physical sickness passed through and through her she had smelt brandy in his breath when he was close to her it was like being in the cage of a wild beast it was like being with a madman the remembrance of him with his fingers stretched out like claws above her baby was so vivid at that moment that she could scarcely see him as he was sitting there quietly waiting for what she was going to say and fixing her eyes on him she said softly  you say you love me gustav i tried to love you too but i never couldnever from the first i tried very hard surely you care what a woman feels even if she happens to be your wife  she could see his face quiver and she went on  when i found i couldnt love you i felt i had no right over you i didnt stand on my rights did i  again his face quivered and again she hurried on  but you wouldnt expect me to go all through my life without ever feeling loveyou whove felt it so many times then clasping her hands tight with a sort of wonder at herself she murmured i am in love ive given myself  he made a queer whining sound covering his face and the beggars tag ave a feelin eart gentlemanave a feelin eart passed idiotically through gyps mind would he get up and strangle her should she dash to the doorescape for a long miserable moment she watched him swaying on the windowseat with his face covered then without looking at her he crammed a clenched hand up against his mouth and rushed out  through the open door gyp had a glimpse of markeys motionless figure coming to life as fiorsen passed she drew a long breath locked the door and lay down on her bed her heart beat dreadfully for a moment something had checked his jealous rage but if on this shock he began to drink what might not happen he had said something wild and she shuddered but what right had he to feel jealousy and rage against her what right she got up and went to the glass trembling mechanically tidying her hair miraculous that she had come through unscathed  her thoughts flew to summerhay they were to meet at three oclock by the seat in st jamess park but all was different now difficult and dangerous she must wait take counsel with her father and yet if she did not keep that tryst how anxious he would bethinking that all sorts of things had happened to her thinking perhapsoh foolishthat she had forgotten or even repented of her love what would she herself think if he were to fail her at their first tryst after those days of bliss certainly that he had changed his mind seen she was not worth it seen that a woman who could give herself so soon so easily was one to whom he could not sacrifice his life  in this cruel uncertainty she spent the next two hours till it was nearly three if she did not go out he would come on to bury street and that would be still more dangerous she put on her hat and walked swiftly towards st jamess palace once sure that she was not being followed her courage rose and she passed rapidly down toward the water she was ten minutes late and seeing him there walking up and down turning his head every few seconds so as not to lose sight of the bench she felt almost lightheaded from joy when they had greeted with that pathetic casualness of lovers which deceives so few they walked on together past buckingham palace up into the green park beneath the trees during this progress she told him about her father but only when they were seated in that comparative refuge and his hand was holding hers under cover of the sunshade that lay across her knee did she speak of fiorsen  he tightened his grasp of her hand then suddenly dropping it said  did he touch you gyp  gyp heard that question with a shock touch her yes but what did it matter  he made a little shuddering sound and wondering mournful she looked at him his hands and teeth were clenched she said softly  bryan dont i wouldnt let him kiss me  he seemed to have to force his eyes to look at her  its all right he said and staring before him bit his nails  gyp sat motionless cut to the heart she was soiled and spoiled for him of course and yet a sense of injustice burned in her her heart had never been touched it was his utterly but that was not enough for a manhe wanted an untouched body too that she could not give he should have thought of that sooner instead of only now and miserably she too stared before her and her face hardened  a little boy came and stood still in front of them regarding her with round unmoving eyes she was conscious of a slice of bread and jam in his hand and that his mouth and cheeks were smeared with red a woman called out jacky come on now and he was hauled away still looking back and holding out his bread and jam as though offering her a bite she felt summerhays arm slipping round her  its over darling never againi promise you  ah he might promisemight even keep that promise but he would suffer always suffer thinking of that other and she said  you can only have me as i am bryan i cant make myself new for you i wish i couldoh i wish i could  i ought to have cut my tongue out first dont think of it come home to me and have teatheres no one there ah do gypcome  he took her hands and pulled her up and all else left gyp but the joy of being close to him going to happiness   ix   fiorsen passing markey like a blind man made his way out into the street but had not gone a hundred yards before he was hurrying back he had left his hat the servant still standing there handed him that widebrimmed object and closed the door in his face once more he moved away going towards piccadilly if it had not been for the expression on gyps face what might he not have done and mixed with sickening jealousy he felt a sort of relief as if he had been saved from something horrible so she had never loved him never at all impossible impossible that a woman on whom he had lavished such passion should never have felt passion for himnever any innumerable images of her passed before himsurrendering always surrendering it could not all have been pretence he was not a common manshe herself had said so he had charmor other women thought so she had lied she must have lied to excuse herself  he went into a cafe and asked for a fine champagne they brought him a carafe with the measures marked he sat there a long time when he rose he had drunk nine and he felt better with a kind of ferocity that was pleasant in his veins and a kind of nobility that was pleasant in his soul let her love and be happy with her lover but let him get his fingers on that fellows throat let her be happy if she could keep her lover from him and suddenly he stopped in his tracks for there on a sandwichboard just in front of him were the words daphne wing pantheon daphne wing plastic danseuse poetry of motion today at three oclock pantheon daphne wing  ah she had loved himlittle daphne it was past three going in he took his place in the stalls close to the stage and stared before him with a sort of bitter amusement this was irony indeed ahand here she came a pierrettein short diaphanous muslin her face whitened to match it a pierrette who stood slowly spinning on her toes with arms raised and hands joined in an arch above her glistening hair  idiotic pose idiotic but there was the old expression on her face limpid dovelike and that something of the divine about her dancing smote fiorsen through all the sheer imbecility of her posturings across and across she flitted pirouetting caught up at intervals by a pierrot in black tights with a face as whitened as her own held upside down or right end up with one knee bent sideways and the toe of a foot pressed against the ankle of the other and arms arched above her then with pierrots hands grasping her waist she would stand upon one toe and slowly twiddle lifting her other leg toward the roof while the trembling of her form manifested cunningly to all how hard it was then off the toe she capered out to the wings and capered back wearing on her face that divine lost dovelike look while her perfect legs gleamed white up to the very thighjoint yes on the stage she was adorable and raising his hands high fiorsen clapped and called out brava he marked the sudden roundness of her eyes a tiny startno more she had seen him ah some dont forget me he thought  and now she came on for her second dance assisted this time only by her own image reflected in a little weedy pool about the middle of the stage from the programme fiorsen read ophelias last dance and again he grinned in a clinging seagreen gown cut here and there to show her inevitable legs with marguerites and cornflowers in her unbound hair she circled her own reflection languid pale desolate then slowly gaining the abandon needful to a full display danced with frenzy till in a gleam of limelight she sank into the apparent water and floated among paper waterlilies on her back lovely she looked there with her eyes still open her lips parted her hair trailing behind and again fiorsen raised his hands high to clap and again called out brava but the curtain fell and ophelia did not reappear was it the sight of him or was she preserving the illusion that she was drowned that arty touch would be just like her  averting his eyes from two comedians in calico beating each other about the body he rose with an audible pish and made his way out he stopped in the street to scribble on his card will you see meg f and took it round to the stagedoor the answer came back  miss wing will see you m a minute sir  and leaning against the distempered wall of the draughty corridor a queer smile on his face fiorsen wondered why the devil he was there and what the devil she would say  when he was admitted she was standing with her hat on while her dresser buttoned her patentleather shoes holding out her hand above the womans back she said  oh mr fiorsen how do you do  fiorsen took the little moist hand and his eyes passed over her avoiding a direct meeting with her eyes he received an impression of something harder more selfpossessed than he remembered her face was the same yet not the same only her perfect supple little body was as it had been the dresser rose murmured goodafternoon miss and went  daphne wing smiled faintly  i havent seen you for a long time have i  no ive been abroad you dance as beautifully as ever  oh yes it hasnt hurt my dancing  with an effort he looked her in the face was this really the same girl who had clung to him cloyed him with her kisses her tears her appeals for lovejust a little love ah but she was more desirable much more desirable than he had remembered and he said  give me a kiss little daphne  daphne wing did not stir her white teeth rested on her lower lip she said  oh no thank you how is mrs fiorsen  fiorsen turned abruptly  there is none  oh has she divorced you  no stop talking of her stop talking i say  daphne wing still motionless in the centre of her little crowded dressingroom said in a matteroffact voice  you are polite arent you its funny i cant tell whether im glad to see you i had a bad time you know and mrs fiorsen was an angel why do you come to see me now  exactly why had he come the thought flashed through him shell help me to forget and he said  i was a great brute to you daphne i came to make up if i can  oh no you cant make upthank you a shudder ran through her and she began drawing on her gloves you taught me a lot you know i ought to be quite grateful oh youve grown a little beard dyou think that improves you it makes you look rather like mephistopheles i think  fiorsen stared fixedly at that perfectly shaped face where a faint underdone pink mingled with the fairness of the skin was she mocking him impossible she looked too matter of fact  where do you live now he said  im on my own in a studio you can come and see it if you like  with pleasure  only youd better understand ive had enough of love  fiorsen grinned  even for another he said  daphne wing answered calmly  i wish you would treat me like a lady  fiorsen bit his lip and bowed  may i have the pleasure of giving you some tea  yes thank you im very hungry i dont eat lunch on matineedays i find it better not do you like my ophelia dance  its artificial  yes it is artificialits done with mirrors and wire netting you know but do i give you the illusion of being mad fiorsen nodded im so glad shall we go i do want my tea  she turned round scrutinized herself in the glass touched her hat with both hands revealing for a second all the poised beauty of her figure took a little bag from the back of a chair and said  i think if you dont mind going on its less conspicuous ill meet you at ruffelsthey have lovely things there au revoir  in a state of bewilderment irritation and queer meekness fiorsen passed down coventry street and entering the empty ruffels took a table near the window there he sat staring before him for the sudden vision of gyp sitting on that oaken chest at the foot of her bed had blotted the girl clean out the attendant coming to take his order gazed at his pale furious face and said mechanically  what can i get you please  looking up fiorsen saw daphne wing outside gazing at the cakes in the window she came in  oh here you are i should like iced coffee and walnut cake and some of those marzipan sweetsoh and some whipped cream with my cake do you mind and sitting down she fixed her eyes on his face and asked  where have you been abroad  stockholm budapest moscow other places  how perfect do you think i should make a success in budapest or moscow  you might you are english enough  oh do you think im very english  utterly your kind of but even he was not quite capable of finishing that sentenceyour kind of vulgarity could not be produced anywhere else daphne wing finished it for him  my kind of beauty  fiorsen grinned and nodded  oh i think thats the nicest thing you ever said to me only of course i should like to think im more of the greek typepagan you know  she fell silent casting her eyes down her profile at that moment against the light was very pure and soft in line and he said  i suppose you hate me little daphne you ought to hate me  daphne wing looked up her round bluegrey eyes passed over him much as they had been passing over the marzipan  no i dont hate younow of course if i had any love left for you i should oh isnt that irish but one can think anybody a rotter without hating them cant one  fiorsen bit his lips  so you think me a rotter  daphne wings eyes grew rounder  but arent you you couldnt be anything elsecould youwith the sort of things you did  and yet you dont mind having tea with me  daphne wing who had begun to eat and drink said with her mouth full  you see im independent now and i know life that makes you harmless  fiorsen stretched out his hand and seized hers just where her little warm pulse was beating very steadily she looked at it changed her fork over and went on eating with the other hand fiorsen drew his hand away as if he had been stung  ah you have changedthat is certain  yes you wouldnt expect anything else would you you see one doesnt go through that for nothing i think i was a dreadful little fool she stopped with her spoon on its way to her mouthand yet  i love you still little daphne  she slowly turned her head toward him and a faint sigh escaped her  once i would have given a lot to hear that  and turning her head away again she picked a large walnut out of her cake and put it in her mouth  are you coming to see my studio ive got it rather nice and new im making twentyfive a week my next engagement im going to get thirty i should like mrs fiorsen to knowoh i forgot you dont like me to speak of her why not i wish youd tell me gazing as the attendant had at his furious face she went on i dont know how it is but im not a bit afraid of you now i used to be oh how is count rosek is he as pale as ever arent you going to have anything more youve had hardly anything dyou know what i should likea chocolate eclair and a raspberry icecream soda with a slice of tangerine in it  when she had slowly sucked up that beverage prodding the slice of tangerine with her straws they went out and took a cab on that journey to her studio fiorsen tried to possess himself of her hand but folding her arms across her chest she said quietly  its very bad manners to take advantage of cabs and withdrawing sullenly into his corner he watched her askance was she playing with him or had she really ceased to care the snap of a finger it seemed incredible the cab which had been threading the maze of the soho streets stopped daphne wing alighted proceeded down a narrow passage to a green door on the right and opening it with a latchkey paused to say  i like its being in a little sordid streetit takes away all amateurishness it wasnt a studio of course it was the back part of a papermakers any space conquered for art is something isnt it she led the way up a few greencarpeted stairs into a large room with a skylight whose walls were covered in japanese silk the colour of yellow azaleas here she stood for a minute without speaking as though lost in the beauty of her home then pointing to the walls she said  it took me ages i did it all myself and look at my little japanese trees arent they dickies six little dark abortions of trees were arranged scrupulously on a lofty windowsill whence the skylight sloped she added suddenly i think count rosek would like this room theres something bizarre about it isnt there i wanted to surround myself with that you knowto get the bizarre note into my work its so important nowadays but through there ive got a bedroom and a bathroom and a little kitchen with everything to hand all quite domestic and hot water always on my people are so funny about this room they come sometimes and stand about but they cant get used to the neighbourhood of course it is sordid but i think an artist ought to be superior to that  suddenly touched fiorsen answered gently  yes little daphne  she looked at him and another tiny sigh escaped her  why did you treat me like you did she said its such a pity because now i cant feel anything at all and turning she suddenly passed the back of her hand across her eyes really moved by that fiorsen went towards her but she had turned round again and putting out her hand to keep him off stood shaking her head with half a tear glistening on her eyelashes  please sit down on the divan she said will you smoke these are russians and she took a white box of pinkcoloured cigarettes from a little golden birchwood table i have everything russian and japanese so far as i can i think they help more than anything with atmosphere ive got a balalaika you cant play on it can you what a pity if only i had a violin i should have liked to hear you play again she clasped her hands do you remember when i danced to you before the fire  fiorsen remembered only too well the pink cigarette trembled in his fingers and he said rather hoarsely  dance to me now daphne  she shook her head  i dont trust you a yard nobody wouldwould they  fiorsen started up  then why did you ask me here what are you playing at you little at sight of her round unmoving eyes he stopped she said calmly  i thought youd like to see that id mastered my fatethats all but of course if you dont you neednt stop  fiorsen sank back on the divan a conviction that everything she said was literal had begun slowly to sink into him and taking a long pull at that pink cigarette he puffed the smoke out with a laugh  what are you laughing at  i was thinking little daphne that you are as great an egoist as i  i want to be its the only thing isnt it  fiorsen laughed again  you neednt worry you always were  she had seated herself on an indian stool covered with a bit of turkish embroidery and joining her hands on her lap answered gravely  no i think i wasnt while i loved you but it didnt pay did it  fiorsen stared at her  it has made a woman of you daphne your face is different your mouth is prettier for my kissesor the want of them all over you are prettier pink came up in daphne wings cheeks and encouraged by that flush he went on warmly if you loved me now i should not tire of you oh you can believe me i  she shook her head  we wont talk about love will we did you have a big triumph in moscow and st petersburg it must be wonderful to have really great triumphs  fiorsen answered gloomily  triumphs i made a lot of money  daphne wing purred  oh i expect youre very happy  did she mean to be ironic  im miserable  he got up and went towards her she looked up in his face  im sorry if youre miserable i know what it feels like  you can help me not to be little daphne you can help me to forget he had stopped and put his hands on her shoulders without moving daphne wing answered  i suppose its mrs fiorsen you want to forget isnt it  as if she were dead ah let it all be as it was daphne you have grown up you are a woman an artist and you  daphne wing had turned her head toward the stairs  that was the bell she said suppose its my people its just their time oh isnt that awkward  fiorsen dropped his grasp of her and recoiled against the wall there with his head touching one of the little japanese trees he stood biting his fingers she was already moving toward the door  my mothers got a key and its no good putting you anywhere because she always has a good look round but perhaps it isnt them besides im not afraid now it makes a wonderful difference being on ones own  she disappeared fiorsen could hear a womans acid voice a mans rather hoarse and greasy the sound of a smacking kiss and with a vicious shrug he stood at bay trapped the little devil the little dovelike devil he saw a lady in a silk dress green shot with beetroot colour a short thick gentleman with a round greyish beard in a grey suit having a small dahlia in his buttonhole and behind them daphne wing flushed and very roundeyed he took a step intending to escape without more ado the gentleman said  introduce us daisy i didnt quite catchmr dawson how do you do sir one of my daughters impresarios i think appy to meet you im sure  fiorsen took a long breath and bowed mr wagges small piggy eyes had fixed themselves on the little trees  shes got a nice little place here for her workquiet and unconventional i hope you think well of her talent sir you might go further and fare worse i believe  again fiorsen bowed  you may be proud of her he said she is the rising star  mr wagge cleared his throat  ow he said yees from a little thing we thought she had stuff in her ive come to take a great interest in her work its not in my line but i think shes a sticker i like to see perseverance where youve got that youve got half the battle of success so many of these young people seem to think lifes all play you must see a lot of that in your profession sir  robert  a shiver ran down fiorsens spine  yees  the name was not dawson  there followed a long moment on the one side was that vinegary woman poking her head forward like an angry hen on the other daphne wing her eyes rounder and rounder her cheeks redder and redder her lips opening her hands clasped to her perfect breast and in the centre that broad greybearded figure with reddening face and angry eyes and hoarsening voice  you scoundrel you infernal scoundrel it lurched forward raising a pudgy fist fiorsen sprang down the stairs and wrenched open the door he walked away in a whirl of mortification should he go back and take that pugfaced vulgarian by the throat as for that minx but his feelings about her were too complicated for expression and thenso dark and random are the ways of the mindhis thoughts darted back to gyp sitting on the oaken chest making her confession and the whips and stings of it scored him worse than ever   x   that same evening standing at the corner of bury street summerhay watched gyp going swiftly to her fathers house he could not bring himself to move while there was still a chance to catch a glimpse of her face a sign from her hand gone he walked away with his head down the more blissful the hours just spent the greater the desolation when they are over of such is the nature of love as he was now discerning the longing to have her always with him was growing fast since her husband knewwhy wait there would be no rest for either of them in an existence of meetings and partings like this with the menace of that fellow she must come away with him at onceabroaduntil things had declared themselves and then he must find a place where they could live and she feel safe and happy he must show he was in dead earnest set his affairs in order and he thought no good doing things by halves mother must know the sooner the better get it overat once and with a grimace of discomfort he set out for his aunts house in cadogan gardens where his mother always stayed when she was in town  lady summerhay was in the boudoir waiting for dinner and reading a book on dreams a redshaded lamp cast a mellow tinge over the grey frock over one reddish cheek and one white shoulder she was a striking person tall and well built her very blonde hair only just turning grey for she had married young and been a widow fifteen yearsone of those women whose naturally free spirits have been netted by association with people of public position bubbles were still rising from her submerged soul but it was obvious that it would not again set eyes on the horizon with views neither narrow nor illiberal as views in society go she judged everything now as people of public position mustdiscussion of course but no alteration in ones way of living speculation and ideas did not affect social usage the countless movements in which she and her friends were interested for the emancipation and benefit of others were in fact only channels for letting off her superfluous goodwill conduitpipes for the directing spirit bred in her she thought and acted in terms of the public good regulated by what people of position said at luncheon and dinner and it was surely not her fault that such people must lunch and dine when her son had bent and kissed her she held up the book to him and said  well bryan i think this mans book disgraceful he simply runs his sexidea to death really we arent all quite so obsessed as that i do think he ought to be put in his own lunatic asylum  summerhay looking down at her gloomily answered  ive got bad news for you mother  lady summerhay closed the book and searched his face with apprehension she knew that expression she knew that poise of his head as if butting at something he looked like that when he came to her in gambling scrapes was this another bryan had always been a pickle his next words took her breath away  the people at mildenham major winton and his daughteryou know well im in love with herimim her lover  lady summerhay uttered a gasp  butbutbryan  that fellow she married drinks hes impossible she had to leave him a year ago with her babyother reasons too look here mother this is hateful but youd got to know i cant talk of her theres no chance of a divorce his voice grew higher dont try to persuade me out of it its no good  lady summerhay from whose comely face a frock as it were had slipped clasped her hands together on the book  such a swift descent of life on one to whom it had for so long been a series of cases was cruel and her son felt this without quite realizing why in the grip of his new emotions he still retained enough balance to appreciate what an abominably desolate piece of news this must be to her what a disturbance and disappointment and taking her hand he put it to his lips  cheer up mother its all right shes happy and so am i  lady summerhay could only press her hand against his kiss and murmur  yes thats not everything bryan is thereis there going to be a scandal  i dont know i hope not but anyway he knows about it  society doesnt forgive  summerhay shrugged his shoulders  awfully sorry for you mother  oh bryan  this repetition of her plaint jarred his nerves  dont run ahead of things you neednt tell edith or flo you neednt tell anybody we dont know whatll happen yet  but in lady summerhay all was too sore and blank this woman she had never seen whose origin was doubtful whose marriage must have soiled her who was some kind of a siren no doubt it really was too hard she believed in her son had dreamed of public position for him or rather felt he would attain it as a matter of course and she said feebly  this major winton is a man of breeding isnt he  rather and stopping before her as if he read her thoughts he added you think shes not good enough for me shes good enough for anyone on earth and shes the proudest woman ive ever met if youre bothering as to what to do about herdont she wont want anything of anybodyi can tell you that she wont accept any crumbs  thats lucky hovered on lady summerhays lips but gazing at her son she became aware that she stood on the brink of a downfall in his heart then the bitterness of her disappointment rising up again she said coldly  are you going to live together openly  yes if she will  you dont know yet  i shallsoon  lady summerhay got up and the book on dreams slipped off her lap with a thump she went to the fireplace and stood there looking at her son he had altered his merry look was gone his face was strange to her she remembered it like that once in the park at widrington when he lost his temper with a pony and came galloping past her sitting back his curly hair stivered up like a little demons and she said sadly  you can hardly expect me to like it for you bryan even if she is what you say and isnt there some story about  my dear mother the more there is against her the more i shall love herthats obvious  lady summerhay sighed again  what is this man going to do i heard him play once  i dont know nothing i dare say morally and legally hes out of court i only wish to god he would bring a case and i could marry her but gyp says he wont  lady summerhay murmured  gyp is that her name and a sudden wish almost a longing not a friendly one to see this woman seized her will you bring her to see me im alone here till wednesday  ill ask her but i dont think shell come he turned his head away mother shes wonderful  an unhappy smile twisted lady summerhays lips no doubt aphrodite herself had visited her boy aphrodite andafterward she asked desolately  does major winton know  yes  what does he say to it  say what can anyone say from your point of view or his its rotten of course but in her position anythings rotten  at that encouraging word the floodgates gave way in lady summerhay and she poured forth a stream of words  oh my dear cant you pull up ive seen so many of these affairs go wrong it really is not for nothing that law and conventions are what they arebelieve me really bryan experience does show that the pressures too great its only once in a wayvery exceptional people very exceptional circumstances you maynt think now itll hamper you but youll find it willmost fearfully its not as if you were a writer or an artist who can take his work where he likes and live in a desert if he wants youve got to do yours in london your whole career is bound up with society do think before you go butting up against it its all very well to say its no affair of anyones but youll find it is bryan and then can youcan you possibly make her happy in the longrun  she stopped at the expression on his face it was as if he were saying i have left your world talk to your fellows all this is nothing to me  look here mother you dont seem to understand im devoteddevoted so that theres nothing else for me  how long will that last bryan you mean bewitched  summerhay said with passion  i dont i mean what i said goodnight and he went to the door  wont you stay to dinner dear  but he was gone and the full of vexation anxiety and wretchedness came on lady summerhay it was too hard she went down to her lonely dinner desolate and sore and to the book on dreams opened beside her plate she turned eyes that took in nothing   summerhay went straight home the lamps were brightening in the earlyautumn dusk and a draughty ruffling wind flicked a yellow leaf here and there from off the plane trees it was just the moment when evening blue comes into the colouring of the townthat hour of fusion when days hard and staring shapes are softening growing dark mysterious and all that broods behind the lives of men and trees and houses comes down on the wings of illusion to repossess the worldthe hour when any poetry in a man wells up but summerhay still heard his mothers oh bryan and for the first time knew the feeling that his hand was against everyones there was a difference already or so it seemed to him in the expression of each passerby nothing any more would be a matter of course and he was of a class to whom everything has always been a matter of course perhaps he did not realize this clearly yet but he had begun to take what the nurses call notice as do those only who are forced on to the defensive against society  putting his latchkey into the lock he recalled the sensation with which that afternoon he had opened to gyp for the first timehalf furtive half defiant it would be all defiance now this was the end of the old order and lighting a fire in his sittingroom he began pulling out drawers sorting and destroying he worked for hours burning making lists packing papers and photographs finishing at last he drank a stiff whisky and soda and sat down to smoke now that the room was quiet gyp seemed to fill it again with her presence closing his eyes he could see her there by the hearth just as she stood before they left turning her face up to him murmuring you wont stop loving me now youre so sure i love you stop loving her the more she loved him the more he would love her and he said aloud by god i wont at that remark so vehement for the time of night the old scotch terrier ossian came from his corner and shoved his long black nose into his masters hand  come along up ossy good dog oss and comforted by the warmth of that black body beside him in the chair summerhay fell asleep in front of the fire smouldering with blackened fragments of his past   xi   though gyp had never seemed to look round she had been quite conscious of summerhay still standing where they had parted watching her into the house in bury street the strength of her own feeling surprised her as a bather in the sea is surprised finding her feet will not touch bottom that she is carried away helplessonly these were the waters of ecstasy  for the second night running she hardly slept hearing the clocks of st jamess strike and big ben boom hour after hour at breakfast she told her father of fiorsens reappearance he received the news with a frown and a shrewd glance  well gyp  i told him  his feelings at that moment were perhaps as mixed as they had ever beencuriosity parental disapproval to which he knew he was not entitled admiration of her pluck in letting that fellow know fears for the consequences of this confession and more than all his profound disturbance at knowing her at last launched into the deep waters of love it was the least of these feelings that found expression  how did he take it  rushed away the only thing i feel sure of is that he wont divorce me  no by george i dont suppose even he would have that impudence and winton was silent trying to penetrate the future well he said suddenly its on the knees of the gods then but be careful gyp  about noon betty returned from the sea with a solemn darkeyed cooing little gyp brown as a roasted coffeeberry when she had been given all that she could wisely eat after the journey gyp carried her off to her own room undressed her for sheer delight of kissing her from head to foot and admiring her plump brown legs then cuddled her up in a shawl and lay down with her on the bed a few sleepy coos and strokings and little gyp had left for the land of nod while her mother lay gazing at her black lashes with a kind of passion she was not a childlover by nature but this child of her own with her dark softness plump delicacy giving disposition her cooing voice and constant adjurations to dear mum was adorable there was something about her insidiously seductive she had developed so quickly with the graceful roundness of a little animal the perfection of a flower the italian blood of her greatgreatgrandmother was evidently prepotent in her as yet and though she was not yet two years old her hair which had lost its baby darkness was already curving round her neck and waving on her forehead one of her tiny brown hands had escaped the shawl and grasped its edge with determined softness and while gyp gazed at the pinkish nails and their absurdly wee halfmoons at the sleeping tranquillity stirred by breathing no more than a roseleaf on a windless day her lips grew fuller trembled reached toward the dark lashes till she had to rein her neck back with a jerk to stop such selfindulgence soothed hypnotized almost in a dream she lay there beside her baby  that evening at dinner winton said calmly  well ive been to see fiorsen and warned him off found him at that fellow roseks gyp received the news with a vague sensation of alarm and i met that girl the dancer coming out of the house as i was going inmade it plain id seen her so i dont think hell trouble you  an irresistible impulse made her ask  how was she looking dad  winton smiled grimly how to convey his impression of the figure he had seen coming down the stepsof those eyes growing rounder and rounder at sight of him of that mouth opening in an oh  much the same rather flabbergasted at seeing me i think a white hatvery smart attractive in her way but common of course those two were playing the piano and fiddle when i went up they tried not to let me in but i wasnt to be put off queer place that  gyp smiled she could see it all so well the black walls the silver statuettes rops drawings scent of dead roseleaves and pastilles and cigarettesand those two by the pianoand her father so cool and dry  one cant stand on ceremony with fellows like that i hadnt forgotten that polish chaps behaviour to you my dear  through gyp passed a quiver of dread a vague return of the feelings once inspired by rosek  im almost sorry you went dad did you say anything very  did i lets see no i think i was quite polite he added with a grim little smile i wont swear i didnt call one of them a ruffian i know they said something about my presuming on being a cripple  oh darling  yes it was that polish chapand so he is  gyp murmured  id almost rather it had beenthe other roseks pale suave face with the eyes behind which there were such hidden things and the lips sweetish and restrained and sensualhe would never forgive but winton only smiled again patting her arm he was pleased with an encounter which had relieved his feelings  gyp spent all that evening writing her first real loveletter but when next afternoon at six in fulfilment of its wording she came to summerhays little house her heart sank for the blinds were down and it had a deserted look if he had been there he would have been at the window waiting had he then not got her letter not been home since yesterday and that chill fear which besets lovers hearts at failure of a tryst smote her for the first time in the threecornered garden stood a decayed statue of a naked boy with a broken bowa sparrow was perching on his greenish shoulder sooty heartshaped lilac leaves hung round his head and at his legs the old scotch terrier was sniffing gyp called ossian ossy and the old dog came wagging his tail feebly  master where is your master dear  ossian poked his long nose into her calf and that gave her a little comfort she passed perforce away from the deserted house and returned home but all manner of frightened thoughts beset her where had he gone why had he gone why had he not let her know doubtsthose hasty attendants on passioncame thronging and scepticism ran riot what did she know of his life of his interests of him except that he said he loved her where had he gone to widrington to some smart houseparty or even back to scotland the jealous feelings that had so besieged her at the bungalow when his letters ceased came again now with redoubled force there must be some woman who before their love began had claim on him or some girl that he admired he never told her of any suchof course he would not she was amazed and hurt by her capacity for jealousy she had always thought she would be too proud to feel jealousya sensation so dark and wretched and undignified butalasso horribly real and clinging  she had said she was not dining at home so winton had gone to his club and she was obliged to partake of a little trumpedup lonely meal she went up to her room after it but there came on her such restlessness that presently she put on her things and slipped out she went past st jamess church into piccadilly to the further crowded side and began to walk toward the park this was foolish but to do a foolish thing was some relief and she went along with a faint smile mocking her own recklessness several women of the townships of night with sails setcame rounding out of side streets or down the main stream with their skilled rapidseeming slowness and at the discomfited halfhostile stares on their rouged and powdered faces gyp felt a wicked glee she was disturbing hurting themand she wanted to hurt  presently a man in evening dress with overcoat thrown open gazed pointblank into her face and raising his hat ranged up beside her she walked straight on still with that halfsmile knowing him puzzled and fearfully attracted then an insensate wish to stab him to the heart made her turn her head and look at him at the expression on her face he wilted away from her and again she felt that wicked glee at having hurt him  she crossed out into the traffic to the park side and turned back toward st jamess and now she was possessed by profound black sadness if only her lover were beside her that beautiful evening among the lights and shadows of the trees in the warm air why was he not among these passersby she who could bring any casual man to her side by a smile could not conjure up the only one she wanted from this great desert of a town she hurried along to get in and hide her longing but at the corner of st jamess street she stopped that was his club nearly opposite perhaps he was there playing cards or billiards a few yards away and yet as in another world presently he would come out go to some musichall or stroll home thinking of herperhaps not even thinking of her another woman passed giving her a furtive glance but gyp felt no glee now and crossing over close under the windows of the club she hurried home when she reached her room she broke into a storm of tears how could she have liked hurting those poor women hurting that manwho was only paying her a mans compliment after all and with these tears her jealous wild feelings passed leaving only her longing  next morning brought a letter summerhay wrote from an inn on the river asking her to come down by the eleven oclock train and he would meet her at the station he wanted to show her a house that he had seen and they could have the afternoon on the river gyp received this letter which began my darling with an ecstasy that she could not quite conceal and winton who had watched her face said presently  i think i shall go to newmarket gyp home tomorrow evening  in the train on the way down she sat with closed eyes in a sort of trance if her lover had been there holding her in his arms he could not have seemed nearer  she saw him as the train ran in but they met without a handclasp without a word simply looking at each other and breaking into smiles  a little victoria dug upas summerhay saidhorse driver and all carried them slowly upward under cover of the light rugs their hands were clasped and they never ceased to look into each others faces except for those formal glances of propriety which deceive no one  the day was beautiful as only early september days can bewhen the sun is hot yet not too hot and its light falls in a silken radiance on trees just losing the opulent monotony of summer on silverygold reaped fields silverygreen uplands golden mustard when shots ring out in the distance and as one gazes a leaf falls without reason as it would seem presently they branched off the main road by a lane past a clump of beeches and drew up at the gate of a lonely house built of very old red brick and covered by virginia creeper just turninga house with an inglenook and low broad chimneys before it was a walled neglected lawn with poplars and one large walnuttree the sunlight seemed to have collected in that garden and there was a tremendous hum of bees above the trees the downs could be seen where racehorses they said were trained summerhay had the keys of the house and they went in to gyp it was like a childs pretendingto imagine they were going to live there together to sort out the rooms and consecrate each she would not spoil this perfect day by argument or admission of the need for a decision and when he asked  well darling what do you think of it she only answered  oh lovely in a way but lets go back to the river and make the most of it  they took boat at the bowl of cream the river inn where summerhay was staying to him who had been a rowing man at oxford the river was known from lechlade to richmond but gyp had never in her life been on it and its placid magic unlike that of any other river in the world almost overwhelmed her on this glistening windless day to drift along past the bright flat waterlily leaves over the greenish depths to listen to the pigeons watch the dragonflies flitting past and the fish leaping lazily not even steering letting her hand dabble in the water then cooling her sunwarmed cheek with it and all the time gazing at summerhay who dipping his sculls gently gazed at herall this was like a voyage down some river of dreams the very fulfilment of felicity there is a degree of happiness known to the human heart which seems to belong to some enchanted worlda bright maze into which for a moment now and then we escape and wander today he was more than ever like her botticelli young man with his neck bare and his face so cleareyed and broad and brown had she really had a life with another man and only a year ago it seemed inconceivable  but when in the last backwater he tied the boat up and came to sit with her once more it was already getting late and the vague melancholy of the now shadowy river was stealing into her and with a sort of sinking in her heart she heard him begin  gyp we must go away together we can never stand it going on apart snatching hours here and there  pressing his hand to her cheeks she murmured  why not darling hasnt this been perfect what could we ever have more perfect its been paradise itself  yes but to be thrown out every day to be whole days and nights without you gyp you mustyou must what is there against it dont you love me enough  she looked at him and then away into the shadows  too much i think its tempting providence to change lets go on as we are bryan no dont look like thatdont be angry  why are you afraid are you sorry for our love  no but let it be like this dont lets risk anything  risk is it peoplesocietyyoure afraid of i thought you wouldnt care  gyp smiled  society no im not afraid of that  what then of me  i dont know men soon get tired im a doubter bryan i cant help it  as if anyone could get tired of you are you afraid of yourself  again gyp smiled  not of loving too little i told you  how can one love too much  she drew his head down to her but when that kiss was over she only said again  no bryan lets go on as we are ill make up to you when im with you if you were to tire of me i couldnt bear it  for a long time more he pleadednow with anger now with kisses now with reasonings but to all she opposed that same tender halfmournful no and at last he gave it up and in dogged silence rowed her to the village whence she was to take train back it was dusk when they left the boat and dew was falling just before they reached the station she caught his hand and pressed it to her breast  darling dont be angry with me perhaps i willsome day  and in the train she tried to think herself once more in the boat among the shadows and the whispering reeds and all the quiet wonder of the river   xii   on reaching home she let herself in stealthily and though she had not had dinner went up at once to her room she was just taking off her blouse when betty entered her round face splotched with red and tears rolling down her cheeks  betty what is it  oh my dear where have you been such a dreadful piece of news theyve stolen her that wicked manyour husbandhe took her right out of her pramand went off with her in a great carhe and that other one ive been half out of my mind gyp stared aghast i hollered to a policeman hes stolen herher father catch them i said however shall i face my mistress she stopped for breath then burst out again hes a bad one i said a foreigner theyre both foreigners her father he said well why shouldnt he hes only givin her a joy ride hell bring her back never you fear and i ran homei didnt know where you were oh dear the major away and allwhat was i to do id just turned round to shut the gate of the square gardens and i never saw him till hed put his great long arm over the pram and snatched her out and sitting on the bed she gave way utterly  gyp stood still nemesis for her happiness that vengeful wretch rosek this was his doing and she said  oh betty she must be crying  a fresh outburst of moans was the only answer gyp remembered suddenly what the lawyer had said over a year agoit had struck her with terror at the time in law fiorsen owned and could claim her child she could have got her back then by bringing a horrible case against him but now perhaps she had no chance was it her return to fiorsen that they aimed ator the giving up of her lover she went over to her mirror saying  well go at once betty and get her back somehow wash your face  while she made ready she fought down those two horrible fearsof losing her child of losing her lover the less she feared the better she could act the more subtly the swifter she remembered that she had somewhere a little stiletto given her a long time ago she hunted it out slipped off its redleather sheath and stabbing the point into a tiny cork slipped it beneath her blouse if they could steal her baby they were capable of anything she wrote a note to her father telling him what had happened and saying where she had gone then in a taxi they set forth cold water and the calmness of her mistress had removed from betty the main traces of emotion but she clasped gyps hand hard and gave vent to heavy sighs  gyp would not think if she thought of her little one crying she knew she would cry too but her hatred for those who had dealt this cowardly blow grew within her she took a resolution and said quietly  mr summerhay betty thats why theyve stolen our darling i suppose you know he and i care for each other theyve stolen her so as to make me do anything they like  a profound sigh answered her  behind that moonface with the troubled eyes what conflict was in progressbetween unquestioning morality and unquestioning belief in gyp between fears for her and wishes for her happiness between the loyal retainers habit of accepting and the old nurses feeling of being in charge she said faintly  oh dear hes a nice gentleman too and suddenly wheezing it out with unexpected force to say truth i never did hold you was rightly married to that foreigner in that horrible registry placeno music no flowers no blessin asked nor nothing i cried me eyes out at the time  gyp said quietly  no betty i never was i only thought i was in love a convulsive squeeze and creaking whiffling sounds heralded a fresh outburst dont cry were just there think of our darling  the cab stopped feeling for her little weapon she got out and with her hand slipped firmly under bettys arm led the way upstairs chilly shudders ran down her spinememories of daphne wing and rosek of that large womanwhat was her nameof many other faces of unholy hours spent up there in a queer state never quite present never comfortable in soul memories of late returnings down these wide stairs out to their cab of fiorsen beside her in the darkness his dim broadcheekboned face moody in the corner or pressed close to hers once they had walked a long way homeward in the dawn rosek with them fiorsen playing on his muted violin to the scandal of the policemen and the cats dim unreal memories grasping bettys arm more firmly she rang the bell when the man servant whom she remembered well opened the door her lips were so dry that they could hardly form the words  is mr fiorsen in ford  no maam mr fiorsen and count rosek went into the country this afternoon i havent their address at present she must have turned white for she could hear the man saying anything i can get you maam  when did they start please  one oclock maamby car count rosek was driving himself i should say they wont be away longthey just had their bags with them gyp put out her hand helplessly she heard the servant say in a concerned voice i could let you know the moment they return maam if youd kindly leave me your address  giving her card and murmuring  thank you ford thank you very much she grasped bettys arm again and leaned heavily on her going down the stairs  it was real black fear now to lose helpless thingschildrendogsand know for certain that one cannot get to them no matter what they may be suffering to be pinned down to ignorance and have in her ears the crying of her childthis horror gyp suffered now and nothing to be done nothing but to go to bed and waithardest of all tasks mercifullythanks to her long day in the openshe fell at last into a dreamless sleep and when she was called there was a letter from fiorsen on the tray with her tea   gyp  i am not a babystealer like your father the law gives me the right to my own child but swear to give up your lover and the baby shall come back to you at once if you do not give him up i will take her away out of england send me an answer to this postoffice and do not let your father try any tricks upon me  gustav fiorsen   beneath was written the address of a west end postoffice  when gyp had finished reading she went through some moments of such mental anguish as she had never known butjust as when betty first told her of the stealingher wits and wariness came quickly back had he been drinking when he wrote that letter she could almost fancy that she smelled brandy but it was so easy to fancy what one wanted to she read it through againthis time she felt almost sure that it had been dictated to him if he had composed the wording himself he would never have resisted a gibe at the law or a gibe at himself for thus safeguarding her virtue it was roseks doing her anger flamed up anew since they used such mean cruel ways why need she herself be scrupulous she sprang out of bed and wrote   how could you do such a brutal thing at all events let the darling have her nurse its not like you to let a little child suffer betty will be ready to come the minute you send for her as for myself you must give me time to decide i will let you know within two days  gyp   when she had sent this off and a telegram to her father at newmarket she read fiorsens letter once more and was more than ever certain that it was roseks wording and suddenly she thought of daphne wing whom her father had seen coming out of roseks house through her there might be a way of getting news she seemed to see again the girl lying so white and void of hope when robbed by death of her own justborn babe yes surely it was worth trying  an hour later her cab stopped before the wagges door in frankland street but just as she was about to ring the bell a voice from behind her said  allow me i have a key what may ioh its you she turned mr wagge in professional habiliments was standing there come in come in he said i was wondering whether perhaps we shouldnt be seeing you after whats transpired  hanging his tall black hat craped nearly to the crown on a knob of the mahogany stand he said huskily  i did think wed seen the last of that and opened the diningroom door come in maam we can put our heads together better in here  in that too well remembered room the table was laid with a stained white cloth a cruetstand and bottle of worcestershire sauce the little blue bowl was gone so that nothing now marred the harmony of red and green gyp said quickly  doesnt daphdaisy live at home then now  the expression on mr wagges face was singular suspicion relief and a sort of craftiness were blended with that furtive admiration which gyp seemed always to excite in him  do i understand that youer  i came to ask if daisy would do something for me  mr wagge blew his nose  you didnt know he began again  yes i dare say she sees my husband if thats what you mean and i dont mindhes nothing to me now  mr wagges face became further complicated by the sensations of a husband  well he said its not to be wondered at perhaps in the circumstances im sure i always thought  gyp interrupted swiftly  please mr waggeplease will you give me daisys address  mr wagge remained a moment in deep thought then he said in a gruff jerky voice  seventythree comrade street soo up to seeing him there on tuesday i must say i cherished every hope now im sorry i didnt strike himhe was too quick for me he had raised one of his gloved hands and was sawing it up and down the sight of that black object cleaving the air nearly made gyp scream her nerves were so on edge its her blasted independencei beg pardonbut who wouldnt he ended suddenly  gyp passed him  who wouldnt she heard his voice behind her i did think shed have run straight this time and while she was fumbling at the outer door his red pudgy face with its round grey beard protruded almost over her shoulder if youre going to see her i hope youll  gyp was gone in her cab she shivered once she had lunched with her father at a restaurant in the strand it had been full of mr wagges but suddenly she thought its hard on him poor man   xiii   seventythree comrade street soho was difficult to find but with the aid of a milkboy gyp discovered the alley at last and the right door there her pride took sudden alarm and but for the milkboys eyes fixed on her while he let out his professional howl she might have fled a plump white hand and wrist emerging took the can and daphne wings voice said  oh wheres the cream  aint got none  oh i told you alwaystwo pennyworth at twelve oclock  two pennorth the boys eyes goggled  didnt you want to speak to her miss he beat the closing door lidy wants to speak to you goodmornin miss  the figure of daphne wing in a blue kimono was revealed her eyes peered round at gyp  oh she said  may i come in  oh yes oh do ive been practising oh i am glad to see you  in the middle of the studio a little table was laid for two daphne wing went up to it holding in one hand the milkcan and in the other a short knife with which she had evidently been opening oysters placing the knife on the table she turned round to gyp her face was deep pink and so was her neck which ran vshaped down into the folds of her kimono her eyes round as saucers met gyps fell met them again she said  oh mrs fiorsen i am glad i really am i wanted you so much to see my roomdo you like it how did you know where i was she looked down and added i think id better tell you mr fiorsen came here and since then ive seen him at count roseksandand  yes but dont trouble to tell me please  daphne wing hurried on  of course im quite mistress of myself now then all at once the uneasy womanoftheworld mask dropped from her face and she seized gyps hand oh mrs fiorsen i shall never be like you  with a little shiver gyp said  i hope not her pride rushed up in her how could she ask this girl anything she choked back that feeling and said stonily do you remember my baby no of course you never saw her he and count rosek have just taken her away from me  daphne wing convulsively squeezed the hand of which she had possessed herself  oh what a wicked thing when  yesterday afternoon  oh i am glad i havent seen him since oh i do think that was wicked arent you dreadfully distressed the least of smiles played on gyps mouth daphne wing burst forth dyou knowi thinki think your selfcontrol is something awful it frightens me if my baby had lived and been stolen like that i should have been half dead by now  gyp answered stonily as ever  yes i want her back and i wondered  daphne wing clasped her hands  oh i expect i can make him she stopped confused then added hastily are you sure you dont mind  i shouldnt mind if he had fifty loves perhaps he has  daphne wing uttered a little gasp then her teeth came down rather viciously on her lower lip  i mean him to do what i want now not what he wants me thats the only way when you love oh dont smile like that please you do make me feel souncertain  when are you going to see him next  daphne wing grew very pink  i dont know he might be coming in to lunch you see its not as if he were a stranger is it casting up her eyes a little she added he wont even let me speak your name it makes him mad thats why im sure he still loves you only his love is so funny and seizing gyps hand i shall never forget how good you were to me i do hope youyou love somebody else gyp pressed those damp clinging fingers and daphne wing hurried on im sure your babys a darling how you must be suffering you look quite pale but it isnt any good suffering i learned that  her eyes lighted on the table and a faint ruefulness came into them as if she were going to ask gyp to eat the oysters  gyp bent forward and put her lips to the girls forehead  goodbye my baby would thank you if she knew  and she turned to go she heard a sob daphne wing was crying then before gyp could speak she struck herself on the throat and said in a strangled voice  thathats idiotic ii havent cried sincesince you know iim perfect mistress of myself only ionlyi suppose you reminded mei never cry  those words and the sound of a hiccough accompanied gyp down the alley to her cab  when she got back to bury street she found betty sitting in the hall with her bonnet on she had not been sent for nor had any reply come from newmarket gyp could not eat could settle to nothing she went up to her bedroom to get away from the servants eyes and went on mechanically with a frock of little gyps she had begun on the fatal morning fiorsen had come back every other minute she stopped to listen to sounds that never meant anything went a hundred times to the window to look at nothing betty too had come upstairs and was in the nursery opposite gyp could hear her moving about restlessly among her household gods presently those sounds ceased and peering into the room she saw the stout woman still in her bonnet sitting on a trunk with her back turned uttering heavy sighs gyp stole back into her own room with a sick trembling sensation ifif her baby really could not be recovered except by that sacrifice if that cruel letter were the last word and she forced to decide between them which would she give up which followher lover or her child  she went to the window for airthe pain about her heart was dreadful and leaning there against the shutter she felt quite dizzy from the violence of a struggle that refused coherent thought or feeling and was just a dumb pull of instincts both so terribly stronghow terribly strong she had not till then perceived  her eyes fell on the picture that reminded her of bryan it seemed now to have no resemblancenone he was much too real and loved and wanted less than twentyfour hours ago she had turned a deaf ear to his pleading that she should go to him for ever how funny would she not rush to him nowgo when and where he liked ah if only she were back in his arms never could she give him upnever but then in her ears sounded the cooing words dear mum her babythat tiny thinghow could she give her up and never again hold close and kiss that round perfect little body that grave little darkeyed face  the roar of london came in through the open window so much life so many peopleand not a soul could help she left the window and went to the cottagepiano she had there out of wintons way but she only sat with arms folded looking at the keys the song that girl had sung at fiorsens concertsong of the broken heartcame back to her  no no she couldntcouldnt it was to her lover she would cling and tears ran down her cheeks  a cab had stopped below but not till betty came rushing in did she look up   xiv   when trembling all over she entered the diningroom fiorsen was standing by the sideboard holding the child  he came straight up and put her into gyps arms  take her he said and do what you will be happy  hugging her baby close to the door as she could get gyp answered nothing her heart was in such a tumult that she could not have spoken a word to save her life relieved as one dying of thirst by unexpected water grateful bewildered abashed yet instinctively aware of something evanescent and unreal in his altruism daphne wing what bargain did this represent  fiorsen must have felt the chill of this instinctive vision for he cried out  yes you never believed in me you never thought me capable of good why didnt you  gyp bent her face over her baby to hide the quivering of her lips  i am sorryvery very sorry  fiorsen came closer and looked into her face  by god i am afraid i shall never forget younever  tears had come into his eyes and gyp watched them moved troubled but still deeply mistrusting  he brushed his hand across his face and the thought flashed through her he means me to see them ah what a cynical wretch i am  fiorsen saw that thought pass and muttering suddenly  goodbye gyp i am not all bad i am not he tore the door open and was gone  that passionate i am not saved gyp from a breakdown no even at his highest pitch of abnegation he could not forget himself  relief if overwhelming is slowly realized but when at last what she had escaped and what lay before her were staring full in each others face it seemed to her that she must cry out and tell the whole world of her intoxicating happiness and the moment little gyp was in bettys arms she sat down and wrote to summerhay   darling  ive had a fearful time my baby was stolen by him while i was with you he wrote me a letter saying that he would give her back to me if i gave you up but i found i couldnt give you up not even for my baby and then a few minutes ago he brought hernone the worse tomorrow we shall all go down to mildenham but very soon if you still want me ill come with you wherever you like my father and betty will take care of my treasure till we come back and then perhaps the old red house we sawafter all onlynow is the time for you to draw back look into the futurelook far dont let any foolish pityor honourweigh with you be utterly sure i do beseech you i can just bear it now if i know its for your good but afterward itll be too late it would be the worst misery of all if i made you unhappy oh make suremake sure i shall understand i mean this with every bit of me and now goodnight and perhapsgoodbye  your  gyp   she read it over and shivered did she really mean that she could bear it if he drew backif he did look far far into the future and decided that she was not worth the candle ah but better nowthan later  she closed and sealed the letter and sat down to wait for her father and she thought why does one have a heart why is there in one something so much too soft   ten days later at mildenham station holding her fathers hand gyp could scarcely see him for the mist before her eyes how good he had been to her all those last days since she told him that she was going to take the plunge not a word of remonstrance or complaint  goodbye my love take care of yourself wire from london and again from paris and smiling up at her he added he has luck i had none  the mist became tears rolled down fell on his glove  not too long out there gyp  she pressed her wet cheek passionately to his the train moved but so long as she could see she watched him standing on the platform waving his grey hat then in her corner sat down blinded with tears behind her veil she had not cried when she left him the day of her fatal marriage she cried now that she was leaving him to go to her incredible happiness  strange but her heart had grown since then     part iv   i   little gyp aged nearly four and a half that first of may stood at the edge of the tulip border bowing to two hen turkeys who were poking their heads elegantly here and there among the flowers she was absurdly like her mother the same ovalshaped face dark arched brows large and clear brown eyes but she had the modern childs openair look her hair that curled over at the ends was not allowed to be long and her polished brown legs were bare to the knees  turkeys you arent good are you come on and stretching out her hands with the palms held up she backed away from the tulipbed the turkeys trailing delicately their longtoed feet and uttering soft liquid interrogations moved after her in hopes of what she was not holding in her little brown hands the sun down in the west for it was past teatime slanted from over the roof of the red house and painted up that small processionthe deep blue frock of little gyp the glint of gold in the chestnut of her hair the daisystarred grass the dark birds with translucent red dewlaps and checkered tails and the tulip background puce and red and yellow when she had lured them to the open gate little gyp raised herself and said  arent you duffies dears shoo and on the tails of the turkeys she shut the gate then she went to where under the walnuttreethe one large tree of that walled gardena very old scotch terrier was lying and sitting down beside him began stroking his white muzzle saying  ossy ossy do you love me  presently seeing her mother in the porch she jumped up and crying out ossyossy walk rushed to gyp and embraced her legs while the old scotch terrier slowly followed  thus held prisoner gyp watched the dogs approach nearly three years had changed her a little her face was softer and rather more grave her form a little fuller her hair if anything darker and done differentlyinstead of waving in wings and being coiled up behind it was smoothly gathered round in a soft and lustrous helmet by which fashion the shape of her head was better revealed  darling go and ask pettance to put a fresh piece of sulphur in ossys waterbowl and to cut up his meat finer you can give hotspur and brownie two lumps of sugar each and then well go out going down on her knees in the porch she parted the old dogs hair and examined his eczema thinking i must rub some more of that stuff in tonight oh ducky youre not smelling your best yes onlynot my face  a telegraphboy was coming from the gate gyp opened the missive with the faint tremor she always felt when summerhay was not with her   detained shall be down by last train need not come up tomorrowbryan   when the boy was gone she stooped down and stroked the old dogs head  master home all day tomorrow ossymaster home  a voice from the path said beautiful evenin maam  the old scoundrel pettance stiffer in the anklejoints with more lines in his gargoyles face fewer stumps in his gargoyles mouth more film over his dark burning little eyes was standing before her and behind him little gyp one foot rather before the other as gyp had been wont to stand waited gravely  oh pettance mr summerhay will be at home all tomorrow and well go a long ride and when you exercise will you call at the inn in case i dont go that way and tell major winton i expect him to dinner tonight  yes maam and ive seen the pony for little miss gyp this morning maam its a mouse pony five year old sound good temper pretty little paces i says to the man dont you come it over me i says i

take it or leave it ah he says pettance you know ow to buy an orse all right he says twelve shes worth all of fifteen maam and the majors passed her so if you likes to have er there she is  gyp looked at her little daughter who had given one excited hop but now stood still her eyes flying up at her mother and her lips parted and she thought the darling she never begs for anything  very well pettance buy her  the old scoundrel touched his forelock  yes maamvery good maam beautiful evenin maam and withdrawing at his gait of one whose feet are at permanent right angles to the legs he mused and thatll be two in my pocket  ten minutes later gyp little gyp and ossian emerged from the garden gate for their evening walk they went not as usual up to the downs but toward the river making for what they called the wild this was an outlying plot of neglected ground belonging to their farm two sedgy meadows hedged by banks on which grew oaks and ashes an old stone linhay covered to its broken thatch by a huge ivy bush stood at the angle where the meadows met the spot had a strange life to itself in that smooth kempt countryside of cornfields grass and beechclumps it was favoured by beasts and birds and little gyp had recently seen two baby hares there from an oaktree where the crinkled leaves were not yet large enough to hide him a cuckoo was calling and they stopped to look at the grey bird till he flew off the singing and serenity the green and golden oaks and ashes the flowersmarshorchis ladies smocks and cuckoobuds starring the rushy grassall brought to gyp that feeling of the uncapturable spirit which lies behind the forms of nature the shadowy hovering smile of life that is ever vanishing and ever springing again out of death while they stood there close to the old linhay a bird came flying round them in wide circles uttering shrill cries it had a long beak and long pointed wings and seemed distressed by their presence little gyp squeezed her mothers hand  poor bird isnt it a poor bird mum  yes dear its a curlewi wonder whats the matter with it perhaps its mate is hurt  what is its mate  the bird it lives with  its afraid of us its not like other birds is it a real bird mum or one out of the sky  i think its real shall we go on and see if we can find out whats the matter  yes  they went on into the sedgy grass and the curlew continued to circle vanishing and reappearing from behind the trees always uttering those shrill cries little gyp said  mum could we speak to it because were not going to hurt nothing are we  of course not darling but im afraid the poor birds too wild try if you like call to it courlie courlie  little gyps piping joined the curlews cries and other birdsongs in the bright shadowy quiet of the evening till gyp said  oh look its dipping close to the ground over there in that cornerits got a nest we wont go near will we  little gyp echoed in a hushed voice  its got a nest  they stole back out of the gate close to the linhay the curlew still fighting and crying behind them  arent we glad the mate isnt hurt mum  gyp answered with a shiver  yes darling fearfully glad now then shall we go down and ask grandy to come up to dinner  little gyp hopped and they went toward the river  at the bowl of cream winton had for two years had rooms which he occupied as often as his pursuits permitted he had refused to make his home with gyp desiring to be on hand only when she wanted him and a simple life of it he led in those simple quarters riding with her when summerhay was in town visiting the cottagers smoking cigars laying plans for the defence of his daughters position and devoting himself to the whims of little gyp this moment when his grandchild was to begin to ride was in a manner sacred to one for whom life had scant meaning apart from horses looking at them hand in hand gyp thought dad loves her as much as he loves me nowmore i think  lonely dinner at the inn was an infliction which he studiously concealed from gyp so he accepted their invitation without alacrity and they walked on up the hill with little gyp in the middle supported by a hand on each side  the red house contained nothing that had been in gyps married home except the piano it had white walls furniture of old oak and for pictures reproductions of her favourites the death of procris hung in the diningroom winton never failed to scrutinize it when he came in to a mealthat deuced rum affair appeared to have a fascination for him he approved of the diningroom altogether its narrow oak last supper table made gay by a strip of blue linen old brick hearth casement windows hung with flowered curtainsall had a pleasing austerity uncannily redeemed to softness he got on well enough with summerhay but he enjoyed himself much more when he was there alone with his daughter and this evening he was especially glad to have her to himself for she had seemed of late rather grave and absentminded when dinner was over and they were undisturbed he said  it must be pretty dull for you my dear sometimes i wish you saw more people  oh no dad  watching her smile he thought thats not sour grapeswhat is the trouble then  i suppose youve not heard anything of that fellow fiorsen lately  not a word but hes playing again in london this season i see  is he ah thatll cheer them and he thought its not that then but theres somethingill swear  i hear that bryans going ahead i met a man in town last week who spoke of him as about the most promising junior at the bar  yes hes doing awfully well and a sound like a faint sigh caught his ears would you say hes changed much since you knew him dad  i dont knowperhaps a little less jokey  yes hes lost his laugh  it was very evenly and softly said yet it affected winton  cant expect him to keep that he answered turning people inside out day after dayand most of them rotten by george what a life  but when he had left her strolling back in the bright moonlight he reverted to his suspicions and wished he had said more directly look here gyp are you worrying about bryanor have people been making themselves unpleasant  he had in these last three years become unconsciously inimical to his own class and their imitators and more than ever friendly to the poorvisiting the labourers small farmers and small tradesmen doing them little turns when he could giving their children sixpences and so forth the fact that they could not afford to put on airs of virtue escaped him he perceived only that they were respectful and friendly to gyp and this warmed his heart toward them in proportion as he grew exasperated with the two or three landed families and that parvenu lot in the riverside villas  when he first came down the chief landownera man he had known for yearshad invited him to lunch he had accepted with the deliberate intention of finding out where he was and had taken the first natural opportunity of mentioning his daughter she was he said devoted to her flowers the red house had quite a good garden his friends wife slightly lifting her brows had answered with a nervous smile oh yes of courseyes a silence had not unnaturally fallen since then winton had saluted his friend and his friends wife with such frigid politeness as froze the very marrow in their bones he had not gone there fishing for gyp to be called on but to show these people that his daughter could not be slighted with impunity foolish of him for man of the world to his fingertips he knew perfectly well that a woman living with a man to whom she was not married could not be recognized by people with any pretensions to orthodoxy gyp was beyond even the debatable ground on which stood those who have been divorced and are married again but even a man of the world is not proof against the warping of devotion and winton was ready to charge any windmill at any moment on her behalf  outside the inn door exhaling the last puffs of his goodnight cigarette he thought what wouldnt i give for the old days and a chance to wing some of these moral upstarts   ii   the last train was not due till eleventhirty and having seen that the evening tray had sandwiches gyp went to summerhays study the room at right angles to the body of the house over which was their bedroom here if she had nothing to do she always came when he was away feeling nearer to him she would have been horrified if she had known of her fathers sentiments on her behalf her instant denial of the wish to see more people had been quite genuine the conditions of her life in that respect often seemed to her ideal it was such a joy to be free of people one did not care two straws about and of all empty social functions everything she had now was reallove and nature riding music animals and poor people what else was worth having she would not have changed for anything it often seemed to her that books and plays about the unhappiness of women in her position were all false if one loved what could one want better such women if unhappy could have no pride or else could not really love she had recently been reading anna karenina and had often said to herself theres something not true about itas if tolstoy wanted to make us believe that anna was secretly feeling remorse if one loves one doesnt feel remorse even if my baby had been taken away i shouldnt have felt remorse one gives oneself to loveor one does not  she even derived a positive joy from the feeling that her love imposed a sort of isolation she liked to be apartfor him besides by her very birth she was outside the fold of society her love beyond the love of those within itjust as her fathers love had been and her pride was greater than theirs too how could women mope and moan because they were cast out and try to scratch their way back where they were not welcome how could any woman do that sometimes she wondered whether if fiorsen died she would marry her lover what difference would it make she could not love him more it would only make him feel perhaps too sure of her make it all a matter of course for herself she would rather go on as she was but for him she was not certain of late had been less and less certain he was not bound now could leave her when he tired and yetdid he perhaps feel himself more bound than if they were marriedunfairly bound it was this thoughtbarely more than the shadow of a thoughtwhich had given her of late the extra gravity noticed by her father  in that unlighted room with the moonbeams drifting in she sat down at summerhays bureau where he often worked too late at his cases depriving her of himself she sat there resting her elbows on the bare wood crossing her fingertips gazing out into the moonlight her mind drifting on a stream of memories that seemed to have beginning only from the year when he came into her life a smile crept out on her face and now and then she uttered a little sigh of contentment  so many memories nearly all happy surely the most adroit work of the jeweller who put the human soul together was his provision of its power to forget the dark and remember sunshine the year and a half of her life with fiorsen the empty months that followed it were gone dispersed like mist by the radiance of the last three years in whose sky had hung just one cloud no bigger than a hand of doubt whether summerhay really loved her as much as she loved him whether from her company he got as much as the all she got from his she would not have been her distrustful self if she could have settled down in complacent security and her mind was ever at stretch on that point comparing past days and nights with the days and nights of the present her prevision that when she loved it would be desperately had been fulfilled he had become her life when this befalls one whose besetting strength and weakness alike is prideno wonder that she doubts  for their odyssey they had gone to spainthat brown uneuropean land of lyrio flowers and cries of agua in the streets where the men seem cleft to the waist when they are astride of horses under their wide black hats and the blackclothed women with wonderful eyes still look as if they missed their eastern veils it had been a month of gaiety and glamour last days of september and early days of october a revel of enchanted wanderings in the streets of seville of embraces and laughter of strange scents and stranger sounds of orange light and velvety shadows and all the warmth and deep gravity of spain the alcazar the cigarettegirls the gipsy dancers of triana the old brown ruins to which they rode the streets and the square with its grave talkers sitting on benches in the sun the watersellers and the melons the mules and the dark ragged man out of a dream picking up the ends of cigarettes the wine of malaga burnt fire and honey seville had bewitched themthey got no further they had come back across the brown uplands of castile to madrid and goya and velasquez till it was time for paris before the lawterm began there in a queer little french hotelall bedrooms and a lift coffee and carved beds wood fires and a chambermaid who seemed all france and down below a restaurant to which such as knew about eating came with waiters who looked like monks both fat and leanthey had spent a week three special memories of that week started up in the moonlight before gyps eyes the long drive in the bois among the falling leaves of trees flashing with colour in the crisp air under a brilliant sky a moment in the louvre before the leonardo bacchus whenhis restored pink skin forgottenall the world seemed to drop away while she listened with the listening figure before her to some mysterious music of growing flowers and secret life and that last most disconcerting memory of the night before they returned they were having supper after the theatre in their restaurant when in a mirror she saw three people come in and take seats at a table a little way behindfiorsen rosek and daphne wing how she managed to show no sign she never knew while they were ordering she was safe for rosek was a gourmet and the girl would certainly be hungry but after that she knew that nothing could save her being seenrosek would mark down every woman in the room should she pretend to feel faint and slip out into the hotel or let bryan know or sit there laughing and talking eating and drinking as if nothing were behind her  her own face in the mirror had a flush and her eyes were bright when they saw her they would see that she was happy safe in her love her foot sought summerhays beneath the table how splendid and brown and fit he looked compared with those two pale towny creatures and he was gazing at her as though just discovering her beauty how could she everthat man with his little beard and his white face and those eyeshow could she ever ugh and then in the mirror she saw roseks darkcircled eyes fasten on her and betray their recognition by a sudden gleam saw his lips compressed and a faint red come up in his cheeks what would he do the girls back was turnedher perfect backand she was eating and fiorsen was staring straight before him in that moody way she knew so well all depended on that deadly little man who had once kissed her throat a sick feeling seized on gyp if her lover knew that within five yards of him were those two men but she still smiled and talked and touched his foot rosek had seen that she was consciouswas getting from it a kind of satisfaction she saw him lean over and whisper to the girl and daphne wing turning to look and her mouth opening for a smothered oh gyp saw her give an uneasy glance at fiorsen and then begin again to eat surely she would want to get away before he saw yes very soon she rose what little airs of the world she had nowquite mistress of the situation the wrap must be placed exactly on her shoulders and how she walked giving just one startled look back from the door gone the ordeal over and gyp said  lets go up darling  she felt as if they had both escaped a deadly perilnot from anything those two could do to him or her but from the cruel ache and jealousy of the past which the sight of that man would have brought him  women for their age are surely older than menmarried women at all events than men who have not had that experience and all through those first weeks of their life together there was a kind of wise watchfulness in gyp he was only a boy in knowledge of life as she saw it and though his character was so much more decided active and insistent than her own she felt it lay with her to shape the course and avoid the shallows and sunken rocks the house they had seen together near the river under the berkshire downs was still empty and while it was being got ready they lived at a london hotel she had insisted that he should tell no one of their life together if that must come she wanted to be firmly settled in with little gyp and betty and the horses so that it should all be for him as much like respectable married life as possible but one day in the first week after their return while in her room just back from a long days shopping a card was brought up to her lady summerhay her first impulse was to be not at home her second id better face it bryan would wish me to see her when the pageboy was gone she turned to the mirror and looked at herself doubtfully she seemed to know exactly what that tall woman whom she had seen on the platform would think of hertoo soft not capable not right for himnot even if she were legally his wife and touching her hair laying a dab of scent on her eyebrows she turned and went downstairs fluttering but outwardly calm enough  in the little lowroofed inner lounge of that old hotel whose rooms were all entirely renovated gyp saw her visitor standing at a table rapidly turning the pages of an illustrated magazine as people will when their minds are set upon a coming operation and she thought i believe shes more frightened than i am  lady summerhay held out a gloved hand  how do you do she said i hope youll forgive my coming  gyp took the hand  thank you it was very good of you im sorry bryan isnt in yet will you have some tea  ive had tea but do lets sit down how do you find the hotel  very nice  on a velvet lounge that had survived the renovation they sat side by side screwed round toward each other  bryans told me what a pleasant time you had abroad hes looking very well i think im devoted to him you know  gyp answered softly  yes you must be and her heart felt suddenly as hard as flint  lady summerhay gave her a quick look  ii hope you wont mind my being frankive been so worried its an unhappy position isnt it gyp did not answer and she hurried on if theres anything i can do to help i should be so gladit must be horrid for you  gyp said very quietly  oh no im perfectly happycouldnt be happier and she thought i suppose she doesnt believe that  lady summerhay was looking at her fixedly  one doesnt realize these things at firstneither of you will till you see how dreadfully society can coldshoulder  gyp made an effort to control a smile  one can only be coldshouldered if one puts oneself in the way of it i should never wish to see or speak to anyone who couldnt take me just for what i am and i dont really see what difference it will make to bryan most men of his age have someone somewhere she felt malicious pleasure watching her visitor jib and frown at the cynicism of that soft speech a kind of hatred had come on her of this society woman whodisguise it as she wouldwas at heart her enemy who regarded her must regard her as an enslaver as a despoiler of her sons worldly chances a delilah dragging him down she said still more quietly he need tell no one of my existence and you can be quite sure that if ever he feels hes had enough of me hell never be troubled by the sight of me again  and she got up lady summerhay also rose  i hope you dont thinki really am only too anxious to  i think its better to be quite frank you will never like me or forgive me for ensnaring bryan and so it had better be please as it would be if i were just his common mistress that will be perfectly all right for both of us it was very good of you to come though thank youand goodbye  lady summerhay literally faltered with speech and hand  with a malicious smile gyp watched her retirement among the little tables and elaborately modern chairs till her tall figure had disappeared behind a column then she sat down again on the lounge pressing her hands to her burning ears she had never till then known the strength of the pridedemon within her at the moment it was almost stronger than her love she was still sitting there when the pageboy brought her another cardher fathers she sprang up saying  yes here please  winton came in all brisk and elated at sight of her after this long absence and throwing her arms round his neck she hugged him tight he was doubly precious to her after the encounter she had just gone though when he had given her news of mildenham and little gyp he looked at her steadily and said  the coastll be clear for you both down there and at bury street whenever you like to come gyp i shall regard this as your real marriage i shall have the servants in and make that plain  a row like family prayersand dad standing up very straight saying in his dry way you will be so good in future as to remember i shall be obliged if you will and so on bettys round face pouting at being brought in with all the others markeys soft inscrutable mrs markeys demure and goggling the maids rabbitfaces old pettances carved grin the film lifting from his little burning eyes ha mr bryn summeray he bought her orse and so shes gone to im and she said  darling i dont know its awfully sweet of you well see later  winton patted her hand we must stand up to em you know gyp you mustnt get your tail down  gyp laughed  no dad never  that same night across the strip of blackness between their beds she said  bryan promise me something  it depends i know you too well  no its quite reasonable and possible promise  all right if it is  i want you to let me take the lease of the red houselet it be mine the whole thinglet me pay for everything there  reasonable whats the point  only that i shall have a proper home of my own i cant explain but your mothers coming today made me feel i must  my child how could i possibly live on you there its absurd  you can pay for everything else londontravellingclothes if you like we can make it square up its not a question of money of course i only want to feel that if at any moment you dont need me any more you can simply stop coming  i think thats brutal gyp  no no so many women lose mens love because they seem to claim things of them i dont want to lose yours that waythats all  thats silly darling  its not menand women tooalways tug at chains and when there is no chain  well then let me take the house and you can go away when youre tired of me his voice sounded smothered resentful she could hear him turning and turning as if angry with his pillows and she murmured  no i cant explain but i really mean it  were just beginning life together and you talk as if you want to split it up it hurts gyp and thats all about it  she said gently  dont be angry dear  well why dont you trust me more  i do only i must make as sure as i can  the sound came again of his turning and turning  i cant  gyp said slowly  oh very well  a dead silence followed both lying quiet in the darkness trying to get the better of each other by sheer listening an hour perhaps passed before he sighed and feeling his lips on hers she knew that she had won   iii   there in the study the moonlight had reached her face an owl was hooting not far away and still more memories camethe happiest of all perhapsof first days in this old house together  summerhay damaged himself out hunting that first winter the memory of nursing him was strangely pleasant now that it was two years old for convalescence they had gone to the pyreneesargeles in march all almondblossom and snows against the bluea wonderful fortnight in london on the way back they had their first awkward encounter coming out of a theatre one evening gyp heard a womans voice close behind say why its bryan what ages and his answer defensively drawled out  halo how are you diana  oh awfully fit where are you nowadays why dont you come and see us  again the drawl  down in the country i will some time goodbye  a tall woman or girlredhaired with one of those wonderful white skins that go therewith and brownyes brown eyes gyp could see those eyes sweeping her up and down with a sort of burninglive curiosity bryans hand was thrust under her arm at once  come on lets walk and get a cab  as soon as they were clear of the crowd she pressed his hand to her breast and said  did you mind  mind of course not its for you to mind  who was it  a second cousin diana leyton  do you know her very well  oh yesused to  and do you like her very much  rather  he looked round into her face with laughter bubbling up behind his gravity ah but could one tease on such a subject as their love and to this day the figure of that tall girl with the burningwhite skin the burningbrown eyes the burningred hair was not quite a pleasant memory to gyp after that night they gave up all attempt to hide their union going to whatever they wished whether they were likely to meet people or not gyp found that nothing was so easily ignored as society when the heart was set on other things besides they were seldom in london and in the country did not wish to know anyone in any case but she never lost the feeling that what was ideal for her might not be ideal for him he ought to go into the world ought to meet people it would not do for him to be cut off from social pleasures and duties and then some day feel that he owed his starvation to her to go up to london too every day was tiring and she persuaded him to take a set of residential chambers in the temple and sleep there three nights a week in spite of all his entreaties she herself never went to those chambers staying always at bury street when she came up a kind of superstition prevented her she would not risk making him feel that she was hanging round his neck besides she wanted to keep herself desirableso little a matter of course that he would hanker after her when he was away and she never asked him where he went or whom he saw but sometimes she wondered whether he could still be quite faithful to her in thought love her as he used to and joy would go down behind a heavy bank of clouds till at his return the sun came out again love such as herspassionate adoring protective longing to sacrifice itself to give all that it had to him yet secretly demanding all his love in returnfor how could a proud woman love one who did not love hersuch love as this is always longing for a union more complete than it is likely to get in a world where all things move and change but against the grip of this love she never dreamed of fighting now from the moment when she knew she must cling to him rather than to her baby she had made no reservations all her eggs were in one basket as her fathers had been before herall  the moonlight was shining full on the old bureau and a vase of tulips standing there giving those flowers colour that was not colour and an unnamed look as if they came from a world which no human enters it glinted on a bronze bust of old voltaire which she had bought him for a christmas present so that the great writer seemed to be smiling from the hollows of his eyes gyp turned the bust a little to catch the light on its far cheek a letter was disclosed between it and the oak she drew it out thinking bless him he uses everything for paperweights and in the strange light its first words caught her eyes   dear bryan  but i sayyou are wasting yourself   she laid it down methodically pushing it back under the bust perhaps he had put it there on purpose she got up and went to the window to check the temptation to read the rest of that letter and see from whom it was no she did not admit that she was tempted one did not read letters then the full import of those few words struck into her dear bryan but i sayyou are wasting yourself a letter in a chain of correspondence then a womans hand but not his mothers nor his sistersshe knew their writings who had dared to say he was wasting himself a letter in a chain of letters an intimate correspondent whose name she did not know becausehe had not told her wasting himselfon whaton his life with her down here and was he had she herself not said that very night that he had lost his laugh she began searching her memory yes last christmas vacationthat clear cold wonderful fortnight in florence he had been full of fun it was may now was there no memory sinceof his old infectious gaiety she could not think of any but i sayyou are wasting yourself a sudden hatred flared up in her against the unknown woman who had said that thingand fever running through her veins made her ears burn she longed to snatch forth and tear to pieces the letter with its guardianship of which that bust seemed mocking her and she turned away with the thought ill go and meet him i cant wait here  throwing on a cloak she walked out into the moonlit garden and went slowly down the whitened road toward the station a magical dewless night the moonbeams had stolen in to the beech clump frosting the boles and boughs casting a fine ghostly grey over the shadowpatterned beechmast gyp took the short cut through it not a leaf moved in there no living thing stirred so might an earth be where only trees inhabited she thought ill bring him back through here and she waited at the far corner of the clump where he must pass some little distance from the station she never gave people unnecessary food for gossipany slighting of her irritated him she was careful to spare him that the train came in a car went whizzing by a cyclist then the first footpassenger at a great pace breaking into a run she saw that it was he and calling out his name ran back into the shadow of the trees he stopped dead in his tracks then came rushing after her that pursuit did not last long and in his arms gyp said  if you arent too hungry darling lets stay here a littleits so wonderful  they sat down on a great root and leaning against him looking up at the dark branches she said  have you had a hard day  yes got hung up by a late consultation and old leyton asked me to come and dine  gyp felt a sensation as when feet happen on ground that gives a little  the leytonsthats eaton square isnt it a big dinner  no only the old people and bertie and diana  diana thats the girl we met coming out of the theatre isnt it  when ohahwhat a memory gyp  yes its good for things that interest me  why did she interest you  gyp turned and looked into his face  yes is she clever  hm i suppose you might call her so  and in love with you  great scott why  is it very unlikely i am  he began kissing her lips and hair and closing her eyes gyp thought if only thats not because he doesnt want to answer then for some minutes they were silent as the moonlit beech clump  answer me truly bryan do you neverneverfeel as if you were wasting yourself on me  she was certain of a quiver in his grasp but his face was open and serene his voice as usual when he was teasing  well hardly ever arent you funny dear  promise me faithfully to let me know when youve had enough of me promise  all right but dont look for fulfilment in this life  im not so sure  i am  gyp put up her lips and tried to drown for ever in a kiss the memory of those words but i sayyou are wasting yourself   iv   summerhay coming down next morning went straight to his bureau his mind was not at ease wasting yourself what had he done with that letter of dianas he remembered gyps coming in just as he finished reading it searching the pigeonholes and drawers moving everything that lay about he twitched the bustand the letter lay disclosed he took it up

passion and passion always fatal i wonder perhaps you know  dont be angry with me for being such a grandmother  au revoir  your very good cousin  diana leyton   he crammed the letter into his pocket and sat there appalled it must have lain two days under that bust had gyp seen it he looked at the bronze face and the philosopher looked back from the hollows of his eyes as if to say what do you know of the human heart my boyyour own your mistresss that girls or anyones a pretty dance the heart will lead you yet put it in a packet tie it round with string seal it up drop it in a drawer lock the drawer and tomorrow it will be out and skipping on its wrappings ho ho and summerhay thought you old goat you never had one in the room above gyp would still be standing as he had left her putting the last touch to her haira man would be a scoundrel who even in thought couldhallo the eyes of the bust seemed to say pity thats queer isnt it why not pity that redhaired girl with the skin so white that it burns you and the eyes so brown that they burn youdont they old satan gyp had his heart no one in the world would ever take it from her  and in the chair where she had sat last night conjuring up memories he too now conjured how he had loved her did love her she would always be what she was and had been to him and the sages mouth seemed to twist before him with the words quite so my dear but the hearts very funnyverycapacious a tiny sound made him turn  little gyp was standing in the doorway  hallo he said  hallo baryn she came flying to him and he caught her up so that she stood on his knees with the sunlight shining on her fluffed out hair  well gipsy whos getting a tall girl  im goin to ride  ho ho  baryn lets do humptydumpty  all right come on he rose and carried her upstairs  gyp was still doing one of those hundred things which occupy women for a quarter of an hour after they are quite ready and at little gyps shout of humpty she suspended her needle to watch the sacred rite  summerhay had seated himself on the footrail of the bed rounding his arms sinking his neck blowing out his cheeks to simulate an egg then with an unexpectedness that even little gyp could always see through he rolled backward on to the bed  and she simulating all the kings horses tried in vain to put him up again this immemorial game watched by gyp a hundred times had today a special preciousness if he could be so ridiculously young what became of her doubts looking at his face pulled this way and that lazily imperturbable under the pommelings of those small fingers she thought and that girl dared to say he was wasting himself for in the night conviction had come to her that those words were written by the tall girl with the white skin the girl of the theatrethe diana of his last nights dinner humptydumpty was up on the bedrail again for the finale all the kings horses were clasped to him making the egg more round and over they both went with shrieks and gurgles what a boy he was she would notno she would not brood and spoil her day with him  but that afternoon at the end of a long gallop on the downs she turned her head away and said suddenly  is she a huntress  who  your cousindiana  in his laziest voice he answered  i suppose you meandoes she hunt me  she knew that tone that expression on his face knew he was angry but could not stop herself  i did  so youre going to become jealous gyp  it was one of those cold naked sayings that should never be spoken between loversone of those sayings at which the heart of the one who speaks sinks with a kind of dismay and the heart of the one who hears quivers she cantered on and he perforce after her when she reined in again he glanced into her face and was afraid it was all closed up against him and he said softly  i didnt mean that gyp  but she only shook her head he had meant ithad wanted to hurt her it didnt mattershe wouldnt give him the chance again and she said  look at that long white cloud and the applegreen in the skyrain tomorrow one ought to enjoy any fine day as if it were the last  uneasy ashamed yet still a little angry summerhay rode on beside her  that night she cried in her sleep and when he awakened her clung to him and sobbed out  oh such a dreadful dream i thought youd left off loving me  for a long time he held and soothed her never never he would never leave off loving her  but a cloud no broader than your hand can spread and cover the whole day   v   the summer passed and always there was that little patch of silence in her heart and in his the tall bright days grew taller slowly passed their zenith slowly shortened on saturdays and sundays sometimes with winton and little gyp but more often alone they went on the river for gyp it had never lost the magic of their first afternoon upon itnever lost its glamour as of an enchanted world all the week she looked forward to these hours of isolation with him as if the surrounding water secured her not only against a world that would take him from her if it could but against that side of his nature which so long ago she had named old georgian she had once adventured to the law courts by herself to see him in his wig and gown under that stiff grey crescent on his broad forehead he seemed so hard and cleverso of a world to which she never could belong so of a piece with the brilliant bullying of the whole proceeding she had come away feeling that she only possessed and knew one side of him on the river she had that side utterlyher lovable lazy impudently loving boy lying with his head in her lap plunging in for a swim splashing round her or with his sleeves rolled up his neck bare and a smile on his face plying his slow sculls downstream singing away my rolling river or puffing home like a demon in want of his dinner it was such a blessing to lose for a few hours each week this growing consciousness that she could never have the whole of him but all the time the patch of silence grew for doubt in the heart of one lover reacts on the heart of the other  when the long vacation came she made an heroic resolve he must go to scotland must have a month away from her a good long rest and while betty was at the sea with little gyp she would take her father to his cure she held so inflexibly to this resolve that after many protests he said with a shrug  very well i will thenif youre so keen to get rid of me  keen to get rid when she could not bear to be away from him but she forced her feeling back and said smiling  at last theres a good boy anything if only it would bring him back to her exactly as he had been she asked no questions as to where or to whom he would go   tunbridge wells that charming purgatory where the retired prepare their souls for a more permanent retirement was dreaming on its hills in long rows of adequate villas its commons and woods had remained unscorched so that the retired had not to any extent deserted it that august for the sea they still shopped in the pantiles strolled the uplands or flourished their golfclubs in the grassy parks they still drank tea in each others houses and frequented the many churches one could see their faces as it were goldened by their coming glory like the chins of children by reflection from buttercups from every kind of life they had retired and waiting now for a more perfect day were doing their utmost to postpone it they lived very long  gyp and her father had rooms in a hotel where he could bathe and drink the waters without having to climb three hills this was the first cure she had attended since the longpast time at wiesbaden was it possible that was only six years ago she felt so utterly so strangely different then life had been sparkling sips of every drink and of none too much now it was one long still draft to quench a thirst that would not be quenched  during these weeks she held herself absolutely at her fathers disposal but she lived for the post and if by any chance she did not get her daily letter her heart sank to the depths she wrote every day sometimes twice then tore up that second letter remembering for what reason she had set herself to undergo this separation during the first week his letters had a certain equanimity in the second week they became ardent in the third they were fitfulnow beginning to look forward now moody and dejected and they were shorter during this third week aunt rosamund joined them the good lady had become a staunch supporter of gyps new existence which in her view served fiorsen right why should the poor childs life be loveless she had a definitely low opinion of men and a lower of the state of the marriagelaws in her view any woman who struck a blow in that direction was something of a heroine and she was oblivious of the fact that gyp was quite guiltless of the desire to strike a blow against the marriagelaws or anything else aunt rosamunds aristocratic and rebellious blood boiled with hatred of what she called the stuffy people who still held that women were mens property it had made her specially careful never to put herself in that position  she had brought gyp a piece of news  i was walking down bond street past that teaandtart shop my dearyou know where they have those special coffeecreams and who should come out of it but miss daphne wing and our friend fiorsen and pretty hangdog he looked he came up to me with his little lady watching him like a lynx really my dear i was rather sorry for him hed got that hungry look of his shed been doing all the eating im sure he asked me how you were i told him very well  when you see her he said tell her i havent forgotten her and never shall but she was quite right this is the sort of lady that im fit for and the way he looked at that girl made me feel quite uncomfortable then he gave me one of his little bows and off they went she as pleased as punch i really was sorry for him  gyp said quietly  ah you neednt have been auntie hell always be able to be sorry for himself  a little shocked at her nieces cynicism aunt rosamund was silent the poor lady had not lived with fiorsen  that same afternoon gyp was sitting in a shelter on the common a book on her kneethinking her one long thought today is thursdaymonday week eleven daysstillwhen three figures came slowly toward her a man a woman and what should have been a dog english love of beauty and the rights of man had forced its nose back deprived it of half its ears and all but three inches or so of tail it had asthmaand waddled in disillusionment a voice said  thisll do maria we can take the sun ere  but for that voice with the permanent cold hoarseness caught beside innumerable graves gyp might not have recognized mr wagge for he had taken off his beard leaving nothing but sidewhiskers and mrs wagge had filled out wonderfully they were some time settling down beside her  you sit here maria you wont get the sun in your eyes  no robert ill sit here you sit there  no you sit there  no i will come duckie  but the dog standing stockily on the pathway was gazing at gyp while what was left of its broad nose moved from side to side mr wagge followed the direction of its glance  oh he said oh this is a surprise and fumbling at his straw hat he passed his other hand over his sleeve and held it out to gyp it felt almost dry and fatter than it had been while she was shaking it the dog moved forward and sat down on her feet mrs wagge also extended her hand clad in a shiny glove  this is aapleasure she murmured who would have thought of meeting you oh dont let duckie sit against your pretty frock come duckie  but duckie did not move resting his back against gyps shinbones mr wagge whose tongue had been passing over a mouth which she saw to its full advantage for the first time said abruptly  you avent come to live here ave you  oh no im only with my father for the baths  ah i thought not never havin seen you weve been retired here ourselves a matter of twelve months a pretty spot  yes lovely isnt it  we wanted nature the air suits us though a bitertoo irony as you might say but its a longlived place we were quite a time lookin round  mrs wagge added in her thin voice  yeswed thought of wimbledon you see but mr wagge liked this better he can get his walk here and its moreselect perhaps we have several friends the church is very nice  mr wagges face assumed an uncertain expression he said bluffly  i was always a chapel man buti dont know how it istheres something in a place like this that makes church seem moremore suitable my wife always had a leaning that way i never conceal my actions  gyp murmured  its a question of atmosphere isnt it  mr wagge shook his head  no i dont hold with incensewere not igh church but how are you maam we often speak of you youre looking well  his face had become a dusky orange and mrs wagges the colour of a doubtful beetroot the dog on gyps feet stirred snuffled turned round and fell heavily against her legs again she said quietly  i was hearing of daisy only today shes quite a star now isnt she  mrs wagge sighed mr wagge looked away and answered  its a sore subject there she is making her forty and fifty pound a week and run after in all the papers shes a successno doubt about it and she works saving a matter of fifteen undred a year i shouldnt be surprised why at my best the years the influenza was so bad i never cleared a thousand net no shes a success  mrs wagge added  have you seen her last photographthe one where shes standing between two hydrangeatubs it was her own idea  mr wagge mumbled suddenly  im always glad to see her when she takes a run down in a car but ive come here for quiet after the life ive led and i dont want to think about it especially before you maam i dontthats a fact  a silence followed during which mr and mrs wagge looked at their feet and gyp looked at the dog  ahhere you are it was winton who had come up from behind the shelter and stood with eyebrows slightly raised gyp could not help a smile her fathers weathered narrow face halfveiled eyes thin nose little crisp grey moustache that did not hide his firm lips his lean erect figure the very way he stood his thin dry clipped voice were the absolute antithesis of mr wagges thickset stoutly planted form thickskinned thickfeatured face thick rather hoarse yet oily voice it was as if providence had arranged a demonstration of the extremes of social type and she said  mr and mrs waggemy father  winton raised his hat gyp remained seated the dog duckie being still on her feet  appy to meet you sir i hope you have benefit from the waters theyre supposed to be most powerful i believe  thank younot more deadly than most are you drinking them  mr wagge smiled  nao he said we live here  indeed do you find anything to do  well as a fact ive come here for rest but i take a turkish bath once a fortnightfind it refreshing keeps the pores of the skin acting  mrs wagge added gently  it seems to suit my husband wonderfully  winton murmured  yes is this your dog bit of a philosopher isnt he  mrs wagge answered  oh hes a naughty dog arent you duckie  the dog duckie feeling himself the cynosure of every eye rose and stood panting into gyps face she took the occasion to get up  we must go im afraid goodbye its been very nice to meet you again when you see daisy will you please give her my love  mrs wagge unexpectedly took a handkerchief from her reticule mr wagge cleared his throat heavily gyp was conscious of the dog duckie waddling after them and of mrs wagge calling duckie duckie from behind her handkerchief  winton said softly  so those two got that pretty filly well she didnt show much quality when you come to think of it shes still with our friend according to your aunt  gyp nodded  yes and i do hope shes happy  he isnt apparently serves him right  gyp shook her head  oh no dad  well one oughtnt to wish any man worse than hes likely to get but when i see people daring to look down their noses at youby jove i get  darling what does that matter  winton answered testily  it matters very much to methe impudence of it his mouth relaxed in a grim little smile ah welltheres not much to choose between us so far as condemning our neighbours goes charity stakesalso ran charles clare winton the church and mrs grundy  they opened out to each other more in those few days at tunbridge wells than they had for years whether the process of bathing softened his crust or the air that mr wagge found a bitertoo irony as you might say had upon winton the opposite effect he certainly relaxed that first duty of man the concealment of his spirit and disclosed his activities as he never had beforehow such and such a person had been set on his feet so and so sent out to canada this mans wife helped over her confinement that mans daughter started again after a slip and gyps childworship of him bloomed anew  on the last afternoon of their stay she strolled out with him through one of the long woods that stretched away behind their hotel excited by the coming end of her selfinflicted penance moved by the beauty among those sunlit trees she found it difficult to talk but winton about to lose her was quite loquacious starting from the sinister change in the racingworldso plutocratic now with the american seat the increase of bookmaking owners and other tragic occurrenceshe launched forth into a jeremiad on the condition of things in general parliament he thought especially now that members were paid had lost its selfrespect the towns had eaten up the country hunting was threatened the power and vulgarity of the press were appalling women had lost their heads and everybody seemed afraid of having any breeding by the time little gyp was gyps age they would all be under the thumb of watch committees live in garden cities and have to account for every halfcrown they spent and every halfhour of their time the horse too would be an extinct animal brought out once a year at the lordmayors show he hopedthe deucehe might not be alive to see it and suddenly he added what do you think happens after death gyp  they were sitting on one of those benches that crop up suddenly in the heart of nature all around them briars and bracken were just on the turn and the hum of flies the vague stir of leaves and life formed but a single sound gyp gazing into the wood answered  nothing dad i think we just go back  ahmy idea too  neither of them had ever known what the other thought about it before  gyp murmured        la vie est vaine         un peu damour       un peu de haine         et puis bonjour   not quite a grunt or quite a laugh emerged from the depths of winton and looking up at the sky he said  and what they call god after all what is it just the very best you can get out of yourselfnothing more so far as i can see dash it you cant imagine anything more than you can imagine one would like to die in the open though like whytemelville but theres one thing thats always puzzled me gyp all ones life ones tried to have a single heart death comes and out you go then why did one love if theres to be no meeting after  yes except for that who would care but does the wanting to meet make it any more likely dad the world couldnt go on without love perhaps loving somebody or something with all your heart is all in itself  winton stared the remark was a little deep  yees he said at last i often think the religious johnnies are saving their money to put on a horse thatll never run after all i remember those yogi chaps in india there they sat and this jolly world might rot round them for all they caredthey thought they were going to be all right themselves in kingdom come but suppose it doesnt come  gyp murmured with a little smile  perhaps they were trying to love everything at once  rum way of showing it and hang it there are such a lot of things one cant love look at that he pointed upwards against the grey bole of a beechtree hung a board on which were the freshly painted words                      private          trespassers will be prosecuted   that board is stuck up all over this life and the next well we wont give them the chance to warn us off gyp  slipping her hand through his arm she pressed close up to him  no dad you and i will go off with the wind and the sun and the trees and the waters like procris in my picture   vi   the curious and complicated nature of man in matters of the heart is not sufficiently conceded by women professors clergymen judges and other critics of his conduct and naturally so since they all have vested interests in his simplicity even journalists are in the conspiracy to make him out less wayward than he is and dip their pens in epithets if his heart diverges inch or ell  bryan summerhay was neither more curious nor more complicated than those of his own sex who would condemn him for getting into the midnight express from edinburgh with two distinct emotions in his hearta regretful aching for the girl his cousin whom he was leaving behind and a rapturous anticipation of the woman whom he was going to rejoin how was it possible that he could feel both at once against all the rules women and other moralists would say well the fact is a mans heart knows no rules and he found it perfectly easy lying in his bunk to dwell on memories of diana handing him tea or glancing up at him while he turned the leaves of her songs with that enticing mockery in her eyes and about her lips and yet the next moment to be swept from head to heel by the longing to feel gyps arms around him to hear her voice look in her eyes and press his lips on hers if instead of being on his way to rejoin a mistress he had been going home to a wife he would not have felt a particle more of spiritual satisfaction perhaps not so much he was returning to the feelings and companionship that he knew were the most deeply satisfying spiritually and bodily he would ever have and yet he could ache a little for that redhaired girl and this without any difficulty how disconcerting but then truth is  from that queer seesawing of his feelings he fell asleep dreamed of all things under the sun as men only can in a train was awakened by the hollow silence in some station slept again for hours it seemed and woke still at the same station fell into a sound sleep at last that ended at willesden in broad daylight dressing hurriedly he found he had but one emotion now one longingto get to gyp sitting back in his cab hands deepthrust into the pockets of his ulster he smiled enjoying even the smell of the misty london morning where would she bein the hall of the hotel waiting or upstairs still  not in the hall and asking for her room he made his way to its door  she was standing in the far corner motionless deadly pale quivering from head to foot and when he flung his arms round her she gave a long sigh closing her eyes with his lips on hers he could feel her almost fainting and he too had no consciousness of anything but that long kiss  next day they went abroad to a little place not far from fecamp in that normandy countryside where all things are largethe people the beasts the unhedged fields the courtyards of the farms guarded so squarely by tall trees the skies the sea even the blackberries large and gyp was happy but twice there came letters in that toowellremembered handwriting which bore a scottish postmark a phantom increases in darkness solidifies when seen in mist jealousy is rooted not in reason but in the nature that feels itin her nature that loved desperately felt proudly and jealousy flourishes on scepticism even if pride would have let her ask what good she would not have believed the answers of course he would sayif only out of pitythat he never let his thoughts rest on another woman but after all it was only a phantom there were many hours in those three weeks when she felt he really loved her and sowas happy  they went back to the red house at the end of the first week in october little gyp home from the sea was now an almost accomplished horsewoman under the tutelage of old pettance she had been riding steadily round and round those rough fields by the linhay which they called the wild her firm brown legs astride of the mousecoloured pony her little brown face with excited dark eyes very erect her auburn crop of short curls flopping up and down on her little straight back she wanted to be able to go out riding with grandy and mum and baryn and the first days were spent by them all more or less in fulfilling her new desires then term began and gyp sat down again to the long sharing of summerhay with his other life   vii   one afternoon at the beginning of november the old scotch terrier ossian lay on the path in the pale sunshine he had lain there all the morning since his master went up by the early train nearly sixteen years old he was deaf now and disillusioned and every time that summerhay left him his eyes seemed to say you will leave me once too often the blandishments of the other nice people about the house were becoming to him daily less and less a substitute for that which he felt he had not much time left to enjoy nor could he any longer bear a stranger within the gate from her window gyp saw him get up and stand with his back ridged growling at the postman and fearing for the mans calves she hastened out  among the letters was one in that dreaded hand writing marked immediate and forwarded from his chambers she took it up and put it to her nose a scentof what too faint to say her thumb nails sought the edge of the flap on either side she laid the letter down any other letter but not thatshe wanted to open it too much readdressing it she took it out to put with the other letters and instantly the thought went through her what a pity if i read it and there was nothing all her restless jealous misgivings of months past would then be set at rest she stood uncertain with the letter in her hand ahbut if there were something she would lose at one stroke her faith in him and her faith in herselfnot only his love but her own selfrespect she dropped the letter on the table could she not take it up to him herself by the three oclock slow train she could get to him soon after five she looked at her watch she would just have time to walk down and she ran upstairs little gyp was sitting on the top stairher favourite seatlooking at a picturebook  im going up to london darling tell betty i may be back tonight or perhaps i may not give me a good kiss  little gyp gave the good kiss and said  let me see you put your hat on mum  while gyp was putting on hat and furs she thought i shant take a bag i can always make shift at bury street if she did not finish the thought but the blood came up in her cheeks take care of ossy darling she ran down caught up the letter and hastened away to the station in the train her cheeks still burned might not this first visit to his chambers be like her old first visit to the little house in chelsea she took the letter out how she hated that large scrawly writing for all the thoughts and fears it had given her these past months if that girl knew how much anxiety and suffering she had caused would she stop writing stop seeing him and gyp tried to conjure up her face that face seen only for a minute and the sound of that clipped clear voice but once heardthe face and voice of one accustomed to have her own way no it would only make her go on all the more fair game against a woman with no claimbut that of love thank heaven she had not taken him away from any womanunlessthat girl perhaps thought she had ah why in all these years had she never got to know his secrets so that she might fight against what threatened her but would she have fought to fight for love was degrading horrible and yetif one did not she got up and stood at the window of her empty carriage there was the riverand thereyes the very backwater where he had begged her to come to him for good it looked so different bare and shorn under the light grey sky the willows were all polled the reeds cut down and a line from one of his favourite sonnets came into her mind        bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang   ah well time enough to face things when they came she would only think of seeing him and she put the letter back to burn what hole it liked in the pocket of her fur coat  the train was late it was past five already growing dark when she reached paddington and took a cab to the temple strange to be going there for the first timenot even to know exactly where harcourt buildings were at temple lane she stopped the cab and walked down that narrow illlighted busy channel into the heart of the great law  up those stone steps miss along the railin second doorway gyp came to the second doorway and in the doubtful light scrutinized the names summerhaysecond floor she began to climb the stairs her heart beat fast what would he say how greet her was it not absurd dangerous to have come he would be having a consultation perhaps there would be a clerk or someone to beard and what name could she give on the first floor she paused took out a blank card and pencilled on it        can i see you a minuteg   then taking a long breath to quiet her heart she went on up there was the name and there the door she rangno one came listenedcould hear no sound all looked so massive and bleak and dimthe iron railings stone stairs bare walls oak door she rang again what should she do leave the letter not see him after allher little romance all come to naughtjust a chilly visit to bury street where perhaps there would be no one but mrs markey for her father she knew was at mildenham hunting and would not be up till sunday and she thought ill leave the letter go back to the strand have some tea and try again  she took out the letter with a sort of prayer pushed it through the slit of the door heard it fall into its wire cage then slowly descended the stairs to the outer passage into temple lane it was thronged with men and boys at the end of the days work but when she had nearly reached the strand a womans figure caught her eye she was walking with a man on the far side their faces were turned toward each other gyp heard their voices and faint dizzy stood looking back after them they passed under a lamp the light glinted on the womans hair on a trick of summerhays the lift of one shoulder when he was denying something she heard his voice highpitched she watched them cross mount the stone steps she had just come down pass along the railed stone passage enter the doorway disappear and such horror seized on her that she could hardly walk away  oh no oh no oh no so it went in her minda kind of moaning like that of a cold rainy wind through dripping trees what did it mean oh what did it mean in this miserable tumult the only thought that did not come to her was that of going back to his chambers she hurried away it was a wonder she was not run over for she had no notion what she was doing where going and crossed the streets without the least attention to traffic she came to trafalgar square and stood leaning against its parapet in front of the national gallery here she had her first coherent thought so that was why his chambers had been empty no clerkno one that they might be alone alone where she had dreamed of being alone with him and only that morning he had kissed her and said goodbye treasure a dreadful little laugh got caught in her throat confused with a sob whywhy had she a heart down there against the plinth of one of the lions a young man leaned with his arms round a girl pressing her to him gyp turned away from the sight and resumed her miserable wandering she went up bury street no light not any sign of life it did not matter she could not have gone in could not stay still must walk she put up her veil to get more air feeling choked  the trees of the green park under which she was passing now had still a few leaves and they gleamed in the lamplight coppercoloured as that girls hair all sorts of torturing visions came to her those empty chambers she had seen one little minute of their intimacy a hundred kisses might have passed between thema thousand words of love and he would lie to her already he had acted a lie she had not deserved that and this sense of the injustice done her was the first relief she feltthis definite emotion of a mind clouded by sheer misery she had not deserved that he should conceal things from her she had not had one thought or look for any man but him since that night down by the sea when he came to her across the garden in the moonlightnot one thoughtand never would poor relief enough she was in hyde park now wandering along a pathway which cut diagonally across the grass and with more resolution more purpose she began searching her memory for signs proofs of when he had changed to her she could not find them he had not changed in his ways to her not at all could one act love then act passion orhorrible thoughtwhen he kissed her nowadays was he thinking of that girl  she heard the rustling of leaves behind a youth was following her along the path some ravening youth whose ungoverned breathing had a kind of pathos in it heaven what irony she was too miserable to care hardly even knew when in the main path again she was free from his pursuit love why had it such possession of her that a little thingyes a little thingonly the sight of him with another should make her suffer so she came out on the other side of the park what should she do crawl home creep into her hole and lie there stricken at paddington she found a train just starting and got in there were other people in the carriage business men from the city lawyers from thatplace where she had been and she was glad of their company glad of the crackle of evening papers and stolid faces giving her looks of stolid interest from behind them glad to have to keep her mask on afraid of the violence of her emotion but one by one they got out to their cars or their constitutionals and she was left alone to gaze at darkness and the deserted river just visible in the light of a moon smothered behind the souwesterly sky and for one wild moment she thought shall i open the door and step outone steppeace  she hurried away from the station it was raining and she drew up her veil to feel its freshness on her hot face there was just light enough for her to see the pathway through the beech clump the wind in there was sighing soughing driving the dark boughs tearing off the leaves little black wet shapes that came whirling at her face the wild melancholy in that swaying wood was too much for gyp she ran thrusting her feet through the deep rustling drifts of leaves not yet quite drenched they clung all wet round her thin stockings and the rainy wind beat her forehead at the edge she paused for breath leaning against the bole of a beech peering back where the wild whirling wind was moaning and tearing off the leaves then bending her head to the rain she went on in the open trying to prepare herself to show nothing when she reached home  she got in and upstairs to her room without being seen if she had possessed any sedative drug she would have taken it anything to secure oblivion from this aching misery huddling before the freshly lighted fire she listened to the wind driving through the poplars and once more there came back to her the words of that song sung by the scottish girl at fiorsens concert        and my heart reft of its own sun       deep lies in deathtorpor cold and grey   presently she crept into bed and at last fell asleep  she woke next morning with the joyful thought its saturday hell be down soon after lunch and then she remembered ah no it was too much at the pang of that remembrance it was as if a devil entered into hera devil of stubborn pride which grew blacker with every hour of that morning after lunch that she might not be in when he came she ordered her mare and rode up on the downs alone the rain had ceased but the wind still blew strong from the souwest and the sky was torn and driven in swathes of white and grey to north south east and west and puffs of what looked like smoke scurried across the cloud banks and the glacierblue rifts between the mare had not been out the day before and on the springy turf stretched herself in that thoroughbred gallop which bears a rider up as it were on air till nothing but the thud of hoofs the grass flying by the beating of the wind in her face betrayed to gyp that she was moving for full two miles they went without a pull only stopped at last by the finish of the level from there one could see faraway over to wittenham clumps across the valley and to the high woods above the river in the eastaway in the south and west under that strange torn sky to a whole autumn land of whitish grass bare fields woods of grey and gold and brown fast being pillaged but all that sweep of wind and sky freshness of rain and distant colour could not drive out of gyps heart the hopeless aching and the devil begotten of it   viii   there are men who however welloffeither in money or lovemust gamble their affections may be deeply rooted but they cannot repulse fate when it tantalizes them with a risk  summerhay who loved gyp was not tired of her either physically or mentally and even felt sure he would never tire had yet dallied for months with this risk which yesterday had come to a head and now taking his seat in the train to return to her he felt unquiet and since he resented disquietude he tried defiantly to think of other things but he was very unsuccessful looking back it was difficult for him to tell when the snapping of his defences had begun a preference shown by one accustomed to exact preference is so insidious the girl his cousin was herself a gambler he did not respect her as he respected gyp she did not touch him as gyp touched him was notno not halfso deeply attractive but she hadconfound her the power of turning his head at moments a queer burning skindeep fascination and above all that most dangerous quality in a womanthe lure of an imperious vitality in love with life she made him feel that he was letting things slip by and since to drink deep of life was his nature toowhat chance had he of escape faroff cousinhood is a dangerous relationship its familiarity is not great enough to breed contempt but sufficient to remove those outer defences to intimacy the conquest of which in other circumstances demands the conscious effort which warns people whither they are going  summerhay had not realized the extent of the danger but he had known that it existed especially since scotland it would be interestingas the historians sayto speculate on what he would have done if he could have foretold what would happen but he had certainly not foretold the crisis of yesterday evening he had received a telegram from her at lunchtime suggesting the fulfilment of a jesting promise made in scotland that she should have tea with him and see his chambersa small and harmless matter only why had he dismissed his clerk so early that is the worst of gamblersthey will put a polish on the risks they run he had not reckoned perhaps that she would look so pretty lying back in his big oxford chair with furs thrown open so that her white throat showed her hair gleaming a smile coming and going on her lips her white hand with polished nails holding that cigarette her brown eyes so unlike gyps fixed on him her slim foot with high instep thrust forward in transparent stocking not reckoned that when he bent to take her cup she would put out her hands draw his head down press her lips to his and say now you know his head had gone round still went round thinking of it that was all a little matterexcept that in an hour he would be meeting the eyes of one he loved much more and yetthe poison was in his blood a kiss so cut shortby whatwhat counter impulseleaving him gazing at her without a sound inhaling that scent of herssomething like a pine woods scent only sweeter while she gathered up her gloves fastened her furs as if it had been he not she who had snatched that kiss but her hand had pressed his arm against her as they went down the stairs and getting into her cab at the temple station she had looked back at him with a little halfmocking smile of challenge and comradeship and promise the link would be hard to breakeven if he wanted to and yet nothing would come of it heavens no he had never thought marriage impossible anything elseeven more impossible when he got back to his chambers he had found in the box the letter which her telegram had repeated readdressed by gyp from the red house and a faint uneasiness at its having gone down there passed through him he spent a restless evening at the club playing cards and losing sat up late in his chambers over a case had a hard mornings work and only now that he was nearing gyp realized how utterly he had lost the straightforward simplicity of things  when he reached the house and found that she had gone out riding alone his uneasiness increased why had she not waited as usual for him to ride with her and he paced up and down the garden where the wind was melancholy in the boughs of the walnuttree that had lost all its leaves little gyp was out for her walk and only poor old ossy kept him company had she not expected him by the usual train he would go and try to find out he changed and went to the stables old pettance was sitting on a cornbin examining an aged ruffs guide which contained records of his longpast glory scored under by a pencil june stakes agility e pettance 3rd tidport selling hcap dorothea e pettance o salisbury cup also ran plum pudding e pettance with other triumphs he got up saying  goodafternoon sir windy afternoon sir the mistress as been gone out over two hours sir she wouldnt take me with er  hurry up then and saddle hotspur  yes sir very good sir  over two hours he went up on to the downs by the way they generally came home and for an hour he rode keeping a sharp lookout for any sign of her no use and he turned home hot and uneasy on the hall table were her ridingwhip and gloves his heart cleared and he ran upstairs she was doing her hair and turned her head sharply as he entered hurrying across the room he had the absurd feeling that she was standing at bay she drew back bent her face away from him and said  no dont pretend anythings better than pretence  he had never seen her look or speak like thather face so hard her eyes so stabbing and he recoiled dumbfounded  whats the matter gyp  nothing onlydont pretend and turning to the glass she went on twisting and coiling up her hair  she looked lovely flushed from her ride in the wind and he had a longing to seize her in his arms but her face stopped him with fear and a sort of anger he said  you might explain i think  an evil little smile crossed her face  you can do that i am in the dark  i dont in the least understand what you mean  dont you there was something deadly in her utter disregard of him while her fingers moved swiftly about her dark shining hairsomething so appallingly sudden in this hostility that summerhay felt a peculiar sensation in his head as if he must knock it against something he sat down on the side of the bed was it that letter but how it had not been opened he said  what on earth has happened gyp since i went up yesterday speak out and dont keep me like this  she turned and looked at him  dont pretend that youre upset because you cant kiss me dont be false bryan you know its been pretence for months  summerhays voice grew high  i think youve gone mad i dont know what you mean  oh yes you do did you get a letter yesterday marked immediate  ah so it was that to meet the definite he hardened and said stubbornly  yes from diana leyton do you object  no only how do you think it got back to you from here so quickly  he said dully  i dont know by post i suppose  no i put it in your letterbox myselfat halfpast five  summerhays mind was trained to quickness and the full significance of those words came home to him at once he stared at her fixedly  i suppose you saw us then  yes  he got up made a helpless movement and said  oh gyp dont dont be so hard i swear by  gyp gave a little laugh turned her back and went on coiling at her hair and again that horrid feeling that he must knock his head against something rose in summerhay he said helplessly  i only gave her tea why not shes my cousin its nothing why should you think the worst of me she asked to see my chambers why not i couldnt refuse  your empty chambers dont bryanits pitiful i cant bear to hear you  at that lash of the whip summerhay turned and said  it pleases you to think the worst then  gyp stopped the movement of her fingers and looked round at him  ive always told you you were perfectly free do you think i havent felt it going on for months there comes a moment when pride revoltsthats all dont lie to me please  i am not in the habit of lying but still he did not go that awful feeling of encirclement of a net round him through which he could not breaka net which he dimly perceived even in his resentment to have been spun by himself by that cursed intimacy kept from her all to no purposebeset him more closely every minute could he not make her see the truth that it was only her he really loved and he said  gyp i swear to you theres nothing but one kiss and that was not  a shudder went through her from head to foot she cried out  oh please go away  he went up to her put his hands on her shoulders and said  its only you i really love i swear it why dont you believe me you must believe me you cant be so wicked as not to its foolishfoolish think of our lifethink of our lovethink of all her face was frozen he loosened his grasp of her and muttered oh your pride is awful  yes its all ive got lucky for you i have it you can go to her when you like  go to her its absurdi couldntif you wish ill never see her again  she turned away to the glass  oh dont what is the use  nothing is harder for one whom life has always spoiled than to find his best and deepest feelings disbelieved in at that moment summerhay meant absolutely what he said the girl was nothing to him if she was pursuing him how could he help it and he could not make gyp believe it how awful how truly terrible how unjust and unreasonable of her and why what had he done that she should be so unbelievingshould think him such a shallow scoundrel could he help the girls kissing him help her being fond of him help having a mans nature unreasonable unjust ungenerous and giving her a furious look he went out  he went down to his study flung himself on the sofa and turned his face to the wall devilish but he had not been there five minutes before his anger seemed childish and evaporated into the chill of deadly and insistent fear he was perceiving himself up against much more than a mere incident up against her natureits pride and scepticismyesand the very depth and singleness of her love while she wanted nothing but him he wanted and took so much else he perceived this but dimly as part of that feeling that he could not break through of the irritable longing to put his head down and butt his way out no matter what the obstacles what was coming how long was this state of things to last he got up and began to pace the room his hands clasped behind him his head thrown back and every now and then he shook that head trying to free it from this feeling of being held in chancery and then diana he had said he would not see her again but was that possible after that kissafter that last look back at him how what could he saydo how break so suddenly then at memory of gyps face he shivered ah how wretched it all was there must be some way outsome way surely some way out for when first in the wood of life fatality halts turns her dim dark form among the trees shows her pale cheek and those black eyes of hers shows with awful swiftness her strange realitymen would be fools indeed who admitted that they saw her   ix   gyp stayed in her room doing little thingsas a woman will when she is particularly wretchedsewing pale ribbons into her garments polishing her rings and the devil that had entered into her when she woke that morning having had his fling slunk away leaving the old bewildered misery she had stabbed her lover with words and looks felt pleasure in stabbing and now was bitterly sad what usewhat satisfaction how by vengeful prickings cure the deep wound disperse the canker in her life how heal herself by hurting him whom she loved so if he came up again now and made but a sign she would throw herself into his arms but hours passed and he did not come and she did not go downtoo truly miserable it grew dark but she did not draw the curtains the sight of the windy moonlit garden and the leaves driving across brought a melancholy distraction little gyp came in and prattled there was a tree blown down and she had climbed on it they had picked up two baskets of acorns and the pigs had been so greedy and she had been blown away so that betty had had to run after her and baryn was walking in the study he was so busy he had only given her one kiss  when she was gone gyp opened the window and let the wind full into her face if only it would blow out of her heart this sickening sense that all was over no matter how he might pretend to love her out of pity in a nature like hers so doubting and selfdistrustful confidence once shaken to the roots could never be restored a proud nature that went all lengths in love could never be content with a halflove she had been born too doubting proud and jealous yet made to love too utterly shewho had been afraid of love and when it came had fought till it swept her away who since then had lived for love and nothing else who gave all and wanted allknew for certain and for ever that she could not have all  it was nothing he had said nothing that for months he had been thinking at least a little of another woman besides herself she believed what he had told her that there had been no more than a kissbut was it nothing that they had reached that kiss this girlthis cousinwho held all the cards had everything on her sidethe world family influence security of life yes and more so terribly much morea mans longing for the young and unawakened this girl he could marry it was this thought which haunted her a mere momentary outbreak of mans natural wildness she could forgive and forgetoh yes it was the feeling that it was a girl his own cousin besieging him dragging him away that was so dreadful ah how horrible it washow horrible how in decent pride keep him from her fetter him  she heard him come up to his dressingroom and while he was still there stole out and down life must go on the servants be hoodwinked and so forth she went to the piano and played turning the dagger in her heart or hoping forlornly that music might work some miracle he came in presently and stood by the fire silent  dinner with the talk needful to blinding the householdfor what is more revolting than giving away the sufferings of the heartwas almost unendurable and directly it was over they went he to his study she back to the piano there she sat ready to strike the notes if anyone came in and tears fell on the hands that rested in her lap with all her soul she longed to go and clasp him in her arms and cry i dont carei dont care do what you likego to herif only youll love me a little and yet to lovea little was it possible not to her  in sheer misery she went upstairs and to bed she heard him come up and go into his dressingroomand at last in the firelight saw him kneeling by her  gyp  she raised herself and threw her arms round him such an embrace a drowning woman might have given pride and all were abandoned in an effort to feel him close once more to recover the irrecoverable past for a long time she listened to his pleading explanations justifications his protestations of undying lovestrange to her and painful yet so boyish and pathetic she soothed him clasping his head to her breast gazing out at the flickering fire in that hour she rose to a height above herself what happened to her own heart did not matter so long as he was happy and had all that he wanted with her and away from herif need be always away from her  but when he had gone to sleep a terrible time began for in the small hours when things are at their worst she could not keep back her weeping though she smothered it into the pillow it woke him and all began again the burden of her cry its gone the burden of his its notcant you see it isnt till at last that awful feeling that he must knock his head against the wall made him leap up and tramp up and down like a beast in a cagethe cage of the impossible for as in all human tragedies both were right according to their natures she gave him all herself wanted all in return and could not have it he wanted her the rest besides and no complaining and could not have it he did not admit impossibility she did  at last came another of those pitying lulls till he went to sleep in her arms long she lay awake staring at the darkness admitting despair trying to find how to bear it not succeeding impossible to cut his other life away from himimpossible that while he lived it this girl should not be tugging him away from her impossible to watch and question him impossible to live dumb and blind accepting the crumbs left over showing nothing would it have been better if they had been married but then it might have been the samereversed perhaps worse the roots were so much deeper than that he was not singlehearted and she was in spite of all that he said she knew he didnt really want to give up that girl how could he even if the girl would let him go and slowly there formed within her a gruesome little plan to test him then ever so gently withdrawing her arms she turned over and slept exhausted  next morning remorselessly carrying out that plan she forced herself to smile and talk as if nothing had happened watching the relief in his face his obvious delight at the change with a fearful aching in her heart she waited till he was ready to go down and then still smiling said  forget all about yesterday darling promise me you wont let it make any difference you must keep up your friendship you mustnt lose anything i shant mind i shall be quite happy he knelt down and leaned his forehead against her waist and stroking his hair she repeated i shall only be happy if you take everything that comes your way i shant mind a bit and she watched his face that had lost its trouble  do you really mean that  yes really  then you do see that its nothing never has been anythingcompared with younever  he had accepted her crucifixion a black wave surged into her heart  it would be so difficult and awkward for you to give up that intimacy it would hurt your cousin so  she saw the relief deepen in his face and suddenly laughed he got up from his knees and stared at her  oh gyp for gods sake dont begin again  but she went on laughing then with a sob turned away and buried her face in her hands to all his prayers and kisses she answered nothing and breaking away from him she rushed toward the door a wild thought possessed her why go on if she were dead it would be all right for him quietpeaceful quietfor them all but he had thrown himself in the way  gyp for heavens sake ill give her upof course ill give her up dodobe reasonable i dont care a fingersnap for her compared with you  and presently there came another of those lulls that both were beginning to know were mere pauses of exhaustion they were priceless all the same for the heart cannot go on feeling at that rate  it was sunday morning the churchbells ringing no wind a lull in the souwesterly galeone of those calms that fall in the night and last as a rule twelve or fifteen hours and the garden all strewn with leaves of every hue from green spotted with yellow to deep copper  summerhay was afraid he kept with her all the morning making all sorts of little things to do in her company but he gradually lost his fear she seemed so calm now and his was a nature that bore trouble badly ever impatient to shake it off and then after lunch the spiritstorm beat up again with a swiftness that showed once more how deceptive were those lulls how fearfully deep and lasting the wound he had simply asked her whether he should try to match something for her when he went up tomorrow she was silent a moment then answered  oh no thanks youll have other things to do people to see  the tone of her voice the expression on her face showed him with a fresh force of revelation what paralysis had fallen on his life if he could not reconvince her of his love he would be in perpetual fearthat he might come back and find her gone fear that she might even do something terrible to herself he looked at her with a sort of horror and without a word went out of the room the feeling that he must hit his head against something was on him once more and once more he sought to get rid of it by tramping up and down great god such a little thing such fearful consequences all her balance her sanity almost destroyed was what he had done so very dreadful he could not help diana loving him  in the night gyp had said you are cruel do you think there is any man in the world that i wouldnt hate the sight of if i knew that to see him gave you a moments pain it was truehe felt it was true but one couldnt hate a girl simply because she loved you at least he couldntnot even to save gyp pain that was not reasonable not possible but did that difference between a man and a woman necessarily mean that gyp loved him so much more than he loved her could she not see things in proportion see that a man might want did want other friendships even passing moments of passion and yet could love her just the same she thought him cruel called him cruelwhat for because he had kissed a girl who had kissed him because he liked talking to her andyes might even lose his head with her but cruel he was not gyp would always be first with him he must make her seebut how give up everything give updiana truth is so funnyit will out even in a mans thoughts well and he could his feeling was not deepthat was gods truth but it would be difficult awkward brutal to give her up completely it could be done though sooner than that gyp should think him cruel to her it could beshould be done  only would it be any use would she believe would she not always now be suspecting him when he was away from her whatever he did must he then sit down here in inactivity and a gust of anger with her swept him why should she treat him as if he were utterly unreliable orwas he he stood still when diana had put her arms round his neck he could no more have resisted answering her kiss than he could now fly through the window and over those poplar trees but he was not a blackguard not cruel not a liar how could he have helped it all the only way would have been never to have answered the girls first letter nearly a year ago how could he foresee and since then all so gradual and nothing really or almost nothing again the surge of anger swelled his heart she must have read the letter which had been under that cursed bust of old voltaire all those months ago the poison had been working ever since and in sudden fury at that miserable mischance he drove his fist into the bronze face the bust fell over and summerhay looked stupidly at his bruised hand a silly thing to do but it had quenched his anger he only saw gyps face nowso pitifully unhappy poor darling what could he do if only she would believe and again he had the sickening conviction that whatever he did would be of no avail he could never get back was only at the beginning of a trouble that had no end and like a rat in a cage his mind tried to rush out of this entanglement now at one end now at the other ah well why bruise your head against walls if it was hopelesslet it go and shrugging his shoulders he went out to the stables and told old pettance to saddle hotspur while he stood there waiting he thought shall i ask her to come but he could not stand another bout of miserymust have rest and mounting he rode up towards the downs  hotspur the sixteenhand brown horse with not a speck of white that gyp had ridden hunting the day she first saw summerhay was nine years old now his masters two faults as a horsemana habit of thrusting and not too light handshad encouraged his rather hard mouth and something had happened in the stables today to put him into a queer temper or perhaps he feltas horses willthe disturbance raging within his rider at any rate he gave an exhibition of his worst qualities and summerhay derived perverse pleasure from that waywardness he rode a good hour up there then hot with aching armsfor the brute was pulling like the devilhe made his way back toward home and entered what little gyp called the wild those two rough sedgy fields with the linhay in the corner where they joined there was a gap in the hedgegrowth of the bank between them and at this he put hotspur at speed the horse went over like a bird and for the first time since dianas kiss summerhay felt a moments joy he turned him round and sent him at it again and again hotspur cleared it beautifully but the animals blood was up now summerhay could hardly hold him muttering oh you brute dont pull he jagged the horses mouth there darted into his mind gyps word cruel and viciously in one of those queer nervecrises that beset us all he struck the pulling horse  they were cantering toward the corner where the fields joined and suddenly he was aware that he could no more hold the beast than if a steamengine had been under him straight at the linhay hotspur dashed and summerhay thought my god hell kill himself straight at the old stone linhay covered by the great ivy bush right at itinto it summerhay ducked his head not low enoughthe ivy concealed a beam a sickening crash torn backward out of the saddle he fell on his back in a pool of leaves and mud and the horse slithering round the linhay walls checked in his own length unhurt snorting frightened came out turning his wild eyes on his master who never stirred then trotted back into the field throwing up his head   x   when at her words summerhay went out of the room gyps heart sank all the morning she had tried so hard to keep back her despairing jealousy and now at the first reminder had broken down again it was beyond her strength to live day after day knowing that he up in london was either seeing that girl or painfully abstaining from seeing her and then when he returned to be to him just what she had been to show nothingwould it ever be possible hardest to bear was what seemed to her the falsity of his words maintaining that he still really loved her if he did how could he hesitate one second would not the very thought of the girl be abhorrent to him he would have shown that not merely said it among other wild things words were no use when they contradicted action she who loved with every bit of her could not grasp that a man can really love and want one woman and yet at the same time be attracted by another  that sudden fearful impulse of the morning to make away with herself and end it for them both recurred so vaguely that it hardly counted in her struggles the conflict centred now round the question whether life would be less utterly miserable if she withdrew from him and went back to mildenham life without him that was impossible life with him just as impossible it seemed there comes a point of mental anguish when the alternatives between which one swings equally hopeless become each so monstrous that the mind does not really work at all but rushes helplessly from one to the other no longer trying to decide waiting on fate so in gyp that sunday afternoon doing little things all the timemending a hole in one of his gloves brushing and applying ointment to old ossy sorting bills and letters  at five oclock knowing little gyp must soon be back from her walk and feeling unable to take part in gaiety she went up and put on her hat she turned from contemplation of her face with disgust since it was no longer the only face for him what was the use of beauty she slipped out by the side gate and went down toward the river the lull was over the southwest wind had begun sighing through the trees again and gorgeous clouds were piled up from the horizon into the pale blue she stood by the river watching its grey stream edged by a scum of tornoff twigs and floating leaves watched the wind shivering through the spoiled plumebranches of the willows and standing there she had a sudden longing for her father he alone could help herjust a littleby his quietness and his love by his mere presence  she turned away and went up the lane again avoiding the inn and the riverside houses walking slowly her head down and a thought came her first hopeful thought could they not travelgo round the world would he give up his work for thatthat chance to break the spell dared she propose it but would even that be anything more than a puttingoff if she was not enough for him now would she not be still less if his work were cut away still it was a gleam a gleam in the blackness she came in at the far end of the fields they called the wild a roseleaf hue tinged the white cloudbanks which towered away to the east beyond the river and peeping over that mountaintop was the moon fleecy and unsubstantial in the flaxblue sky it was one of natures moments of wild colour the oaktrees above the hedgerows had not lost their leaves and in the darting rainwashed light from the setting sun had a sheen of old gold with heart of ivygreen the hailstripped beeches flamed with copper the russet tufts of the ashtrees glowed and past gyp a single leaf blown off went soaring turning over and over going up on the rising wind upup higherhigher into the sky till it was lostaway  the rain had drenched the long grass and she turned back at the gate beside the linhay a horse was standing it whinnied hotspur saddled bridled with no rider why wherethen hastily she undid the latch ran through and saw summerhay lying in the mudon his back with eyes wideopen his forehead and hair all blood some leaves had dropped on him god o god his eyes had no sight his lips no breath his heart did not beat the leaves had dropped even on his facein the blood on his poor head gyp raised himstiffened cold as ice she gave one cry and fell embracing his dead stiffened body with all her strength kissing his lips his eyes his broken forehead clasping warming him trying to pass life into him till at last she too lay still her lips on his cold lips her body on his cold body in the mud and the fallen leaves while the wind crept and rustled in the ivy and went over with the scent of rain close by the horse uneasy put his head down and sniffed at her then backing away neighed and broke into a wild gallop round the field  old pettance waiting for summerhays return to stableup for the night heard that distant neigh and went to the garden gate screwing up his little eyes against the sunset he could see a loose horse galloping down there in the wild where no horse should be and thinking there now that artful devils broke away from the guvnor now ill ave to ketch im he went back got some oats and set forth at the best gait of his stiffjointed feet the old horseman characteristically did not think of accidents the guvnor had got off no doubt to unhitch that heavy gatethe one you had to lift that orsehe was a masterpiece of mischief his difference with the animal still rankled in a mind that did not easily forgive  half an hour later he entered the lighted kitchen shaking and gasping tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks into the corners of his gargoyles mouth and panted out  o my gord fetch the farmerfetch an urdle o my gord betty you and cooki cant get er off him she dont speak i felt herall cold come on you slutsquick o my gord the poor guvnor that orse must a galloped into the linhay and killed him ive seed the marks on the devils shoulder where he rubbed it scrapin round the wall come oncome on fetch an urdle or shell die there on him in the mud put the child to bed and get the doctor and send a wire to london to the major to come sharp oh blarst you allkeep your eads whats the good o howlin and blubberin  in the whispering corner of those fields light from a lantern and the moon fell on the old stone linhay on the ivy and the broken gate on the mud the golden leaves and the two quiet bodies clasped together gyps consciousness had flown there seemed no difference between them and presently over the rushy grass a procession moved back in the wind and the moonlighttwo hurdles two men carrying one two women and a man the other and behind old pettance and the horse   xi   when gyp recovered a consciousness whose flight had been mercifully renewed with morphia she was in her bed and her first drowsy movement was toward her mate with eyes still closed she turned as she was wont and put out her hand to touch him before she dozed off again there was no warmth no substance through her mind still away in the mists of morphia the thoughts passed vague and lonely ah yes in london and she turned on her back london somethingsomething up there she opened her eyes so the fire had kept in all night someone was in a chair there orwas she dreaming and suddenly without knowing why she began breathing hurriedly in little halfsobbing gasps the figure moved turned her face in the firelight betty gyp closed her eyes an icy sweat had broken out all over her a dream in a whisper she said  betty  the muffled answer came  yes my darlin  what is it  no answer then a halfchoked dont ee thinkdont ee think your daddyll be here directly my sweetie  gyps eyes wide open passed from the firelight and that rocking figure to the little chink of light that was hardly light as yet coming in at one corner of the curtain she was remembering her tongue stole out and passed over her lips beneath the bedclothes she folded both her hands tight across her heart then she was not dead with himnot dead not gone back with him into the groundnotand suddenly there flickered in her a flame of maniacal hatred they were keeping her alive a writhing smile forced its way up on to her parched lips  betty im so thirstyso thirsty get me a cup of tea  the stout form heaved itself from the chair and came toward the bed  yes my lovey at once itll do you good thats a brave girl  yes  the moment the door clicked to gyp sprang up her veins throbbed her whole soul was alive with cunning she ran to the wardrobe seized her long fur coat slipped her bare feet into her slippers wound a piece of lace round her head and opened the door all dark and quiet holding her breath stifling the sound of her feet she glided down the stairs slipped back the chain of the front door opened it and fled like a shadow she passed across the grass out of the garden gate down the road under the black dripping trees the beginning of light was mixing its grey hue into the darkness she could just see her feet among the puddles on the road she heard the grinding and whirring of a motorcar on its top gear approaching up the hill and cowered away against the hedge its light came searching along picking out with a mysterious momentary brightness the bushes and treetrunks making the wet road gleam gyp saw the chauffeur turn his head back at her then the cars body passed up into darkness and its taillight was all that was left to see perhaps that car was going to the red house with her father the doctor somebody helping to keep her alive the maniacal hate flared up in her again she flew on the light grew a man with a dog came out of a gate she had passed and called hallo she did not turn her head she had lost her slippers and ran with bare feet unconscious of stones or the tornoff branches strewing the road making for the lane that ran right down to the river a little to the left of the inn the lane of yesterday where the bank was free  she turned into the lane dimly a hundred or more yards away she could see the willows the width of lighter grey that was the river the riveraway my rolling riverthe riverand the happiest hours of all her life if he were anywhere she would find him there where he had sung and lain with his head on her breast and swum and splashed about her where she had dreamed and seen beauty and loved him so she reached the bank cold and grey and silent swifter than yesterday the stream was flowing by its dim far shore brightening slowly in the first break of dawn and gyp stood motionless drawing her breath in gasps after her long run her knees trembled gave way she sat down on the wet grass clasping her arms round her drawnup legs rocking herself to and fro and her loosened hair fell over her face the blood beat in her ears her heart felt suffocated all her body seemed on fire yet numb she sat moving her head up and downas the head of one moves that is gasping her lastwaiting for breathbreath and strength to let go life to slip down into the grey water and that queer apartness from self which is the property of fever came on her so that she seemed to see herself sitting there waiting and thought i shall see myself dead floating among the reeds i shall see the birds wondering above me and suddenly she broke into a storm of dry sobbing and all things vanished from her save just the rocking of her body the gasping of her breath and the sound of it in her ears her boyher boyand his poor hair away my rolling river swaying over she lay face down clasping at the wet grass and the earth  the sun rose laid a pale bright streak along the water and hid himself again a robin twittered in the willows a leaf fell on her bare ankle   winton who had been hunting on saturday had returned to town on sunday by the evening tram and gone straight to his club for some supper there falling asleep over his cigar he had to be awakened when they desired to close the club for the night it was past two when he reached bury street and found a telegram   something dreadful happened to mr summerhay come quickbetty   never had he so cursed the loss of his hand as during the time that followed when markey had to dress help his master pack bags and fetch a taxi equipped for so long a journey at halfpast three they started the whole way down winton wrapped in his fur coat sat a little forward on his seat ready to put his head through the window and direct the driver it was a wild night and he would not let markey whose chest was not strong go outside to act as guide twice that silent one impelled by feelings too strong even for his respectful taciturnity had spoken  thatll be bad for miss gyp sir  bad yesterrible  and later  dyou think it means hes dead sir  winton answered sombrely  god knows markey we must hope for the best  dead could fate be cruel enough to deal one so soft and loving such a blow and he kept saying to himself courage be ready for the worst be ready  but the figures of betty and a maid at the open garden gate in the breaking darkness standing there wringing their hands were too much for his stoicism leaping out he cried  what is it woman quick  oh sir my dears gone i left her a moment to get her a cup of tea and shes run out in the cold  winton stood for two seconds as if turned to stone then taking betty by the shoulder he asked quietly  what happened to him  betty could not answer but the maid said  the horse killed him at that linhay sir down in the wild and the mistress was unconscious till quarter of an hour ago  which way did she go  out here sir the door and the gate was opencant tell which way  through winton flashed one dreadful thought the river  turn the cab round stay in markey betty and you girl go down to the wild and search there at once yes what is it  the driver was leaning out  as we came up the hill sir i see a lady or something in a long dark coat with white on her head against the hedge  right drive down again sharp and use your eyes  at such moments thought is impossible and a feverish use of every sense takes its place but of thought there was no need for the gardens of villas and the inn blocked the river at all but one spot winton stopped the car where the narrow lane branched down to the bank and jumping out ran by instinct he ran silently on the grass edge and markey imitating ran behind when he came in sight of a black shape lying on the bank he suffered a moment of intense agony for he thought it was just a dark garment thrown away then he saw it move and holding up his hand for markey to stand still walked on alone tiptoeing in the grass his heart swelling with a sort of rapture stealthily moving round between that prostrate figure and the water he knelt down and said as best he could for the husk in his throat  my darling  gyp raised her head and stared at him her white face with eyes unnaturally dark and large and hair falling all over it was strange to himthe face of grief itself stripped of the wrappings of form and he knew not what to do how to help or comfort how to save he could see so clearly in her eyes the look of a wild animal at the moment of its capture and instinct made him say  i lost her just as cruelly gyp  he saw the words reach her brain and that wild look waver stretching out his arm he drew her close to him till her cheek was against his her shaking body against him and kept murmuring  for my sake gyp for my sake  when with markeys aid he had got her to the cab they took her not back to the house but to the inn she was in high fever and soon delirious by noon aunt rosamund and mrs markey summoned by telegram had arrived and the whole inn was taken lest there should be any noise to disturb her  at five oclock winton was summoned downstairs to the little socalled readingroom a tall woman was standing at the window shading her eyes with the back of a gloved hand though they had lived so long within ten miles of each other he only knew lady summerhay by sight and he waited for the poor woman to speak first she said in a low voice  there is nothing to say only i thought i must see you how is she  delirious  they stood in silence a full minute before she whispered  my poor boy did you see himhis forehead her lips quivered i will take him back home and tears rolled one after the other slowly down her flushed face under her veil poor woman poor woman she had turned to the window passing her handkerchief up under the veil staring out at the little strip of darkening lawn and winton too stared out into that mournful daylight at last he said  i will send you all his things exceptexcept anything that might help my poor girl  she turned quickly  and so its ended like this major winton is there anything behindwere they really happy  winton looked straight at her and answered  ah too happy  without a quiver he met those teardarkened dilated eyes straining at his with a heavy sigh she once more turned away and brushing her handkerchief across her face drew down her veil  it was not truehe knew from the mutterings of gyps feverbut no one not even summerhays mother should hear a whisper if he could help it at the door he murmured  i dont know whether my girl will get through or what she will do after when fate hits she hits too hard and you goodbye  lady summerhay pressed his outstretched hand  goodbye she said in a strangled voice i wish yougoodbye then turning abruptly she hastened away  winton went back to his guardianship upstairs  in the days that followed when gyp robbed of memory hung between life and death winton hardly left her room that low room with creepered windows whence the river could be seen gliding down under the pale november sunshine or black beneath the stars he would watch it fascinated as one sometimes watches the relentless sea he had snatched her as by a miracle from that snaky river  he had refused to have a nurse aunt rosamund and mrs markey were skilled in sickness and he could not bear that a strange person should listen to those delirious mutterings his own part of the nursing was just to sit there and keep her secrets from the othersif he could and he grudged every minute away from his post he would stay for hours with eyes fixed on her face no one could supply so well as he just that coherent thread of the familiar by which the fevered without knowing it perhaps find their way a little in the dark mazes where they wander and he would think of her as she used to bewell and happyadopting unconsciously the methods of those mental and other scientists whom he looked upon as quacks  he was astonished by the number of inquiries even people whom he had considered enemies left cards or sent their servants forcing him to the conclusion that people of position are obliged to reserve their human kindness for those as good as dead but the small folk touched him daily by their genuine concern for her whose grace and softness had won their hearts one morning he received a letter forwarded from bury street   dear major winton  i have read a paragraph in the paper about poor mr summerhays death and oh i feel so sorry for her she was so good to me i do feel it most dreadfully if you think she would like to know how we all feel for her you would tell her wouldnt you i do think its cruel  very faithfully yours  daphne wing   so they knew summerhays namehe had not somehow expected that he did not answer not knowing what to say  during those days of fever the hardest thing to bear was the sound of her rapid whisperings and mutteringsincoherent phrases that said so little and told so much sometimes he would cover his ears to avoid hearing of that long stress of mind at which he had now and then glimpsed of the actual tragedy her wandering spirit did not seem conscious her lips were always telling the depth of her love always repeating the dread of losing his except when they would give a whispering laugh uncanny and enchanting as at some gleam of perfect happiness those little laughs were worst of all to hear they never failed to bring tears into his eyes but he drew a certain gruesome comfort from the conclusion slowly forced on him that summerhays tragic death had cut short a situation which might have had an even more tragic issue one night in the big chair at the side of her bed he woke from a doze to see her eyes fixed on him they were different they saw were her own eyes again her lips moved  dad  yes my pet  i remember everything  at that dreadful little saying winton leaned forward and put his lips to her hand that lay outside the clothes  where is he buried  at widrington  yes  it was rather a sigh than a word and raising his head winton saw her eyes closed again now that the fever had gone the white transparency of her cheeks and forehead against the dark lashes and hair was too startling was it a living face or was its beauty that of death  he bent over she was breathingasleep   xii   the return to mildenham was made by easy stages nearly two months after summerhays death on new years daymildenham dark smelling the same full of ghosts of the days before love began for little gyp more than five years old now and beginning to understand life this was the pleasantest home yet in watching her becoming the spirit of the place as she herself had been when a child gyp found rest at times a little rest she had not picked up much strength was shadowy as yet and if her face was taken unawares it was the saddest face one could see her chief preoccupation was not being taken unawares alas to winton her smile was even sadder he was at his wits end about her that winter and spring she obviously made the utmost effort to keep up and there was nothing to do but watch and wait no use to force the pace time alone could healperhaps meanwhile he turned to little gyp so that they became more or less inseparable  spring came and passed physically gyp grew strong again but since their return to mildenham she had never once gone outside the garden never once spoken of the red house never once of summerhay winton had hoped that warmth and sunlight would bring some life to her spirit but it did not seem to not that she cherished her grief appeared rather to do all in her power to forget and mask it she only had what used to be called a broken heart nothing to be done little gyp who had been told that baryn had gone away for ever and that she must never speak of him for fear of making mum sad would sometimes stand and watch her mother with puzzled gravity she once remarked uncannily to winton  mum doesnt live with us grandy she lives away somewhere i think is it with baryn  winton stared and answered  perhaps it is sweetheart but dont say that to anybody but me dont ever talk of baryn to anyone else  yes i know but where is he grandy  what could winton answer some imbecility with the words very far in it for he had not courage to broach the question of death that mystery so hopelessly beyond the grasp of children and of himselfand others  he rode a great deal with the child who like her mother before her was never so happy as in the saddle but to gyp he did not dare suggest it she never spoke of horses never went to the stables passed all the days doing little things about the house gardening and sitting at her piano sometimes playing a little sometimes merely looking at the keys her hands clasped in her lap this was early in the fateful summer before any as yet felt the worldtremors or saw the veil of the temple rending and the darkness beginning to gather winton had no vision of the coif above the dark eyes of his loved one nor of himself in a strange brown garb calling out old familiar words over barracksquares he often thought if only she had something to take her out of herself  in june he took his courage in both hands and proposed a visit to london to his surprise she acquiesced without hesitation they went up in whitweek while they were passing widrington he forced himself to an unnatural spurt of talk and it was not till fully quarter of an hour later that glancing stealthily round his paper he saw her sitting motionless her face turned to the fields and tears rolling down it and he dared not speak dared not try to comfort her she made no sound the muscles of her face no movement only those tears kept rolling down and behind his paper wintons eyes narrowed and retreated his face hardened till the skin seemed tight drawn over the bones and every inch of him quivered  the usual route from the station to bury street was up and the cab went by narrow bystreets town lanes where the misery of the world is on show where illlooking men draggled and overdriven women and the jaunty ghosts of little children in gutters and on doorsteps proclaim by every feature of their claycoloured faces and every movement of their unfed bodies the postdatement of the millennium where the lean and smutted houses have a look of dissolution indefinitely put off and there is no more trace of beauty than in a sewer gyp leaning forward looked out as one does after a long sea voyage winton felt her hand slip into his and squeeze it hard  that evening after dinnerin the room he had furnished for her mother where the satinwood chairs the little jacobean bureau the old brass candelabra were still much as they had been just on thirty years agoshe said  dad ive been thinking would you mind if i could make a sort of home at mildenham where poor children could come to stay and get good air and food there are such thousands of them  strangely moved by this the first wish he had heard her express since the tragedy winton took her hand and looking at it as if for answer to his question said  my dear are you strong enough  quite theres nothing wrong with me now except here she drew his hand to her and pressed it against her heart whats given one cant get back i cant help it i would if i could its been so dreadful for you im so sorry winton made an unintelligible sound and she went on if i had them to see after i shouldnt be able to think so much the more i had to do the better good for our gipsybird too to have them there i should like to begin it at once  winton nodded anything that she felt could do her goodanything  yes yes he said i quite seeyou could use the two old cottages to start with and we can easily run up anything you want  only let me do it all wont you  at that touch of her old self winton smiled she should do everything pay for everything bring a whole street of children down if it would give her any comfort  rosamundll help you find em he muttered shes firstrate at all that sort of thing then looking at her fixedly he added courage my soul itll all come back some day  gyp forced herself to smile watching her he understood only too well the childs saying mum lives away somewhere i think  suddenly she said very low  and yet i wouldnt have been without it  she was sitting her hands clasped in her lap two red spots high in her cheeks her eyes shining strangely the faint smile still on her lips and winton staring with narrowed eyes thought love beyond measurebeyond deathit nearly kills but one wouldnt have been without it why   three days later leaving gyp with his sister he went back to mildenham to start the necessary alterations in the cottages he had told no one he was coming and walked up from the station on a perfect june day bright and hot when he turned through the drive gate into the beechtree avenue the leafshadows were thick on the ground with golden gleams of the invincible sunlight thrusting their way through the grey boles the vivid green leaves those glistening sunshafts through the shade entranced him coming from the dusty road down in the very middle of the avenue a small white figure was standing as if looking out for him he heard a shrill shout  oh grandy youve come backyouve come back what fun  winton took her curls in his hand and looking into her face said  well my gipsybird will you give me one of these  little gyp looked at him with flying eyes and hugging his legs answered furiously  yes because i love you pull
