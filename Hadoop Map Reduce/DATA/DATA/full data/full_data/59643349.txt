59643349	diderot  and  the encyclopÆdists   by john morley   vol i   london  macmillan and co limited  new york the macmillan company  1905     first published elsewhere  new edition 1886 reprinted 1891 1897 1905     preface   the present work closes a series of studies on the literary preparation for the french revolution it differs from the companion volumes on voltaire and rousseau in being much more fully descriptive in the case of those two famous writers every educated reader knows more or less of their performances of diderot and his circle such knowledge cannot be taken for granted and i have therefore thought it best to occupy a considerable space which i hope that those who do me the honour to read these pages will not find excessive with what is little more than transcript or analysis such a method will at least enable the reader to see what those ideas really were which the social and economic condition of france on the eve of the convulsion made so welcome to men the shortcomings of the encyclopædic group are obvious enough they have lately been emphasised in the ingenious and onesided exaggerations of that brilliant man of letters mr taine the social significance and the positive quality of much of their writing is more easily missed and this side of their work it has been one of my principal objects alike in the case of voltaire of rousseau and of diderot to bring into the prominence that it deserves in the history of opinion  the edition of diderots works to which the references are made is that in twenty volumes by the late mr assézat and mr maurice tourneux the only other serious book on diderot with which i am acquainted is rosenkranzs valuable diderots leben published in 1866 and abounding in full and patient knowledge of the numerous criticisms on diderot by raumer arndt hettner damiron bersot and above all by mr carlyle i need not make more particular mention  may 1878   note       since the following pages were printed an american      correspondent writes to me with reference to the dialogue      between franklin and raynal mentioned on page 218 vol      iii have now before me volume iv of the american law

prosecuted raynal therefore would have been right      if instead of massachusetts he had said connecticut and      either franklin told an untruth or else silas deane       september 1878

century when the gallican church hoped for a return of internal union and prosperity this brief era of hope coincided almost exactly with the middle of the century voltaire was in exile at berlin the author of the persian letters and the spirit of laws was old and near his end rousseau was copying music in a garret the encyclopædia was looked for but only as a literary project of some associated booksellers the jansenists who had been so many in number and so firm in spirit fiveandtwenty years earlier had now sunk to a small minority of the french clergy the great ecclesiastical body at length offered an unbroken front to its rivals the great judicial bodies a patriotic minister was indeed audacious enough to propose a tax upon ecclesiastical property but the church fought the battle and won troops had just been despatched to hunt and scatter the protestants of the desert and bigots exulted in the thought of pastors swinging on gibbets and heretical congregations fleeing for their lives before the fire of orthodox musketry the house of austria had been forced to suffer spoliation at the hands of the infidel frederick but all the world was well aware that the haughty and devout empressqueen would seize a speedy opportunity of taking a crushing vengeance france would this time be on the side of righteousness and truth for the moment a churchman might be pardoned if he thought that superstition ignorance abusive privilege and cruelty were on the eve of the smoothest and most triumphant days that they had known since the reformation  we now know how illusory this sanguine anticipation was destined to prove and how promptly in little more than forty years after the triumphant enforcement of the odious system of confessional certificates then the crowning event of ecclesiastical supremacy paris saw the feast of the supreme being and the adoration of the goddess of reason the church had scarcely begun to dream before she was rudely and peremptorily awakened she found herself confronted by the most energetic hardy and successful assailants whom the spirit of progress ever inspired compared with the new attack jansenism was no more than a trifling episode in a family quarrel thomists and molinists became as good as confederates and quietism barely seemed a heresy in every age even in the very depth of the times of faith there had arisen disturbers of the intellectual peace almost each century after the resettlement of europe by charlemagne had procured some individual or some little group who had ventured to question this or that article of the ecclesiastical creed to whom broken glimpses of new truth had come and who had borne witness against the error or inconsistency or inadequateness of old ways of thinking the questions which presented themselves to the acuter minds of a hundred years ago were present to the acuter minds who lived hundreds of years before that the more deeply we penetrate into the history of opinion the more strongly are we tempted to believe that in the great matters of speculation no question is altogether new and hardly any answer is altogether new but the church had known how to deal with intellectual insurgents from abelard in the twelfth century down to giordano bruno and vanini in the seventeenth they were isolated they were for the most part submissive and if they were not the arm of the church was very long and her grasp mortal and all these meritorious precursors were made weak by one cardinal defect for which no gifts of intellectual acuteness could compensate they had the scientific idea but they lacked the social idea they could have set opinion right about the efficacy of the syllogism and the virtue of entities and quiddities they could have taught europe earlier than the church allowed it to learn that the sun does not go round the earth and that it is the earth which goes round the sun but they were wholly unfitted to deal with the prodigious difficulties of moral and social direction this function so immeasurably more important than the mere discovery of any number of physical relations it was the glory of the church to have discharged for some centuries with as much success as the conditions permitted we are told indeed by writers ignorant alike of human history and human nature that only physical science can improve the social condition of man the common sense of the world always rejects this gross fallacy the acquiescence for so many centuries in the power of the great directing organisation of western europe notwithstanding its intellectual inadequateness was the decisive expression of that rejection  after the middle of the last century the insurrection against the pretensions of the church and against the doctrines of christianity was marked in one of its most important phases by a new and most significant feature in this phase it was animated at once by the scientific idea and by the social idea it was an advance both in knowledge and in moral motive it rested on a conception which was crude and imperfect enough but which was still almost like the great ecclesiastical conception itself a conception of life as a whole morality positive law social order economics the nature and limits of human knowledge the constitution of the physical universe had one by one disengaged themselves from theological explanations the final philosophical movement of the century in france which was represented by diderot now tended to a new social synthesis resting on a purely positive basis if this movement had only added to its other contents the historic idea its destination would have been effectually reached as it was its leaders surveyed the entire field with as much accuracy and with as wide a range as their instruments allowed and they scattered over the world a set of ideas which at once entered into energetic rivalry with the ancient scheme of authority the great symbol of this new comprehensiveness in the insurrection was the encyclopædia  the encyclopædia was virtually a protest against the old organisation no less than against the old doctrine broadly stated the great central moral of it all was this that human nature is good that the world is capable of being made a desirable abidingplace and that the evil of the world is the fruit of bad education and bad institutions this cheerful doctrine now strikes on the ear as a commonplace and a truism a hundred years ago in france it was a wonderful gospel and the beginning of a new dispensation it was the great counterprinciple to asceticism in life and morals to formalism in art to absolutism in the social ordering to obscurantism in thought every social improvement since has been the outcome of that doctrine in one form or another the conviction that the character and lot of man are indefinitely modifiable for good was the indispensable antecedent to any general and energetic endeavour to modify the conditions that surround him the omnipotence of early instruction of laws of the method of social order over the infinitely plastic impulses of the human creaturethis was the maxim which brought men of such widely different temperament and leanings to the common enterprise everybody can see what wide and deepreaching bearings such a doctrine possessed how it raised all the questions connected with psychology and the formation of character how it went down to the very foundation of morals into what fresh and unwelcome sunlight it brought the articles of the old theology with what new importance it clothed all the relations of real knowledge and the practical arts what intense interest it lent to every detail of economics and legislation and government  the deadly chagrin with which churchmen saw the encyclopedic fabric rising was very natural the teaching of the church paints man as fallen and depraved the new secular knowledge clashed at a thousand points alike in letter and in spirit with the old sacred lore even where it did not clash its vitality of interest and attraction drove the older lore into neglected shade to stir mens vivid curiosity and hope about the earth was to make their care much less absorbing about the kingdom of heaven to awaken in them the spirit of social improvement was ruin to the most scandalous and crying social abuse then existing the old spiritual power had lost its instinct once so keen and effective of wise direction instead of being the guide and corrector of the organs of the temporal power it was the worst of their accomplices the encyclopædia was an informal transitory and provisional organisation of the new spiritual power the school of which it was the great expounder achieved a supreme control over opinion by the only title to which control belongs a more penetrating eye for social exigencies and for the means of satisfying them  our veteran humorist told us long ago in his whimsical way that the importance of the acts of the french philosophes recorded in whole acres of typography is fast exhausting itself that the famed encyclopædical tree has borne no fruit and that diderot the great has contracted into diderot the easily measurable the humoristic method is a potent instrument for working such contractions and expansions at will the greatest of men are measurable enough if you choose to set up a standard that is half transcendental and half cynical a saner and more patient criticism measures the conspicuous figures of the past differently it seeks their relations to the great forward movements of the world and asks to what quarter of the heavens their faces were set whether towards the east where the new light dawns or towards the west after the old light has sunk irrevocably down above all a saner criticism bids us remember that pioneers in the progressive way are rare their lives rude and sorely tried and their services to mankind beyond price diderot is diderot wrote one greater than carlyle a peculiar individuality whoever holds him or his doings cheaply is a philistine and the name of them is legion men know neither from god nor from nature nor from their fellows how to receive with gratitude what is valuable beyond appraisement goethe an intense philistinism underlay the great spiritual reaction that followed the revolution and not even such of its apostles as wordsworth and carlyle wholly escaped the taint  forty years ago when carlyle wrote it might really seem to a prejudiced observer as if the encyclopædic tree had borne no fruit even then and even when the critic happened to be a devotee of the sterile transcendentalism then in vogue one might have expected some recognition of the fact that the seed of all the great improvements bestowed on france by the revolution in spite of the woful evils which followed in its train had been sown by the encyclopædists but now that the last vapours of the transcendental reaction are clearing away we see that the movement initiated by the encyclopædia is again in full progress materialistic solutions in the science of man humanitarian ends in legislation naturalism in art active faith in the improvableness of institutionsall these are once more the marks of speculation and the guiding ideas of practical energy the philosophical parenthesis is at an end the interruption of eighty years counts for no more than the twinkling of an eye in the history of the transformation of the basis of thought and the interruption has for the present come to a close europe again sees the old enemies face to face the church and a social philosophy slowly labouring to build her foundations in positive science it cannot be other than interesting to examine the aims the instruments and the degree of success of those who a century ago saw most comprehensively how profound and farreaching a metamorphosis awaited the thought of the western world we shall do this most properly in connection with diderot  whether we accept or question comtes strong description of diderot as the greatest genius of the eighteenth century it is at least undeniable that he was the one member of the great party of illumination with a real title to the name of thinker voltaire and rousseau were the heads of two important schools and each of them set deep and unmistakable marks both on the opinion and the events of the century it would not be difficult to show that their influence was wider than that of the philosopher who discerned the inadequateness of both but rousseau was moved by passion and sentiment voltaire was only the master of a brilliant and penetrating rationalism diderot alone of this famous trio had in his mind the idea of scientific method alone showed any feeling for a doctrine and for large organic and constructive conceptions he had the rare faculty of true philosophic meditation though immeasurably inferior both to voltaire and rousseau in gifts of literary expression he was as far their superior in breadth and reality of artistic principle he was the originator of a natural realistic and sympathetic school of literary criticism he aspired to impose new forms upon the drama both in imaginative creation and in criticism his work was a constant appeal from the artificial conventions of the classic schools to the actualities of common life the same spirit united with the tendency of his philosophy to place him among the very few men who have been great and genuine observers of human nature and human existence so singular and widely active a genius may well interest us even apart from the important place that he holds in the history of literature and opinion     chapter ii  youth   denis diderot was born at langres in 1713 being thus a few months younger than rousseau 1712 nearly twenty years younger than voltaire 1694 nearly two years younger than hume 1711 and eleven years older than kant 1724 his stock was ancient and of good repute the family had been engaged in the great local industry the manufacture of cutlery for no less than two centuries in direct line diderot liked to dwell on the historic prowess of his town from the days of julius cæsar and the old lingones and sabinus down to the time of the great monarch with the taste of his generation for tracing moral qualities to a climatic source he explained a certain vivacity and mobility in the people of his district by the great frequency and violence of its atmospheric changes from hot to cold from calm to storm from rain to sunshine thus they learn from earliest infancy to turn to every wind the man of langres has a head on his shoulders like the weathercock at the top of the church spire it is never fixed at one point if it returns to the point it has left it is not to stop there with an amazing rapidity in their movements their desires their plans their fancies their ideas they are cumbrous in speech for myself i belong to my country side this was thoroughly true he inherited all the versatility of his compatriots all their swift impetuosity and something of their want of dexterity in expression  his father was one of the bravest most upright most patient most sensible of men diderot never ceased to regret that the old mans portrait had not been taken with his apron on his spectacles pushed up and a hand on the grinders wheel after his death none of his neighbours could speak of him to his son without tears in their eyes diderot wild and irregular as were his earlier days had always a true affection for his father one of the sweetest moments of my life he once said was more than thirty years ago and i remember it as if it were yesterday when my father saw me coming home from school my arms laden with the prizes i had carried off and my shoulders burdened with the wreaths they had given me which were too big for my brow and had slipped over my head as soon as he caught sight of me some way off he threw down his work hurried to the door to meet me and fell aweeping it is a fine sighta grave and sterling man melted to tears1 of his mother we know less he had a sister who seems to have possessed the rough material of his own qualities he describes her as lively active cheerful decided prompt to take offence slow to come round again without much care for present or future never willing to be imposed on by people or circumstance free in her ways still more free in her talk she is a sort of diogenes in petticoats she is the most original and the most stronglymarked creature i know she is goodness itself but with a peculiar physiognomy2 his only brother showed some of the same native stuff but of thinner and sourer quality he became an abbé and a saint peevish umbrageous and as excessively devout as his more famous brother was excessively the opposite he would have been a good friend and a good brother wrote diderot if religion had not bidden him trample under foot such poor weaknesses as these he is a good christian who proves to me every minute of the day how much better it would be to be a good man he shows that what they call evangelical perfection is only the mischievous art of stifling nature which would most likely have spoken as lustily in him as in me3  diderot like so many others of the eighteenthcentury reformers was a pupil of the jesuits an ardent impetuous overgenial temperament was the cause of frequent irregularities in conduct but his quick and active understanding overcame all obstacles his teachers ever wisely on the alert for superior capacity hoped to enlist his talents in the order either they or he planned his escape from home but his father got to hear of it my grandfather says diderots daughter kept the profoundest silence but as he went off to bed took with him the keys of the yard door when he heard his son going downstairs he presented himself before him and asked whither he was bound at twelve oclock at night to paris replied the youth where i am to join the jesuits that will not be tonight but your wishes shall be fulfilled first let us have our sleep the next morning his father took two places in the coach and carried him to paris to the collége dharcourt he made all the arrangements and wished his son goodbye but the good man loved the boy too dearly to leave him without being quite at ease how he would fare he had the patience to remain a whole fortnight killing the time and half dead of weariness in an inn without ever seeing the one object of his stay at the end of the fortnight he went to the college and diderot used many a time to say that such a mark of tenderness and goodness would have made him go to the other end of the world if his father had required it my friend said his father i am come to see if you are well if you are satisfied with your superiors with your food with your companions and with yourself if you are not well or not happy we will go back together to your mother if you had rather stay where you are i am come to give you a word to embrace you and to leave you my blessing the boy declared he was perfectly happy and the principal pronounced him an excellent scholar though already promising to be a troublesome one4  after a couple of years the young diderot like other sons of adam had to think of earning his bread the usual struggle followed between youthful genius and old prudence his father who was a man of substance gave him his choice between medicine and law law he refused because he did not choose to spend his days in doing other peoples business and medicine because he had no turn for killing his father resolutely declined to let him have more money on these terms and diderot was thrown on his wits  the man of letters shortly before the middle of the century was as much an outcast and a beggar in paris as he was in london voltaire gray and richardson were perhaps the only three conspicuous writers of the time who had never known what it was to want a meal or to go without a shirt but then none of the three depended on his pen for his livelihood every other man of that day whose writings have delighted and instructed the world since had begun his career and more than one of them continued and ended it as a drudge and a vagabond fielding and collins goldsmith and johnson in england goldoni in italy vauvenargues marmontel rousseau in france winckelmann and lessing in germany had all alike been doubtful of dinner and trembled about a nights lodging they all knew the life of mean hazard sorry shift and petty expedient again and again renewed it is sorrowful to think how many of the compositions of that time that do most to soothe and elevate some of the best hours of our lives were written by men with aching hearts in the midst of haggard perplexities the man of letters as distinguished alike from the oldfashioned scholar and the systematic thinker now first became a distinctly marked type macaulay has contrasted the misery of the grub street hack of johnsons time with the honours accorded to men like prior and addison at an earlier date and the solid sums paid by booksellers to the authors of our own day but these brilliant passages hardly go lower than the surface of the great change its significance lay quite apart from the prices paid for books the allimportant fact about the men of letters in france was that they constituted a new order that their rise signified the transfer of the spiritual power from ecclesiastical hands and that while they were the organs of a new function they associated it with a new substitute for doctrine these men were not only the pupils of the jesuits they were also their immediate successors as the teachers the guides and the directors of society for two hundred years the followers of ignatius had taken the intellectual and moral control of catholic communities out of the failing hands of the popes and the secular clergy their own hour had now struck the rationalistic historian has seldom done justice to the services which this great order rendered to european civilisation the immorality of many of their maxims their too frequent connivance at political wrong for the sake of power their inflexible malice against opponents and the cupidity and obstructiveness of the years of their decrepitude have blinded us to the many meritorious pages of the jesuit chronicle even men like diderot and voltaire whose lives were for years made bitter by jesuit machinations gave many signs that they recognised the aid which had been rendered by their old masters to the cultivation and enlightenment of europe it was from the jesuit fathers that the men of letters whom they trained acquired that practical and social habit of mind which made the world and its daily interests so real to them it was perhaps also his jesuit preceptors whom the man of letters had to blame for a certain want of rigour and exactitude on the side of morality  what was this new order which thus struggled into existence which so speedily made itself felt and at length so completely succeeded in seizing the lapsed inheritance of the old spiritual organisation who is this man of letters a satirist may easily describe him in epigrams of cheap irony the pedant of the colleges may see in him a frivolous and shallow profaner of the mysteries of learning the intellectual coxcomb who nurses his own dainty wits in critical sterility despises him as sir piercie shafton would have despised lord lindsay of the byres this notwithstanding the man of letters has his work to do in the critical period of social transition he is to be distinguished from the great systematic thinker as well as from the great imaginative creator he is borne on the wings neither of a broad philosophic conception nor of a lofty poetic conception he is only the propagator of portions of such a conception and of the minor ideas which they suggest unlike the jesuit father whom he replaced he has no organic doctrine no historic tradition no effective discipline and no definite comprehensive farreaching concentrated aim the characteristic of his activity is dispersiveness its distinction is to popularise such detached ideas as society is in a condition to assimilate to interest men in these ideas by dressing them up in varied forms of the literary art to guide men through them by judging empirically and unconnectedly each case of conduct of policy or of new opinion as it arises we have no wish to exalt the office on the contrary i accept the maxim of that deep observer who warned us that the mania for isolation is the plague of the human throng and to be strong we must march together you only obtain anything by developing the spirit of discipline among men5  but there are ages of criticism when discipline is impossible and the evils of isolation are less than the evils of rash and premature organisation fontenelle was the first and in some respects the greatest type of this important class he was sceptical learned ingenious eloquent he stretched hands 16571757 from the famous quarrel between ancients and moderns down to the encyclopædia and from bossuet and corneille down to jean jacques and diderot when he was born the man of letters did not exist when he died the man of letters was the most conspicuous personage in france but when diderot first began to roam about the streets of paris this enormous change was not yet complete  for some ten years 17341744 diderots history is the old tale of hardship and chance of fine constancy and excellent faith not wholly free from an occasional stroke of rascality for a time he earned a little money by teaching if the pupil happened to be quick and docile he grudged no labour and was content with any fee or none if the pupil happened to be dull diderot never came again and preferred going supperless to bed his employers paid him as they chose in shirts in a chair or a table in books in money and sometimes they never paid him at all the prodigious exuberance of his nature inspired him with a sovereign indifference to material details from the beginning he belonged to those to whom it comes by nature to count life more than meat and the body than raiment the outward things of existence were to him really outward they never vexed or absorbed his days and nights nor overcame his vigorous constitutional instinct for the true proportions of external circumstance he was of the humour of the old philosopher who when he heard that all his worldly goods had been lost in a shipwreck only made for answer jubet me fortuna expeditius philosophari once he had the good hap to be appointed tutor to the sons of a man of wealth he performed his duties zealously he was well housed and well fed and he gave the fullest satisfaction to his employer at the end of three months the mechanical toil had grown unbearable to him the father of his pupils offered him any terms if he would remain look at me sir replied the tutor my face is as yellow as a lemon i am making men of your children but each day i am becoming a child with them i am a thousand times too rich and too comfortable in your house leave it i must what i want is not to live better but to avoid dying again he plunged from comfort into the life of the garret if he met any old friend from langres he borrowed and the honest father repaid the loan his mothers savings were brought to him by a faithful creature who had long served in their house and who now more than once trudged all the way from home on this errand and added her own humble earnings to the little stock many a time the hours went very slowly for the necessitous man one shrove tuesday he rose in the morning and found his pockets empty even of so much as a halfpenny his friends had not invited him to join their squalid bohemian revels hunger and thoughts of old shrovetide merriment and feasting in the faroff home made work impossible he hastened out of doors and walked about all day visiting such public sights as were open to the penniless when he returned to his garret at night his landlady found him in a swoon and with the compassion of a good soul she forced him to share her supper that day diderot used to tell his children in later years i promised myself that if ever happier times should come and ever i should have anything i would never refuse help to any living creature nor ever condemn him to the misery of such a day as that6 and the real interest of the story lies in the fact that no oath was ever more faithfully kept there is no greater test of the essential richness of a mans nature than that this squalid adversity not of the sentimental introspective kind but hard and grinding and not even kept in countenance by respectability fails to make him a savage or a miser or a misanthrope  diderot had his bitter moments he knew the gloom and despondency that have their inevitable hour in every solitary and unordered life but the fits did not last they left no sour sediment and this is the sign of health in temperament provided it be not due to mere callousness from that horrible quality diderot assuredly was the furthest removed of any one of his time now and always he walked with a certain large carelessness of spirit he measured life with a roving and liberal eye circumstance and conventions the words under which men hide things the oracles of common acceptance the infinitely diversified properties of human character the many complexities of our conduct and destinyall these he watched playing freely around him and he felt no haste to compress his experience into maxims and system he was absolutely uncramped by any of the formal mannerisms of the spirit he was wholly uncorrupted by the affectation of culture with which the great goethe infected part of the world a generation later his own life was never made the centre of the world selfdevelopment and selfidealisation as ends in themselves would have struck diderot as effeminate drolleries the daily and hourly interrogation of experience for the sake of building up the fabric of his own character in this wise or that would have been incomprehensible and a little odious to him in theory and impossible as a matter of practice in the midst of all the hardships of his younger time as afterwards in the midst of crushing herculean taskwork he was saved from moral ruin by the inexhaustible geniality and expansiveness of his affections nor did he narrow their play by looking only to the external forms of human relation to diderot it came easily to act on a principle which most of us only accept in words he looked not to what people said nor even to what they did but wholly to what they were  those whom he had once found reason to love and esteem might do him many an ill turn without any fear of estranging him any one can measure character by conduct it is a harder thing to be willing in cases that touch our own interests to interpret conduct by previous knowledge of character his father for instance might easily have spared money enough to save him from the harassing privations of bohemian life in paris a less fullblooded and generous person than diderot would have resented the stoutness of the old mans persistency diderot on the contrary felt and delighted to feel that this conflict of wills was a mere accident which left undisturbed the reality of old love the first few years of my life in paris he once told an acquaintance had been rather irregular my behaviour was enough to irritate my father without there being any need to make it worse by exaggeration still calumny was not wanting people told himwell what did they not tell him an opportunity for going to see him presented itself i did not give it two thoughts i set out full of confidence in his goodness i thought that he would see me that i should throw myself into his arms that we should both of us shed tears and that all would be forgotten i thought rightly7 we may be sure of a stoutness of native stuff in any stock where so much tenacity united with such fine confidence on one side and such generous love on the other it is a commonplace how much waste would be avoided in human life if men would more freely allow their vision to pierce in this way through the distorting veils of egoism to the reality of sentiment and motive and relationship  throughout his life diderot was blessed with that divine gift of pity which one that has it could hardly be willing to barter for the understanding of an aristotle nor was it of the sentimental type proper for fine ladies one of his friends had an aversion for women with child what monstrous sentiment diderot wrote for my part that condition has always touched me i cannot see a woman of the common people so without a tender commiseration8 and diderot had delicacy and respect in his pity he tells a story in one of his letters of a poor woman who had suffered some wrong from a priest she had not money enough to resort to law until a friend of diderot took her part the suit was gained but when the moment came for execution the priest had vanished with all his goods the woman came to thank her protector and to regret the loss he had suffered as she chatted she pulled a shabby snuffbox out of her pocket and gathered up with the tip of her finger what little snuff remained at the bottom her benefactor says to her ah ah you have no more snuff give me your box and i will fill it he took the box and put into it a couple of louis which he covered up with snuff now theres an action thoroughly to my taste and to yours too give but if you can spare to the poor the shame of holding out a hand9 and the important thing as we have said is that diderot was as good as his sentiment unlike most of the fine talkers of that day to him these homely and considerate emotions were the most real part of life nobody in the world was ever more eager to give succour to others nor more careless of his own ease  one singular story of diderots heedlessness about himself has often been told before but we shall be none the worse in an egoistic world for hearing it told again there came to him one morning a young man bringing a manuscript in his hand he begged diderot to do him the favour of reading it and to make any remarks he might think useful on the margin diderot found it to be a bitter satire upon his own person and writings on the young mans return diderot asked him his grounds for making such an attack i am without bread the satirist answered and i hoped you might perhaps give me a few crowns not to print it diderot at once forgot everything in pity for the starving scribbler i will tell you a way of making more than that by it the brother of the duke of orleans is one of the pious and he hates me dedicate your satire to him get it bound with his arms on the cover take it to him some fine morning and you will certainly get assistance from him but i dont know the prince and the dedicatory epistle embarrasses me sit down said diderot and i will write one for you the dedication was written the author carried it to the prince and received a handsome fee10  marmontel assures us that never was diderot seen to such advantage as when an author consulted him about a work you should have seen him he says take hold of the subject pierce to the bottom of it and at a single glance discover of what riches and of what beauty it was susceptible if he saw that the author missed the right track instead of listening to the reading he at once worked up in his head all that the author had left crude and imperfect was it a play he threw new scenes into it new incidents new strokes of character and thinking that he had actually heard all that he had dreamed he extolled to the skies the work that had just been read to him and in which when it saw the light we found hardly anything that he had quoted from it he who was one of the most enlightened men of the century was also one of the most amiable and in everything that touched moral goodness when he spoke of it freely i cannot express the charm of his eloquence his whole soul was in his eyes and on his lips never did a countenance better depict the goodness of the heart11 morellet is equally loud in praise not only of diderots conversation its brilliance its vivacity its fertility its suggestiveness its sincerity but also his facility and indulgence to all who sought him and of the sympathetic readiness with which he gave the very best of himself to others12  it is needless to say that such a temper was constantly abused threefourths of diderots life were reckoned by his family to have been given up to people who had need of his purse his knowledge or his good offices his daughter compares his library to a shop crowded by a succession of customers but the customers took whatever wares they sought not by purchase but by way of free gift luckily for diderot he was thus generous by temperament and not because he expected gratitude any necessitous knave with the gift of tears and the mask of sensibility could dupe and prey upon him in one case he had taken a great deal of trouble for one of these needy and importunate clients had given him money and advice and had devoted much time to serve him at the end of their last interview diderot escorts his departing friend to the head of the staircase the grateful client then asks him whether he knows natural history well not much diderot replies i know an aloe from a lettuce and a pigeon from a hummingbird do you know about the formica leo no well it is a little insect that is wonderfully industrious it hollows out in the ground a hole shaped like a funnel it covers the surface with a light fine sand it attracts other insects it takes them it sucks them dry and then it says to them m diderot i have the honour to wish you good day13  yet insolence and ingratitude made no difference to diderot his ear always remained as open to every tale of distress his sensibility always as quickly touched his time money and service always as profusely bestowed i know not whether to say that this was made more or that it was made less of a virtue by his excess of tolerance for social castaways and reprobates our rough mode of branding a man as bad revolted him the common appetite for constituting ourselves public prosecutors for the universe was to him one of the worst of human weaknesses you know he used to say all the impetuosity of the passions you have weighed all circumstance in your everlasting balance you pass sentence on the goodness or the badness of creatures you set up rewards and penalties among matters which have no proportion nor relation with one another are you sure that you have never committed wrong acts for which you pardoned yourselves because their object was so slight though at bottom they implied more wickedness than a crime prompted by misery or fury even magistrates supported by experience by the law by conventions which force them sometimes to give judgment against the testimony of their own conscience still tremble as they pronounce the doom of the accused and since when has it been lawful for the same person to be at once judge and informer14  such reasoned leniency is the noblest of traits in a man i am more affected he said in words of which better men that diderot might often be reminded by the charms of virtue than by the deformity of vice i turn mildly away from the bad and i fly to embrace the good if there is in a work in a character in a painting in a statue a single fine bit then on that my eyes fasten i see only that that is all i remember the rest is as good as forgotten15  this is the secret of a rare and admirable temperament it carried diderot well through the trial and ordeal of the ragged apprenticeship of letters what to other men comes by culture came to him by inborn force and natural capaciousness we do not know in what way diderot trained and nourished his understanding the annotations to his translation of shaftesbury as well as his earliest original pieces show that he had read montaigne and pascal and not only read but meditated on them with an independent mind they show also that he had been impressed by the civitas dei of augustine and had at least dipped into terence and horace cicero and tacitus his subsequent writings prove that like the other men of letters of his day he found in our own literature the chief external stimulant to thought above all he was impressed by the magnificent ideas of the illustrious bacon and these ideas were the direct source of the great undertaking of diderots life he is said to have read little and to have meditated muchthe right process for the few men of his potent stamp the work which he had to do for bread was of the kind that crushes anything short of the strongest faculty he composed sermons a missionary once ordered halfadozen of them for consumption in the portuguese colonies and paid him fifty crowns apiece which diderot counted far from the worst bargain of his life all this was beggarly toil for a man of genius but diderot never took the trouble to think of himself as a man of genius and was quite content with life as it came if he found himself absolutely without food and without pence he began moodily to think of abandoning his books and his pen and of complying with the wishes of his father a line of homer an idea from the principia an interesting problem in algebra or geometry was enough to restore the eternally invincible spell of knowledge and no sooner was this commanding interest touched than the cloud of uncomfortable circumstance vanished from before the sun and calm and serenity filled his spirit  montesquieu used to declare that he had never known a chagrin which half an hour of a book was not able to dispel diderot had the same fortunate temper  yet diderot was not essentially a man of books he never fell into the characteristic weakness of the follower of letters by treating books as ends in themselves or placing literature before life character passion circumstance the real tragicomedy not its printed shadow and image engrossed him he was in this respect more of the temper of rousseau than he was like voltaire or fontenelle abstraction made he used to say of my existence and of the happiness of my fellows what does the rest of nature matter to me yet as we see nobody that ever lived was more interested in knowledge his biographer and disciple remarked the contrast in him between his ardent impetuous disposition and enthusiasm and his spirit of close unwearied observation faire le bien connaître le vrai was his formula for the perfect life and defined the only distinction that he cared to recognise between one man and another and the only motive he ever admitted as reasonable for seeking truth was as a means of doing good so strong was his sense of practical life in the midst of incessant theorising                                       at the moment when he had most difficulty in procuring a little bread each day for himself diderot conceived a violent passion for a seamstress antoinnette champion by name who happened to live in his neighbourhood he instantly became importunate for marriage the mother long protested with prudent vigour against a young man of such headstrong impetuosity who did nothing and who had nothing save the art of making speeches that turned her daughters head at length the young mans golden tongue won the mother as it had won the daughter it was agreed that his wishes should be crowned if he could procure the consent of his family diderot fared eagerly and with a sanguine heart to langres his father supposed that he had seen the evil of his ways and was come at last to continue the honest tradition of their name when the son disclosed the object of his visit he was treated as a madman and threatened with malediction without a word of remonstrance he started back one day for paris madame champion warned him that his project must now be for ever at an end such unflinching resoluteness is often the last preliminary before surrender diderot fell ill the two women could not bear to think of him lying sick in a room no better than a dogkennel without broths and tisanes lonely and sorrowful they hastened to nurse him and when he got well what he thought the great object of his life was reached he and his adored were married 174316 as has been said choice in marriage is a great match of cajolery between purpose and invisible hazard deep criticism of a game of pure chance is time wasted in diderots case destiny was hostile  his wife was over thirty she was dutiful sage and pious she had plenty of that devotion which in small things women so seldom lack while her husband went to dine out she remained at home to dine and sup on dry bread and was pleased to think that the next day she would double the little ordinary for him coffee was too dear to be a household luxury so every day she handed him a few halfpence to have his cup and to watch the chessplayers at the café de la régence when after a year or two she went to make her peace with her fatherinlaw at langres she wound her way round the old mans heart by her affectionate caresses her respect her ready industry in the household her piety her simplicity it is however unfortunately possible for even the best women to manifest their goodness their prudence their devotion in forms that exasperate perhaps it was so here diderot at fifty was an orderly and steadfast person but at thirty the blood of vagabondage was still hot within him he needed in his companion a robust patience to match his own too robust activity one may suppose that if mirabeau had married hannah more the union would have turned out ill and diderots marriage was unluckily of such a type his wifes narrow pieties and homely solicitudes fretted him he had not learned to count the cost of deranging the fragile sympathy of the hearth while his wife was away on her visit to his family he formed a connection with a woman madame puisieux who seems to have been as bad and selfish as his wife was the opposite she was the authoress of some literary pieces which the world willingly and speedily let die but even very moderate pretensions to belesprit may have seemed wonderfully refreshing to a man wearied to death by the illiterate stupidity of his daily companion17 this lasted some three or four years down to 1749 as we shall see he discovered the infidelity of his mistress and broke with her but by this time his wifes virtues seem to have gone a little sour as disregarded prudence and thwarted piety are so apt to do it was too late now to knit up again the ravelled threads of domestic concord during a second absence of his wife in champagne 1754 he formed a new attachment to the daughter of a financiers widow mdlle voland this lasted to the end of the ladys days 1783 or 1784  there is probably nothing very profitable to be said about all this domestic disorder we do not know enough of the circumstances to be sure of allotting censure in exact and rightful measure we have to remember that such irregularities were in the manners of the time to connect them by way of effect with the new opinions in religion would be as impertinent as to trace the immoralities of dubois or lewis the fifteenth or the cardinal de rohan to the old opinions     chapter iii  early writings   la rochefoucauld expressing a commonplace with the penetrative terseness that made him a master of the apophthegm pronounced it not to be enough to have great qualities a man must have the economy of them or as another writer says empire in this world belongs not so much to wits to talents and to industry as to a certain skilful economy and to the continual management that a man has the art of applying to all his other gifts18 notwithstanding the peril that haunts superlative propositions we are inclined to say that diderot is the most striking illustration of this that the history of letters or speculation has to furnish if there are many who have missed the mark which they or kindly intimates thought them certain of attaining this is mostly not for want of economy but for want of the great qualities which were imputed to them by mistake to be mediocre to be sterile to be futile are the three fatal endings of many superbly announced potentialities such an end nearly always comes of exaggerated faculty rather than of bad administration of natural gifts in diderot were splendid talents it was the art of prudent stewardship that lay beyond his reach hence this singular fact that he perhaps alone in literature has left a name of almost the first eminence and impressed his greatness upon men of the strongest and most different intelligence and yet never produced a masterpiece many a fine page as marmontel said but no one fine work  no man that ever wrote was more wholly free from that unquiet selfconsciousness which too often makes literary genius pitiful or odious in the flesh he put on no airs of pretended resignation to inferior production with bursting hints of the vast superiorities that unfriendly circumstance locked up within him yet on one occasion and only on one so far as evidence remains he indulged a natural regret and so he wrote when revising the last sheets of the encyclopædia july 25 1765 in eight or ten days i shall see the end of an undertaking that has occupied me for twenty years that has not made my fortune by a long way that has exposed me many a time to the risk of having to quit my country or lose my freedom and that has consumed a life that i might have made both more useful and more glorious the sacrifice of talent to need would be less common if it were only a question of self one could easily resolve rather to drink water and eat dry crusts and follow the bidding of ones genius in a garret but for a woman and for children what can one not resolve if i sought to make myself of some account in their eyes i would not sayi have worked thirty years for you i would sayi have for you renounced for thirty years the vocation of my nature i have preferred to renounce my tastes in doing what was useful for you instead of what was agreeable to myself that is your real obligation to me and of that you never think19  it is a question nevertheless whether diderot would have achieved masterpieces even if the pressure of housekeeping had never driven him to seek bread where he could find it indeed it is hardly a question his genius was spacious and original but it was too dispersive too facile of diversion too little disciplined for the prolonged effort of combination which is indispensable to the greater constructions whether of philosophy or art the excellent talent of economy and administration had been denied him that thrift of faculty which accumulates store and force for concentrated occasions he was not encyclopædic by accident nor merely from external necessity the quality of rapid movement impetuous fancy versatile idea which he traced to the climate of his birthplace marked him from the first for an encyclopædic or some such task his interest was nearly as promptly and vehemently kindled in one subject as in another he was always boldly tentative always fresh and vigorous in suggestion always instant in search but this multiplicity of active excitementsand with diderot every interest rose to the warmth of excitementwas even more hostile to masterpieces than were the exigencies of a livelihood it was not unpardonable in a moment of exhaustion and chagrin to fancy that he had offered up the treasures of his genius to the dull gods of the hearth but if he had been childless and unwedded the result would have been the same he is the munificent prodigal of letters always believing his substance inexhaustible never placing a limit to his fancies nor a bound to his outlay it is not they who rob me of my life he wrote it is i who give it to them and what can i do better than accord a portion of it to him who esteems me enough to solicit such a gift i shall get no praise for it tis true either now while i am here nor when i shall exist no longer but i shall esteem myself for it and people will love me all the better for it tis no bad exchange that of benevolence against a celebrity that one does not always win and that nobody wins without a drawback i have never once regretted the time that i have given to others i can scarcely say as much for the time that i have used for myself20 remembering how uniformly men of letters take themselves somewhat too seriously we may be sorry that this unique figure among them who was in other respects constituted to be so considerable and so effective did not take himself seriously enough  apart from his moral inaptitude for the monumental achievements of authorship diderot was endowed with the gifts of the talker rather than with those of the writer like dr johnson he was a great converser rather than the author of great books if we turn to his writings we are at some loss to understand the secret of his reputation they are too often declamatory illcompacted broken by frequent apostrophes ungainly dislocated and rambling he has been described by a consummate judge as the most german of all the french and his style is deeply marked by that want of feeling for the exquisite that dulness of edge that bluntness of stroke which is the common note of all german literature save a little of the very highest in conversation we do not insist on constant precision of phrase nor on elaborate sustension of argument apostrophe is made natural by the semidramatic quality of the situation even vehement hyperbole which is nearly always a disfigurement in written prose may become impressive or delightful when it harmonises with the voice the glance the gesture of a fervid and exuberant converser hence diderots personality invested his talk as happened in the case of johnson and of coleridge with an imposing interest and a power of inspiration which we should never comprehend from the mere perusal of his writings  his admirers declared his head to be the ideal head of an aristotle or a plato his brow was wide lofty open gently rounded the arch of the eyebrow was full of delicacy the nose of masculine beauty the habitual expression of the eyes kindly and sympathetic but as he grew heated in talk they sparkled like fire the curves of the mouth bespoke an interesting mixture of finesse grace and geniality his bearing was nonchalant enough but there was naturally in the carriage of his head especially when he talked with action much dignity energy and nobleness it seemed as if enthusiasm were the natural condition for his voice for his spirit for every feature he was only truly diderot when his thoughts had transported him beyond himself his ideas were stronger than himself they swept him along without the power either to stay or to guide their movement when i recall diderot wrote one of his friends the immense variety of his ideas the amazing multiplicity of his knowledge the rapid flight the warmth the impetuous tumult of his imagination all the charm and all the disorder of his conversation i venture to liken his character to nature herself exactly as he used to conceive herrich fertile abounding in germs of every sort gentle and fierce simple and majestic worthy and sublime but without any dominating principle without a master and without a god21 grétry the musical composer declares that diderot was one of the rare men who had the art of blowing the spark of genius into flame the first impulses stirred by his glowing imagination were of inspiration divine22  marmontel warns us that he who only knows diderot in his writings does not know him at all we should have listened to his persuasive eloquence and seen his face aglow with the fire of enthusiasm it was when he grew animated in talk and let all the abundance of his ideas flow freely from the source that he became truly ravishing in his writings says marmontel with obvious truth he never had the art of forming a whole and this was because that first process of arranging everything in its place was too slow and too tiresome for him the want of ensemble vanished in the free and varied course of conversation23  we have to remember then that diderot was in this respect of the socratic type though he was unlike socrates in being the disseminator of positive and constructive ideas his personality exerted a decisive force and influence in reading the testimony of his friends we think of the young aristides saying to socrates i always made progress whenever i was in your neighbourhood even if i were only in the same house without being in the same room but my advancement was greater if i were in the same room with you and greater still if i could keep my eyes fixed upon you24 it has been well said that diderot like socrates had about him a something dæmonic he was possessed and so had the first secret of possessing others but then to reach excellence in literature one must also have selfpossession a double current of impulse and deliberation a free stream of ideas spontaneously obeying a sense or order harmony and form eloquence in the informal discourse of the parlour or the country walk did not mean in diderots case the empty fluency and nugatory emphasis of the ordinary talker of reputation it must have been both pregnant and copious declamatory in form but fresh and substantial in matter excursive in arrangement but forcible and pointed in intention no doubt if he was a sage he was sometimes a sage in a frenzy he would wind up a peroration by dashing his nightcap passionately against the wall by way of clencher to the argument yet this impetuosity this turn for declamation did not hinder his talk from being directly instructive younger men of the most various type from morellet down to joubert men quite competent to detect mere bombast or ardent vagueness were held captive by the cogency of his understanding his writings have none of this compulsion we see the flame but through a veil of interfused smoke the expression is not obscure but it is awkward not exactly prolix but heavy overcharged and opaque we miss the vivid precision and the high spirits of voltaire the glow and the brooding sonorousness of rousseau the pomp of buffon to diderot we go not for charm of style but for a store of fertile ideas for some striking studies of human life and for a vigorous and singular personality  diderots knowledge of our language now did him good service one of the details of the method by which he taught himself english is curious instead of using an anglofrench dictionary he always used one in anglolatin the sense of a latin or greek word he said is better established more surely fixed more definite less liable to capricious peculiarities of convention than the vernacular words which the whim or ignorance of the lexicographer may choose the reader composes his own vocabulary and gains both correctness and energy25 however this may be his knowledge of english was more accurate than is possessed by most french writers of our own day diderots first work for the booksellers after his marriage seems to have been a translation in three volumes of stanyans history of greece for this to the amazement of his wife he got a hundred crowns about the same time 1745 he published principles of moral philosophy or an essay of mr s on merit and virtue the initial stands for shaftesbury and the book translated was his inquiry concerning virtue and merit  towards the same time again diderot probably made acquaintance with madame de puisieux of whom it has been said with too patent humour that she was without either the virtue or the merit on which her admirer had just been declaiming we are told that it was her need of money which inspired him with his first original work as his daughters memoir from which the tale comes is swarming with blunders this may not be more true than some of her other statements all that we know of diderots sense and sincerity entitles him to the benefit of the doubt the philosophical thoughts 1746 are a continuation of the vein of the annotations on the essay he is said to have thrown these reflections together between good friday and easter sunday nor is there anything incredible in such rapid production when we remember the sweeping impetuosity with which he flung himself into all that he undertook the thoughts are evidently the fruits of long meditation and the literary arrangement of them may well have been an easy task they are a robuster development of the scepticism which was the less important side of shaftesbury the parliament of paris ordered the book to be burnt along with some others july 7 1746 partly because they were heterodox partly because the practice of publishing books without official leave was gaining an unprecedented height of license26 this was diderots first experience of that hand of authority which was for thirty years to surround him with mortification and torment but the disapproval of authority did not check the circulation or influence of the thoughts they were translated into german and italian and were honoured by a shower of hostile criticism in france they were often reprinted and even in our own day they are said not wholly to have lost their vogue as a short manual of scepticism27  the historians of literature too often write as if a book were the cause or the controlling force of controversies in which it is really only a symbol or a proclamation of feelings already in mens minds we should never occupy ourselves in tracing the thread of a set of opinions without trying to recognise the movement of living men and concrete circumstance that accompanied and caused the progress of thought in watching how the beaconfire flamed from height to height      greek phaos de têlepompon ouk ênaineto     phroura prosaithrizousa pompimonphloga  we should not forget that its source and reference lie in action in the motion and stirring of confused hosts and multitudes of men a book after all is only the mouthpiece of its author and the author being human is moved and drawn by the events that occur under his eye it was not merely because bacon and hobbes and locke had written certain books that voltaire and diderot became freethinkers and assailed the church so long it has been said as a bossuet a fénelon an arnauld a nicole were alive bayle made few proselytes the elevation of dubois and its consequences multiplied unbelievers and indifferents28  the force of speculative literature always hangs on practical opportuneness the economic evils of monasticism the increasing flagrancy and grossness of superstition the aggressive factiousness of the ecclesiastics the cruelty of bigoted tribunalsthese things disgusted and wearied the more enlightened spirits and the english philosophy only held out an inspiring intellectual alternative29  nor was it accident that drew diderots attention to shaftesbury rather than to any other of our writers that authors essay on enthusiasm had been suggested by the extravagances of the french prophets poor fanatics from the cevennes who had fled to london after the revocation of the edict of nantes and whose paroxysms of religious hysteria at length brought them into trouble with the authorities 1707 paris saw an outbreak of the same kind of ecstasy though on a much more formidable scale among the jansenist fanatics from 1727 down to 1758 or later some of the best attested miracles in the whole history of the supernatural were wrought at the tomb of the jansenist deacon paris30 the works of faith exalted multitudes into convulsive transports men and women underwent the most cruel tortures in the hope of securing a descent upon them of the divine grace the sober citizen whose journal is so useful a guide to domestic events in france from the regency to the peace of 1763 tells us the effect of this hideous revival upon public sentiment people began to see he says what they were to think of the miracles of antiquity the more they went into these matters whether miracles or prophecies the more obscurity they discovered in the one the more doubt about the other who could tell that they had not been accredited and established in remote times with as little foundation as what was then passing under mens very eyes just in the same way the violent and prolonged debates the intrigue the tergiversation which attended the acceptance of the famous bull unigenitus taught shrewd observers how it is that religions establish themselves they also taught how little respect is due in our minds and consciences to the great points which the universal church claims to have decided31  these are the circumstances which explain the rude and vigorous scepticism of diderots first performances and they explain the influence of shaftesbury over him neither diderot nor his contemporaries were ready at once to plunge into the broader and firmer negation to which they afterwards committed themselves no doubt some of the politeness which he shows to christianity both in the notes to his translation of shaftesbury and in his own philosophic thoughts is no more than an ironical deference to established prejudices the notes to the essay on merit and virtue show that diderot like all the other french revolters against established prejudice had been deeply influenced by the shrewdwitted montaigne but the ardour of the disciple pressed objections home with a trenchancy that is very unlike the sage distillations of the master it was from shaftesbury however that he borrowed common sense as a philosophic principle shaftesbury had indirectly drawn it from locke and through hutcheson it became the source and sponsor of the scottish philosophy of that century this was a weapon exactly adapted for dealing with a theology that was discredited in the eyes of all cool observers by the hysterical extravagances of one set of religionists and the factious pretensions of their rivals and no other weapon was at hand the historic or critical method of investigation was impossible for the age did not possess the requisite learning the indirect attack from the side of physical science was equally impossible the bearing of newtons great discovery on the current conceptions of the creator and the supposed system of the divine government was not yet fully realised the other scientific ideas which have since made the old hypothesis less credible were not at that time even conceived  diderot did indeed perceive even so early as this that the controversy was passing from the metaphysicians to the physicists though he for the moment misinterpreted the ultimate direction of the effect of experimental discovery he discerned its potency in the field of theological discussion it is not from the hands of the metaphysician he said that atheism has received the weightiest strokes the sublime meditations of malebranche and descartes were less calculated to shake materialism than a single observation of malpighis if this dangerous hypothesis is tottering in our days it is to experimental physics that such a result is due it is only in the works of newton of muschenbroek of hartzoeker and of nieuwentit that people have found satisfactory proofs of the existence of a being of sovereign intelligence thanks to the works of these great men the world is no longer a god it is a machine with its cords its pulleys its springs its weights32 in other words diderot had as yet not made his way beyond the haltingplace which has been the favourite goal of english physicists from newton down to faraday33 consistent materialism had not yet established itself in his mind meanwhile he laid about him with his common sense just as voltaire did though diderot has more weightiness of manner if his use of the weapon cannot be regarded as a decisive settlement of the true issues we have to remember that he himself became aware in a very short time of its inadequateness and proceeded to the discussion as we shall presently see from another side  the scope of the philosophical thoughts and the attitude of diderots mind when they were written may be shown in a few brief passages the opening words point to the significance of the new time in one direction and they are the keynote to diderots whole character people are for ever declaiming against the passions they set down to them all the pains that man endures and quite forget that they are also the source of all his pleasures it is regarded as an affront to reason if one dares to say a word in favour of its rivals yet it is only passions and strong passions that can raise the soul to great things sober passions produce only the commonplace deadened passions degrade men of extraordinary quality constraint annihilates the greatness and energy of nature see that tree tis to the luxury of its branches that you owe the freshness and the widespreading breadth of its shade which you may enjoy till winter comes to despoil it of its leafy tresses an end to all excellence in poetry in painting in music as soon as superstition has once wrought upon human temperament the effect of old age it is the very climax of madness to propose to oneself the ruin of the passions a fine design truly in your pietist to torment himself like a convict in order to desire nothing love nothing feel nothing and he would end by becoming a true monster if he were to succeed34 many years afterwards he wrote in the same sense to madame voland i have ever been the apologist of strong passions they alone move me whether they inspire me with admiration or horror i feel vehemently if atrocious deeds that dishonour our nature are due to them it is by them also that we are borne to the marvellous endeavour that elevates it the man of mediocre passion lives and dies like the brute and so forth until the writer is carried to the perplexing position that if we were bound to choose between racine a bad husband a bad father a false friend and a sublime poet and racine good father good husband good friend and dull worthy man i hold to the first of racine the bad man what remains nothing of racine the man of genius the work is eternal35 without attempting to solve this problem in casuistry we recognise diderots mood and the hatred with which it would be sure to inspire him for the starved and mutilated passions of the christian type the humility chastity obedience indolent solitude which had for centuries been glorified by the church were monstrous to this vehement and energetic spirit the church had placed heroism in effacement diderot borne to the other extreme left out even discipline to turn from his maxims on the foundation of conduct to his maxims on opinion as we have said his attitude is that of the sceptic  what has never been put in question has not been proved what people have not examined without prepossessions they have not examined thoroughly scepticism is the touchstone § 31  incredulity is sometimes the vice of a fool and credulity the defect of a man of intelligence the latter sees far into the immensity of the possible the former scarcely sees anything possible beyond the actual perhaps this is what produces the timidity of the one and the temerity of the other  a demiscepticism is the mark of a feeble understanding it reveals a pusillanimous reasoner who suffers himself to be alarmed by consequences a superstitious creature who thinks he is honouring god by the fetters which he imposes on his reason a kind of unbeliever who is afraid of unmasking himself to himself for if truth has nothing to lose by examination as is the demisceptics conviction what does he think in the bottom of his heart of those privileged notions which he fears to sound and which are placed in one of the recesses of his brain as in a sanctuary to which he dares not draw nigh § 34  scepticism does not suit everybody it supposes profound and impartial examination he who doubts because he does not know the grounds of credibility is no better than an ignoramus the true sceptic has counted and weighed the reasons but it is no light matter to weigh arguments who of us knows their value with any nicety every mind has its own telescope an objection that disappears in your eyes is a colossus in mine you find an argument trivial that to me is overwhelming if then it is so difficult to weigh reasons and if there are no questions which have not two sides and nearly always in equal measure how come we to decide with such rapidity § 24  when the pious cry out against scepticism it seems to me that they do not understand their own interest or else that they are inconsistent if it is certain that a true faith to be embraced and a false faith to be abandoned need only to be thoroughly known then surely it must be highly desirable that universal doubt should spread over the surface of the earth and that all nations should consent to have the truth of their religions examined our missionaries would find a good half of their work done for them § 36  one thing to be remembered is that diderot like vauvenargues voltaire condorcet always had pascal in his mind when dealing with apologetics they all recognised in him a thinker with a love of truth as distinguished from the mere priest catholic anglican brahman or another pascal says diderot was upright but he was timid and inclined to credulity an elegant writer and a profound reasoner he would doubtless have enlightened the world if providence had not abandoned him to people who sacrificed his talents to their own antipathies how much to be regretted that he did not leave to the theologians of his time the task of settling their own differences that he did not give himself up to the search for truth without reserve and without the fear of offending god by using all the intelligence that god had given him how much to be regretted that he took for masters men who were not worthy to be his disciples and was foolish enough to think arnauld de sacy and nicole better men than himself § 14 the philosophic thoughts are designed for an answer in form to the more famous thoughts of this champion of popular theology the first of the following extracts for instance recalls a memorable illustration of pascals sublime pessimism a few passages will illustrate sufficiently the line of argument which led the foremost men at the opening of the philosophic revolution to reject the pretensions of christianity  what voices what cries what groans who is it that has shut up in dungeons all these piteous souls what crimes have the poor wretches committed who condemns them to such torments the god whom they have offended who then is this god a god full of goodness but would a god full of goodness take delight in bathing himself in tears if criminals had to calm the furies of a tyrant what would they do more there are people of whom we ought not to say that they fear god but that they are horribly afraid of him judging from the picture they paint of the supreme being from his wrath from the rigour of his vengeance from certain comparisons expressive of the ratio between those whom he leaves to perish and those to whom he deigns to stretch out a hand the most upright soul would be tempted to wish that such a being did not exist §§ 79  you present to an unbeliever a volume of writings of which you claim to show him the divinity but before going into your proofs he will be sure to put some questions about your collection has it always been the same why is it less ample now than it was some centuries ago by what right have they banished this work or that which another sect reveres and preserved this or that which the other has repudiated you only answer all these difficulties by the avowal that the first foundations of the faith are purely human that the choice between the manuscripts the restoration of passages finally the collection has been made according to rules of criticism well i do not refuse to concede to the divinity of the sacred books a degree of faith proportioned to the certainty of these rules § 59  people agree that it is of the last importance to employ none but solid arguments for the defence of a creed yet they would gladly persecute those who attempt to cry down the bad arguments what then is it not enough to be a christian am i also to be one upon wrong grounds §57  the less probability a fact has the more does the testimony of history lose its weight i should have no difficulty in believing a single honest man who should tell me that the king had just won a complete victory over the allies but if all paris were to assure me that a dead man had come to life again i should not believe a word of it that a historian should impose upon us or that a whole people should be mistakenthere is no miracle in that §46  what is god a question that we put to children and that philosophers have much trouble to answer we know the age at which a child ought to learn to read to sing to dance to begin latin or geometry it is only in religion that you take no account of his capacity he scarcely hears what you say before he is asked what is god it is at the same instant from the same lips that he learns that there are ghosts goblins werewolvesand a god §25  the diversity of religious opinions has led the deists to invent an argument that is perhaps more singular than sound cicero having to prove that the romans were the most warlike people in the world adroitly draws this conclusion from the lips of their rivals gauls to whom if to any do you yield the palm for courage to the romans parthians after you who are the bravest of men the romans africans whom would you fear if you were to fear any the romans let us interrogate the religionists in this fashion say the deists chinese what religion would be the best if your own were not the best naturalism mussulmans what faith would you embrace if you abjured mahomet naturalism christians what is the true religion if it be not christianity judaism but you o jews what is the true religion if judaism be false naturalism now those continues cicero to whom the second place is awarded by unanimous consent and who do not in turn concede the first place to anyit is those who incontestably deserve that place §62                                       in all this we notice one constant characteristic of the eighteenth century controversy about revealed religion the assailant demands of the defender an answer to all the intellectual or logical objections that could possibly be raised by one who had never been a christian and who refused to become a christian until these objections could be met no account is taken of the mental conditions by which a creed is engendered and limited nor of the train of historic circumstance which prepares men to receive it the modern apologist escapes by explaining religion the apologist of a hundred years ago was required to prove it the end of such a method was inevitably a negation the objective propositions of a creed with supernatural pretensions can never be demonstrated from natural or rationalistic premisses and if they could be so demonstrated it would only be on grounds that are equally good for some other creeds with the same pretensions the sceptic was left triumphantly weighing one revealed system against another in an equal balance36  the position of the writer of the philosophical thoughts is distinctly theistic yet there is at least one striking passage to show how forcibly some of the arguments on the other side impressed him i open says diderot the pages of a celebrated professor and i readatheists i concede to you that movement is essential to matter what conclusion do you draw from that that the world results from the fortuitous concourse of atoms you might as well say that homers iliad or voltaires henriade is a result of the fortuitous concourse of written characters now for my part i should be very sorry to use that reasoning to an atheist the comparison would give him a very easy game to play according to the laws of the analysis of chances he would say to me i ought not to be surprised that a thing comes to pass when it is possible and the difficulty of the event is compensated by the number of throws there is a certain number of throws in which i would safely back myself to bring 100000 sixes at once with 100000 dice whatever the definite number of the letters with which i am invited fortuitously to produce the iliad there is a certain definite number of throws which would make the proposal advantageous for me nay my advantage would be infinite if the quantity of throws accorded to me were infinite now you grant to me that matter exists from all eternity and that movement is essential to it in return for this concession i will suppose with you that the world has no limits that the multitude of atoms is infinite and that this order which astonishes you nowhere contradicts itself well from these reciprocal admissions there follows nothing else unless it be this that the possibility of engendering the universe fortuitously is very small but that the number of throws is infinite or in other words that the difficulty of the event is more than sufficiently compensated by the multitude of the throws therefore if anything ought to be repugnant to reason it is the supposition thatmatter being in motion from all eternity and there being perhaps in the infinite number of possible combinations an infinite number of admirable arrangementsnone of these admirable arrangements would have been met with out of the infinite multitude of all those which matter successively took on therefore the mind ought to be more astonished at the hypothetical duration of chaos37 § 21  in a short continuation of the philosophical thoughts entitled on the sufficiency of natural religion diderot took the next step and turned towards that faith which the votaries of each creed allow to be the best after their own even here he is still in the atmosphere of negation he desires no more than to show that revealed religion confers no advantages which are not already secured by natural religion the revealed law contains no moral precept which i do not find recommended and practised under the law of nature therefore it has taught us nothing new upon morality the revealed law has brought us no new truth for what is a truth but a proposition referring to an object conceived in terms which present clear ideas to me and the connection of which with one another is intelligible to me now revealed religion has introduced no such propositions to us what it has added to the natural law consists of five or six propositions which are not a whit more intelligible to me than if they were expressed in ancient carthaginian inasmuch as the ideas represented by the terms and the connection among these ideas escape me entirely38  there is no sign in this piece that diderot had examined the positive grounds of natural religion or that he was ready with any adequate answer to the argument which butler had brought forward in the previous decade of the century we do not see that he is aware as yet of there being as valid objections on his own sceptical principles to the alleged data of naturalistic deism as to the pretensions of a supernatural religion he was content with shaftesburys position  shaftesburys influence on diderot was permanent it did not long remain so full and entire as it was now in the sphere of religious belief but the traces of it never disappeared from his notions on morals and art shaftesburys cheerfulness and geniality in philosophising were thoroughly sympathetic to diderot the optimistic harmony which the english philosopher coming after leibnitz assumed as the startingpoint of his ethical and religious ideas was not only highly congenial to diderots sanguine temperament it was a most attractive way of escape from the disorderly and confused theological wilderness of sin asceticism miracle and the other monkeries this naturalistic religion may seem a very unsafe and comfortless haltingplace to us but to men who heard of religion only in connection with the bull unigenitus and confessional certificates with some act of intolerance or cruelty with futile disputes about grace and the five propositions the naturalism which shaftesbury taught in prose and pope versified was like the dawn after the foulness of night those who wished to soften the inhuman rigour of the criminal procedure of the time39 used to appeal from customary ordinances and written laws to the law natural the law natural was announced to have preceded any law of human devising in the same way those who wished to disperse the darkness of unintelligible dogmas and degraded ecclesiastical usages appealed to the simplicity light and purity of that natural religion which was supposed to have been overlaid and depraved by the special superstitions of the different communities of the world  popes essay on man wrote voltaire after his return from england 1728 seems to me the finest didactic poem the most useful the most sublime that was ever written in any tongue tis true the whole substance of it is to be found in shaftesburys characteristics and i do not know why pope gives all the honour of it to bolingbroke without saying a word of the celebrated shaftesbury the pupil of locke40 the ground of this enthusiastic appreciation of the english naturalism was not merely that it made morality independent of religion which shaftesbury took great pains to do it also identified religion with all that is beautiful and harmonious in the universal scheme it surrounded the new faith with a pure and lofty poetry that enabled it to confront the old on more than equal terms of dignity and elevation shaftesbury and diderot after him ennobled human nature by placing the principle of virtue the sense of goodness within the breast of man diderot held to this idea throughout as we shall see that he did so explains a kind of phraseology about virtue and morality in his letters to madame voland and elsewhere which would otherwise sound disagreeably like cant finally shaftesburys peculiar attribution of beauty to morality his reference of ethical matters to a kind of taste the tolerably equal importance attributed by him to a sense of beauty and to the moral sense all impressed diderot with a mark that was not effaced in the text of the inquiry the author pronounces it a childish affectation in the eyes of any man who weighs things maturely to deny that there is in moral beings just as in corporeal objects a true and essential beauty a real sublime the eagerness with which diderot seized on this idea from the first is shown in the declamatory footnote which he here appends to his original41 it was the source by a process of inverted application of that ethical colouring in his criticisms on art which made them so new and so interesting because it carried æsthetic beyond technicalities and associated it with the real impulses and circumstances of human life42  one of diderots writings composed about our present date 1747 the promenade du sceptique did not see the light until after his death his daughter tells us that a police agent came one day to the house and proceeded to search the authors room he found a manuscript said good that is what i am looking for thrust it into his pocket and went away diderot did his best to recover his piece but never succeeded43 a copy of it came into the hands of naigeon and it seems to have been retained by malesherbes the director of the press out of goodwill to the author if it had been printed it would certainly have cost him a sojourn in vincennes  we have at first some difficulty in realising how he police could know the contents of an obscure authors desk for one thing we have to remember that paris though it had been enormously increased in the days of law and the system 171920 was still of a comparatively manageable size in 1720 though the population of the whole realm was only fourteen or fifteen millions that of paris had reached no less a figure than a million and a half after the explosion of the system its artificial expansion naturally came to an end by the middle of the century the highest estimate of the population does not make it much more than eight hundred thousand44 this unlike the socially unwholesome and monstrous agglomerations of paris or london in our own time was a population over which police supervision might be made tolerably effective it was more like a very large provincial town again the inhabitants were marked off into groups or worlds with a definiteness that is now no longer possible onefifth of the population for instance consisted of domestic servants45 there were between twentyeight and thirty thousand professional beggars46 the legal circle was large and was deeply engrossed by its own interests and troubles the world of authorship though extremely noisy and profoundly important still made only a small group one effect of a censorship is to produce much gossip and whispering about suspected productions before they see the light and these whispers let the police into as many secrets as they choose to know  in diderots case his unsuspecting goodnature to all comers made his affairs accessible enough his house was the resort of all the starving hacks in paris and he has left us more than one graphic picture of the literary drudge of that time he writes for instance about a poor devil to whom he had given a manuscript to copy the time for which he had promised it to me expired and as my man did not appear i became uneasy and started in search of him i found him in a hole about as big as my fist almost pitchdark without the smallest scrap of curtain or hanging to cover the nakedness of his walls a couple of strawbottomed chairs a trucklebed with a quilt riddled by the moths a box in the corner of the chimney and rags of every sort stuck upon it a small tin lamp to which a bottle served as support and on a shelf some dozen firstrate books i sat talking there for threequarters of an hour my man was as bare as a worm lean black dry but perfectly serene he said nothing but munched his crust of bread with good appetite and bestowed a caress from time to time on his beloved on the miserable bedstead that took up twothirds of his room if i had never learnt before that happiness resides in the soul my epictetus of hyacinth street would have taught it me right thoroughly47  the history of one of these ragged clients is to our point among those he wrote to madame voland48 whom chance and misery sent to my address was one glénat who knew mathematics wrote a good hand and was in want of bread i did all i could to extricate him from his embarrassments i went begging for customers for him on every side if he came at mealtimes i would not let him go if he lacked shoes i gave him them now and then i slipped a shilling into his hands as well he had the air of the worthiest man in the world and he even bore his neediness with a certain gaiety that used to amuse me i was fond of chatting with him he seemed to set little store by fortune fame and most of the other things that charm or dazzle us in life seven or eight days ago damilaville wrote to send this man to him for one of his friends who had a manuscript for him to copy i send him the manuscript is entrusted to hima work on religion and government i do not know how it came about but that manuscript is now in the hands of the lieutenant of police damilaville gives me word of this i hasten to my friend glénat to warn him to count no more upon me and why am i not to count upon you because you are a marked man the police have their eyes upon you and tis impossible to send work to you but my dear sir theres no risk so long as you entrust nothing reprehensible to my hands the police only come here when they scent game i cannot tell how they do it but they are never mistaken ah well i at any rate know how it is and you have let me see much more in the matter than i ever expected to learn from you and with that i turn my back on my rascal diderot having occasion to visit the lieutenant of police introduced the matter and could not withhold an energetic remonstrance against such an odious abuse of a mans kindness of heart as the introduction of spies to his fireside m de sartine laughed and diderot took his leave vowing that all the wretches who should come to him for the future with cuffs dirty and torn with holes in their stockings and holes in their shoes with hair all unkempt in shabby overcoats with many rents or scanty black suits with starting seams with all the tones and looks of distressed worth would henceforth seem to him no better than police emissaries and scoundrels set to spy on him the vow we may be sure was soon forgotten but the story shows how seriously in one respect the man of letters in france was worse off than his brother in england  the world would have suffered no irreparable loss if the police had thrown the sceptics walk into the fire it is an allegory designed to contrast the life of religion the life of philosophy and the life of sensual pleasure of all forms of composition an allegory most depends for its success upon the rapidity of the writers eye for new felicities accuracy verisimilitude sustention count for nothing in comparison with imaginative adroitness and variety bunyan had such an eye and so with infinitely more vivacity had voltaire diderot had not the deep sincerity or realism of conviction of the one nor had he the inimitable power of throwing himself into a fancy that was possessed by the other he was the least agile the least felicitous the least ready of composers his allegory of the avenue of thorns the avenue of chestnuttrees and the avenue of flowers is an allegory unskilful obvious poor and not any more amusing than if its matter had been set forth without any attempt at fanciful decoration the blinded saints among the thorns and the voluptuous sinners among the flowers are rather mechanical figures the translation into the dialect required by the allegorical situation of a sceptics aversion for gross superstition on the one hand and for gross hedonism on the other is forced and wooden the most interesting of the three sections is the second containing a discussion in which the respective parts are taken by a deist a pantheist a subjective idealist a sceptic and an atheist the allegory falls into the background and we have a plain statement of some of the objections that may be made by the sceptical atheist both to revelation and to natural religion a starry sky calls forth the usual glorification of the maker of so much beauty that is all imagination rejoins the atheist it is mere presumption we have before us an unknown machine on which certain observations have been made ignorant people who have only examined a single wheel of it of which they hardly know more than a tooth or two form conjectures upon the way in which their cogs fit in with a hundred thousand other wheels and then to finish like artisans they label the work with the name of its author  the defender justifies this by the argument from a repeaterwatch of which paley and others have made so much use we at once ascribe the structure and movement of a repeaterwatch to intelligent creation nothings are not equal says the atheist you are comparing a finished work whose origin and manufacture we know to an infinite piece of complexity whose beginnings whose present condition and whose end are all alike unknown and about whose author you have nothing better than guesses  but does not its structure announce an author no you do not see who nor what he is who told you that the order you admire here belies itself nowhere else are you allowed to conclude from a point in space to infinite space you pile a vast piece of ground with earthheaps thrown here or there by chance but among which the worm and the ant find convenient dwellingplaces enough what would you think of these insects if reasoning after your fashion they fell into raptures over the intelligence of the gardener who had arranged all these materials so delightfully for their convenience49  in this rudimentary form the chief speaker presses some of the objections to optimistic deism from the point of view of the fixed limitations the inevitable relativity of human knowledge this kind of objection had been more pithily expressed by pascal long before in the famous article of his thoughts on the difficulty of demonstrating the existence of a deity by light of nature50 diderots argument does not extend to dogmatic denial it only shows that the deist is exposed to an attack from the same sceptical armoury from which he had drawn his own weapons for attacking revelation it is impossible to tell how far diderot went at this moment the trenchancy with which his atheist urges his reasoning proves that the writer was fully alive to its force on the other hand the atheist is left in the midst of a catastrophe on his return home he finds his children murdered his house pillaged and his wife carried off and we are told that he could not complain on his own principles  if the absence of witnesses allowed the robber to commit his crime with impunity why should he not again there is a passage in which the writer seems to be speaking his own opinions an interlocutor maintains the importance of keeping the people in bondage to certain prejudices what prejudices if a man once admits the existence of a god the reality of moral good and evil the immortality of the soul future rewards and punishments what need has he of prejudices supposing him initiated in all the mysteries of transubstantiation consubstantiation the trinity hypostatical union predestination incarnation and the rest will he be any the better citizen51  in truth diderots mind was at this time floating in an atmosphere of rationalistic negation and the moral of his piece as he hints points first to the extravagance of catholicism next to the vanity of the pleasures of the world and lastly to the unfathomable uncertainty of philosophy still we may discern a significant leaning towards the theory of the eternity of matter which has arranged itself and assumed variety of form by virtue of its inherent quality of motion52  it is a characteristic and displeasing mark of the time that diderot in the midst of these serious speculations should have set himself 1748 to the composition of a story in the kind which the author of the sofa had made highly popular the mechanism of this deplorable piece is more grossly disgustingi mean æsthetically not morallythan anything to be found elsewhere in the too voluminous library of impure literature the idea would seem to have been borrowed from one of the old fabliaux53 but what is tolerable in the quaint and naïf verse of the twelfth or thirteenth century becomes shocking when deliberately rendered by a grave man into bald unblushing prose of the eighteenth the humour the rich sparkle the wit the merry gaillardise have all vanished we are left with the vapid dregs of an obscene anachronism mr carlyle who knows how to be manly in these matters and affects none of the hypocritical airs of our conventional criticism yet has not more energetically than truly pronounced this the beastliest of all past present or future dull novels as the next mortal creature even a reviewer again compelled to glance into that book i have felt the propriety of our humorists injunction to such a one to bathe himself in running water put on change of raiment and be unclean until the even diderot himself as might have been expected soon had the grace to repent him of this shameful book and could never hear it mentioned without a very lively embarrassment54  as i have said before55 it was such books as this as crébillons novels as ducloss confessions du comte x and the dissoluteness of manners indicated by them which invested rousseaus new heloïsa 1761 with its delightful and irresistible fascinations having pointed out elsewhere the significance of the licentiousness from which the philosophic party did not escape untainted56 i need not here do more than make two short remarks first the corruption which had seized the court after the death of lewis xiv in the course of a few years had reached the middle class in the town the loosening of social fibre caused by the insenate speculation at the time of law no doubt furthered the spread of demoralisation second the reaction against the church involved among its other elements a passionate contempt for all asceticism this happened to fall in with the general relaxation of morals that followed lewiss gloomy rigour consequently even men of pure life like condorcet carried the theoretical protest against asceticism so far as to vindicate the practical immorality of the time this is one of those enormous drawbacks that people seldom take into account when they are enumerating the blessings of superstition mediæval superstition had produced some advantages but now came the setoff durable morality had been associated with a transitory religious faith the faith fell into intellectual discredit and sexual morality shared its decline for a short season this must always be the natural consequence of building sound ethics on the shifting sands and rotting foundations of theology  such literature as these tales of diderots was the mirror both of the ordinary practical sentiment and the philosophic theory a nation pays dearly for one of those outbreaks when they happen to stamp themselves in a literary form that endures there are those who hold that louvets faublas is to this day a powerful agent in the depravation of the youth of france diderot however had not the most characteristic virtues of french writing he was no master in the art of the naïf nor in delicate malice nor in sprightly cynicism his book consequently has not lived and we need not waste more words upon it chaque esprit a sa lie wrote one who for a while had sat at diderots feet57 and we may dismiss this tale as the lees of diderots strong careless sensualised understanding he was afterwards the author of a work la religieuse on which the superficial critic may easily pour out the vials of affected wrath there however he was executing a profound pathological study in a serious spirit if the subject is horrible we have to blame the composition of human character or the mischievousness of a human institution la religieuse is no continuation of the vein of defilement which began and ended with the story of 1748a story which is one among so many illustrations of guizots saying about the eighteenth century that it was the most tempting and seductive of all centuries for it promised full satisfaction at once to all the greatnesses of humanity and to all its weaknesses hettner quotes a passage from the minor writings of niebuhr in which the historian compares diderot with petronius as having both of them been honest and wellintentioned men who in shameless times were carried towards cynicism by their deep contempt for the prevailing vice if diderot were alive now says niebuhr and if petronius had only lived in the fourth instead of the third century then the painting of obscenity would have been odious to them and the inducement to it infinitely smaller58 there is no trace in diderot of this deep contempt for the viciousness of his time all that can be said is that he did not escape it in his earlier years in spite of the natural wholesomeness and rectitude of his character  it is worthy of remark that the dissoluteness of the middle portion of the century was not associated with the cynical and contemptuous view about women that usually goes with relaxed morality there was a more or less distinct consciousness of a truth which has ever since grown into clearer prominence with the advance of thought since the revolution it is that the sphere and destiny of women are among the three or four foremost questions in social improvement this is now perceived on all sides profound as are the differences of opinion upon the proper solution of the problem a hundred years ago this perception was vague and indefinite but there was an unmistakable apprehension that the catholic ideal of womanhood was no more adequate to the facts of life than catholic views about science or property or labour or political order and authority  diderot has left some curious and striking reflections upon the fate and character of women he gives no signs of feeling after social reorganisation he only speaks as one brooding in uneasy meditation over a very mournful perplexity there is no sentimentalising after the fashion of jean jacques he does not neglect the plain physical facts about which it is so difficult in an age of morbid reserve to speak with freedom yet about which it is fatal to be silent he indulged in none of those mischievous flatteries of women which satisfy narrow observers or coxcombs or the uxorious never forget he said that for lack of reflection and principles nothing penetrates down to a certain profoundness of conviction in the understanding of women the ideas of justice virtue vice goodness badness float on the surface of their souls they have preserved selflove and personal interest with all the energy of nature although more civilized than we are outwardly they have remained true savages inwardly it is in the passion of love the access of jealousy the transports of maternal tenderness the instants of superstition the way in which they show epidemic and popular notions that women amaze us fair as the seraphin of klopstock terrible as the fiends of milton the distractions of a busy and contentious life break up our passions a woman on the contrary broods over her passions they are a fixed point on which her idleness or the frivolity of her duties holds her attention fast impenetrable in dissimulation cruel in vengeance tenacious in their designs without scruples about the means of success animated by a deep and secret hatred against the despotism of manit seems as if there were among them a sort of league such as exists among the priests of all nations the symbol of women in general is that of the apocalypse on the front of which is inscribed mystery if we have more reason than women have they have far more instinct than we have59 all this was said in no bitterness but in the spirit of the strong observer  cynical bitterness is as misplaced as frivolous adulation diderot had a deep pity for women their physical weaknesses moved him to compassion to these are added the burden of their maternal function and the burden of unequal laws the moment which shall deliver the girl from subjection to her parents is come her imagination opens to a future thronged by chimæras her heart swims in secret delight rejoice while thou canst luckless creature time would have weakened the tyranny that thou hast left time will strengthen the tyranny that awaits thee they choose a husband for her she becomes a mother it is in anguish at the peril of their lives at the cost of their charms often to the damage of their health that they give birth to their little ones the organs that mark their sex are subject to two incurable maladies there is perhaps no joy comparable to that of the mother as she looks on her firstborn but the moment is dearly bought time advances beauty passes there come the years of neglect of spleen of weariness tis in pain that nature disposes them for maternity in pain and illness dangerous and prolonged she brings maternity to its close what is a woman after that neglected by her husband left by her children a nullity in society then piety becomes her one and last resource in nearly every part of the world the cruelty of the civil laws against women is added to the cruelty of nature they have been treated like weakminded children there is no sort of vexation which among civilised peoples man cannot inflict upon woman with impunity60  the thought went no further in diderots mind than this pathetic ejaculation he left it to the next generation to condorcet and others to attack the problem practically effectively to assert the true theory that we must look to social emancipation in women and moral discipline in men to redress the physical disadvantages meanwhile diderot deserves credit for treating the position and character of women in a civilised society with a sense of reality and for throwing aside those faded gallantries of poetic and literary convention that screen a broad and dolorous gulf     chapter iv  the new philosophy   it is a common prejudice to treat voltaire as if he had done nothing save write the pucelle and mock at habakkuk every serious and instructed student knows better voltaires popularisation of the philosophy of newton 1738 was a stimulus of the greatest importance to new thought in france in a chapter of this work he had explained with his usual matchless terseness and lucidity berkeleys theory of vision the principle of this theory is as every one knows that figures magnitudes situations distances are not sensations but inferences they are not the immediate revelations of sight but the products of association and intellectual construction they are not directly judged by vision but by imagination and experience if this be so neither situation nor distance nor magnitude nor figure would be at once discerned by one born blind supposing him suddenly to receive sight voltaire then describes the results of the operation performed by cheselden 1728 on a lad who had been blind from his birth this experiment was believed to confirm all that locke and berkeley had foreseen for it was long before the patient could distinguish objects by size distance or shape61 condillac had renewed the interest which voltaire had first kindled in the subject by referring to cheseldens experiment in his first work which was published in 174662  it happened that in 1748 réaumur couched the eyes of a girl who had been born blind diderot sought to be admitted to the operation but the favour was denied him and he expressed his resentment in terms which as we shall see cost him very dear as he could not witness the experiment he began to meditate upon the subject and the result was the letter on the blind for the use of those who see published in 1749the date it may be observed in passing of another very important work in the development of materialistic speculation david hartleys observations on man his frame his duty and his expectations diderots real disappointment at not being admitted to the operation was slight in a vigorous passage he shows the difficulties in the way of conducting such an experiment under the conditions necessary to make it conclusive to prepare the bornblind to answer philosophical interrogatories truly and then to put these interrogatories rightly would have been a feat he declares not unworthy of the united talents of newton descartes locke and leibnitz unless the patient were placed in such conditions as this diderot thinks there would be more profit in questioning a blind person of good sense than in the answers of an uneducated person receiving sight for the first time under abnormal and bewildering circumstances63 in this he was undoubtedly right if the experiment could be prepared under the delicate conditions proper to make it demonstrative evidence it would be final but the experiment had certainly not been so prepared in his time and probably never will be64  read in the light of the rich and elaborate speculative literature which england is producing in our own day diderots once famous letter on the blind seems both crude and loose in its thinking yet considering the state of philosophy in france at the time of its appearance we are struck by the acuteness the good sense and the originality of many of its positions it was the first effective introduction into france of these great and fundamental principles that all knowledge is relative to our intelligence that thought is not the measure of existence nor the conceivableness of a proposition the test of its truth and that our experience is not the limit to the possibilities of things that is an impatient criticism which dismisses the french philosophers with some light word as radically shallow and impotent diderot grasped the doctrine of relativity in some of the most important and farreaching of all its bearings the fact that he and his allies used the doctrine as a weapon of combat against the standing organisation is exactly what makes their history worth writing about the standing organisation was the antagonistic doctrine incarnate it made anthropomorphism and the absolute the very base and spring alike of individual and of social life no growth was possible until this speculative base had been transformed hence the profound significance of what looks like a mere discussion of one of the minor problems of metaphysics diderot was not the first to discover relativity nor did he establish it but it was he who introduced it into the literature of his country at the moment when circumstances were ripe for it  condillac as we have said had published his first work the essay on the origin of human knowledge three years before 1746 this was a simple and undeveloped rendering of the doctrine of locke that the ultimate source of our notions lies in impressions made upon the senses shaped and combined by reflection it was not until 1754 that condillac published his more celebrated treatise on the sensations in which he advanced a stride beyond locke and instead of tracing our notions to the double source of sensation and reflection maintained that reflection itself is nothing but sensation differently transformed in the first book again he had disputed berkeleys theory of vision in the second he gave a reasoned adhesion to it now diderot and condillac had first been brought together by rousseau when all three were needy wanderers about the streets of paris they used to dine together once a week at a tavern and it was diderot who persuaded a bookseller to give condillac a hundred crowns for his first manuscript the paris booksellers says rousseau are very arrogant and harsh to beginners and metaphysics then extremely little in fashion did not offer a very particularly attractive subject65 the constant intercourse between diderot and condillac in the interval between the two works of the great apostle of sensationalism may well account for the remarkable development in doctrine this is one of the many examples of the share of diderots energetic and stimulating intelligence in directing and nourishing the movement of the time its errors and precipitancies included on the other hand the share of condillac in providing a text for diderots first considerable performance is equally evident  the letter on the blind is an inquiry how far a modification of the five senses such as the congenital absence of one of them would involve a corresponding modification of the ordinary notions acquired by men who are normally endowed in their capacity for sensation it considers the intellect in a case where it is deprived of one of the senses the writer opens with an account of a visit made by himself and some friends to a man born blind at puisaux a place seventy miles from paris they asked him in what way he thought of the eyes they are an organ on which the air produces the same effect as my stick upon my hand a mirror he described as a machine which sets things in relief away from themselves if they are properly placed in relation to it this conception had formed itself in his mind in the following way the blind man only knows objects by touch he is aware on the testimony of others that we know objects by sight as he knows them by touch he can form no other notion he is aware again that a man cannot see his own face though he can touch it sight then he concludes is a sort of touch which only extends to objects different from our own visage and remote from us now touch only conveys to him the idea of relief a mirror therefore must be a machine which sets us in relief out of ourselves how many philosophers cries diderot have employed less subtlety to reach notions just as untrue  the bornblind had a memory for sound in a surprising degree and countenances do not present more diversity to us than he observed in voices the voice has for such persons an infinite number of delicate shades that escape us because we have not the same reason for attention that the blind have the help that our senses lend to one another is an obstacle to their perfection  the blind man said he should have been tempted to regard persons endowed with sight as superior intelligences if he had not found out a hundred times how inferior we are in other respects how do we knowdiderot reflects upon thisthat all the animals do not reason in the same way and look upon themselves as our equals or superiors notwithstanding our more complex and efficient intelligence they may accord to us a reason with which we should still have much need of their instinct while they claim to be endowed with an instinct which enables them to do very well without our reason  when asked whether he should be glad to have sight the bornblind replied that apart from curiosity he would be just as well pleased to have long arms his hands would tell him what is going on in the moon better than our eyes or telescopes and the eyes cease to see earlier than the hands lose the sense of touch it would therefore be just as good to perfect in him the organ that he had as to confer upon him another which he had not this is untrue no conceivable perfection of touch would reveal phenomena of light and the longest arms must leave those phenomena undisclosed  after recounting various other peculiarities of thought diderot notices that the blind man attaches slight importance to the sense of shame he would hardly understand the utility of clothes for instance except as a protection against cold he frankly told his philosophising visitors that he could not see why one part of the body should be covered rather than another i have never doubted says diderot that the state of our organs and senses has much influence both on our metaphysics and our morality this i may observe does not in the least show that in a society of human beings not blind but endowed with vision the sense of physical shame is a mere prejudice of which philosophy will rid us the fact that a blind man discerns no ill in nakedness has no bearing on the value or naturalness of shame among people with eyes and moreover the fact that delicacy or shame is not a universal human impulse but is established and its scope defined by a varying etiquette does not in the least affect the utility or wisdom of such an artificial establishment and definition the grounds of delicacy though connected with the senses are fixed by considerations that spring from the social reason it seems to be true as diderot says that the bornblind are at first without physical delicacy because delicacy has its root in the consciousness that we are observed while the bornblind are not conscious that they are observed it is found that one of the most important parts of their education is to impress this knowledge upon them66  but the artificiality of a moral acquisition is obviously no test of its worth nor of the reasons for preserving it diderot exclaims ah madam how different is the morality of a blind man from ours and how the morality of the deaf would differ from that of the blind and if a being should have a sense more than we have how wofully imperfect would he find our morality this is plainly a crude and erroneous way of illustrating the important truth of the strict relativity of ethical standards and maxims diderot speaks as if they were relative simply and solely to our five wits and would vary with them only everybody now has learnt that morality depends not merely on the five wits but on the mental constitution within and on the social conditions without it is to these rather than to the number of our senses that moral ideas are relative  passing over various other remarks we come to those pages in the letter which apply the principle of relativity to the masterconception of god diderots argument on this point naturally drew keener attention than the more disinterestedly scientific parts of his contribution people were not strongly agitated by the question whether a blind man who had learned to distinguish a sphere from a cube by touch would instantly identify each of them if he received sight67  the question whether a blind man has as good reasons for believing in the existence of a god as a man with sight can find was of more vivid interest as a matter of fact diderots treatment of the narrower question pp 324 etc is more closely coherent than his treatment of the wider one for the simple reason that the special limitation of experience in the bornblind cannot fairly be made to yield any decisive evidence on the great the insoluble enigma  here as in the other part of his essay diderot followed the method of interrogating the blind themselves in this instance he turned to the most extraordinary example in history of intellectual mastery and scientific penetration in one who practically belonged to the class of the bornblind and this too in dealing with subjects where sight might be thought most indispensable from 1711 to 1739 one of the professors of mathematics at cambridge was nicholas saunderson who had lost his sight before he was twelve months old he was a man of striking mental vigour an original and efficient teacher and the author of a book upon algebra which was considered meritorious in its day his knowledge of optics was highly remarkable he had distinct ideas of perspective of the projections of the sphere and of the forms assumed by plane or solid figures in certain positions for performing computations he devised a machine of great ingenuity which also served the purpose with certain modifications of representing geometrical diagrams in religion he was a sceptic or something more and in his last hours diderot supposes him to have engaged in a discussion with a minister of religion upon the arguments for the existence of a deity drawn from final causes this discussion diderot professes to reproduce and he makes saunderson discourse with much eloquence and some pathos  by one of those mystifications which make the french polemical literature of the eighteenth century the despair of bibliographers diderot cites as his authority a life of saunderson by dr inchlif he sets forth the title with great circumstantiality but no such book exists or ever did exist the royal society of london however took the jest of fathering atheism on one of its members in bad part and diderot was systematically excluded from the honour of admission to that learned body as he was excluded all his life from the french academy  the reasoning which diderot puts into the professors mouth is at first a fervid enlargement of the text that the argument drawn from the wonders of nature is very weak evidence for blind men our power of creating new objects so to speak by means of a little mirror is far more incomprehensible to them than the stars which they have been condemned never to behold the luminous ball that moves from east to west through the heavens is a less astonishing thing to them than the fire on the hearth which they can lessen or augment at pleasure68 why talk to me says saunderson of all that fine spectacle which has never been made for me i have been condemned to pass my life in darkness and you cite marvels that i cannot understand and that are only evidence for you and for those who see as you do if you want me to believe in god you must make me touch him the minister replied that the sense of touch ought to be enough to reveal the divinity to him in the admirable mechanism of his organs to this saundersoni repeat all that is not as fine for me as it is for you but the animal mechanism even were it as perfect as you pretend and as i daresay it iswhat has it in common with a being of sovereign intelligence if it fills you with astonishment that is perhaps because you are in the habit of treating as a prodigy anything that strikes you as being beyond your own strength i have been myself so often an object of admiration for you that i have a poor opinion of what surprises you i have attracted people from all parts of england who could not conceive by what means i could work at geometry well you must agree that such persons had not very exact notions about the possibility of things is a phenomenon in our notions beyond the power of man then we instantly saytis the handiwork of a god nothing short of that can content our vanity why can we not contrive to throw into our talk less pride and more philosophy if nature offers us some knot that is hard to untie let us leave it for what it is do not let us employ for cutting it the hand of a being who then immediately becomes in turn a new knot for us and a knot harder to untie than the first an indian tells you that our globe is suspended in the air on the back of an elephant and the elephant it stands on a tortoise and the tortoise what sustains that you pity the indian and yet one might very well say to you as to himmr holmes my good friend confess your ignorance and spare me elephant and tortoise69  the minister very naturally then falls back upon good authority and asks saunderson to take the word of newton clarke and leibnitz the blind man answers that though the actual state of the universe may be the illustration of a marvellous and admirable order still newton clarke and leibnitz must leave him freedom of opinion as to its earlier states and then he foreshadows in a really singular and remarkable way that theory which is believed to be the great triumph of scientific discovery and which is certainly the great stimulus to speculation in our own time as to anterior states you have no witnesses to confront with me and your eyes give you no help imagine if you choose that the order which strikes you so profoundly has subsisted from the beginning but leave me free to think that it has done no such thing and that if we went back to the birth of things and scenes and perceived matter in motion and chaos slowly disentangling itself we should come across a whole multitude of shapeless creatures instead of a very few creatures highly organised if i have no objection to make to what you say about the present condition of things i may at least question you as to their past condition i may at least ask of you for example who told youyou and leibnitz and clarke and newtonthat in the first instances of the formation of animals some were not without heads and others without feet i may maintain that these had no stomachs and those no intestines that some to whom a stomach a palate and teeth seemed to promise permanence came to an end through some fault of heart or lungs that the monsters annihilated one another in succession that all the faulty vicieuses combinations of matter disappeared and that those only survived whose mechanism implied no important misadaptation contradiction and who had the power of supporting and perpetuating themselves  on this hypothesis if the first man had happened to have his larynx closed or had not found suitable food or had been defective in the parts of generation or had failed to find a mate then what would have become of the human race it would have been still enfolded in the general depuration of the universe and that arrogant being who calls himself man dissolved and scattered among the molecules of matter would perhaps have remained for all time hidden in the number of mere possibilities  if shapeless creatures had never existed you would not fail to insist that none will ever appear and that i am throwing myself headlong into chimerical hypotheses but the order is not even now so perfect but that monstrous products appear from time to time70  we have here a distinct enough conception though in an exceedingly undigested shape first of incessant variability in organisms as an actual circumstance which we may see exemplified in its extreme form in the monstrous deviations of structure that occur from time to time before our own eyes second of adaptation to environment as the determining condition of survival among the forms that present themselves even as a bald and unsustained guess this was an effective sideblow at the doctrine of final causesa doctrine as has been often remarked which does not survive in any given set of phenomena the reduction of these phenomena to terms of matter and motion  i conjecture then continues saunderson enlarging the idea of the possibilities of matter and motion that in the beginning when matter in fermentation gradually brought our universe bursting into being blind creatures like myself were very common but why should i not believe of worlds what i believe of animals how many worlds mutilated and imperfect were peradventure dispersed then reformed and are again dispersing at each moment of time in those faroff spaces which i cannot touch and you cannot behold but where motion combines and will continue to combine masses of matter until they have chanced on some arrangement in which they may finally persevere o philosophers transport yourselves with me on to the confines of the universe beyond the point where i feel and you see organised beings gaze over that new ocean and seek across its lawless aimless heavings some vestiges of that intelligent being whose wisdom strikes you with such wonder here  what is this world a complex whole subject to endless revolutions all these revolutions show a continual tendency to destruction a swift succession of beings who follow one another press forward and vanish a fleeting symmetry the order of a moment i reproached you just now with estimating the perfection of things by your own capacity and i might accuse you here of measuring its duration by the length of your own days you judge of the continuous existence of the world as an ephemeral insect might judge of yours the world is eternal for you as you are eternal to the being that lives but for one instant yet the insect is the more reasonable of the two for what a prodigious succession of ephemeral generations attests your eternity what an immeasurable tradition yet shall we all pass away without the possibility of assigning either the real extension that we filled in space or the precise time that we shall have endured time matter spaceall it may be are no more than a point71  diderot sent a copy of his work to voltaire the poet replied with his usual playful politeness but declared his dissent from saunderson who denied god because he happened to have been born blind72 more pretentious and infinitely less acute critics than voltaire have fixed on the same point in the argument and met it by the same answer namely that blind as he was saunderson ought to have recognised an intelligent being who had provided him with so many substitutes for sight he ought to have inferred a skilful demiurgus from those ordered relations in the universe which thought independently of vision might well have disclosed to him in truth this is not the centre of the whole argument when saunderson implies that he could only admit a god on condition that he could touch him he makes a single sense the channel of all possible ideas and the arbiter of all reasoned combinations of ideas this is absurd and diderot as we have seen rapidly passed away from that to the real strength of the position all the rest of the contention against final causes would have come just as fitly from the lips of a man with vision as from saunderson the hypothetical inference of a deity from the marvels of adaptation to be found in the universe is unjustified among other reasons because it ignores or leaves unexplained the marvels of misadaptation in the universe it makes absolute through eternity a hypothesis which can at its best only be true relativelynot merely to the number of our senses butto a few partially chosen phenomena of our own little day it explains a few striking facts it leaves wholly unexplained a far greater number of equally striking facts even if it be not directly contradicted by them it is the invention of an imaginary agency to account for the scanty successes of creation and an attribution to that agency of the kind of motives that might have animated a benevolent european living in the eighteenth century it leaves wholly unaccounted for the prodigious host of monstrous or imperfect organisms and the appalling law of merciless and incessant destruction  to us this is the familiar discussion of the day but let us return to the startingpoint of this chapter in france a hundred and twenty years ago it was the first opening of a decisive breach in the walls that had sheltered the men of western europe against outer desolation for some fifteen centuries or more the completeness of catholicism as a selfcontaining system of life and thought is now harder for protestants or sceptics to realise than any other fact in the whole history of human society catholicism was not only an institution nor only a religious faith it was also a philosophy and a systematised theory of the universe the church during its best age directed the moral relations of individual men and attempted more or less successfully to humanise the relations of communities it satisfied or stimulated the affections by its exaltation of the virgin mary as a supreme object of worship it nourished the imagination on polytheistic legends of saints and martyrs it stirred the religious emotions by touching and impressive rites it surrounded its members with emblems of a special and invincible protection catholicism we have again and again to repeat claimed to deal with life as a whole and to leave no province of nature no faculty of man no need of intelligence or spirit uncomprehended but we must not forget that though this prodigious system had its root in the affections and sympathies of human nature it was also fenced round by a theory of metaphysic it rested upon authority and tradition but it also sought an expression in an intellectual philosophy of things the essence of this philosophy was to make man the final cause of the universe its interpretation of the world was absolute its conception of the creator was absolute its account of our intellectual impressions of our moral rules of our spiritual ideals made them all absolute now diderot when he wrote the letter on the blind perceived that mere rationalistic attacks upon the sacred books upon the miracles upon the moral types of catholicism could only be partially effective for destruction and could have no effect at all in replacing the old ways of thinking by others of more solid truth the attack must begin in philosophy the first fruitful process must consist in shifting the point of view in enlarging the range of the facts to be considered in pressing the relativity of our ideas in freeing ourselves from the tyranny of anthropomorphism  hobbess witty definition of the papacy as the ghost of the old roman empire sitting enthroned on the grave thereof may tempt us to forget the allimportant truth that the basis of the power of the ghost was essentially different from that of the dissolved body the empire was a political organisation resting on military force the church was a social organisation made vital by a conviction the greatest fact in the intellectual history of the eighteenth century is the decisive revolution that overtook that sustaining conviction the movement and the men whom we are studying owe all their interest to the share that they had in this immense task the central conception that the universe was called into existence only to further its creators purpose towards man became incredible this absolute proposition was slowly displaced by notions of the limitation of human faculties and of the comparatively small portion of the whole cosmos or chaos to which we have reason to believe that these faculties give us access to substitute this relative point of view for the absolute was the allimportant preliminary to the effectual breaking up of the great catholic construction  what seems to careless observers a mere metaphysical dispute was in truth and still is the decisive quarter of the great battle between theology and a philosophy reconcilable with science when the catholic reaction set in joseph de maistre by far its acutest champion in the region of philosophy at once made it his first business to attack the principle of relativity with all his force of dialectic and to reinstate absolute modes of thinking and the absolute quality of catholic propositions about religion knowledge and government73 yet neither he nor any one else on his side has ever effectively shaken the solid argument which diderot fancifully illustrated in the following passage from his reply to voltaires letter of thanks for the opuscule this marvellous order and these wondrous adaptations what am i to think of them that they are metaphysical entities only existing in your own mind you cover a vast piece of ground with a mass of ruins falling hither or thither at hazard amid these the worm and the ant find commodious shelter enough what would you say of these insects if they were to take for real and final entities the relations of the places which they inhabit to their organisation and then fall into ecstasies over the beauty of their subterranean architecture and the wonderfully superior intelligence of the gardener who arranges things so conveniently for them74 this is the notion which voltaire himself three years afterwards illustrated in the witty fancies of micromégas the little animalcule in the square cap who makes the giant laugh in a homeric manner by its inflated account of itself as the final cause of the universe is the type of the philosophy on which catholicism is based  in the same letter diderot avows his dissenthypocritically we find reason for suspectingfrom saundersons conclusion it is commonly in the nighttime he says that the mists arise which obscure in me the existence of god the rising of the sun never fails to scatter them but then the darkness is everenduring for the blind and the sun only rises for those who see diderots denial of atheism seems more than suspicious when one finds him taking so much pains to make out saundersons case for him when he urges the argument following for instance if there had never existed any but material beings there would never have been spiritual beings for then the spiritual beings would either have given themselves existence or else would have received it from the material beings but if there had never existed any but spiritual beings you will see that there would never have been material beings right philosophy only allows me to suppose in things what i can distinctly perceive in them now i perceive no other faculties distinctly in the mind except those of willing and thinking and i no more conceive that thought and will can act on material beings or on nothing than i can conceive material beings or nothing acting on spiritual beings and he winds up his letter thus it is very important not to take hemlock for parsley but not important at all to believe or to disbelieve in god the world said montaigne is a tennisball that he has given to philosophers to toss hither and thither and i would say nearly as much of the deity himself75  in concluding our account of this piece we may mention that diderot threw out a hint which is a good illustration of the alert and practically helpful way in which his mind was always seeking new ideas we have common signs he said appealing to the eye namely written characters and others appealing to the ear namely articulate sounds we have none appealing to touch for want of such a language communication is entirely broken between us and those who are born deaf dumb and blind they grow but they remain in a state of imbecility perhaps they would acquire ideas if we made ourselves understood by them from childhood in a fixed determinate constant and uniform manner in short if we traced on their hand the same characters that we trace upon paper and invariably attached the same significance to them76 the patient benevolence and ingenuity of dr howe of boston has realised in our own day the value of diderots suggestion  one or two trifling points of literary interest may be noticed in the letter on the blind diderot refers to the ingenious expression of an english geometer that god geometrises p 294 he is unaware apparently of the tradition which attributes the expression to plato though it is not found in platos writings plutarch i believe is the first person who mentions the saying and discusses what plato exactly meant by it in truth it is one of that large class of dicta which look more ingenious than they are true there is a fine latin passage by barrow on the mighty geometry of the universe and the reader of the religio medici p 42 may remember that sir thomas browne pronounces god to be like a skilful geometrician  an odd coincidence of simile is worth mentioning diderot says that great services are like large pieces of money that we have seldom any occasion to use small attentions are a current coin that we always carry in our hands this is curiously like the saying in the tatler that a man endowed with great perfections without good breeding is like one who has his pockets full of gold but wants change for his ordinary occasions yet if diderot had read the tatler he would certainly have referred to the story in no 55 how william jones of newington born blind was brought to sight at the age of twentya story told in a manner after diderots own heart   ii  it is proper in this place to mention a short philosophic piece which diderot wrote in 1751 his letter on the deaf and dumb for the use of those who hear and talk this is not like the letter on the blind the examination of a case of the intellect deprived of one or more of the senses it is substantially a fragment and a very important fragment on Æsthetics and as such there will be something to say about it in another chapter but there are perhaps one or two points at which the letter on the deaf and dumb touches the line of thought of the letter on the blind  the letter opens on the question of the origin and limits of inversion in language this at once leads to a discussion of the natural order of ideas and expressions and that original order says diderot we can only ascertain by a study of the language of gesture such a study can be pursued either in assiduous conversation with one who has been deaf and dumb from birth or by the experiment of a muet de convention a man who foregoes the use of articulate sounds for the sake of experiment as to the process of the formation of language generalising this idea diderot proceeds to consider man as distributed into as many distinct and separate beings as he has senses my idea would be to decompose a man so to speak and to examine what he derives from each of the senses with which he is endowed i have sometimes amused myself with this kind of metaphysical anatomy and i found that of all the senses the eye was the most superficial the ear the proudest smell the most voluptuous taste the most superstitious and the most inconstant touch the profoundest and the most of a philosopher it would be amusing to get together a society each member of which should have no more than one sense there can be no doubt that they would all treat one another as out of their wits  this is interesting because it was said at the time to be the source of one of the most famous fancies in the philosophical literature of the century the statue in condillacs treatise on the sensations condillac imagined a statue organised like a man but each sense unfolding itself singly at the will of an eternal arbiter the philosopher first admits the exercise of smell to his frankenstein and enumerates the mental faculties which might be expected to be set in operation under the changing impressions made upon that one sense the other senses are imparted to it in turn one by one each adding a new group of ideas to the previous stock until at length the mental equipment is complete  we may see the extent of the resemblance between condillacs statue and diderots muet de convention but diderot at least is free from the charge of borrowing condillacs book was published three years 1754 after the letter on the deaf and dumb and he afterwards wrote a pamphlet defending himself from the charge of having taken the fancy of his statue from diderot nor for that matter did diderot ever make sign or claim in the matter we have already spoken of the relations between the two philosophers and though it is a mistake to describe diderot as one of condillacs most celebrated pupils77 yet there is just as little reason to invert the connection or to doubt condillacs own assertion that the statue was suggested to him by mademoiselle ferrand that remarkable woman to whose stimulating and directing influence he always professed such deep obligation attention has been called to the fact that in 1671 a parisian bookseller published a latin version of a much more intelligent and scientific fancy than the statuethe philosophus autodidactus of the arabian ibn tophail this was a romance in which a human being is suckled by a gazelle on a desert island in the tropics and grows up in the manner of some robinson crusoe with a turn for psychological speculation and gradually becomes conscious through observation of the peculiar properties belonging to his senses78  of the part of the letter that concerns gesture one can only say that it appears astonishingly crude to those who know the progress that has been made since diderots time in collecting and generalising the curious groups of fact connected with gesturelanguage we can imagine the eager interest that diderot would have had in such curious observations as that gesturelanguage has something like a definite syntax that it furnishes no means of distinguishing causation from sequence or simultaneity that savages can understand and be understood with ease and certainty in a deafanddumb school79 diderot was acute enough to see that the questions of language could only be solved not by the old metaphysical methods but experientially for the experiential method in this matter the time was not ripe it was no wonder then that after a few pages he broke away and hastened to æsthetics   iii  penalties on the publication of heretical opinion did not cease in england with the disappearance of the licensing act but they were at least inflicted by law it was the court of kings bench which in 1730 visited woolston with fine and imprisonment after all the forms of a prosecution had been duly gone through it was no bishops court nor star chamber much less a warrant signed by george the third or by bute which in 1762 condemned peter annet to the pillory and the gaol for his free inquirer the only evil which overtook mandeville for his fable of the bees was to be harmlessly presented 1723 as a public nuisance by the grand jury of middlesex we may contrast with this the state of things which prepared a revolution in france  one morning in july 1749almost exactly forty years before that july of 89 so memorable in the annals of arbitrary government and state prisonsa commissary of police and three attendants came to diderots house made a vigorous scrutiny of his papers and then produced a warrant for his detention the philosopher without any ado told his wife not to expect him home for dinner stepped into the chaise and was driven off with his escort to vincennes his real offence was a light sneer in the letter on the blind at the mistress of a minister80 the atheistical substance of the essay however apart from the pique of a favourite would have given sufficiently good grounds for a prosecution in england and in france for that vile substitute for prosecution the lettredecachet and there happened to be special causes for harshness towards the press at this moment verses had been published satirising the king and his manner of life in bitter terms and a stern raid was made upon all the scribblers in paris at the court there had just taken place one of those reactions in favour of the ecclesiastical party which for thirty years in the court history alternated so frequently with movements in the opposite direction the gossip of the town set down diderots imprisonment to a satire against the jesuits of which he was wrongly supposed to be the author81 it is not worth while to seek far for a reason when authority was as able and as ready to thrust men into gaol for a bad reason as for a good one the writer or the printer of a philosophical treatise was at this moment looked upon in france much as a magistrate now looks on the wretch who vends infamous prints  the lieutenant of police berryer treated the miserable author with additional severity for stubbornly refusing to give up the name of the printer diderot was well aware that the printer would be sent to the galleys for life if the lieutenant of police could once lay hands upon him this personage we may mention was afterwards raised to the dignified office of keeper of the seals as a reward for his industry and skill in providing victims for the royal seraglio at versailles82 the man who had ventured to use his mind was thrown into the dungeon at vincennes by the man who played spy and pander for the pompadour the official record of a dialogue between berryer and denis diderot of the catholic apostolic and roman religion is a singular piece of reading if we remember that the prisoners answers were made after oath taken by the respondent to speak and answer the truth  interrogated if he has not composed a work entitled letters on the blind  answered no  interrogated by whom he had caused said work to be printed  answered that he had not caused the said work to be printed  interrogated if he knows the name of the author of the said work  answered that he knows nothing about it  interrogated whether he has not had said work in manuscript in his possession before it was printed  answered that he had not had the said manuscript in his possession before or after it was printed  interrogated whether he has not composed a work which appeared some years ago entitled philosophic thoughts  answered no  and so after a dozen more replies of equal veracity on reading being made to the respondent of the present interrogatory diderot said that the answers contain the truth persisted in them and signed as witness his hand a sorrowful picture indeed of the plight of an apostle of a new doctrine on the other hand the apostle of the new doctrine was perhaps good enough for the preachers of the old two years before this the priest of the church of saint médard had thought it worth while to turn spy and informer this is the report which the base creature sent to the lieutenant of police 1747       diderot a man of no profession living etc is a young man      who plays the freethinker and glories in impiety he is the      author of several works of philosophy in which he attacks      religion his talk is like his books he is busy at the      composition of one now which is very dangerous  the priests delation was confirmed presently by a still lower agent of authority who in bad grammar and bad spelling describes this wretch diderot as a very dangerous man who speaks of the holy mysteries of our religion with contempt who corrupts manners and who says that when he comes to the last moment of his life he will have to do like others will confess and will receive what we call our god but it will only be for the sake of his family83  all these things had prepared an unfriendly fate for diderot when his time at last came as it came to most of his friends for a month he was cut off from the outer world his only company was the paradise lost which he happened to have in his pocket at the moment of his arrest he compounded an ink for himself by scraping the slate at the side of his window grinding it very fine and mixing with wine in a broken glass a toothpick found by happy accident in the pocket of his waistcoat served him for pen and the flyleaves and margins of the milton made a repository for his thoughts with a simple but very characteristic interest in others who might be as unfortunate as himself he wrote upon the walls of his prison his short recipe for writing materials84 diderot might easily have been buried here for months or even years but as it happened the governor of vincennes was a kinsman of voltaires divine emily the marquise du châtelet when voltaire who was then at luneville heard of diderots illfortune he proclaimed as usual his detestation of a land where bigots can shut up philosophers under lock and key and as usual he at once set to work to lessen the wrong madame du châtelet was made to write to the governor praying him to soften the imprisonment of socratesdiderot as much as he could85 it was the last of her good deeds for she died in circumstances of grotesque tragedy in the following month sept 1749 and her husband her son voltaire and saint lambert alternately consoled and reproached one another over her grave diderot meanwhile had the benefit of her intervention he was transferred from the dungeon to the château was allowed to wander about the park on his parole and to receive visits from his friends one of the most impulsive of these friends was jean jacques their first meeting after diderots imprisonment has been described by rousseau himself in terms at which the phlegmatic will smilenot wisely for the manner of expressing emotion like all else is relative after three or four centuries of impatience i flew into the arms of my friend o indescribable moment he was not alone dalembert and the treasurer of the sainte chapelle were with him as i went in i saw no one but himself with a single hound and a cry i pressed his face close to mine i clasped him tightly in my arms without speaking to him save by my tears and sobs i was choking with tenderness and joy86 after this rousseau used to walk over to see him two or three times a week it was during one of these walks on a hot summer afternoon that he first thought of that memorable literary effort the essay against civilisation he sank down at the foot of a tree and feverishly wrote a page or two to show to his friend he tells us that but for diderots encouragement he should hardly have executed his design there is a story that it was diderot who first suggested to rousseau to affirm that arts and sciences had corrupted manners there is no violent improbability in this diderot for all the robustness and penetration of his judgment was yet often borne by his natural impetuosity towards the region of paradox his own curious and bold supplément au voyage de bougainville is entirely in the vein of rousseaus discourse on the superiority of primitive over civilised life prodigious sibyl of the eighteenth century cries michelet the mighty magician diderot he breathed out one day a breath lo there sprang up a manrousseau87 it is hard to believe that such an astonishing genius for literature as rousseaus could have lain concealed after he had once inhaled the vivifying air of paris yet the fire and inspiring energy of diderot may well have been the quickening accident that brought his genius into productive life all the testimony goes to show that it was so whether however diderot is really responsible for the perverse direction of rousseaus argument is a question of fact and the evidence is not decisive88 it would be an odd example of that giants nonchalance which is always so amazing in diderot if he really instigated the most eloquent and passionate writer then alive to denounce art and science as the scourge of mankind at the very moment when he was himself straining his whole effort to spread the arts and sciences and to cover them with glory in mens eyes  among diderots other visitors was madame de puisieux one day she came clad in gay apparel bound for a merrymaking at a neighbouring village diderot conceiving jealous doubts of her fidelity received assurance that she would be solitary and companionless at the feast thinking mournfully of her persecuted philosopher lying in prison she forgot that one of the parents of philosophy is curiosity and that diderot had trained himself in the school of the sceptics that evening he scaled the walls of the park of vincennes flew to the scene of the festival and there found what he had expected in vain for her had he written upon virtue and merit and the unhallowed friendship came to an end  after three months of captivity diderot was released the booksellers who were interested in the encyclopædia were importunate with the authorities to restore its head and chief to an enterprise that stirred universal curiosity89 for the first volume of that famous work was now almost ready to appear and expectation was keen the idea of the book had occurred to diderot in 1745 and from 1745 to 1765 it was the absorbing occupation of his life of the value and significance of the conception underlying this immense operation i shall speak in the next chapter there also i shall describe its history the circumstances under which these fiveandthirty volumes were given to the world mark diderot for one of the few true heroes of literature they called into play some of the most admirable of human qualities they required a laboriousness as steady and as prolonged a wariness as alert a grasp of plan as firm a fortitude as patient unvarying and unshaken as men are accustomed to applaud in the engineer who constructs some vast and difficult work or the commander who directs a hardy and dangerous expedition     chapter v  the encyclopÆdia   the history of the encyclopædic conception of human knowledge is a much more interesting and important object of inquiry than a list of the various encyclopædic enterprises to be found in the annals of literature yet it is proper here to mention some of the attempts in this direction which preceded our memorable book of the eighteenth century it is to aristotle no doubt that we must look for the first glimpse of the idea that human knowledge is a totality whose parts are all closely and organically connected with one another but the idea that only dawned in that gigantic understanding was lost for many centuries the compilations of pliny are not in a right sense encyclopædic being presided over by no definite idea of informing order it was not until the later middle age that any attempt was made to present knowledge as a whole albertus magnus the ape of aristotle 11931280 left for a season the three great questions of the existence of universals of the modes of the existence of species and genus and of their place in or out of the bosom of the individuals and executed a compilation of such physical facts as had been then discovered90 a more distinctly encyclopædic work was the book of vincent de beauvais d 1264 called speculum naturale morale doctrinale et historialea compilation from aquinas in some parts and from aristotle in others hallam mentions three other compilations of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and observes that their laborious authors did not much improve the materials which they had amassed in their studies though they sometimes arranged them conveniently in the mediæval period as he remarks the want of capacity to discern probable truths was a very great drawback from the value of their compilations91  far the most striking production of the thirteenth century in this kind was the opus majus of roger bacon 1267 of which it has been said that it is at once the encyclopædia and the novum organum of that age92 at once a summary of knowledge and the suggestion of a truer method this however was merely the introductory sketch to a vaster encyclopædic work the compendium philosophiæ which was not perfected in common with minds of great and comprehensive grasp his vivid perception of the intimate relationship of the different parts of philosophy and his desire to raise himself from the dead level of every individual science induced bacon to grasp at and embrace the whole93 in truth the encyclopædic spirit was in the air throughout the thirteenth century it was the century of books bearing the significant titles of summa or universitas or speculum  the same spirit revived towards the middle of the sixteenth century in 1541 a book was published at basel by one ringelberg which first took the name of cyclopædia that has since then become so familiar a word in western europe this was followed within sixty years by several other works of the same kind the movement reached its height in a book which remained the best in its order for a century a german one jh alsted 15881638 published in 1620 an encyclopædia scientiarum omnium a hundred years later the illustrious leibnitz pronounced it a worthy task to perfect and amend alsteds book what was wanting to the excellent man he said was neither labour nor judgment but material and the good fortune of such days as ours and leibnitz wrote a paper of suggestions for its extension and improvement94 alsteds encyclopædia is of course written in latin and he prefixes to it by way of motto the celebrated lines in which lucretius declares that nothing is sweeter than to dwell apart in the serene temples of the wise though he informs us in the preface that his object was to trace the outlines of the great latifundium regni philosophici in a single syntagma yet he really does no more than arrange a number of separate treatises or manuals and even dictionaries within the limits of a couple of folios as is natural to the spirit of the age in which he wrote great predominance is given to the verbal sciences of grammar rhetoric and formal logic and a verbal or logical division regulates the distribution of the matter rather than a scientific regard for its objective relations  for the true parentage however of the encyclopædia of diderot and dalembert it is unnecessary to prolong this list it was francis bacons idea of the systematic classification of knowledge which inspired diderot and guided his hand throughout if we emerge from this vast operation he wrote in the prospectus our principal debt will be to the chancellor bacon who sketched the plan of a universal dictionary of sciences and arts at a time when there were not so to say either arts or sciences this sense of profound and devoted obligation was shared by dalembert and was expressed a hundred times in the course of the work no more striking panegyric has ever been passed upon our immortal countryman than is to be found in the preliminary discourse95 the french encyclopædia was the direct fruit of bacons magnificent conceptions and if the efficient origin of the encyclopædia was english so did the occasion rise in england also  in 1727 ephraim chambers a westmoreland quaker published in london two folios entitled a cyclopædia or universal dictionary of the arts and sciences the idea of it was broad and excellent our view says chambers was to consider the several matters not only in themselves but relatively or as they respect each other both to treat them as so many wholes and as so many parts of some greater whole the compiler lacked the grasp necessary to realise this laudable purpose the book has however the merit of conciseness and is a singular monument of literary industry for it was entirely compiled by chambers himself it had a great success and though its price was high four guineas it ran through five editions in eighteen years on the whole however it is meagre and more like a dictionary than an encyclopædia such as alsteds for instance  some fifteen years after the publication of chamberss cyclopædia an englishman mills and a german sellius went to le breton with a project for its translation into french the bookseller obtained the requisite privilege from the government but he obtained it for himself and not for the projectors this trick led to a quarrel and before it was settled the german died and the englishman returned to his own country they left the translation behind them duly executed96 le breton then carried the undertaking to a certain abbé gua de malves gua de malves b 1712 seems to have been a man of a busy and ingenious mind he was the translator of berkeleys hylas and philonous of ansons voyages and of various english tracts on currency and political economy it is said that he first suggested the idea of a cyclopædia on a fuller plan97 but we have no evidence of this in any case the project made no advance in his hands the embarrassed bookseller next applied to diderot who was then much in need of work that should bring him bread his fertile and energetic intelligence transformed the scheme by an admirable intuition he divined the opportunity which would be given by the encyclopædic form of gathering up into a whole all that new thought and modern knowledge which existed as yet in unsystematic and uninterpreted fragments his enthusiasm fired le breton it was resolved to make chamberss work a mere startingpoint for a new enterprise of far wider scope  the old and learned daguesseau says michelet notwithstanding the pitiable the wretched sides of his character had two lofty sides his reform of the laws and a personal passion the taste and urgent need of universality a certain encyclopædic sense a young man came to him one day a man of letters living by his pen and somewhat under a cloud for one or two hazardous books that lack of bread had driven him to write yet this stranger of dubious repute wrought a miracle with bewilderment the old sage listened to him unrolling the gigantic scheme of a book that should be all books on his lips sciences were light and life it was more than speech it was creation one would have said that he had made these sciences and was still at work adding extending fertilising ever engendering the effect was incredible daguesseau a moment above himself forgot the old man received the infection of genius and became great with the greatness of the other he had faith in the young man and protected the encyclopædia98  a fresh privilege was procured jan 21 1746 and as le bretons capital was insufficient for a project of this magnitude he invited three other booksellers to join him retaining a half share for himself and allotting the other moiety to them as le breton was not strong enough to bear the material burdens of producing a work on so gigantic a scale as was now proposed so diderot felt himself unequal to the task of arranging and supervising every department of a book that was to include the whole circle of the sciences he was not skilled enough in mathematics nor in physics which were then for the most part mathematically conceived for that province he associated with himself as an editorial colleague one of the most conspicuous and active members of the philosophical party of this eminent man whose relations with diderot were for some years so intimate it is proper that we should say something  dalembert was the natural son of madame de tencin by whom he had been barbarously exposed immediately after his birth the true ancestors of a man of genius says condorcet finely upon this circumstance are the masters who have gone before him and his true descendants are disciples that are worthy of him he was discovered on a november night in the year 1717 by the beadle in a nearly dying condition on the steps of the church of st john the round from which he afterwards took his christian name an honest woman of the common people with that personal devotion which is less rare among the poor than among the rich took charge of the foundling the father who was an officer of artillery and brother of destouches the author of some poor comedies by and by advanced the small sums required to pay for the boys schooling dalembert proved a brilliant student unlike nearly every other member of the encyclopædic party he was a pupil not of the jesuits but of their rivals the jansenists recognised the keenness and force of their pupil and hoped that they had discovered a new pascal but he was less docile than his great predecessor in their ranks when his studies were completed he devoted himself to geometry for which he had a passion that nothing could extinguish for the old monastic vow of poverty chastity and obedience he adopted the manlier substitute of poverty truth and libertythe worthy device of every man of letters when he awoke in the morning he thought with delight of the work that had been begun the previous day and would occupy the day before him in the necessary intervals of his meditations he recalled the lively pleasure that he felt at the play at the play between the acts he thought of the still greater pleasure that was promised to him by the work of the morrow his mathematical labours led to valuable results in the principles of equilibrium and the movement of fluids in a new calculus and in a new solution of the problem of the precession of the equinoxes99  these contributions to what was then the most popular of the sciences brought him fame and fame brought him its usual distractions as soon as a writer has shown himself the possessor of gifts that may be of value to society then society straightway sets to work to seduce and hinder him from diligently exercising them dalembert resisted these influences steadfastly his means were very limited yet he could never be induced to increase them at the cost either of his social independence or of his scientific pursuits he lived for forty years under the humble roof of the poor woman who had treated him as a son you will never be anything better than a philosopher she used to cry reproachfully and what is a philosopher tis a madman who torments himself all his life that people may talk about him when he is dead dalembert zealously adhered to his destination frederick the great vainly tempted him by an offer of the succession to maupertuis as president of the academy of berlin although however he declined to accept the post he enjoyed all its authority and prerogative frederick always consulted him in filling up vacancies and making appointments it is a magnanimous trait in dalemberts history that he should have procured for lagrange a position and livelihood at berlin warmly commending him as a man of rare and superior genius although lagrange had vigorously opposed some of his own mathematical theories ten years after fredericks offer the other great potentate of the north catherine of russia besought him to undertake the education of the young grand duke her son but neither urgent flatteries and solicitations under the imperial hand nor the munificent offer of a hundred thousand francs a year availed to draw him away from his independence and his friends the great frederick used to compare him to one of those oriental monarchs who cherish a strict seclusion in order to enhance their importance and majesty he did not refuse a pension of some fifty pounds a year from berlin and the same amount was bestowed upon him from the privy purse at versailles he received a small annual sum in addition from the academy  though the mathematical sciences remained the objects of his special study dalembert was as free as the other great men of the encyclopædic school from the narrowness of the pure specialist he naturally reminds us of the remarkable saying imputed to leibnitz that he only attributed importance to science because it enabled him to speak with authority in philosophy and religion his correspondence with voltaire extending over the third quarter of the century is the most instructive record that we possess of the manysided doings of that busy time his series of éloges on the academicians who died between 1700 and 1772 is one of the most interesting works in the department of literary history he paid the keenest attention to the great and difficult art of writing translations from tacitus bacon and addison show his industry in a useful practice a long collection of synonyms bears witness to his fine discrimination in the use of words and the clearness precision and reserved energy of his own prose mark the success of the pains that he took with style he knew the secret have lofty sentiments he said and your manner of writing will be firm and noble100 yet he did not ignore the other side and half of the truth which is expressed in the saying of another important writer of that dayby taking trouble to speak with precision one gains the habit of thinking rightly condillac  like so many others to whom literature owes much dalembert was all his life fighting against bad health like voltaire and rousseau he was born dying and he remained delicate and valetudinarian to the end he had the mental infirmities belonging to his temperament he was restless impatient mobile susceptible of irritation when the young mademoiselle phlipon in after years famous as wife of the virtuous roland was taken to a sitting of the academy she was curious to see the author of the preliminary discourse to the encyclopædia but his small face and sharp thin voice made her reflect with some disappointment that the writings of a philosopher are better to know than his mask101 in everything except zeal for light and emancipation dalembert was the opposite of diderot where diderot was exuberant prodigal and disordered dalembert was a precisian difference of temperament however did not prevent their friendship from being for many years cordial and intimate when the encyclopædia was planned it was to dalembert as we have said that diderot turned for aid in the mathematical sciences where his own knowledge was not sufficiently full nor well grounded they were in strong and singular agreement in their idea of the proper place and function of the man of letters one of the most striking facts about their alliance and one of the most important facts in the history of the encyclopædia is that henceforth the profession of letters became at once definite and independent diderot and dalembert both of them remained poor but they were never hangerson they did not look to patrons nor did they bound their vision by versailles they were the first to assert the lawful authority of the new priesthood they revolted deliberately and in set form against the old system of suitorship and protection happy are men of letters wrote dalembert if they recognise at last that the surest way of making themselves respectable is to live united and almost shut up among themselves that by this union they will come without any trouble to give the law to the rest of the nation in all affairs of taste and philosophy that the true esteem is that which is awarded by men who are themselves worthy of esteem as if the art of instructing and enlightening men were not after the too rare art of good government the noblest portion and gift in human reach102  this consciousness of the power and exaltation of their calling which men of letters now acquired is much more than the superficial fact which it may at first seem to be it marked the rise of a new teaching order and the supersession of the old the highest moral ideas now belonged no longer to the clergy but to the writers no longer to official catholicism but to that fertilising medley of new notions about human knowledge and human society which then went by the name of philosophy what is striking is that the ideas sown by philosophy became eventually the source of higher life in catholicism if the church of the revolution showed something that we may justly admire it was because the encyclopædic band had involuntarily and inevitably imparted a measure of their own clearsightedness fortitude moral energy and spirit of social improvement to a church which was when they began their work an abominable burden on the spiritual life of the nation if the catholicism of chateaubriand of lamennais of montalembert was a different thing from the catholicism of a dubois or a rohan from the vile corruptions of the jesuits and the grovelling superstitions of the later jansenists it was the execrated freethinkers whom the church and mankind had to thank for the change the most enlightened catholic of today ought to admit that voltaire diderot rousseau were the true reformers of his creed they supplied it with ideas which saved it from becoming finally a curse to civilisation it was no christian prelate but diderot who burst the bonds of a paralysing dogma by the magnificent cry détruisez ces enceintes qui rétrécissent vos idées elargissez dieu103 we see the same phenomenon in our own day the christian churches are assimilating as rapidly as their formula will permit the new light and the more generous moral ideas and the higher spirituality of teachers who have abandoned all churches and who are systematically denounced as enemies of the souls of men sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes these transformations of religion by leavening elements contributed from a foreign doctrine are the most interesting process in the history of truth  the encyclopædia became a powerful engine for aiding such a transformation because it was this and because it rallied all that was then best in france round the standard of light and social hope we ought hardly to grudge time or pains to its history for it was not merely in the field of religious ideas that the encyclopædists led france in a new way they affected the national life on every side pressing forward with enlightened principles in all the branches of material and political organisation their union in a great philosophical band gave an impressive significance to their work the collection within a single set of volumes of a body of new truths relating to so many of the main interests of men invested the book and its writers with an aspect of universality of collective and organic doctrine which the writers themselves would without doubt have disowned and which it is easy to dissolve by tests of logic but the popular impression that the encyclopædists constituted a single body with a common doctrine and a common aim was practically sound comte has pointed out with admirable clearness the merit of the conception of an encyclopædic workshop104 it united the members of rival destructive schools in a great constructive task it furnished a rallyingpoint for efforts otherwise the most divergent their influence was precisely what it would have been if popular impressions had been literally true diderot and dalembert did their best to heighten this feeling they missed no occasion of fixing a sentiment of cooperation and fellowship they spoke of their dictionary as the transactions of an academy105 each writer was answerable for his own contribution but he was in the position of a member of some learned corporation to every volume until the great crisis of 1759 was prefixed a list of those who had contributed to it if a colleague died the public was informed of the loss that the work had sustained and his services were worthily commemorated in a formal éloge106 feuds epigrams and offences were not absent but on the whole there was steadfast and generous fraternity  as voltaire eloquently said officers of war by land and by sea magistrates physicians who knew nature men of letters whose taste purified knowledge geometers physicists all united in a work that was as useful as it was laborious without any view of interest without even seeking fame as many of them concealed their names finally without any common understanding and agreement and therefore without anything of the spirit of party107 turning over the pages on which the list of writers is inscribed we find in one place or another nearly every name that has helped to make the literature of the time famous montesquieu who died in the beginning of 1755 left behind him the unfinished fragment of an article on taste and it may be noticed in passing that our goodnatured diderot was the only man of letters who attended the remains of the illustrious writer to the grave108 the article itself though no more than a fragment has all the charms of montesquieus delightful style it is serious without pedantry graceful without levity and is rich in observations that are precise and pointed without the vice of emphasis the great turgot diligently solicitous for the success of every enterprise that promised to improve human happiness by adding to knowledge and spreading enlightenment wrote some of the most valuable articles that the work contained and his discussion of endowments perhaps still remains the weightiest contribution to that important subject oddly enough he was one of the very few writers who refused to sign his name to his contributions109 his assistance only ceased when he perceived that the scheme was being coloured by that spirit of sect which he always counted the worst enemy of the spirit of truth110 jean jacques rousseau who had just won a singular reputation by his paradoxes on natural equality and the corruptions of civilisation furnished the articles on music in the first half dozen volumes they were not free from mistakes but his colleagues chivalrously defended him by the plea of careless printing or indifferent copying111 the stately buffon very early in the history of the encyclopædia sent them an article upon nature and the editors made haste to announce to their subscribers the advent of so superb a colleague112 the articles on natural history however were left by buffon in his usual majestic fashion to his faithful lieutenant and squireatarms daubenton and even his own article seems not to have been printed before the eleventh volume appeared terrible storms had arisen not a few of the shipmen had parted company and buffon may well have been one of them certainly the article on nature as it stands can hardly be his  in the supplementary volumes which appeared in 1776ten years after the completion of the original undertakingtwo new labourers came into the vineyard whose names add fresh lustre and give still more serious value to the work one of these was the prince of the physiologists of the eighteenth century the great haller who contributed an elaborate history of those who had been his predecessors in unfolding the intricate mechanism of the human frame and analysing its marvels of complex function the other was the austere and generous condorcet ever loyal to good causes and resolute against despairing of the human commonwealth he began in the pages of the encyclopædia a career that was brilliant with good promise and high hopes and ended in the grim hall of the convention and a nobly tragic death amid the red storm of the terror  among the lesser stars in the encyclopædic firmament are some whose names ought not to be wholly omitted forbonnais one of the most instructive economic writers of the century contributed articles to the early volumes which were afterwards republished in his elements of commerce113 the lighthearted marmontel wrote cheerful articles on comedy eloges eclogues glory and other matters of literature and taste quesnai the eminent founder of the economic sect dealt with two agricultural subjects and reproduced both his theoretical paradoxes and his admirable practical maxims on the material prosperity of nations holbach not yet author of the memorable system of nature compiled a vast number of the articles on chemistry and mineralogy chiefly and avowedly from german sources he being the only writer of the band with a mastery of a language which was at that moment hardly more essential to culture than russian is now the name of duclos should not be passed over in the list of the foremost men who helped to raise the encyclopædic monument he was one of the shrewdest and most vigorous intelligences of the time being in the front rank of men of the second order his quality was coarse but this was only the effect of a thoroughly penetrating and masculine understanding his articles in the encyclopædia déclamation des anciens etiquette etc are not very remarkable but the reflections on conduct which he styled considérations sur les moeurs de ce siécle 1750 though rather hard in tone abound in an acuteness a breadth a soundness of perception that entitle the book to the rare distinction among the writings of moralists and social observers of still being worth reading morellet wrote upon some of the subjects of theology and his contributions are remarkable as being the chief examples in the record of the encyclopædic body of a distinctly and deliberately historic treatment of religion i let people see he wrote many years after that in such a collection as the encyclopædia we ought to treat the history and experience of the dogmas and discipline of the christian exactly like those of the religion of brahma or mahomet114 this sage and philosophic principle enabled him to write the article fils de dieu vol vi without sliding into arian nestorian socinian or other heretical view on that fantastic theme we need not linger over the names of other writers who indeed are now little more than mere shadows of names such as la condamine a scientific traveller of fame and merit in his day and generation of du marsais the povertystricken and unlucky scholar who wrote articles on grammar of the president des brosses who was unfortunate enough to be in the right in a quarrel about money with voltaire and who has since been better known to readers through the fury of the provoked patriarch than through his own meritorious contributions to the early history of civilisation  the name of one faithful worker in the building of this new jerusalem ought not to be omitted though his writings were multa non multum the chevalier de jaucourt 17041779 as his title shows was the younger son of a noble house he studied at geneva cambridge and leyden and published in 1734 a useful account of the life and writings of leibnitz when the encyclopædia was projected his services were at once secured and he became its slave from the beginning of a to the end of z he wrote articles in his own special subjects of natural history and physical science but he was always ready to lend his help in other departments in writing rewriting reading correcting and all those other humbler necessities of editorship of which the inconsiderate reader knows little and thinks less jaucourt revelled in this drudgery god made him for grinding articles said diderot for six or seven years he wrote one day jaucourt has been in the middle of half a dozen secretaries reading dictating slaving for thirteen or fourteen hours a day and he is not tired of it even now when he was told that the work must positively be brought to an end his countenance fell and the prospect of release from such happy bondage filled his heart with desolation115 if says diderot in the preface to the eighth volume 1765 we have raised a shout of joy like the sailor when he espies land after a sombre night that has kept him midway between sky and flood it is to m de jaucourt that we are indebted for it what has he not done for us especially in these latter times with what constancy has he not refused all the solicitations whether of friendship or of authority that sought to take him away from us never has sacrifice of repose of health of interest been more absolute and more entire116 these modest and unwearying helpers in good works ought not to be wholly forgotten in a commemoration of more farshining names  besides those who were known to the conductors of the encyclopædia was a host of unsought volunteers the further we proceed the editors announced in the preface to the sixth volume 1756 the more are we sensible of the increase both in matter and in number of those who are good enough to second our efforts they received many articles on the same subject they were constantly embarrassed by an emulation which however flattering as a testimony to their work obliged them to make a difficult choice or to lose a good article or to sacrifice one of their regular contributors or to offend some influential newcomer every one who had a new idea in his head or what he thought a new idea sent them an article upon it men who were priests or pastors by profession and unbelievers in their hearts sent them sheaves of articles in which they permitted themselves the delicious luxury of saying a little of what they thought women too pressed into the great work unknown ladies volunteered sprightly explanations of the technicalities of costume from the falbala which adorned the bottom of their skirts up to that little knot of riband in the hair which had come to replace the old appalling edifice of ten stories high in hierarchic succession of duchess solitary musketeer crescent firmament tenth heaven and mouse117 the oldest contributor was lenglet du fresnoy whose book on the method of studying history is still known to those who have examined the development of mens ideas about the relations of the present to the past lenglet was born in 1674 the youngest of the band was condorcet who was born nearly seventy years later 1743 one veteran morellet who had been the schoolmate of turgot and loménie de brienne lived to think of many things more urgent than faith fils de dieu and fundamentals he survived the revolution the terror the empire waterloo the restoration and died in 1819 within sight of the holy alliance and the peterloo massacre from the birth of lenglet to the death of morelletwhat an arc of the circle of western experience  no one will ask whether the keen eye and stimulating word and helpful hand of voltaire were wanting to an enterprise which was to awaken men to new love of tolerance enlightenment charity and justice voltaire was playing the refractory courtier at potsdam when the first two volumes appeared with characteristic vehemence he instantly pronounced it a work which should be the glory of france and the shame of its persecutors diderot and dalembert were raising an immortal edifice and he would gladly furnish them with a little stone here or there which they might find convenient to stuff into some corner or crevice in the wall he was incessant in his industry unlike those feebler and more consequential spirits the petitsmaîtres of thought by whom editors are harassed and hindered this great writer was as willing to undertake small subjects as large ones and to submit to all the mutilations and modifications which the exigencies of the work and the difficulties of its conductors recommended to them118 as the structure progresses his enthusiasm waxes warmer diderot and his colleague are cutting their wings for a flight to posterity they are atlas and hercules bearing a world upon their shoulders it is the greatest work in the world it is a superb pyramid its printingoffice is the office for the instruction of the human race and so forth in every phrase of stimulating sympathy and energetic interest nor does his sympathy blind him to faults of execution voltaires good sense and sound judgment were as much at the service of his friends in warning them of shortcomings as in eulogising what they achieved and he had good faith enough to complain to his friends instead of complaining of them in one place he tells them what is perfectly true that their journeymen are far too declamatory and too much addicted to substitute vague and puerile dissertations for that solid instruction which is what the reader of an encyclopædia seeks in another he remonstrates against certain frivolous affectations and some of the coxcombries of literary modishness everywhere he recommends them to insist on a firm and distinct method in their contributorsetymologies definitions examples reasons clearness brevity you are badly seconded he writes there are bad soldiers in the army of a great general119 i am sorry to see that the writer of the article hell declares that hell was a point in the doctrine of moses now by all the devils that is not true why lie about it hell is an excellent thing to be sure but it is evident that moses did not know it tis this world that is hell120  dalembert in reply always admitted the blemishes for which the patriarch and master reproached them but urged various pleas in extenuation he explains that diderot is not always the master either to reject or to prune the articles that are offered to him121 a writer who happened to be useful for many excellent articles would insist as the price of good work that they should find room for his bad work also and so forth no doubt we have bad articles in theology and metaphysics but with theologians for censors and a privilege i defy you to make them any better there are other articles that are less exposed to the daylight and in them all is repaired time will enable people to distinguish what we have thought from what we have said122 this last is a bitter and humiliating word but before any man hastens to cast a stone let him first make sure that his own life is free from every trace of hypocritical conformity and mendacious compliance condorcet seems to make the only remark that is worth making when he says that the true shame and disgrace of these dissemblings lay not with the writers whose only other alternative was to leave the stagnation of opinion undisturbed but with the ecclesiastics and ministers whose tyranny made dissimulation necessary and the veil imposed by authority did not really serve any purpose of concealment every reader was let into the secret of the writers true opinion of the old mysteries by means of a piquant phrase an adroit parallel a significant reference an equivocal word of dubious panegyric diderot openly explains this in the pages of the encyclopædia itself in all cases he says where a national prejudice would seem to deserve respect the particular article ought to set it respectfully forth with its whole procession of attractions and probabilities but the edifice of mud ought to be overthrown and an unprofitable heap of dust scattered to the wind by references to articles in which solid principles serve as a base for the opposite truths this way of undeceiving men operates promptly on minds of the right stamp and it operates infallibly and without any troublesome consequences secretly and without disturbance on minds of every description123 our fanatics feel the blows cried dalembert complacently though they are sorely puzzled to tell from which side they come124  it is one of the most deplorable things in the history of literature to see a man endowed with diderots generous conceptions and high social aims forced to stoop to these odious economies in reading his prospectus and still more directly in his article  encyclopédie we are struck by the beneficence and breadth of the great designs which inspire and support him the encyclopædia it has been said was no peaceful storehouse in which scholars and thinkers of all kinds could survey the riches they had acquired it was a gigantic siegeengine and armoury of weapons of attack125 this is only true in a limited sense of one part of the work and that not the most important part such a judgment is only possible for one who has not studied the book itself or else who is ignorant of the social requirements of france at the time we shall show this presently in detail meanwhile it is enough to make two observations the implements which the circumstances of the time made it necessary to use as weapons of attack were equally fitted for the acquisition in a happier season of those treasures of thought and knowledge which are the object of disinterested research and what is still more important we have to observe that it was the characteristic note and signal glory of the french revolutionary school to subordinate mere knowledge to the practical work of raising society up from the corruption and paralysis to which it had been brought by the double action of civil and ecclesiastical authority the efforts of the encyclopædists were not disinterested in the sense of being vague blows in the air their aim was not theory but practice not literature but life the encyclopædists were no doubt all men of battle and some of them were hardly more than mere partisans  but diderot at least had constantly in mind the great work which remained after the battle should be won he was profoundly conscious that the mere accumulation of knowledge of the directly physical facts of the universe would take men a very short way towards reconstruction and he struck the keynote in such admirable passages as this one consideration especially that we ought never to lose from sight is that if we ever banish a man or the thinking and contemplative being from above the surface of the earth this pathetic and sublime spectacle of nature becomes no more than a scene of melancholy and silence the universe is dumb the darkness and silence of the night take possession of it it is the presence of man that gives its interest to the existence of other beings and what better object can we set before ourselves in the history of these beings than to accept such a consideration why shall we not introduce man into our work in the same place which he holds in the universe why shall we not make him a common centre is there in infinite space any other point from which we can with greater advantage draw those immense lines that we propose to extend to all other points what a vivid and softening reaction must result between man and the beings by whom he is surrounded man is the single term from which we ought to set out and to which we ought to trace all back if we would please interest touch even in the most arid reflections and the driest details if you take away my own existence and the happiness of my fellows of what concern to me is all the rest of nature126  in this we hear the voice of the new time as we do in his exclamation that the perfection of an encyclopædia is the work of centuries centuries had to elapse before the foundations could be laid centuries would have to elapse before its completion mais à la posérité et À lÊtre qui ne meurt point127 these exalted ideas were not a substitute for arduous labour in all that diderot writes upon his magnificent undertaking we are struck by his singular union of common sense with elevation of simplicity with grasp of suppleness with strength of modesty with hopeful confidence on occasions that would have tempted a man of less sincerity and less seriousness to bombast and inflation his sense of the unavoidable imperfections of so vast a work always makes itself felt through his pride in its lofty aim and beneficent design the weight of the burden steadied him and the anxiety of the honest and laborious craftsman mastered the impulses of rhetoric  before going further into the general contents of the encyclopædia we shall briefly describe the extraordinary succession of obstacles and embarrassments against which its intrepid conductor was compelled to fight his way the project was fully conceived and its details worked out between 1745 and 1748 the encyclopedia was announced in 1750 in a prospectus of which diderot was the author at length in 1751 the first volume of the work itself was given to the public followed by the second in january 1752 the clerical party at once discerned what tremendous fortifications with how deadly an armament were rising up in face of their camp the jesuits had always been jealous of an enterprise in which they had not been invited to take a part they had expected at least to have the control of the articles on theology they now were bent on taking the work into their own hands and orthodoxy hastily set all the machinery of its ally authority in vigorous motion  the first attack was indirect an abbé de prades sustained a certain thesis in an official exercise at the sorbonne and diderot was suspected without good reason of being its true author an examination of its propositions was ordered it was pronounced pernicious dangerous and tending to deism chiefly on account of some too suggestive comparisons between the miraculous healings in the new testament and those ascribed in the more ancient legend to Æsculapius other grounds of vehement objection were found in the writers maintenance of the lockian theory of the origin of our ideas to deny the innateness of ideas was roundly asserted to be materialism and atheism the abbé de prades was condemned and deprived of his license jan 27 1752 as he was known to be a friend of diderot and was suspected of being the writer of articles on theology in the encyclopædia the design of the jesuit cabal in ruining de prades was to discredit the new undertaking and to induce the government to prohibit it their next step was to procure a pastoral from the archbishop of paris this document not only condemned the heretical propositions of de prades but referred in sombre terms to unnamed works teeming with error and impiety every one understood the reference and among its effects was an extension of the vogue and notoriety of the encyclopædia128 the jesuits were not allowed to retain a monopoly of persecuting zeal and the jansenists refused to be left behind in the race of hypocritical intrigue the bishop of auxerre who belonged to this party followed his brother prelate of paris in a more direct attack in which he included not only the encyclopædia but montesquieu and buffon de prades took to flight dalembert commended him to voltaire then at berlin the king was absent but voltaire gave royal protection to the fugitive until fredericks return de prades was then at once taken into favour and appointed reader to the king he proved but a poor martyr however for he afterwards retracted his heresies got a benefice and was put into prison by frederick for giving information to his french countrymen during the seven years war129 unfortunately neither orthodoxy nor heterodoxy has any exclusive patent for monopoly of rascals  meanwhile diderot wrote on his behalf an energetic and dignified reply to the aggressive pastoral this apology is not such a masterpiece of eloquence as the magnificent letter addressed by rousseau ten years later to the archbishop of paris after the pastoral against emilius but diderots vindication of de prades is firm moderate and closely argumentative the piece is worth turning to in our own day when great dignitaries of the churches too often show the same ignorance the same temerity and the same reckless want of charity as the bishop of auxerre showed a hundred and twenty years ago they resort to the very same fallacies by way of shield against scientific truths or philosophical speculations that happen not to be easily reconcilable with their official opinions i know nothing so indecent says diderot and nothing so injurious to religion as these vague declamations of theologians against reason one would suppose to hear them that men could only enter into the bosom of christianity as a herd of cattle enter into a stable and that we must renounce our common sense either to embrace our religion or to remain in it such principles as yours are made to frighten small souls everything alarms them because they perceive clearly the consequences of nothing they set up connections among things which have nothing to do with one another they spy danger in any method of arguing which is strange to them they float at hazard between truths and prejudices which they never distinguish and to which they are equally attached and all their life is passed in crying out either miracle or impiety in an eloquent peroration which is not more eloquent than it is instructive de prades is made to turn round on his jansenist censor and reproach him with the disturbance with which the intestine rivalries of jansenist and jesuit had afflicted the faithful it is the abominable testimony of your convulsions he cries that has overthrown the testimony of miracles it is the fatuous audacity with which your fanatics have confronted persecution that has annihilated the evidence of the martyrs it is your declamations against sovereign pontiffs against bishops against all the orders of the ecclesiastical hierarchy that have covered priest altar and creed with opprobrium if the pope the bishops the priests the simple faithful the whole church if its mysteries its sacraments its temples its ceremonies have fallen into contempt yours yours is the handiwork130  bourdaloue more than half a century before had taunted the freethinkers of his day with falseness and inconsistency in taking sides with the jansenists whose superstitions they notoriously held in open contempt the motive for the alliance was tolerably obvious the jansenists apart from their theology were above all else the representatives of opposition to authority it was for this that lewis xiv counted them worse than atheists the jesuits it has been well said in keeping down their enemies by force became the partisans of absolute government and upheld it on every occasion the jansenists after they had been crushed by violence began to feel to what excesses power might be brought from being speculative enemies to freedom as a theory they became through the education of persecution the partisans of freedom in practice the quarrel of molinists and jansenists from a question of theology grew into a question of human liberty131  circumstances had now changed the freethinkers were becoming strong enough to represent opposition to authority on their own principles and in their own persons diderots vigorous remonstrance with the bishop of auxerre incidentally marks for us the definite rupture of philosophic sympathy for the jansenist champions it is your disputatiousness he said which within the last forty years has made far more unbelievers than all the productions of philosophy as we cannot too clearly realise it was the flagrant social incompetence of the church which brought what they called philosophy that is to say liberalism into vogue and power lockes essay had been translated in 1700 but it had made no mark and as late as 1725 the first edition of the translation remained unsold it was the weakness and unsightly decrepitude of the ecclesiastics which opened the way for the thinkers  this victory however was not yet diderot had still a dismal wilderness to traverse he was not without secret friends even in the camp of his enemies  after his reply to peré berthiers attack on the prospectus he received an anonymous letter to the effect that if he wished to avenge himself on the jesuits there were both important documents and money at his command diderot replied that he was in no want of money and that he had no time to spare for jesuit documents132 he trusted to reason neither reason nor eloquence availed against the credit at court of the ecclesiastical cabal the sale of the second volume of the encyclopædia was stopped by orders which malesherbes was reluctantly compelled to issue a decree of the kings council feb 7 1752 suppressed both volumes as containing maxims hostile to the royal authority and to religion the publishers were forbidden to reprint them and the booksellers were forbidden to deliver any copies that might still be in hand the decree however contained no prohibition of the continuance of the work it was probably not meant to do anything more serious than to pacify the jesuits and lend an apparent justification to the officious pastorals of the great prelates some even thought that the aim of the government was to forestall severer proceedings on the part of the parliament of lawyers133 for corporations of lawyers have seldom been less bigoted or obstructive than corporations of churchmen nor were lawyers and priests the only foes even the base and despicable jealousies of booksellers counted for something in the storm134  a curious triumph awaited the harassed diderot  he was compelled under pain of a second incarceration to hand over to the authorities all the papers proofsheets and plates in his possession the jesuit cabal supposed that if they could obtain the materials for the future volumes they could easily arrange and manipulate them to suit their own purposes their ignorance and presumption were speedily confounded in taking diderots papers they had forgotten as grimm says to take his head and his genius they had forgotten to ask him for a key to articles which so far from understanding they with some confusion vainly strove even to decipher the government was obliged may 1752 to appeal to diderot and dalembert to resume a work for which their enemies had thus proved themselves incompetent yet by one of the meannesses of decaying authority the decree of three months before was left suspended over their heads135  the third volume of the encyclopædia appeared in the autumn of 1753 dalembert prefixed an introduction vindicating himself and his colleague with a manliness a sincerity a gravity a fire that are admirable and touching what he concluded can malignity henceforth devise against two men of letters trained long since by their meditations to fear neither injustice nor poverty who having learnt by a long and mournful experience not to despise but to mistrust and dread men have the courage to love them and the prudence to flee them after having been the stormy and painful occupation of the most precious years of our life this work will perhaps be the solace of its close may it when both we and our enemies alike have ceased to exist be a durable monument of the good intention of the one and the injustice of the other let us remember the fable of bocalina a traveller was disturbed by the importunate chirrupings of the grasshoppers he would fain have slain them every one but only got belated and missed his way he need only have fared peacefully on his road and the grasshoppers would have died of themselves before the end of a week136 a volume was now produced in each year until the autumn of 1757 and the issue of the seventh volume this brought the work down to gyromancy and gythiuin then there arose storms and divisions which marked a memorable epoch alike in the history of the book in the life of diderot and others and in the thought of the century the progress of the work in popularity during the five years between 1752 and 1757 had been steady and unbroken the original subscribers were barely two thousand when the fourth volume appeared there were three thousand the seventh volume found nearly a thousand more137 such prodigious success wrought the chagrin of the party of superstition to fever heat as each annual volume came from the press and found a wider circle of readers than its predecessor their malice and irritation waxed a degree more intense they scattered malignant rumours abroad they showered pamphlets no imputation was too odious or too ridiculous for them diderot dalembert voltaire rousseau buffon were declared to have organised a league of writers with the deliberate purpose of attacking the public tranquillity and overthrowing society they were denounced as heads of a formal conspiracy a clandestine association a midnight band united in a horrible community of pestilent opinions and sombre interests  in the seventh volume an article appeared which made the ferment angrier than it had ever been dalembert had lately been the guest of voltaire at ferney whence he had made frequent visits to geneva in his intercourse with the ministers of that famous city he came to the conclusion that their religious opinions were really socinian and when he wrote the article on geneva he stated this he stated it in such a way as to make their heterodox opinions a credit to genevese pastors because he associated disbelief in the divinity of jesus christ in mysteries of faith and in eternal punishment with a practical life of admirable simplicity purity and tolerance each line of this eulogy on the socinian preachers of geneva veiled a burning and contemptuous reproach against the cruel and darkened spirit of the churchmen in france jesuit and jansenist loose abbès and debauched prelates felt the quivering of the arrow in the quick as they read that the morals of the genevese pastors were exemplary that they did not pass their lives in furious disputes upon unintelligible points that they brought no indecent and persecuting accusation against one another before the civil magistrate there was gall and wormwood to the orthodox bigot in the harmless statement that hell which is one of the principal articles of our belief has ceased to be one with many of the ministers of geneva it would be according to them a great insult to the divinity to imagine that this being so full of justice and goodness is capable of punishing our faults by an eternity of torment they explain in as good a sense as they can the formal passages of scripture which are contrary to their opinion declaring that we ought never in the sacred books to take anything literally that seems to wound humanity and reason and we may be sure that dalembert was thinking less of the consistory and the great council of geneva than of the priests and the parliament of paris when he praised the protestant pastors not only for their tolerance but for confining themselves within their proper functions and for being the first to set an example of submission to the magistrates and the laws the intention of this elaborate and reasoned account of the creed and practice of a handful of preachers in a heretical town could not be mistaken by those at whom it was directed it produced in the black ranks of official orthodoxy fully as angry a shock as its writer could have designed  the church had not yet we must remember borrowed the principles of humanity and tolerance from atheists it was not the comparatively purified christian doctrine of our own time with which the encyclopædists did battle but an organised corporation with exceptional tribunals with special material privileges with dungeons and chains at their disposal we have to realise that official religion was then a strange union of byzantine decrepitude with the energetic ferocity of the holy office within five years of this indirect plea of dalembert for tolerance and humanity calas was murdered by the orthodoxy of toulouse nearly ten years later 1766 we find lewis xv with the steam of the parc aux cerfs about him rewarded by the loyal acclamations of a parisian crowd for descending from his carriage as a priest passed bearing the sacrament and prostrating himself in the mud before the holy symbol138 in the same year the youth la barre was first tortured then beheaded then burnt for some presumed disrespect to the same holy symbolthen become the hateful ensign of human degradation of fanatical cruelty of rancorous superstition yet i should be sorry to be unjust it is to be said that even in these bad days when religion meant cruelty and cabal the one or two men who boldly withstood to the face the king and the pompadour for the vileness of their lives were priests of the church  dalemberts article hardly goes beyond what to us seem the axioms of all men of sense we must remember the time even members of the philosophic party itself like grimm thought the article misplaced and hardy139 the genevese ministers indignantly repudiated the compliment of socinianism and the eulogy of being rather less irrational than their neighbours voltaire read and read again with delight and plied the writer with reiterated exhortations in every key not to allow himself to be driven from the great work by the raging of the heathen and the vain imaginings of the people140  while the storm seemed to be at its height an incident occurred which let loose a new flood of violent passion helvétius published that memorable book in which he was thought to have told all the world its own secret his de lesprit came out in 1758141 it provoked a general insurrection of public opinion the devout and the heedless agreed in denouncing it as scandalous licentious impious and pregnant with peril the philosophic party felt that their ally had dealt a sore blow to liberty of thought and the free expression of opinion philosophy said grimm by philosophy as i have said meaning liberalism will long feel the effect of the rising of opinion which this author has caused by his book and for having described too freely a morality that is bad and false in itself m helvétius will have to reproach himself with all the restraints that are now sure to be imposed on the few men of lofty genius who still are left to us whose destiny was to enlighten their fellows and to spread truth over the earth142  at the beginning of 1759 the procureurgénéral laid an information before the court against helvétiuss book against half a dozen minor publications and finally against the encyclopædia the de lesprit was alleged to be a mere abridgment of the encyclopædia and the encyclopædia was denounced as being the opprobrium of the nation by its impious maxims and its hostility to morals and religion the court appointed nine commissaries to examine the seven volumes suspending their further sale or delivery in the meanwhile when the commissaries sent in their report a month later the parliament was dissatisfied with its tenour and appointed four new examiners two of them being theologians and two of them lawyers before the new censors had time to do their work the council of state interposed with an arbitrary decree march 1759 suppressing the privilege which had been conceded in 1746 prohibiting the sale of the seven volumes already printed and the printing of any future volumes under pain of exemplary punishment143 the motive for this intervention has never been made plain one view is that the kings government resented the action of the law courts and that the royal decree was only an episode in the quarrel then raging between the crown and the parliaments another opinion is that malesherbes or choiseul was anxious to please the dauphin and the jesuit party at versailles the most probable explanation is that the authorities were eager to silence one at least of the three elements of opposition the jansenists the lawyers and the philosopherswho were then distracting the realm the two former were beyond their direct reach they threw themselves upon the foe who happened to be most accessible  the government however had no intention of finally exterminating an enemy who might at some future day happen to be a convenient ally they encouraged or repressed the philosophers according to the political calculations of the moment sometimes according to the caprices of the kings mistress or even a ministers mistress when the clergy braved the royal authority the hardiest productions were received with indulgence if the government were reduced to satisfy the clergy then even the very commonplaces of the new philosophy became ground for accusation the encyclopædia was naturally exposed in a special degree to such alternations of favour and suspicion144 the crisis of 1759 furnishes a curious illustration of this as we have seen in the spring of that year the privilege was withdrawn from the four associated booksellers and the continuance of the work strictly prohibited yet the printing was not suspended for a week fifty compositors were busily setting up a book which the ordinance of the government had decisively forbidden under heavy penalties  the same kind of connivance was practised to the advantage of other branches of the opposition thirty years before this the organ of the jansenist party was peremptorily suppressed the police instituted a rigorous search and seized the very presses on which the nouvelles ecclésiastiques was being printed but the journal continued to appear and was circulated just as regularly as before145  the history of the policy of authority towards the encyclopædia is only one episode in the great lesson of the reign of lewis xv it was long a common mistake to think of this kings system of government as violent and tyrannical in truth its failure and confusion resulted less from the arbitrariness of its procedure than from the hopeless absence of tenacity conviction and consistency in the substance and direction of its objects and this again was the result partly of the complex and intractable nature of the opposition with which successive ministers had to deal and partly of the overpowering strength of those asiatic maxims of government which richelieu and lewis xiv had invested with such ruinous prestige the impatience and charlatanry of emotional or pseudoscientific admirers of a personal system blind them to the permanent truth of which the succession of the decrepitude of lewis xv to the strength of his greatgrandfather and of the decrepitude of napoleon iii to the strength of his uncle are only illustrations  the true interest of all these details about a mere book lies in the immense significance of the movement of political ideas and forces to which they belong the true interest of all history lies in the spectacle which it furnishes of the growth and dissolution the shock and the transformation incessantly at work among the great groups of human conceptions the decree against the encyclopædia marks the central moment of a collision between two antagonistic conceptions which disputed and in france still dispute with one another the shaping and control of institutions one of these ideas is the exclusion of political authority from the sphere and function of directing opinion it implies the absolute secularisation of government the rival idea prompted the massacre of st bartholomew the dragonnades the revocation of the edict of nantes and all the other acts of the same policy which not only deprived france of thousands of the most conscientious and most ingenious of her sons but warped and corrupted the integrity of the national conscience it is natural that we should feel anger at the arbitrary attempt to arrest diderots courageous and enlightened undertaking yet in truth it was only the customary inference from an accepted principle that it is the business or the right of governments to guide thought and regulate its expression the jesuits acted on this theory and resorted to repressive power and the secular arm whenever they could the jansenists repudiated the principle but eagerly practised it whenever the turn of intrigue gave them the chance  an extraordinary and unforeseen circumstance changed the external bearings of this critical conflict of ideas the conception of the duties of the temporal authority in the spiritual sphere had been associated hitherto with catholic doctrine the decay of that doctrine was rapidly discrediting the conception allied with it but the movement was interrupted and it was interrupted by a man who suddenly stepped out from the ranks of the encyclopædists themselves rousseau from his solitary cottage at montmorency 1758 fulminated the celebrated letter to dalembert on stage plays the article on geneva in the seventh volume of the encyclopædia had not only praised the pastors for their unbelief it also assailed the timehonoured doctrine of the churches that the theatre is an institution from hell and an invention of devils dalembert paid a compliment to his patriarch and master at ferney as well as shot a bolt at his ecclesiastical foes in paris by urging the people of geneva to shake off irrational prejudices and straightway to set up a playhouse rousseau had long been brooding over certain private grievances of his own against diderot the dreary story has been told by me before and happily need not be repeated146 he took the occasion of dalemberts mischievous suggestion to his native geneva not merely to denounce the drama with all the force and eloquence at his command but formally to declare the breach between himself and diderot from this moment he treated the holbachiansso he contemptuously styled the encyclopædistsas enemies of the human race and disseminators of the deadliest poisons  this was no mere quarrel of rival authors it marked a fundamental divergence in thought and proclaimed the beginning of a disastrous reaction in the very heart of the school of illumination among the most conspicuous elements of the reaction were these the subordination of reason to emotion the displacement of industry science energetic and manysided ingenuity by dreamy indolence and finally what brings us back to our startingpoint the suppression of opinions deemed to be antisocial by the secular arm the old idea was brought back in a new dress the absolutist conception of the function of authority associated with a theistic doctrine unfortunately for france rousseaus idea prospered and ended by vanquishing its antagonist the reason is plain rousseaus idea exactly fitted in with the political traditions and institutions of the country it was more easily and directly compatible than was the contending idea with that temper and set of mens minds which tradition and institutions had fixed so disastrously deep in the national character  the crisis of 175859 then is a date of the highest importance it marks a collision between the old principle of lewis xiv of the bartholomew massacre of the revocation of the edict of nantes and the new rationalistic principle of spiritual emancipation the old principle was decrepit it was no longer able to maintain itself the hounds were furious but their fury was toothless before the new principle could achieve mastery rousseau had made mastery impossible two men came into the world at this very moment whom destiny made incarnations of the discordant principles danton and robespierre were both born in 1759 diderot seems to have had a biblical presentiment says michelet we feel that he saw beyond rousseau something sinister a spectre of the future diderotdanton already looks in the face of rousseaurobespierre147  a more vexatious incident now befell the alldaring allenduring diderot than either the decree of the council or the schism of the heresiarch at montmorency dalembert declared his intention of abandoning the work and urged his colleague to do the same his letters to voltaire show intelligibly enough how he brought himself to this resolution i am worn out he says with the affronts and vexations of every kind that this work draws down upon us the hateful and even infamous satires which they print against us and which are not only tolerated but protected authorised applauded nay actually commanded by the people with power in their hands the sermons or rather the tocsins that are rung against us at versailles in the presence of the king nemine reclamante the new intolerable inquisition that they are bent on practising against the encyclopædia by giving us new censors who are more absurd and more intractable than could be found at goa all these reasons joined to some others drive me to give up this accursed work once for all he cared nothing for libels or stinging pamphlets in themselves but libels permitted or ordered by those who could instantly have suppressed them were a different thing especially when they vomited forth the vilest personalities he admitted that there were other reasons why he was bent on retiring and it would appear that one of these reasons was dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements of the booksellers148  voltaire for some time remonstrated against this retreat before the hated infâme at length his opinion came round to dalemberts reiterated assertions of the shame and baseness of men of letters subjecting themselves to the humiliating yoke of ministers priests and police voltaire wrote to diderot protesting that before all things it was necessary to present a firm front to the foe it would be atrocious weakness to continue the work after dalembert had quitted it it was monstrous that such a genius as diderot should make himself the slave of booksellers and the victim of fanatics must this dictionary he asked which is a hundred times more useful than bayles be fettered with the superstition which it should annihilate must they make terms with scoundrels who keep terms with none could the enemies of reason the persecutors of philosophers the assassins of our kings still dare to lift up their voices in such a century as that men are on the eve of a great revolution in the human mind and it is you to whom they are most of all indebted for it149  more than once voltaire entreated diderot to finish his work in a foreign country where his hands would be free no said diderot in a reply of pathetic energy to abandon the work is turning our back upon the breach and to do precisely what the villains who persecute us desire if you knew with what joy they have learnt dalemberts desertion it is not for us to wait until the government have punished the brigands to whom they have given us up is it for us to complain when they associate with us in their insults men who are so much better than ever we shall be what ought we to do then do what becomes men of couragedespise our foes follow them up and take advantage as we have done of the feebleness of our censors if dalembert resumes and we complete our work is not that vengeance enough after all this you will believe that i cling at any price to the encyclopædia and you will be mistaken my dear master i am over forty i am tired out with tricks and shufflings i cry from morning till night for rest rest and scarcely a day passes when i am not tempted to go and live in obscurity and die in peace in the depths of my old country there comes a time when all ashes are mingled then what will it boot me to have been voltaire or diderot or whether it is your three syllables or my three syllables that survive one must work one must be useful one owes an account of ones gifts etcetera etcetera be useful to men is it quite clear that one does more than amuse them and that there is much difference between the philosopher and the fluteplayer they listen to one or the other with pleasure or disdain and remain what they were the athenians were never wickeder than in the time of socrates and perhaps all that they owe to his existence is a crime the more that there is more spleen than good sense in all this i admitand back i go to the encyclopædia150  thus for seven years the labour of conducting the vast enterprise fell upon diderot alone he had not only to write articles upon the most exhausting and various kinds of subjects he had also to distribute topics among his writers to shape their manuscripts to correct proofsheets to supervise the preparation of the engravings to write the text explanatory of them and all this amid constant apprehension and alarm from the government and the police he would have been free from persecution at lausanne or at leyden the two great sovereigns of the north who thought it part of the trade of a king to patronise the new philosophy offered him shelter at petersburg or berlin151  but how could he transport to the banks of the neva or the spree his fifty skilled compositors his crafty engravers on copperplate and all the host of his industrial army how could he find in those halfbarbarous lands the looms and engines and thousand cunning implements and marvellous processes which he had under his eye and ready to his hand in france and so he held fast to his post on the fifth floor of the house in the rue saint benoît a standing marvel to the world of letters for all time  as his toil was drawing to a close he suddenly received the most mortifying of all the blows that were struck at him in the course of his prolonged hazardous and tormenting adventure after the interruption in 1759 it was resolved to bring out the ten volumes which were still wanting in a single issue le breton was entrusted with the business of printing them the manuscript was set in type diderot corrected the proofsheets saw the revises and returned each sheet duly marked with his signature for the press at this point the nefarious operation of le breton began he and his foreman took possession of the sheets and proceeded to retrench cut out and suppress every passage line or phrase that appeared to them to be likely to provoke clamour or the anger of the government they thus of their own brute authority reduced most of the best articles to the condition of fragments mutilated and despoiled of all that had been most valuable in them the miscreants did not even trouble themselves to secure any appearance of order or continuity in these mangled skeletons of articles their murderous work done they sent the pages to the press and to make the mischief beyond remedy they committed all the original manuscripts and proofsheets to the flames one day when the printing was nearly completed 1764 diderot having occasion to consult an article under the letter s found it entirely spoiled he stood confounded an instants thought revealed the printers atrocity he eagerly turned to the articles on which he and his subordinates had taken most pains and found everywhere the same ravages and disorder the discovery says grimm threw him into a state of frenzy and despair which i shall never forget152 he wept tears of rage and torment in the presence of the criminal himself and before wife and children and sympathising domestics for weeks he could neither eat nor sleep for years he cried to le breton you have been basely cheating me you have massacred or got a brute beast to massacre the work of twenty good men who have devoted to you their time their talents their vigils from love of right and truth from the simple hope of seeing their ideas given to the public and reaping from them a little consideration richly earned which your injustice and thanklessness have now stolen from them for ever you and your book will be dragged through the mire you will henceforth be cited as a man who has been guilty of an act of treachery an act of vile hardihood to which nothing that has ever happened in this world can be compared then you will be able to judge your panic terror and the cowardly counsels of those barbarous ostrogoths and stupid vandals who helped you in the havoc you have made153  yet he remained undaunted to the very last his first movement to throw up the work and denounce le bretons outrage to the subscribers and the world was controlled his labour had lost its charm the monument was disfigured and defaced he never forgot the horrible chagrin and he never forgave the ignoble author of it but the last stone was at length laid in 1765 the subscribers received the concluding ten volumes of letterpress the eleven volumes of plates were not completed until 1772 the copies bore neufchâtel on the titlepage and were distributed privately the clergy in their assembly at once levelled a decree at the new book the parliament quashed this not from love of the book but from hatred of the clergy the government however ordered all who possessed the encyclopædia to deliver it over forthwith to the police eventually the copies were returned to their owners with some petty curtailments  voltaire has left us a vivacious picture of authority in grave consultation over the great engine of destruction with that we may conclude our account of its strange eventful history       a servant of lewis xv told me that one day the king his      master supping at trianon with a small party the talk      happened to turn first upon the chase and next on gunpowder      some one said that the best powder was made of equal parts of      saltpetre of sulphur and of charcoal the duke de la      vallière better informed maintained that to make good      gunpowder you required one part of sulphur and one of charcoal      to five parts of saltpetre       it is curious said the duke de nivernois that we should      amuse ourselves every day in killing partridges at versailles      and sometimes in killing men or getting ourselves killed on      the frontier without knowing exactly how the killing is      done       alas said madame de pompadour we are all reduced to that      about everything in the world i dont know how they compound      the rouge that i put on my cheeks and i should be vastly      puzzled if they were to ask me how they make my silk      stockings       tis a pity then said the duke de la vallière that his      majesty should have confiscated our encyclopædias which cost      us a hundred pistoles apiece we should soon find there an      answer to all our difficulties       the king justified the confiscation he had been warned that      oneandtwenty folios that were to be found on the      dressingtables of all the ladies were the most dangerous      thing in all the world for the kingdom of france and he meant      to find out for himself whether this were true or not before      letting people read the book when supper was over he sent      three lackeys for the book and they returned each with a good      deal of difficulty carrying seven volumes       it was then seen from the article powder that the duke de la      vallière was right and then madame de pompadour learnt the      difference between the old rouge of spain with which the      ladies of madrid coloured their faces and the rouge of the      ladies of paris she knew that the greek and roman ladies      were painted with the purple that came from the murex and      that therefore our scarlet is the purple of the ancients that      there was more saffron in the rouge of spain and more      cochineal in that of france       she saw how they made her stockings by loom and the machine      transported her with amazement       everyone threw himself on the volumes like the daughters of      lycomedes on the ornaments of ulysses every one immediately      found all he sought those who were at law were surprised to      see their affair decided the king read all about the rights      of his crown but upon my word he said i cant tell why      they spoke so ill of this book do you not see sire said      the duke de nivernois it is because the book is so good      people never cry out against what is mediocre or common in      anything if women seek to throw ridicule on a new arrival      she is sure to be prettier than they are       all this time they kept on turning over the leaves and the      count de c said aloudsire how happy you are that      under your reign men should be found capable of understanding      all the arts and transmitting them to posterity everything is      here from the way to make a pin down to the art of casting      and pointing your guns from the infinitely little up to the      infinitely great thank god for having brought into the world      in your kingdom the men who have done such good work for the      whole universe other nations must either buy the      encyclopædia or else they must pirate it take all my      property if you will but give me back my encyclopædia       yet they say replied the king that there are many faults      in this work necessary and admirable as it is       sire said the count de c there were at your supper      two ragouts which were failures we left them uneaten and yet      we had excellent cheer would you have had them throw all the      supper out of the window because of those two ragouts       envy and ignorance did not count themselves beaten the two      immortal sisters continued their cries their cabals their      persecutions what happened foreigners brought out four      editions of this french book which in france was proscribed      and they gained about 1800000 crowns154  in a monotonous world it is a pity to spoil a striking effect yet one must be vigilant it has escaped the attention of writers who have reproduced this lively scene that madame de pompadour was dead before the volumes containing powder and rouge were born the twentyone volumes were not published until 1765 and she died in the spring of the previous year but the substance of the story is probably true though voltaire has only made a slip in a name  as to the reference with which voltaire impatiently concludes we have to remember that the work was being printed at geneva as it came out in paris it was afterwards reprinted as a whole both at geneva 1777 and at lausanne 1778 an edition appeared at leghorn in 1770 and another at lucca in 1771 immediately after the completion of the encyclopædia there began to appear volumes of selections from it the compilers of these anthologies for instance of an esprit de lencydopédie published at geneva in 1768 were free from all intention of proselytising they meant only to turn a more or less honest penny by serving up in neat duodecimos the liveliest most curious and most amusing pieces to be found in the immense mass of the folios of the original  the encyclopædia of diderot though not itself the most prodigious achievement on which french booksellers may pride themselves yet inspired that achievement in 1782 panckouckea familiar name in the correspondence of voltaire and the voltairean familyconceived the plan of a methodical encyclopædia this colossal work which really consists of a collection of special cyclopædias for each of the special sciences was not completed until 1832 and comprises one hundred and sixtysix volumes of text with a score more volumes of plates it has no unity of doctrine no equal application of any set of philosophic principles and no definite social aim the only encyclopædia since 1772 with which i am acquainted that is planned with a view to the presentation of a general body of doctrine is the unfinished encyclopédie nuevelle of pìerre leroux and jean reynaud this work was intended to apply the socialistic and spiritualistic ideas of its authors over the whole field of knowledge and speculation the result is that it furnishes only a series of dissertations and is not an encyclopædia in the ordinary sense155  the booksellers at first spoke of the encyclopædia as an affair of two million livres it appeared however that its cost did not go much beyond one million one hundred and forty thousand livres the gross return was calculated to be nearly twice as much the price to the subscriber of the seven volumes up to 1757 of the ten volumes issued in 1765 and of the eleven volumes of plates completed in 1772 amounted to nine hundred and eighty livres156 or about fortythree pounds sterling of that date equivalent in value to more than three times the sum in money of today  the payment received by diderot is a little doubtful and the terms were evidently changed from time to time his average salary after dalembert had quitted him seems to have amounted to about three thousand livres or one hundred and thirty pounds sterling per annum this coincides with grimms statement that the total sum received by diderot was sixty thousand livres or about two thousand six hundred pounds sterling157 and to think cried voltaire when he heard of diderots humble wage that an army contractor makes twenty thousand livres a day voltaire himself had made a profit of more than half a million livres by a share in an army contract in the war of 1734 and his yearly income derived from such gains and their prudent investment was as high as seventy thousand livres representing in value a sum not far short of ten thousand pounds a year of our present money  ii   all writers on the movement of illumination in france in the eighteenth century call our attention to the quick transformation which took place after the middle of the century of a speculative or philosophical agitation into a political or social one readers often find some difficulty in understanding plainly how or why this metamorphosis was brought about the metaphysical question which men were then so fond of discussing whether matter can think appears very far removed indeed from the sphere of political conceptions the psychological question whether our ideas are innate or are solely given to us by experience through the sensations may strike the publicist as having the least possible to do with the type of a government or the aims of a community yet it is really the conclusions to which men come in this region that determine the quality of the civil sentiment and the significance of political organisation the theological doctors who persecuted de prades for suggestions of lockes psychology and for high treason against cartesianism were guided by a right instinct of selfpreservation de maistre by far the most acute and penetrating of the catholic school was never more clearsighted than when he made a vigorous and deliberate onslaught upon bacon the centre of his movement against revolutionary principles158  as we have said before the immediate force of speculative literature hangs on practical opportuneness it was not merely because bacon and hobbes and locke had written certain books that the encyclopædists who took up their philosophic succession inevitably became a powerful political party and multiplied their adherents in an increasing proportion as the years went on from various circumstances the attack acquired a significance and a weight in france which it had never possessed in england for one thing physical science had in the interval taken immense strides this both dwarfed the sovereignty of theology and theological metaphysics and indirectly disposed mens minds for nontheological theories of moral as well as of physical phenomena in france again the objects of the attack were inelastic and unyielding political speculation in england followed and did not precede political innovation and reform in france its light played round institutions which were too deeply rooted in absolutism and privilege to be capable of substantial modification deism was comparatively impotent against the church of england first because it was an intellectual movement and not a social one second because the constitutional doctrines of the church were flexible deism in the hands of its french propagators became connected with social liberalism because the catholic church in those days was identified with all the ideas of repression and the tendencies of deism in france grew more violently destructive not only because religious superstition was grosser but because that superstition was incorporated in a strong and inexpansible social structure  it would be a mistake wrote that sagacious and wellinformed observer dargenson so early as 1753 to attribute the loss of religion in france to the english philosophy which has not gained more than a hundred philosophers or so in paris instead of setting it down to the hatred against the priests which goes to the very last extreme all minds are turning to discontent and disobedience and everything is on the high road to a great revolution both in religion and in government and it will be a very different thing to that rude reformation a medley of superstition and freedom which came to us from germany in the sixteenth century as our nation and our century are enlightened in so very different a fashion they will go whither they ought to go they will banish every priest all priesthood all revelation all mystery this however only represents the destructive side of the vast change which dargenson then foresaw sixandthirty years before its consummation that change had also a constructive side if one of its elements was hate another and more important element was hope this constructive and reforming spirit which made its way in the intelligence of the leading men in france from 1750 to 1789 was represented in the encyclopædic confederation and embodied in their forty folios and to return to our first point it was directly and inseparably associated with the philosophy of bacon and locke what is the connection between their speculations and a vehement and energetic spirit of social reform we have no space here to do more than barely hint the line of answer  the broad features of the speculative revolution of which the encyclopædia was the outcome lie on the surface of its pages and cannot be mistaken the transition from descartes to newton meant the definite substitution of observation for hypothesis the exaltation of bacon meant the advance from supernatural explanations to explanations from experience the acceptance and development of the lockian psychology meant the reference of our ideas to bodily sensations and led men by what they thought a tolerably direct path to the identification of mind with functions of matter we need not here discuss the philosophical truth or adequateness of these ways of considering the origin and nature of knowledge or the composition of human character all that now concerns us is to mark their tendency that tendency clearly is to expel magic as the decisive influence among us in favour of ordered relations of cause and effect only to be discovered by intelligent search the universe began to be more directly conceived as a group of phenomena that are capable of rational and connected explanation then the wider the area of law the greater is mans consciousness of his power of controlling forces and securing the results that he desires objective interests and their conditions acquire an increasing preponderance in his mind on the other hand as the limits of science expand so do the limits of nescience become more definite the more we know of the universal order the more are we persuaded however gradually and insensibly that certain matters which men believed themselves to know outside of this phenomenal order are in truth inaccessible by those instruments of experience and observation to which we are indebted for other knowledge hence a natural inclination to devote our faculty to the forces within our control and to withdraw it from vain industry about forcesif they be forceswhich are beyond our control and beyond our apprehension thus man becomes the centre of the world to himself nature his servant and minister human society the field of his interests and his exertions the sensational psychology again whether scientifically defensible or not clearly tends to heighten our idea of the power of education and institutions upon character the more vividly we realise the share of external impressions in making men what they are the more ready we shall be to concern ourselves with external conditions and their improvement the introduction of the positive spirit into the observation of the facts of society was not to be expected until the cartesian philosophy with its reliance on inexplicable intuitions and its exaggeration of the method of hypothesis had been laid aside  diderot struck a keynote of difference between the old catholic spirit and the new social spirit between quietist superstition and energetic science in the casual sentence in his article on almshouses and hospitals it would be far more important to work at the prevention of misery than to multiply places of refuge for the miserable  it is very easy to show that the encyclopædists had not established an impregnable scientific basis for their philosophy anybody can now see that their metaphysic and psychology were imperfectly thought out the important thing is that their metaphysic and psychology were calculated notwithstanding all their superficialities to inspire an energetic social spirit because they were pregnant with humanistic sentiment to represent the encyclopædia as the gospel of negation and denial is to omit fourfifths of its contents men may certainly if they please describe it as merely negative work for example to denounce such institutions as examination and punishment by torture see question peine but if so what gospel of affirmation can bring better blessings159 if the metaphysic of these writers had been a thousandfold more superficial than it was what mattered that so long as they had vision for every one of the great social improvements on which the progress and even the very life of the nation depended it would be obviously unfair to say that reasoned interest in social improvement is incompatible with a spiritualistic doctrine but we are justified in saying that energetic faith in possibilities of social progress has been first reached through the philosophy of sensation and experience  in describing the encyclopædic movement as being among other things the development of political interest under the presiding influence of a humanistic philosophy we are using the name of politics in its widest sense the economic conditions of a country and the administration of its laws are far more vitally related to its wellbeing than the form of its government the form of government is indeed a question of the first importance but then this is owing in a paramount degree to the influence which it may have upon the other two sets of elements in the national life form of government is like the fashion of a mans clothes it may fret or may comfort him may be imposing or mean may react upon his spirits to elate or depress them in either case it is less intimately related to his welfare than the state of his blood and tissues in saying then that the encyclopædists began a political work what is meant is that they drew into the light of new ideas groups of institutions usages and arrangements which affected the real wellbeing and happiness of france as closely as nutrition affected the health and strength of an individual frenchman it was the encyclopædists who first stirred opinion in france against the iniquities of colonial tyranny and the abominations of the slave trade they demonstrated the folly and wastefulness and cruelty of a fiscal system that was eating the life out of the land they protested in season and out of season against arrangements which made the administration of justice a matter of sale and purchase they lifted up a strong voice against the atrocious barbarities of an antiquated penal code it was this band of writers organised by a harassed man of letters and not the nobles swarming round lewis xv nor the churchmen singing masses who first grasped the great principle of modern society the honour that is owed to productive industry they were vehement for the glories of peace and passionate against the brazen glories of war160  we are not to suppose that the encyclopædia was the originating organ of either new methods or new social ideas the exalted and peculiarly modern views about peace for instance were plainly inspired from the writings of the abbé saint pierre 16581743one of the most original spirits of the century who deserves to be remembered among other good services as the inventor of the word bienfaisance again in the mass of the political articles we feel the immense impulse that was given to sociological discussion by the esprit des lois few questions are debated here which montesquieu had not raised and none are debated without reference to montesquieus line of argument the change of which we are conscious in turning from the esprit des lois to the encyclopædia is that political ideas have been grasped as instruments philosophy has become patriotism the encyclopædists advanced with grave solicitude to the consideration of evils to which the redheeled parasites of versailles were insolently and incorrigibly blind  the articles on agriculture for example are admirable alike for the fulness and precision with which they expose the actual state of france for the clearness with which they trace its deplorable inadequateness back to the true sources and for the strong interest and sympathy in the subject which they both exhibit and inspire if now and again the touch is too idyllic it was still a prodigious gain to let the country know in a definite way that of the fifty million arpents of cultivable land in the realm more than one quarter lay either unbroken or abandoned and it was a prodigious gain to arouse the attention of the general public to the causes of the forced deterioration of french agriculture namely the restrictions on trade in grain the arbitrariness of the imposts and the flight of the population to the large towns then the demonstration corroborated in the pages of the encyclopædia by the two patriotic vaunts of contemporary english writers of the stimulus given to agriculture by our system of free exports contained one of the most useful lessons that the french had to learn  again there are some abuses which cannot be more effectively attacked than by a mere statement of the facts in the plainest and least argumentative terms the history of such an impost as the tax upon salt gabelle and a bold outline of the random and incongruous fashions in which it was levied were equivalent to a formal indictment it needed no rhetoric nor discussion to heighten the harsh injustice of the rule that persons who have changed domicile are still taxed for a certain time in the seat of their former abode namely farmers and labourers for one year and all other taxpayers for two years provided the parish to which they have removed is within the same district and if otherwise then farmers to pay for two years and other persons for three years taille thus a man under the given circumstances would have to pay double taxes for three years as a penalty for changing his dwelling we already hear the murmur of the cahiers of fiveandtwenty years later in the account of the transports of joy with which the citizens of lisieux saw the taille proportionelle established 1718 and how numerous other cities sent up prayers that the same blessing might be conferred on them reasons that it is not for us to divine caused the rejection of these demands so hard is it to do a good act which everybody talks about much more in order to seem to desire it than from any intention of really doing it to illustrate the advantages of this plan the impost of 1718 with all arrears for five years was discharged in twelve months without needless cost or dispute by an extravagance more proper than any other to degrade humanity the common happiness made malcontents of all that class whose prosperity depends on the misery of othersthat is the privileged class161  it is no innate factiousness as flighty critics of french affairs sometimes imply that has made civil equality the passion of modern france the root of this passion is an undying memory of the curse that was inflicted on its citizens morally and materially by the fiscal inequalities of the old régime the article privilegé urges the desirableness of inquiring into the grounds of the vast multitude of fiscal exemptions and of abolishing all that were no longer associated with the performance of real and useful service a bourgeois says the writer anticipating a cry that was so soon to ring through the land a bourgeois in comfortable circumstances and who could himself pay half of the taille of a whole parish if it were imposed in its due proportionon payment of the amount of his taxes for one or for two years and often for less without birth education or talents buys a place in a local salt office or some useless charge at court or in the household of some prince this man proceeds to enjoy in the public eye all the exemptions possessed by the nobility and the high magistracy from such an abuse of privileges spring two very considerable evils the poorer part of the citizens are always burdened beyond their strength though they are the most useful to the state since this class is composed of those who cultivate the land and procure a subsistence for the upper classes the other evil is that privileges disgust persons of education and talent with the idea of entering the magistracy or other professions demanding labour and application and lead them to prefer small posts and paltry offices and so forth with a gravity and moderation that were then common in political discussion in france it gradually disappeared in 1789 when it was found that the privileged orders even at that time in their cahiers steadily demanded the maintenance of every one of their most odious and iniquitous rights162  when it is said then that the encyclopædists deliberately prepared the way for a political revolution let us remember that what they really did was to shed the light of rational discussion on such practical grievances as even the most fatuous conservative in france does not now dream of bringing back  let us turn to two other of the most oppressive institutions that then scourged france first the corvée or feudal rule which forced every unprivileged farmer and peasant in france to furnish so many days labour for the maintenance of the highways arthur young tells us and the statement is confirmed by the minutes of turgot that this wasteful cruel and inefficient system was annually the ruin of many hundreds of persons and he mentions that no less than three hundred farmers were reduced to beggary in filling up a single vale in lorraine163 under this allimportant head the encyclopædia has an article that does not merely add to the knowledge of its readers by a history of the corvées but proceeds to discuss as in a pamphlet or review article the inconveniences of the prevailing system and presses schemes for avoiding them turgot had not yet shown in practice the only right substitute the article was printed in 1754 and it was not until ten years later that this great administrator then become intendant of the limousin did away in his district with compulsory personal service on the roads and required in its place a money payment assessed on the parishes164 the writer of the article in the encyclopædia does not anticipate this obviously rational plan but he paints a striking picture of the thousand abuses and miserable inefficiencies of the practice of corvées and his piece illustrates that vigorous discussion of social subjects which the encyclopædia stimulated it is worth remarking that this writer was a subengineer of roads and bridges in the generality of tours the case is one example among others of the importance of the encyclopædia as a centre to which activeminded men of all kinds might bring the fruits of their thought and observation  next to the corvées the monster grievance of the third estate was the system of enrolments for the militia the article milice is very short but it goes to the root of the matter the only son of a cultivator of moderate means forced to quit the paternal roof at the moment when his labour might recompense his straitened parents for the expense of having brought him up is justly described as an irreparable loss the writer after hinting that it would be well if such an institution were wholly dispensed with urges that at least its object might be more effectively and more humanely reached by allowing each parish to provide its due contingent of men in its own way this change was indeed already 1765 being carried out by turgot in the limousin and with excellent results the writer concludes with the highly civilised remark that we ought to weigh whether the good of the rural districts the culture of the land and population are not preferable objects to the glory of setting enormous hosts of armed men on foot after the example of xerxes alas it is one of the discouragements of the student of history that he often finds highly civilised remarks made one or two or twenty centuries ago which are just as useful and just as little heeded now as they were when they were made  the same reflection occurs to one in reading the article on foundations as i have already said this carefully written and sagacious piece still remains the most masterly discussion we possess of the advantages and disadvantages of endowments even now and in our own country the most fertile and beneficent work to which a statesman of energy and courage could devote himself would be an application of the wise principles which were established in the encyclopædia passing from fondation to foire in the same volume also from the pen of turgot we see an almost equally striking example of the economic wisdom of the encyclopædic school the provincial fairs with their privileges exemptions exclusions were a conspicuous case of the mischief done by that mania for regulating and guiding everything which then infected commercial administration and interrupted the natural course of trade by imbecile vexations of police another vicious example of the same principle is exposed in the article on maîtrises this must have convinced every reader capable of rising above the holy laws of prejudice how bad faith idleness disorder and all the other evils of monopoly were fomented by a system of jealous tradeguilds carrying compulsory subdivision and restriction of all kinds of skilled labour down to a degree that would have been laughable enough if it had only been less destructive  one of the loudest cries in 1789 was for the destruction of game and the great manorial chases or capitaineries by game says arthur young must be understood whole droves of wild boars and herds of deer not confined by any wall or pale but wandering at pleasure over the whole country to the destruction of crops and to the peopling of the galleys by the wretched peasants who presumed to kill them in order to save that food which was to support their helpless children165 in the same place he enumerates the outrageous and incredible rules which ruined agriculture over hundreds of leagues of country in order that the seigneurs might have sport in most matters the seven volumes of the encyclopædia which were printed before 1757 are more reserved than the ten volumes which were conducted by diderot alone after the great schism of 1759 on the subject of sport however the writer of the article chasse enumerates all the considerations which a patriotic minister could desire to see impressed on public opinion some of the paragraphs startle us by their directness and freedom of complaint and even a very cool reader would still be likely to feel some of the wrath that was stirred in the breast of our shrewd and sober arthur young a generation later 1787 go to the residence of these great nobles he says wherever it may be and you would probably find them in the midst of a forest very well peopled with deer wild boar and wolves oh if i were the legislator of france for a day i would make such great lords skip166  this brings us to what is perhaps the most striking of all the guiding sentiments of the book virgils georgics have been described as a glorification of labour the encyclopædia seems inspired by the same motive the same earnest enthusiasm for all the purposes interests and details of productive industry diderot as has been justly said himself the son of a cutler might well bring handiwork into honour assuredly he had inherited from his good fathers workshop sympathy and regard for skill and labour167 the illustrative plates to which diderot gave the most laborious attention for a period of almost thirty years are not only remarkable for their copiousness their clearness their finishand in all these respects they are truly admirablebut they strike us even more by the semipoetic feeling that transforms the mere representation of a process into an animated scene of human life stirring the sympathy and touching the imagination of the onlooker as by something dramatic the bustle the dexterity the alert force of the iron foundry the glass furnace the gunpowder mill the silk calendry are as skilfully reproduced as the more tranquil toil of the dairywoman the embroiderer the confectioner the setter of types the compounder of drugs the chaser of metals the drawings recall that eager and personal interest in his work that nimble complacency which is so charming a trait in the best french craftsman the animation of these great folios of plates is prodigious they affect one like looking down on the world of paris from the heights of montmartre to turn over volume after volume is like watching a splendid panorama of all the busy life of the time minute care is as striking in them as their comprehensiveness the smallest tool the knot in a thread the ply in a cord the curve of wrist or finger each has special and proper delineation the reader smiles at a complete and elaborate set of tailors patterns he shudders as he comes upon the knives the probes the bandages the posture of the wretch about to undergo the most dangerous operation in surgery in all the chief departments of industry there are plates good enough to serve for practical specifications and working drawings it has often been told how diderot himself used to visit the workshops to watch the men at work to put a thousand questions to sit down at the loom to have the machine pulled to pieces and set together again before his eyes to slave like any apprentice and to do bad work in order as he says to be able to instruct others how to do good work that was no movement of empty rhetoric which made him cry out for the encyclopædia to become a sanctuary in which human knowledge might find shelter against time and revolutions he actually took the pains to make it a complete storehouse of the arts so perfect in detail that they could be at once reconstructed after a deluge in which everything had perished save a single copy of the encyclopædia such details said dalembert will perhaps seem extremely out of place to certain scholars for whom a long dissertation on the cookery or the hairdressing of the ancients or on the site of a ruined hamlet or on the baptismal name of some obscure writer of the tenth century would be vastly interesting and precious he suggests that details of economy and of arts and trades have as good a right to a place as the scholastic philosophy or some system of rhetoric still in use or the mysteries of heraldry yet none even of these had been passed over168  the importance given to physical science and the practical arts in the encyclopædia is the sign and exemplification of two elements of the great modern transition it marks both a social and an intellectual revolution we see in it first the distinct association with pacific labour of honour and a kind of glory such as had hitherto been reserved for knights and friars for war and asceticism for fighting and praying  it is the definite recognition of the basis of a new society if the nobles and the churchmen could only have understood as clearly as diderot and dalembert understood the irresistible forces that were making against the maintenance of the wornout system all the worst of the evils attending the great political changes of the last decade of the century would have been avoided that the nobles and churchmen would not see this was the fatality of the revolution we have a glimpse of the profound transformation of social ideas which was at work in the five or six lines of the article journalier journeymana workman who labours with his hands and is paid daywages this description of men forms the great part of a nation it is their lot which a good government ought to keep principally in sight if the journeyman is miserable the nation is miserable and again the net profit of a society if equally distributed may be preferable to a larger profit if it be distributed unequally and have the effect of dividing the people into two classes one gorged with riches the other perishing in misery homme  the second element in the modern transition is only the intellectual side of the first it is the substitution of interest in things for interest in words of positive knowledge for verbal disputation few now dispute the services of the schoolmen to the intellectual development of europe but conditions had fully ripened and it was time to complete the movement of bacon and descartes by finally placing verbal analysis verbal definition verbal inferences in their right position form was no longer to take precedence of matter the encyclopædists are never weary of contrasting their own age of practical rationalism with the pusillanimous ages of taste a great collection of books is described in one article bibliomanie as a collection of material for the history of the blindness and infatuation of mankind the gatherer of books is compared to one who should place five or six gems under a pile of common pebbles if a man of sense buys a work in a dozen volumes and finds that only half a dozen pages are worth reading he does well to cut out the half dozen pages and fling the rest into the fire finally it would be no unbecoming device for every great library to have inscribed over its portal the bedlam of the human mind at this point one might perhaps suggest to dalembert that study of the pathology of the mind is no bad means of surprising the secrets of humanity and life for his hour however the need was not knowledge of the thoughts dreams and mental methods of the past but better mastery of the aids and instruments of active life in any case diderot was right when he expressed his preference for the essay over the treatise an essay where the writer throws me one or two ideas of genius almost isolated rather than a treatise where the precious gems are stifled beneath a mass of iteration a man had only one idea the idea demanded no more than a phrase this phrase full of marrow and meaning would have been seized with relish washed out in a deluge of words it wearies and disgusts169 rousseau himself does not surpass diderot or dalembert in contempt for mere bookishness we wholly misjudge the encyclopædia if we treat it either as literature or philosophy  the attitude of the encyclopædia to religion is almost universally misrepresented in the common accounts we are always told that the aim of its conductors was to preach dogmatic atheism such a statement could not be made by any one who had read the theological articles whether the more or the less important among them whether diderot had himself advanced definitely to the dogma of atheism at this time or not it is certain that the encyclopædia represents only the phase of rationalistic scepticism that the criticism was destructive of much of the fabric of popular belief and was designed to destroy it is undeniable as it was inevitable but when the excesses of 93 and 94and all the revolutionary excesses put together are but a drop compared with the oceans of bloodshed with which catholicism and absolutism have made history crimsonwhen the crimes and confusion of the end of the century are traced by historians to the materialism and atheism of the encyclopædia we can only say that such an account is a misrepresentation the materialism and atheism are not there the religious attack was prompted and guided by the same social feeling that inspired the economic articles the priest was the enemy of society the patron of indolence the hater of knowledge the mutineer against the civil laws the unprofitable devourer of the national substance the persecutor sacerdotalism is the object of the encyclopædic attack to undermine this it was necessary first to establish the principle of toleration because the priest claims to be recognised as the exclusive possessor of saving doctrine second it was necessary to destroy the principle of miracle because the priest professes himself in his daily rites the consecrated instrument of thaumaturgy let a man says rosenkranz very truly turn over hundreds of histories of church of state of literature and in every one of them he will read that the encyclopædia spread abroad an irreligious spirit the accusation has only a relative truth to the extent that the encyclopædia assailed the belief in miracles and the oppression of conscience supported by a priestly aristocracy170  it must be admitted that no consistent and definite language is adhered to from beginning to end dalemberts prophecy that time would disclose to people what the writers really thought behind what fear of the censorship compelled them to say is only partially fulfilled  the idea of miracle is sapped not by direct arguments but by the indirect influences of science and the exposition of the successes of scientific method it was here that the encyclopædia exerted really destructive power and it did so in the only way in which power of that kind can be exerted either wisely or effectually the miracle of a divine revelation of grace of the mass began to wear a different look in mens eyes as they learned more of the physical processes of the universe we should describe the work of the encyclopædia as being to make its readers lose their interest rather than their belief in mysteries this is the normal process of theological dissolution it unfolded a vast number of scientific conceptions in all branches of human activity a surprising series of acquisitions a vivid panorama of victories won by the ingenuity and travail of man a contemplation of the wonders that man had wrought for himself replaced meditation on the wonders that were alleged to have been wrought by the gods the latter were not so much denied by the plain reader as they were gradually left out of sight and forgotten nobody now cares to disprove jupiter and juno satyrs and hamadryads  diderot constantly insists on the propriety the importance the indispensableness of keeping the provinces of science and philosophy apart from the province of theology this separation is much sought in our own day as a means of saving theology diderot designed it to save philosophy he felt that the distinct recognition of positive thought as supreme within the widest limits then covered by it would ultimately lead to the banishment of theological thought to a region of its own too distant and too infertile for men to weary themselves in pursuit of it his conception was to supplant the old ways of thinking and the old objects of intellectual interest by new ones he trusted to the intrinsic fitness and value of the new knowledge and new views of human life to displace the old this marks him for a constructive thinker he replaced barren theological interests that had outlived their time by all those great groups of living and fruitful interests which glow and sparkle in the volumes of the encyclopædia here was the effective damage that the encyclopædia inflicted on the church as the organ of a stationary superstition some of the articles remind us on what a strange borderland france stood in those days between debasing credulity and wholesome light we are so sensible of the new air that breathes impalpably over the book that when the old theological fancies appear for forms sake and are solemnly marshalled in orthodox state the contrast and the incongruity are so marked that one is amused by what looks like a subtle irony mocking the censor under his very eyes who can help smiling at the grave question adam le premier de tous les hommes atil été philosophe such disputes as whether it is proper to baptize abortions ceased to interest a public that had begun to educate itself by discussions on the virtue of inoculation  of the gross defects in the execution of the encyclopædia nobody was so sensible as diderot himself he drew up a truly formidable list of the departments where the work was badly done171 but when the blunders and omissions in each subject were all counted the value of the vast grouping of the subjects was hardly diminished the union of all these secular acquisitions in a single colossal work invested them with something imposing secular knowledge was made to present a massive and sumptuous front it was pictured before the curious eyes of that generation as a great city of glittering palaces and stately mansions or else as an immense landscape with mountains plains rocks waters forests animals and a thousand objects glorious and beautiful in the sunlight theology became visibly a shrivelled thing men grew to be conscious of the vastness of the universe at the same time and by the same process the encyclopædia gave them a key to the plan a guiding thread in the immense labyrinth the genealogical tree or classification of arts and sciences which with a few modifications was borrowed from bacon and appeared at the end of the prospectus is seen to be faulty and inadequate it distributes the various branches of knowledge with reference to faculties of the human understanding instead of grouping them according to their objective relations to one another this led to many awkward results as when the art of printing is placed by the side of orthography as a subdivision of logic to which also is given the art of heraldry or emblazonment there is awkwardness too in dividing architecture into three heads and then placing civil architecture under national jurisprudence and naval architecture under social jurisprudence while under fine arts no kind of architecture has any place but when we have multiplied these objections to the uttermost the effect of the magnificence and vastness of the scheme remains exactly what it was  even more important than the exposition of human knowledge was the exposition of the degrees by which it had been slowly reared the preliminary discourse to the encyclopædia of which by far the greater and more valuable portion was written by dalembert contains a fine survey of the progress of science thought and letters since the revival of learning it is a generous canonisation of the great heroes of secular knowledge it is rapid but the contributions of bacon descartes newton locke leibnitz are thrown into a series that penetrates the readers mind with the idea of ordered growth and measured progress this excited a vivid hopefulness of interest which insensibly but most effectually pressed the sterile propositions of dogmatic theology into a dim and squalid background nor was this all the preliminary discourse and the host of articles marshalled behind it showed that the triumphs of knowledge and true opinion had all been gained on two conditions the first of these conditions was a firm disregard of authority the second was an abstention from the premature concoction of system the reign of ignorance and prejudice was made inveterate by deference to tradition the reign of truth was hindered by the artificial boundarymarks set mischievously deep by the authors of systems as the whole spirit of theology is both essentially authoritative and essentially systematic this disparagement was full of tolerably direct significance it told in another way the sorbonne the universities the doctors had identified orthodoxy with cartesianism it is hard to believe says dalembert in 1750 that it is only within the last thirty years that people have even begun to renounce cartesianism he might have added that one of the most powerful of his contemporaries montesquieu himself remained a rigid cartesian to the end of his days our nation he says singularly eager as it is for novelties in all matters of taste is in matters of science extremely attached to old opinions this remark remains true of france to the present hour and it would be an interesting digression did time allow to consider its significance france can at all events count one master innovator the founder of cartesianism himself dalembert points out that the disciples violate the first maxims of their chief he describes the hypothesis of vortices and the doctrine of innate ideas as no longer tenable and even as ridiculous but do not let us forget he says with a fine movement of candour that it was descartes who opened the way he who set an example to men of intelligence of shaking off the yoke of scholasticism of opinion of authorityin a word of prejudices and barbarism those who remain faithful to his hypothetical system while they abandon his method may be the last of his partisans but they would assuredly never have been the first of his disciples  by system the encyclopædists meant more or less coherent bodies of frivolous conjecture the true merit of the philosopher or the physicist is described as being to have the spirit of system yet never to construct a system the notion expressed in this sentence promises a union of the advantages of an organic synthesis with the advantages of an open mind and unfettered inquiry it would be ridiculous to think says dalembert that there is nothing more to discover in anatomy because anatomists devote themselves to researches that may seem to be of no use and yet often prove to be full of use in their consequences nor would it be less absurd to lay a ban on erudition on the pretext that our learned men often give themselves up to matters of trivial import  we are constantly struck in the encyclopædia by a genuine desire to reach the best opinion by the only right way the way of abundant manysided and liberal discussion the article for instance on fermes générales contains an examination of the question whether it is more expedient that the taxes of a nation should be gathered by farmers of the revenue or directly by the agents of the government acting on its behalf and under its supervision montesquieu had argued strongly in favour of a régie the second of these methods the writer of the article sets out the nine considerations by which montesquieu had endeavoured to establish his position and then he offers on each of them the strongest observations that occur to him in support of the opposite conclusion at the conclusion of the article the editors of the encyclopædia append the following note our professed impartiality and our desire to promote the discussion and clearing up of an important question have induced us to insert this article as the encyclopædia has for its principal aim the public advantage and instruction we will insert in the article régie without taking any side all such reasons for and against as people may he willing to submit to us provided they are stated with due sense and moderation alas when we turn to the article on régie the promise is unfulfilled and a dozen meagre lines disappoint the seeker but eight years of storm had passed and many a beneficent intention had been wrecked the announcement at least shows us the aim and spirit of the original scheme  of the line of argument taken in the encyclopædia as to toleration we need say nothing the encyclopædists were the most ardent propagators of the modern principles of tolerance no one has to be reminded that this was something more than an abstract discussion among the doctors of social philosophy in a country where youths were broken on the wheel for levity in face of an ecclesiastical procession where nearly every considerable man of the century had been either banished or imprisoned for daring to use his mind and which had been half ruined by the great proscription of protestants more than once renewed the article tolérance was greatly admired in its day and it is an eloquent and earnest reproduction of the pleas of locke one rather curious feature in it is the reproduction of the passage from the social contract in which rousseau explains the right of the magistrate to banish any citizen who has not got religion enough to make him do his duties and who will not make a profession of civil faith the writer of the article interprets this as implying that atheists in particular who remove from the powerful the only rein and from the weak their only hope have no right to claim toleration this is an unexpected stroke in a work that is vulgarly supposed to be a violent manifesto on behalf of atheism172  diderot himself in an earlier article intolérance had treated the subject with more trenchant energy he does not argue his points systematically but launches a series of maxims as with set teeth clenched hands and a brow like a thundercloud he hails the oppressors of his life the priests and the parliaments with a pungency that is exhilarating and winds up with a description of the intolerant as one who forgets that a man is his fellow and for holding a different opinion treats him like a ravening brute as one who sacrifices the spirit and precepts of his religion to his pride as the rash fool who thinks that the arch can only be upheld by his hands as a man who is generally without religion and to whom it comes easier to have zeal than morals every page of the encyclopædia was in fact a plea for toleration this embittered the hostility of the churchmen to the work more than its attack upon dogma for most ecclesiastics valued power more dearly than truth and in power they valued most dearly the atrocious right of silencing by foul means or fair all opinions that were not official   iii  having thus described the general character and purport of the encyclopædia we have still to look at a special portion of it from a more particular point of view we have already shown how multifarious were diderots labours as editor it remains to give a short account of his labours as a contributor everything was on the same vast scale his industry in writing would have been in itself most astonishing even if it had not been accompanied by the more depressing fatigue of revising what others had written diderots articles fill more than four of the large volumes of his collected works  the confusion is immense the spirit is sometimes historical sometimes controversial now critical now dogmatic in one place diderot speaks in his own proper person in another as the neutral scribe writing to the dictation of an unseen authority there is no rigorous measure and ordered proportion we constantly pass from a serious treatise to a sally from an elaborate history to a caprice there are not a few pages where we know that diderot is saying what he does not think some of the articles seem only to have found a place because diderot happened to have taken an interest in their subjects at the moment after reading voltaires concise account of imagination we are amazed to find diderot devoting a larger space than voltaire had needed for the subject at large to so subordinate and remote a branch of the matter as the power of the imagination in pregnant women upon the unborn young the article on theosophs would hardly have been so disproportionately long as it is merely for the sake of paracelsus and van helmont and poiret and the rosicrucians unless diderot happened to be curiously and halfsympathetically brooding over the mixture of inspiration and madness of charlatanry and generous aim of which these semimystic semiscientific characters were composed173  many of diderots articles again have no rightful place in an encyclopædia genius for instance is dealt with in what is neither more nor less than a literary essay vigorous suggestive diffuse and containing by the way the curious assertion that although there are few errors in locke and too few truths in shaftesbury yet locke is only an acute and comprehensive intelligence while shaftesbury is a genius of the first order  under the word laborious we have only a dozen lines of angry reproach against the despotism that makes men idle by making property uncertain under such words as frivolous gallantry perfection importance politeness melancholy glorieux the reader is amused and edified by miniature essays on manners and character seldom ending without some pithy sentence and pointed moral sometimes eg grandeur we have a charming piece after the manner of la bruyère under the verb naítre which is placed in the department of grammar we find a passage so far removed from grammar as the following  the terms of life and death have nothing absolute they only designate the successive states of one and the same being for him who has been strongly nourished in this philosophy the urn that contains the ashes of a father a mother a husband a mistress is truly a touching object there still remains in it life and warmth these ashes may perhaps even yet feel our tears and give them response who knows if the movement that our tears stir as they water those ashes is wholly without sensibility  this little burst of grotesque sentimentalism is one of the pieces that justify the description of diderot as the most german of all the french174 equally characteristic and more sensible is the writers outbreak against formalists the formalist knows exactly the proper interval between receiving and returning a visit he expects you on the exact day at the exact time if you fail he thinks himself neglected and takes offence a single man of this stamp is enough to chill and embarrass a whole company there is nothing so repugnant to simple and upright souls as formalities as such people have within themselves the consciousness of the goodwill they bear to everybody they neither plague themselves to be constantly displaying a sentiment that is habitual nor to be constantly on the watch for it in others this is analogous to his contempt for the pedants who object to the use of a hybrid word if it happens that a composite of a greek word and a latin word renders the idea as well and is easier to pronounce or pleasanter to the ear than a compound of two greek words and two latin words why prefer the latter hibrides some articles are simply diatribes against the enemy pardon for instance it needs much attention much modesty much skill to wring from others pardon for our superiority the men who have executed a foolish work have never been able to pardon us for projecting a better we could have got from them pardon for a crime but never for a good action and so forth with much magnanimous acrimony prostitution is only introduced for the pleasure of applying the unsavoury word to certain critics of whom we have so many in these days and of whom we say that they prostitute their pens to money to favour to lying and to all the vices most unworthy of an honourable man  we are constantly being puzzled and diverted by diderots ingenuity in wandering away from the topic nominally in hand to insinuate some of those doctrines of tolerance of suspended judgment or of liberty which lay so much nearer to his heart than any point of mere erudition there is a little article on aiuslocutius the announcing speaker one of the minor roman gods diderot begins by a few lines describing the rise of the deity into repute he then quotes ciceros pleasantry on the friendly divinity that when nobody in the world had ever heard of him he delivered a salutary oracle but after people had built him a fine temple then the god of speech fell dumb this suggests to diderot to wonder with edifying innocence how so religious a people as the romans endured these irreverent jests in their philosophers by an easy step we pass to the conditions on which modern philosophers should be allowed by authority to publish their speculations diderot throws out the curious hint that it would be best to forbid any writing against government and religion in the vulgar tongue and to allow those who write in a learned tongue to publish what they please and so we bid farewell to aiuslocutius in passing we ask ourselves whether diderots suggestion is not available in the discussion of certain questions where freedom of speech in the vernacular tongue is scarcely compatible with the reverentia quæ debetur pueris  diderot is never prevented by any mistaken sense of the dignity of his enterprise from interspersing his disquisitions on science and philosophy with such practical thoughts on the common matters of daily life as come into his ingenious head he suggests for instance by way of preventing the frauds of cabdrivers on their masters and on the public that all payments of fares should be made to appointed officers at the various cabstations and that no driver should take up a fare except at one of these stations175 in writing about lackeys after a word on their insolence and on the wretched case in which most of them end their days he points out that the multitude of them is causing the depopulation of the fields they are countrymen who have thronged to paris to avoid military service peasants turned lackeys to escape the conscription just as in our own days they turn priests then says diderot this evil ought to be checked by a tax upon liveries but such a tax is far too sensible ever to be imposed  yet notwithstanding the practical and fervid temper of his understanding diderot is not above literary trifling when the humour seizes him if he can write an exhaustive article on encyclopædia or spinosa or academies or weaving he can also stoop to anagrams and can tell us that the letters of frère jacques clément the assassin of henry iii make up the sinister words cest lenfer qui ma créé he can write a couple of amusing pages on onomatomancy or divination of a mans fortune from his name and can record with neutral gravity how frequently great empires have been destroyed under princes bearing the same name as their first founders how again certain names are unlucky for princes as cains among the romans john in france england and scotland and henry in france  we have now and then an anecdote that is worth reading and worth preserving thus under machiavellist i have heard that a philosopher being asked by a great prince about a refutation of machiavellism which the latter had just published replied sire i fancy that the first lesson that machiavelli would have given to his disciple would have been to refute his work whether voltaire ever did say this to the great frederick is very questionable but it would not have been ill said after the reader has been taken through a short course of arabian philosophy he is enlivened by a selection of poetic sayings about human life from the rosegarden of sadi and the whole article winds up with an eastern fable of no particular relevancy of three men finding a treasure and of one of them poisoning the food for which the other two had sent him on his return they suddenly fell on him and slew him and then ate the poisoned food and so the treasure fell to none of them176  we have spoken in the previous section of the contempt expressed by dalembert for mere literary antiquarianisma very different thing let us remember from scientific inquiry into the origin and classification of institutions and social organs diderots article on the germans is an excellent illustration of this wholesome predominance of the scientific spirit over the superficialities of barren erudition the word allemand says diderot has a great many etymologies but they are so forced that it is almost as well to know none of them as to know them all as for the origin of this famous stock all that has been said on that matter between tacitus and clovis is simply a tissue of guesses without foundation of course in this some persons will see a shameful levity others will regard it as showing very good sense and a right estimate of what is knowable and worth knowing and what is neither one nor the other in the article on celibacy we notice the same temper a few sentences are enough for the antiquarianism of the subject what the egyptians greeks and romans thought and ordained about celibacy the substance of the article is a reproduction of the abbé saint pierres discussion of the advantages that would be gained for france with her declining population if her forty thousand curés were allowed to marry and to bring into the world eighty thousand children we may believe that diderot smiled as he transcribed the abbés cunning suggestion that a dispensing power to relieve from the obligation of celibacy should be recognised in the pope and that the roman court should receive a sum of money for every dispensation so granted  although however diderot despised mere bookishness his article on libraries is one of the longest and most painstaking furnishing a tolerably complete list of the most famous collections from the beginning of books down to the latest additions to the kings library in the rue vivienne in the course of this article he quotes with seeming approval the quaint words in which old richard of bury the author of the philobiblon 1340 praised books as the best of masters much as the immortal defender of the poet archias had praised them hi sunt magistri qui nos instruunt sine virgis et ferulis sine cholera sine pecuniâ si accedis non dormiunt si inquiris non se abscondunt non obmurmurant si oberres cachinnos nesciunt si ignores  in literature proper as in philosophy diderot loses no opportunity of insisting on the need of being content with suspended judgment for instance he blames historians of opinion for the readiness with which they attribute notions found in one or two rabbis to the whole of the jews or because two or three fathers say something boldly set this down as the sentiments of a whole century although perhaps we have nothing else save these two or three fathers left of the century and although we do not know whether their writings were applauded or were even widely known it were to be wished that people should speak less affirmatively especially on particular points and remote consequences and that they should only attribute them directly to those in whose writings they are actually to be found i confess that the history of the sentiments of antiquity would not seem so complete and that it would be necessary to speak in terms of doubt much more often than is common but by acting otherwise we expose ourselves to the danger of taking false and uncertain conjectures for ascertained and unquestionable truths the ordinary man of letters does not readily put up with suspensive expressions any more than common people do so all this is an odd digression to be found under the head of hylopathianism but it must always remain wholesome doctrine  we cannot wonder at diderots admiration for montaigne and for bayle who with hume would make the great trinity of scepticism the work of montaigne said diderot is the touchstone of a good intelligence you may be sure that any one whom the reading of montaigne displeases has some vice either of heart or understanding as for bayle he has had few equals in the art of reasoning and perhaps no superior and though he piles doubt upon doubt he always proceeds with order an article of his is a living polypus which divides itself into a number of polypuses all living engendered one from the other177 yet diderot had a feeling of the necessity of advancing beyond the attitude of bayle and montaigne intellectual suspense and doubt was made difficult to him by his vehement and positive demand for emotional certainties  diderot is always ready to fling away his proper subject in a burst of moralising the article on man as a branch of natural history contains a correct if a rather superficial account of that curious animal at length the writer comes to a table showing the probable duration of life at certain ages you will observe he says 1st that the age of seven is that at which you may hope a longer life 2d that at twelve or thirteen you have lived a quarter of your life at twentyeight or twentynine you have lived half at fifty more than threequarters and then he suddenly winds up the whole performance by the exclamation o ye who have laboured up to fifty who are in the enjoyment of comfort and who still have left to you health and strength what then are you waiting for before you take rest how long will you go on saying tomorrow tomorrow  there are many casual brilliancies in the way of analogy and parallel many aptnesses of thought and phrase the stoics are called the jansenists of paganism for a single blade of grass to grow it is necessary that the whole of nature should cooperate a man comes to pyrrhonism by one of two opposite ways either because he does not know enough or because he knows too much the latter is not the most common way and so forth  if we turn to the group of articles dealing with theology it is difficult for us to know exactly where we are sometimes diderot writes of popular superstitions with the gravity proper to a dictionary of mythology sometimes he sews on to the sober gray of his scepticism a purple patch of theistic declamation178 the article on jesus christ is obviously a mere piece of common form and more than one passage in his article on christianisme is undoubtedly insincere when we come to his more careful article providence we find it impossible to extract from it a body of coherent propositions of which we could confidently say that they represented his own creed or the creed that he desired his readers to bear away in their minds  it is hardly worth while to measure the more or the less of his adherence to christianity or even to deism as inferred from the encyclopædia we need only turn to his private letters to find that he is in no degree nor kind an adherent but the most hardy contemptuous and thoroughgoing of opponents at the risk of shocking devout persons i am bound to reproduce a passage from one of his letters in which there can be no doubt that we have diderots true mind as distinguished from what it was convenient to print the christian religion he says is to my mind the most absurd and atrocious in its dogmas the most unintelligible the most metaphysical the most intertwisted and obscure and consequently the most subject to divisions sects schisms heresies the most mischievous for the public tranquillity the most dangerous to sovereigns by its hierarchic order its persecutions its discipline the most flat the most dreary the most gothic and the most gloomy in its ceremonies the most puerile and unsociable in its morality considered not in what is common to it with universal morality but in what is peculiarly its own and constitutes it evangelical apostolical and christian morality which is the most intolerant of all lutheranism freed from some absurdities is preferable to catholicism protestantism to lutheranism socinianism to protestantism deism with temples and ceremonies to socinianism since it is necessary that man being superstitious by nature should have a fetish the simplest and most harmless will be the best fetish179 we need not discuss nor extend the quotation enough has been said to relieve us from the duty of analysing or criticising articles in which christianity is treated with all the formal respect that the secular authority insisted upon  this formal respect is not incompatible with many veiled and secret sarcasms which were as well understood as they were sharply enjoyed by those who read between the lines it is not surprising that these sarcasms were constantly unjust and shallow even those of us who repudiate theology and all its works for ourselves may feel a shock at the coarseness and impurity of innuendo which now and then disfigures diderots treatment of theological as of some other subjects for this the attitude of the church itself was much to blame coarse virulent unspiritual as it was in france in those days voltaire diderot holbach would have written in a very different spirit even while maintaining and publishing the same attacks on theological opinion if the church of france had possessed such a school of teachers as the church of england found in the latitudinarians in the seventeenth century or such as she finds now in the nineteenth century in those who have imported partly from the poetry of wordsworth partly from the historic references of the oxford tracts an equity a breadth an elevation a pensive grace that effectually forbid the use of those more brutal weapons of controversy which were the only weapons possible in france a century ago  we have already said so much of the great and important group of articles on arts and trades that it is unnecessary to add anything further as to diderots particular share in them he visited all the workshops in paris he sent for information and specifications to the most important seats of manufacture in the kingdom he sometimes summoned workmen from the provinces to describe to him the paper works of montargis and the silk works and velvet works of lyons180 much of diderots work even on great practical subjects was no doubt the reproduction of mere bookknowledge acquired at secondhand take for instance agriculture which was undoubtedly the most important of all subjects for france at that date as indeed at every other date there are a dozen pages of practical precepts for which diderot was probably indebted to one of the farmers at grandval after this he fills up the article with about twenty pages in which he gives an account of the new system of husbandry which our english jethro tull described to an unbelieving public between 1731 and 1751 tulls volume was translated into french by duhamel with notes and the record of experiments of his own from this volume diderot drew the pith of his article diderots only merit in the matterand it is hardly an inconsiderable one in a world of routineis that he should have been at the pains to seek the newest lights and above all that he should have urged the value of fresh experiments in agriculture tull was not the safest authority in the world but it is to be remembered that the shrewdwitted cobbett thought his ideas on husbandry worth reproducing seventy years after diderot had thought them worth compiling into an article  it was not merely in the details of the practical arts that diderot wrote from material acquired at secondhand the article on the zendavesta is taken from the annual register for 1762 the long series of articles on the history of philosophy is in effect a reproduction of what he found in bayle in deslandes and in brucker there are one or two considerable exceptions perhaps the most important is under the heading of spinosa to which we shall return presently the article on hobbisme contains an analysis evidently made by the writers own hand of the bulk of hobbess propositions it is scarcely however illuminated by a word of criticism if we turn to the article on société it is true we find hobbess view of the relations between the civil and temporal powers tolerably effectively combated but even here diderot hardly does more than arm himself with the weapons of locke  of course he honestly refers his readers to these sources of wider information181 all that we can say of the articles on the history of philosophy is that the series is very complete that diderot used his matter with intelligence and the spirit of criticism and that he often throws in luminous remarks and farreaching suggestions of his own this was all that the purpose of his book required to imitate the laborious literary search of bayle or of brucker and to attempt to compile an independent history of philosophy would have been to sacrifice the encyclopædia as a whole to the superfluous perfection of a minor part there is only one imperative condition in such a case namely that the writer should pass the accepted material through his own mind before reproducing it with this condition it was impossible for a man of diderots indefatigable energy of spirit not as a rule to comply  but this rule too had exceptions there were cases in which he reproduced as any mere bookmaker might have done the thought of his authority without an attempt to make it his own of the confusion and inequalities in which diderot was landed by this method of mingling the thoughts of other people with his own there is a curious example in the two articles on philosopher and philosophy in the first we have an essentially social and practical description of what the philosopher should be in the second we have a definition of philosophy which takes us into the regions most remote from what is social and practical we soar to the airiest heights of verbal analysis and pure formalism nothing can be better so far as it goes than the picture of the philosopher diderot begins by contrasting him with the crowd of people and clever people who insist on passing judgment all day long they ignore the scope and limits of the human mind they think it capable of knowing everything hence they think it a disgrace not to pronounce judgment and imagine that intelligence consists in that and nothing else the philosopher believes that it consists in judging rightly he is better pleased with himself when he has suspended his faculty of coming to a conclusion than if he had come to a conclusion without the proper grounds he prefers to brilliancy the pains of rightly distinguishing his ideas of finding their true extent and exact connection he is never so attached to a system as not to feel all the force of the objections to it most men are so strongly given over to their opinions that they do not take any trouble to make out those of others the philosopher on the other hand understands what he rejects with the same breadth and the same accuracy as he understands what he adopts then diderot turns characteristically from the intellectual to the social side our philosopher does not count himself an exile in the world he does not suppose himself in an enemys country he would fain find pleasure with others and to find it he must give it he is a worthy man who wishes to please and to make himself useful the ordinary philosophers who meditate too much or rather who meditate to wrong purpose are as surly and arrogant to all the world as great people are to those whom they do not think their equals they flee men and men avoid them but our philosopher who knows how to divide himself between retreat and the commerce of men is full of humanity civil society is so to say a divinity for him on the earth he honours it by his probity by an exact attention to his duties and by a sincere desire not to be a useless or an embarrassing member of it the sage has the leaven of order and rule he is full of the ideas connected with the good of civil society what experience shows us every day is that the more reason and light people have the better fitted they are and the more to be relied on for the common intercourse of life182  the transition is startling from this conception of  philosopher as a very high kind of man of the world to the definition of philosophy as the science of possibles quâ possibles diderots own reflection comes back to us combien cette maudite métaphysique fait des fous183 we are abruptly plunged from a baconian into a leibnitzian atmosphere we should naturally have expected some such account of philosophy as that it begins with a limitation of the questions to which men can hope for an answer and ends in an ordered arrangement of the principles of knowledge with ultimate reference to the conditions of morals and the structure of civil societies we should naturally have expected to find what indeed we do find that the characteristic of the philosopher is to admit nothing without proof never to acquiesce in illusory notions to draw rigorously the dividing lines of the certain the probable the doubtful above all things never to pay himself with mere words but then these wholesome prescriptions come in an article whose definitions and distribution of philosophy are simply a reproduction from christian wolff and the methods and dialect of wolff are as essentially alien from the positive spirit of the encyclopædia as they were from the mystic spirit of jacobi  wolffs place in the philosophical succession of german speculation 16791754 is between leibnitz and kant and until kant came his system was dominant in the country of metaphysics184 it is from wolff that diderot borrows and throws unassimilated into the pages of the encyclopædia propositions so fundamentally incongruous as this that among all possibles there must of necessity be a being subsisting by himself otherwise there would be possible things of the possibility of which no account could be given an assertion that could never be made it is a curious thing and it illustrates again the strangely miscellaneous quality of diderots compilation that the very article which begins by this incorporation of the author of a philosophical system expounded in a score of quartos ends by a vigorous denunciation of the introduction of the systematic spirit into philosophy  i shall venture to quote a hardy passage from another article pyrrhonienne which some will think a measure of diderots philosophical incompetency and others will think a measure of his good sense we will conclude he says for our part that as all in nature is bound together there is nothing properly speaking of which man has perfect absolute and complete knowledge because for that he would need knowledge of all now as all is bound together it inevitably happens that from discussion to discussion he must come to something unknown then in starting again from this unknown point we shall be justified in pleading against him the ignorance or the obscurity or the uncertainty of the point preceding and of that preceding this and so forth up to the most evident principle so we must admit a sort of sobriety in the use of reason when step by step i have brought a man to some evident proposition i shall cease to dispute i will listen no longer to a man who goes on to deny the existence of bodies the rules of logic the testimony of the senses the difference between good and evil true and false etc etc i will turn my back on everybody who tries to lead me away from a simple question to embark me in discussion as to the nature of matter of the understanding of thought and other subjects shoreless and bottomless185 whatever else may be said of this we have to recognise that it is exactly characteristic of the author but then why have written on metaphysics at all  we have mentioned the article on spinosa it is characteristic both of the good and the bad sides of diderots work half of it is merely a reproduction of bayles criticisms on spinosa and his system the other half consists of original objections propounded by diderot with marked vigour of thrust against spinosa but there is no evidence that he had gone deeper into spinosa than the first book of the ethics there is no certain sign that he had read anything else or that he had more of that before him than the extracts that were furnished by bayle such treatment of a serious subject hardly conforms to the modern requirements of the literary conscience for in truth the literary conscience has now turned specialist and shrinks from the encyclopædic diderots objections are as we have said pushed with marked energy of speech however short away he says you penetrate into the thick darkness in which spinosa has wrapped himself up you discover a succession of abysses into which this audacious reasoner has precipitated himself of propositions either evidently false or evidently doubtful of arbitrary principles substituted for natural principles and sensible truths an abuse of terms taken for the most part in a wrong sense a mass of deceptive equivocations a cloud of palpable contradictions the system is monstrous it is absurd and ridiculous it is spinosas plausible method that has deceived people they supposed that one who employed geometry and proceeded by way of axioms and definitions must be on the track of truth they did not see that these axioms were nothing better than very vague and very uncertain propositions that the definitions were inexact defective and bizarre  we have no space to follow the reasoning by which diderot supports this scornful estimate of the famous thinker of whom it can never be settled whether he be pantheist atheist akosmist or godintoxicated man he returns to the charge again and again as if he felt a certain secret uneasiness lest for scorn so loudly expressed he had not brought forward adequate justification and the reader feels that diderot has scarcely hit the true line of cleavage that would have enabled himfrom his own point of viewto shatter the spinosist system he tries various bouts of logic with spinosa in connection with detached propositions thus he deals with spinosas third proposition that in the case of things that have nothing in common with one another one cannot be the cause of the other this proposition diderot contends is false in all moral and occasional causes the sound of the name of god has nothing in common with the idea of the creator which that name produces in my mind a misfortune that overtakes my friend has nothing in common with the grief that i feel in consequence when i move my arm by an act of will the movement has nothing in common in its nature with the act of my will they are very different i am not a triangle yet i form the idea of one and i examine its properties so with the fifth proposition that there cannot be in the universe two or more substances of the same nature or the same attributes if spinosa is only talking of the essence of things or of their definition what he says is naught for it can only mean that there cannot be in the universe two different essences having the same essence who doubts it but if spinosa means that there cannot be an essence which is found in various single objects in the same way as the essence of triangle is found in the triangle a and the triangle b then he says what is manifestly untrue it is not however until the last two or three pages that diderot sets forth his dissent in its widest form  to refute spinosa he says at last all that is necessary is to stop him at the first step without taking the trouble to follow him into a mass of consequences all that we need do is to substitute for the obscure principle which he makes the base of his system the following namely that there are several substancesa principle that in its own way is clear to the last degree and in fact what proposition can be clearer more striking more close to the understanding and consciousness of man i here seek no other judge than the most just impression of the common sense that is spread among the human race now since common sense revolts against each of spinosas propositions no less than against the first of which they are the pretended proofs instead of stopping to reason on each of these proofs where common sense is lost we should be right to say to himyour principle is contrary to common sense from a principle in which common sense is lost nothing can issue in which common sense is to be found again  the passage sounds unpleasantly like an appeal to the crowd in a matter of science which is as the sin against the holy ghost in these high concerns what diderot meant probably was to charge spinosa with inventing a conception of substance which has no relation to objective experience and further with giving fantastic answers to questions that were in themselves never worth asking because the answers must always involve a violent wrench of the terms of experience into the sphere transcending experience and because moreover they can never be verified whether he meant this or something else and whether he would have been right or wrong in such an intention we may admit that it would have been more satisfactory if in dealing with such a mastertype of the metaphysical method as spinosa so acute a positive critic as diderot had taken more pains to give to his objections the utmost breadth of which they were capable186  the article on leibnitz has less original matter in it than that on spinosa the various speculations of that great and energetic intellect in metaphysic logic natural theology natural law are merely drawn out in a long table of succinct propositions while the account of the life and character of leibnitz is simply taken from the excellent éloge which had been published upon him by fontenelle in 1716 fontenelles narrative is reproduced in a generous spirit of admiration and respect for a genius that was like diderots own in encyclopædic variety of interest while it was so far superior to diderots in concentration in subtlety in precision in power of construction if there could exist over our heads says diderot a species of beings who could observe our works as we watch those of creatures at our feet with what surprise would such beings have seen those four marvellous insects bayle descartes leibnitz and newton and he then draws up a little calendar of the famous men out of whom we must choose the name to be placed at the very head of the human race the list contains besides julian the apostatewho was inserted we may presume merely by way of playful insult to the ecclesiastical enemysocrates marcus aurelius trajan bacon and the four great names that have just been cited germany derives as much honour from leibnitz alone he concludes with unconsidered enthusiasm as greece from plato aristotle and archimedes all put together as we have said however there is no criticism nor any other sign that diderot had done more than survey the façade of the great leibnitzian structure admiringly from without  the article on liberty would be extremely remarkable appearing where it does and coming from a thinker of diderots general capacity if only we could be sure that diderot was sincere as it happens there is good reason to suppose that he was wholly insincere it is quite as shallow from the point of view of philosophy as his article on the jews or on the bible is from the point of view of erudition one reason for this might not be far to seek we have repeatedly observed how paramount the social aim and the social test are in diderots mind over all other considerations but this reference of all subjects of discussion to the good of society and this measurement of conclusions by their presumed effect on society is a method that has its own dangers the aversion of ecclesiastics to unfettered discussion lest it should damage institutions and beliefs deemed useful to mankind is the great leading example of this peril diderot it might be said by those who should contend that he wrote what he thought did not escape exactly the same predicament as soon as ever he forgot that of all the things that are good for society truth is the best now who will believe that it is diderot the persecuted editor of the encyclopædia and the author of the manly article on intolerance who introduces such a passage as the following into the discussion of the everlasting controversy of free will and necessity take away liberty and you leave no more vice nor virtue nor merit in the world rewards are ridiculous and punishments unjust the ruin of liberty overthrows all order and all police confounds vice and virtue authorises every monstrous infamy extinguishes the last spark of shame and remorse degrades and disfigures beyond recovery the whole human race a doctrine of such enormity as this ought not to be examined in the schools it ought to be punished by the magistrates187 of course this was exactly what the jesuits said about a belief in god about revelation and about the institutions of the church to take away these they said is to throw down the bulwarks of order and an attempt to take them away as by encyclopædists or others ought to be punished by the magistrates diderot had for the moment clearly lost himself  we need hardly be surprised if an article conceived in this spirit contains no serious contribution to the difficult question with which it deals diderot had persuaded himself that without free will all those emotional moralities in the way of sympathy and benevolence and justice which he adored would be lowered to the level of mere mechanism if men are not free in what they do of good and evil then he cries in what is surely a paroxysm of unreason good is no longer good and evil no longer evil as if the outward quality and effects of good and evil were not independent of the mental operations which precede human action murder would not cease to be an evil simply because it had been proved that the murderers will to do a bad deed was the result of antecedents acts have marks and consequences of their own good or bad whatever may be the state of mind of those who do them but diderot does not seem to divine the true issue he writes as if necessarians or determinists denied the existence of volitions and as if the question were whether volitions do exist nobody denies that they exist the real question is of the conditions under which they exist are they determined by antecedents or are they selfdetermined spontaneous and unconnected is will independent of cause  diderots argumentation is in fact merely a protest that man is conscious of a will and just as in other parts of his article diderot by liberty means only the existence of will so by liberty he means only the healthy condition of the soul and not its independence of causation we need not waste words on so dire a confusion nor on the theory that will is sometimes dependent on cerebral antecedents and sometimes not the curious thing is that the writer should not have perceived that he was himself in this preposterous theory propounding the very principle which he denounced as destructive to virtue ruinous to society and worthy of punishment by the government for it seems that after all the will of those whose dispositions are not moderate is not free and we may surely say that those whose dispositions are least moderate are exactly the most violent malefactors against the common weal one more passage is worth quoting to show how little the writer had seized the true meaning of the debate according to you he says to bayle it is not clear that it is at the pure choice of my will to move my arm or not to move it if that be so it is then necessarily determined that within a quarter of an hour from now i shall lift my hand three times together or that i shall not now if you seriously pretend that i am not free you cannot refuse an offer that i make you i will wager a thousand pistoles to one that i will do in the matter of moving my hand exactly the opposite to what you back and you may take your choice if you do think the wager fair it can only be because of your necessary and invincible judgment that i am free as if the will to move or not to move the arm would be uncaused and unaffected by antecedents when you have just provided so strong an antecedent as the desire to save a thousand pistoles it was perhaps well enough for voltaire to content himself with vague poetical material for his poetical discourse on liberty but from diderot whether as editor or as writer something better might have been expected than a clumsy reproduction of the reasoning by which men like turretini had turned philosophy into the corrupted handmaid of theology  the most extraordinary thing about this extraordinary article still remains to be told it was written we may suppose between 1757 and 1762 or about that time in june 1756 diderot wrote to a certain landois a fellowworker on the encyclopædia a letter containing the most emphatic possible repudiation of the whole doctrine of liberty liberty is a word void of sense there are not and there never can have been free beings we are only what fits in with the general order with organisation with education and with the chain of events we can no more conceive a being acting without a motive than we can conceive one of the arms of a balance acting without a weight and the motive is always exterior and foreign to us attached either by nature or by some cause or other that is not ourselves there is only one sort of causes properly speaking and those are physical causes188 and so forth in the vein of hard and remorseless necessarianism which we shall find presently in the pages of the system of nature189  there is only one explanation of this flagrant contradiction diderot must have written on liberty just as he wrote on jesus christ or the bible he cannot have said what he thought but only what the persons in authority required him to pretend to think we may he sure that a letter to an intimate would be more likely to contain his real opinion than an article published in the encyclopædia that such mystifications are odious are shameful are almost too degrading a price to pay for the gains of such a work we may all readily enough admit all that we can do is to note so flagrant a case as a striking example of the common artifices of the time one other point we may note the fervour and dexterity with which diderot made what he knew to be the worse appear the better cause make a still more striking example of his astonishing dramatic power of throwing himself as dialectician casuist sophist into a false and illusive part  turning from the philosophical to the political or social group of articles we find little to add to what has been said in the previous section one of the most excellent essays in this group is that on luxury diderot opens ingeniously with a list of the propositions that state the supposed evils of luxury and under each proposition he places the most striking case that he can find in history of its falseness he goes through the same process with the propositions asserting the gains of luxury to society having thus effectually disposed of any wholesale way of dealing with the subject he proceeds to make a number of observations on the gains and drawbacks of luxury these are full of sense and freedom from commonplace such articles as pouvoir souverain autorité do little more than tell over again the old unhistoric story about a society surrendering a portion of its sovereign power to some individual or dynasty to hold in trust it is worth remarking how little democratic were diderot and his school in any jacobinical or anarchic or even more respectable modern sense there is in diderots contributions many a firm and manly plea for the selfrespect of the common people but not more than once or twice is there a syllable of the disorder which smoulders under the pages of rousseau thus when the dwellers among the fields are well treated the number of proprietors insensibly grows greater the extreme distance and the vile dependence of poor on rich grow less hence the people have courage force of soul and strength of body they love their country they respect the magistrates they are attached to a prince to an order and to laws to which they owe their peace and wellbeing and you will no longer see the son of the honourable tiller of the soil so ready to quit the noble calling of his forefathers nor so ready to go and sully himself with the liveries and with the contempt of the man of wealth190  no one can find fault with democratic sentiment of this kind nor with the generous commonplaces of the moralist about virtue being the only claim to honour and vice the only true source of shame and inferiority but neither diderot nor voltaire ever allowed himself to flatter the crowd for qualities which the crowd can scarcely possess the little article on multitude seems merely inserted for the sake of buffeting unwarranted pretensions distrust the judgment of the multitude in all matters of reasoning and philosophy there its voice is the voice of malice folly inhumanity irrationality and prejudice distrust it again in things that suppose much knowledge or a fine taste the multitude is ignorant and dulled distrust it in morality it is not capable of strong and generous actions it rather wonders at such actions than approves them heroism is almost madness in its eyes distrust it in the things of sentiment is delicacy of sentiment so common a thing that you can accord it to the multitude in what then is the multitude right in everything but only at the end of a very long time because then it has become an echo repeating the judgment of a small number of sensible men who shape the judgment of posterity for it beforehand if you have on your side the testimony of your conscience and against you that of the multitude take comfort and be assured that time does justice it is far from being a universal gift among men of letters and others to unite this fastidious estimation of the incapacity of the crowd in the higher provinces of the intellectual judgment with a fervid desire that the life of the crowd should be made worthy of selfrespecting men  the same hand that wrote the defiance of the populace that has just been quoted wrote also this short article on misery there are few souls so firm that misery does not in the long run cast them down and degrade them the poor common people are incredibly stupid i know not what false dazzling prestige closes their eyes to their present wretchedness and to the still deeper wretchedness that awaits the years of old age misery is the mother of great crimes it is the sovereigns who make the miserable and it is they who shall answer in this world and the other for the crimes that misery has committed  so far as the mechanism of government is concerned diderot writes much as montesquieu had done under the head of représentants he proclaims the advantages not exactly of government by a representative assembly but of assisting and advising the royal government by means of such an assembly there is no thought of universal suffrage it is property that makes the citizen every man who has possessions in the state is interested in the state and whatever be the rank that particular conventions may assign to him it is always as a proprietor it is by reason of his possessions that he ought to speak and that he acquires the right of having himself represented yet this very definite statement does not save him from the standing difficulty of a democratic philosophy of politics nor can it be reconciled in point of logic with other propositions to which diderot commits himself in the same article for instance he says that no order of citizens is capable of stipulating for all if one order had the right it would very soon come to stipulate only for itself each class ought to be represented by men who know its condition and its needs these needs are only well known to those who actually feel them but then in that case the poorest classes are those who have most need of direct representation they are the most numerous their needs are sharpest they are the classes to which war consumption of national capital and way of expending national income equal laws judicial administration and the other concerns of a legislative assembly come most close the problem is to reconcile the sore interests of the multitude with the ignorance and the temper imputed in diderots own description of them  an interesting study might be made if the limits of our subject permitted such a digression on the new political ideas which a centurys experience in england france germany the american union has added to the publicists stock diderots article on the legislator is a curious mixture of views which political thinkers have left behind with views which the most enlightened statesmen have taken up there is much talk after the fashion of jean jacques rousseau about the admirable legislation of lycurgus at sparta the philosophical government of the great empire of china and the fine spirit of the institutions of peru we perceive that the same influences which made rousseaus political sentimentalism so popular also brought even strong heads like diderot to believe in the unbounded power of a government to mould men at its will and to impose institutions at discretion the idea that it is the main function of a government to make its people virtuous is generally as strong in diderot as it was in rousseau and as it became in robespierre he admires the emperors of china because their edicts are as the exhortation of a father to his children all edicts he says ought to instruct and to exhort as much as they command yet two years after the encyclopædia was finished 1774 when turgot prefaced his reforming edicts by elaborate and reasoned statements of the grounds for them it was found that his prefaces caused greater provocation than the very laws that they introduced  apart from the common form of enthusiasm for the sublime legislation of countries which the writer really knew nothing about the article on the legislator has some points worth noticing we have seen how diderot made the possession of property the true note of citizenship and of a claim to share in the government but he did not pay property this compliment for nothing it is he says the business of the legislator to do his best to make up to mankind for the loss of that equality which was one of the comforts that men surrendered when they gave up the state of nature hence the legislator ought to take care that no one shall reach a position of extreme opulence otherwise than by an industry that enriches the state he must take care that the charges of society shall fall upon the rich who enjoy the advantages of society even those who agree with diderot and are ready to vote for a graduated incometax will admit that he comes to his conclusion without knowing or reflecting about either the serious arguments for it or the serious objections against it  what is really interesting in this long article is its anticipation of those ideas which in england we associate with the name of cobden all the men of all lands have become necessary to one another for the exchange of the fruits of industry and the products of the soil commerce is a new bond among men every nation has an interest in these days in the preservation by every other nation of its wealth its industry its banks its luxury its agriculture the ruin of leipsic of lisbon and of lima has led to bankruptcies on all the exchanges of europe and has affected the fortunes of many millions of persons191 in the same spirit he foresees the decline of patriotism in its older and narrower sense and the predominance of the international over the national sentiment all nations now have sufficiently just ideas of their neighbours and consequently they have less enthusiasm for their country than in the old days of ignorance there is little enthusiasm where there is much light enthusiasm is nearly always the emotion of a soul that is more passionate than it is instructed by comparing among all nations laws with laws talents with talents and manners with manners nations will find so little reason to prefer themselves to others that if they preserve for their own country that love which is the fruit of personal interest at least they will lose that enthusiasm which is the fruit of an exclusive selfesteem  yet diderot had the perspicacity to discern the drawbacks to such a revolution in the conditions of social climate commerce like enlightenment lessens ferocity but also just as enlightenment takes away the enthusiasm of selfesteem so perhaps commerce takes away the enthusiasm of virtue it gradually extinguishes the spirit of magnanimous disinterestedness and replaces it by that of hard justice by turning mens minds rather to use than beauty to prudence rather than to greatness it may be that it injures the strength the generosity the nobleness of manners  all this whether it comes to much or little is at least more true than diderots assurance that henceforth for any nation in europe to make conquests must be a moral impossibility napoleon bonaparte was then a child in arms whether his career was on the whole a fulfilment or a contradiction of diderots proposition may be disputed  and so our sketch of the great book must at length end let us make one concluding remark is it not surprising that a man of diderots speculative boldness and power should have failed to rise from the mechanical arrangement of thought and knowledge up to some higher and more commanding conception of the relation between himself in the eighteenth century or ourselves in the nineteenth and all those great systems of thought method and belief which in various epochs and over different spaces of the globe have given to men working answers to the questions that their leading spirits were moved to put to themselves and to the iron universe around them we constantly feel how near diderot is to the point of view that would have brought light we feel how very nearly ready he was to see the mental experiences of the race in east and west not as superstition degradation grovelling error but as aspects of intellectual effort and aspiration richly worthy of human interest and scientific consideration and in their aim as well as in their substance all of one piece with the newest science and the last voices of religious or antireligious development diderot was the one member of the party of philosophers who was capable of grasping such a thought if this guiding idea of the unity of the intellectual history of man and the organic integrity of thought had happily come into diderots mind we should have had an encyclopædia indeed a survey and representation of all the questions and answers of the world such as would in itself have suggested what questions are best worth putting and at the same time have furnished its own answers  for this the moment was not yet an urgent social task lay before france and before europe it could not be postponed until the thinkers had worked out a scheme of philosophic completeness the thinkers did not seriously make any effort after this completeness the encyclopædia was the most serious attempt and it did not wholly fail as i replace in my shelves this mountain of volumes dusky and huge enlarging on the sight i have a presentiment that their pages will seldom again be disturbed by me or by others they served a great purpose a hundred years ago they are now a monumental ruin clothed with all the profuse associations of history it is no ozymandias of egypt king of kings whose wrecked shape of stone and sterile memories we contemplate we think rather of the gray and crumbling walls of an ancient stronghold reared by the endeavour of stout hands and faithful whence in its own day and generation a band once went forth against barbarous hordes to strike a blow for humanity and truth     chapter vi  social life 17591770   any one must be ignorant of the facts who supposes that the men of the eighteenth century who did not believe in god and were as little continent as king david were therefore no better than the reckless vagabonds of grub street diderot after he had once settled down to his huge task became a very orderly person it is true that he had an attachment to a lady who was not his wife marriage was in those days among the courtiers and the encyclopædic circle too habitually regarded as merely an official relation provided that there was no official desertion and no scandal the world had nothing to say diderot was no worse than his neighbours though we may well be sorry that a man of his generous sympathies and fine impulse was no better than his neighbours mademoiselle voland after proper deduction made for the manners of the time was of a respectable and sentimental type her family were of good position she lived with her mother and sisters and diderot was on good terms with them all we have a glimpse of the characteristics of the three ladies in a little dialogue between diderot and some one whom he met and who happened to have made their acquaintance he informed me that he had passed three months in the country where you arethree months said he is more than one needs to go mad about madame le gendre192true but then she is so reservedi scarcely know any woman with such an amount of selfrespectshe is quite rightmadame voland is a woman of rare merityes and her eldest daughtershe has the cleverness of a very devilshe is very clever no doubt but what i especially like is her frankness i would lay a wager that she has never told a voluntary lie since she came to years of discretion193 the relations between diderot and sophie voland were therefore not at all on the common footing of a low amour with a coarse or frivolous woman of the world all the proprieties of appearance were scrupulously observed their mutual passion though once not wholly without its gallantries soon took on that worthy and decorous quality into which the ardour of valiant youth is reluctantly softened by middle age when we gravely comfort it with names of philosophical compliment  one of the most interesting of all the documentary memorials of the century is to be found in the letters which diderot wrote to mademoiselle voland no doubt has ever been thrown on the authenticity of these letters and they bear ample evidence of genuineness so far as the substance of them is concerned in their characteristic style they were first published in 1830 from manuscripts sold to the bookseller the year before by a certain french man of letters jeudydugour by name he became a naturalised russian changed his name to gouroff and died in the position of councillor of state and director of the university of st petersburg how he came by any papers of diderot it is impossible to guess it is assumed that when mademoiselle voland died her family gave his letters and other papers back to diderot these along with other documents are supposed to have been given by diderot to grimm thence they went to the library of the hermitage at st petersburg whether jeudydugour sold copies or originals and whether he made the copies if copies they were from the library which was however rigorously closed during the reign of nicholas i are literary secrets which it is impossible to fathom so far as diderot is concerned some of the spirit of mystification that haunted literature in the eighteenth century still hovers about it in the nineteenth this we shall presently find in a still more interesting monument of diderot than even his letters to mademoiselle voland194  they are not a continuous series it was only when either diderot was absent from paris or his correspondent was away at her mothers house in the country that letterwriting was necessary diderot appears to have written to her openly and without disguise the letters of mademoiselle voland in reply were for obvious reasons not sent to diderots house but under cover to the office of damilaville so well known to the reader of voltaires correspondence damilaville was a commissioner in one of the revenue departments and it is one among many instances of the connivance between authority and its foes that most of the letters and packets of voltaire diderot and the rest of the group should have been taken in sent out guarded and franked by the head of a government office the trouble that damilaville willingly took in order to serve his friends is another example of what we have already remarked as the singular amiability and affectionate solicitude of those times think of damilavilles attention says diderot on one occasion today is sunday and he was obliged to leave his office he was sure that i should come this evening for i never fail when i hope for a letter from you he left the key with two candles on a table and between the two candles your little letter and a pleasant note of his own and by the light of the candles diderot at once wrote a long answer195  we need not wonder if much is said in these letters of tardy couriers missing answers intolerable absences dreary partings delicious anticipations all these are the old eternal talk of men and women ever since the world began without them we should hardly know that we are reading the words of man to woman they are in our present case only the setting of a curiously frank and open picture of a mans life  it is held by some that one of the best means of giving the sense of a little fixity to lives that are but as the evanescent fabric of a dream and the shadow of smoke is to secure stability of topographical centre by abiding in the same house diderot is one of the few who complied with this condition for thirty years he occupied the fourth and fifth floors of a house which was still standing not long ago at the corner of the rue saint benoit by the rue taranne in that paris which our tourists leave unexplored but which is nevertheless the true paris of the eighteenth century of the equipment of his room we have a charming picture by the hand of its occupant it occurs in his playful regrets on my old dressinggown so rich in happy and delightful touches  what induced me to part with it it was made for me i was made for it it moulded itself to all the turns and outlines of my body without fretting me i was picturesque and beautiful its successor so stiff so heavy makes a mere mannikin of me there was no want to which its complaisance did not lend itself for indigence is ever obsequious was a book covered with dust one of the lappets offered itself to wipe the dust away did the thick ink refuse to flow from the pen it offered a fold you saw traced in the long black lines upon it how many a service it had rendered me those long lines announced the man of letters the writer the workman and now i have all the mien of a rich idler you know not who i may be i was the absolute master of my old robe i am the slave of my new one the dragon that guarded the golden fleece was not more restless than i care wraps me about  the old man who has delivered himself up bound hand and foot to the caprices of a young giddypate says from morning to night ah where is my old my kind housekeeper what demon possessed me the day that i dismissed her for this creature then he sighs he weeps i do not weep nor sigh but at every moment i say cursed be the man who invented the art of making common stuff precious by dyeing it scarlet cursed be the costly robe that i stand in awe of where is my old my humble my obliging piece of homespun  that is not all my friend hearken to the ravages of luxuryof a luxury that must needs be consistent with itself my old gown was at one with the things about me a strawbottomed chair a wooden table a deal shelf that held a few books and three or four engravings dimmed by smoke without a frame nailed at the four corners to the wall among the engravings three or four casts in plaster were hung up they formed with my old dressinggown the most harmonious indigence all has become discord no more ensemble no more unity no more beauty  the woman who comes into the house of a widower the minister who steps into the place of a statesman in disgrace the molinist bishop who gets hold of the diocese of a jansenist bishopnone of these people cause more trouble than the intruding scarlet has caused to me  i can bear without disgust the sight of a peasantwoman the bit of coarse canvas that covers her head the hair falling about her cheeks the rags that only half cover her the poor short skirt that goes no more than halfway down her legs the naked feet covered with mudall these things do not wound me tis the image of a condition that i respect tis the sign and summary of a state that is inevitable that is woful and that i pity with all my heart but my gorge rises and in spite of the scented air that follows her i turn my eyes from the courtesan whose fine lace headgear and torn cuffs white stockings and wornout shoes show me the misery of the day in company with the opulence of last night such would my house have been if the imperious scarlet had not forced all into harmony with itself i had two engravings that were not without merit poussins manna in the wilderness and the same painters esther before ahasuerus the one is driven out in shame by some old man of rubenss the fall of the manna is scattered to the winds by a storm of vernets the old straw chair is banished to the anteroom by a luxurious thing of morocco homer virgil horace cicero have been taken from their shelf and shut up in a case of grand marqueterie work an asylum worthier of them than of me the wooden table still held its ground protected by a vast pile of pamphlets and papers heaped pellmell upon it they seemed as if they would long protect it from its doom yet one day that too was mastered by fate and in spite of my idleness pamphlets and papers went to arrange themselves in the shelves of a costly bureau it was thus that the edifying retreat of the philosopher became transformed into the scandalous cabinet of the farmergeneral thus i too am insulting the national misery  of my early mediocrity there remained only a list carpet the shabby carpet hardly matches with my luxury i feel it but i have sworn and i swear that i will keep this carpet as the peasant who was raised from the hut to the palace of his sovereign still kept his wooden shoes when in a morning clad in the sumptuous scarlet i enter my room if i lower my eyes i perceive my old list carpet it recalls to me my early state and rising pride stands checked no my friend i am not corrupted my door is open as ever to want it finds me affable as ever i listen to its tale i counsel i pity i succour it   yet the interior of socratesdiderot was as little blessed by domestic sympathy as the interior of the older and greater socrates of course diderot was far enough from being faultless his wife is described by rousseau as a shrew and a scold it is too plain that she was so sullen to her husband impatient with her children and exacting and unreasonable with her servants196 we cannot pretend accurately to divide the blame the companionship was very dreary and the picture grievous and most afflicting to our thoughts diderot returns in the evening from holbachs throws his carpetbag in at the door flies off to seek a letter from mademoiselle voland writes one to her gets back to his house at midnight finds his daughter ill puts cheerful and cordial questions to his wife she replies with a tartness that drives him back into silence197 another time the scene is violent a torrent of injustice and unreasonableness flows over him for two long hours and he wonders what the woman will profit after she has made him burst a bloodvessel he groans in anguish ah how hard life seems to me to bear how many a time would i accept the end of it with joy198 so sharp are the goads in a divided house so sorely with ache and smart and deepwelling tears do men and women rend into shreds the fine web of one anothers lives but the pity of it o the pity of it  there are many brighter intervals which make one willing to suppose that if the wife had been a little more patient more tolerant more cheerful less severely addicted to her sterile superstition there might have been somewhat more happiness in the house one misery of the present social ideal of women is that while it keeps them so systematically ignorant superstitious and narrow it leaves them without humility be content said the great john wesley to his froward wife be content to be a private insignificant person known and loved by god and me of what importance is your character to mankind if you was buried just now or if you had never lived what loss would it be to the cause of god this energetic remonstrance can hardly be said to exhaust the matter still it puts a wholesome side of the case which madame diderot missed and which better persons are likely to miss so long as the exclusion of women by common opinion or by law from an active participation in the settlement of great issues makes them indifferent to all interests outside domestic egoism and egoistic and personal religion brighter intervals shone in the household i announced my departure writes diderot for next tuesday at the first word i saw the faces both of mother and daughter fall the child had a compliment for my fêteday all ready and it would not do to let her waste the trouble of having learnt it the mother had projected a grand dinner for sunday well we arranged everything perfectly i made my journey and came back to be harangued and feasted the poor child made her little speech in the most bewitching way in the middle there came some hard words so she stopped and said to me my papa tis because my two front teeth have come outas was true then she went on at the end as she had a posy to give me and it could not be found she stopped a second time to say to meheres the worst of the tale my pinks have got lost then she started off in search of her flowers we dined in great style my wife had got all her friends together i was very gay eating drinking and doing the honours of my table to perfection on rising from table i stayed among them and played cards instead of going out i saw them all off between eleven and twelve i was charming and if you only knew with whom what physiognomies what folk what talk  another time the child whispering in his ear asks why her mother bade her not remind him that the morrow was the mothers fêteday the presence of the blithe allhoping young looking on with innocent unconscious eyes at the veiled tragedy of love turned to bitter discord gives to such scenes their last touch of piteousness diderot however observed the day and presented a bouquet which was neither well or ill received at the birthday dinner the master of the house presided if you had been behind the curtains you would have said to yourself how can all this gossip and twaddle find a place in the same head with certain ideas and in truth i was charming and played the fool to a marvel199  in the midst of distractions great and small was an indomitable industry i tell you he wrote and i tell all men when you are ill at ease with yourself instantly set about some good work in busying myself to soothe the trouble of another i forget my own he was assiduous in teaching his daughter though he complained that her mother crushed out in a day what it had taken him a month to implant the booksellers found him the most cheerful and strenuous bondsman that ever booksellers had he would pass a whole month without a days break working ten hours every day at the revision of proofsheets sometimes he remains a whole week without leaving his workroom he wears out his eyes over plates and diagrams bristling with figures and letters and with no more refreshing thought in the midst of this sore toil than that insult persecution torment trickery will be the fruit of it he not only spent whole days bent over his desk until he had a feeling as of burning flame within him he also worked through the hours of the night on one of these occasions worn out with fatigue and weariness he fell asleep with his head on his desk the light fell down among his papers and he awoke to find half the books and papers on the desk burnt to ashes i kept my own counsel about it he writes because a single hint of such an accident would have robbed my wife of sleep for the rest of her life200  his favourite form of holiday was a visit to holbachs country house at grandval here he spent some six weeks or more nearly every autumn after 1759 the manner of life there was delightful to him there was perfect freedom the mistress of the house neither rendering strict duties of ceremony nor exacting them diderot used to rise at six or at eight and remain in his own room until one reading writing meditating nobody was more exquisitely sensible than diderot to the charm of loitering over books over those authors as he said who ravish us from ourselves in whose hands nature has placed a fairy wand with which they no sooner touch us than straightway we forget the evils of life the darkness lifts from our souls and we are reconciled to existence201 the musing suggestiveness of reading when we read only for readings sake and not for reproduction nor direct use was as delightful to our laborious drudge as to others but he could indulge himself with little of this sweet idleness it was in harder labour that he passed most of his mornings these hours of work achieved he dressed and went down among his friends then came the midday dinner which was sumptuous host and guests both ate and drank more than was good for their health after a short siesta towards four oclock they took their sticks and went forth to walk among woods over ploughed fields up hills through quagmires delighting in nature as they went they talked of history or politics or chemistry of literature or physics or morality at sundown they returned to find lights and cards on the tables and they made parties of piquet interrupted by supper at halfpast ten the game ends they chat until eleven and in half an hour more they are all fast asleep202 each day was like the next industry gaiety bodily comfort mental activity diversifying the hours grimm was often there the most french of all the germans and galiani the most nimblewitted of men inexhaustible in story inimitable in pantomimic narration and yet with the keenest intellectual penetration shining through all his neapolitan prank and buffoonery holbach cared most for the physical sciences marmontel brought a vein of sentimentalism and helvétius a vein of cynical formalism diderot played socrates panurge pantophile questioning instructing combining pouring out knowledge and suggestion full of interest in every subject sympathetic with every vein relishing alike the newest philosophic hardihood the last too merry mood of holbachs motherinlaw the freshest piece of news brought by a traveller it was not at grandval that he found life hard to bear or would have accepted its close with joy and indeed if one could by miracle be transported back into the sixth decade of that dead century for a single day perhaps one might choose that such a day should be passed among the energetic and vivid men who walked of an afternoon among the fields and woods of grandval  the unblushing grossness of speech which even the ladies of the party permitted themselves cannot be reproduced in the decorous print of our age it is nothing less than inconceivable to us how diderot can have brought himself to write down in letters addressed to a woman of good education and decent manners some of the talk that went on at grandval the coarsest schoolboy of these days would wince at such shameless freedoms but it would be wrong to forget the allowance that must be made for differences in point of fashion diderot for instance in these very letters is wonderfully frank in his exposure of the details of his health he describes his indigestions and other more indescribable obstructions to happiness as freely as cicero wrote about the dysentery which punished him when after he had resisted oysters and lampreys at supper he yielded to a dish of beet and mallow so dressed with potherbs ut nil posset esse suavius whatever men could say to one another or to their surgeons they saw no harm in saying to women we have to remember how sir walter scotts greataunt about the very time when diderot was writing to mademoiselle voland had heard mrs aphra behns books read aloud for the amusement of large circles consisting of the first and most creditable society in london we think of swift in an earlier period of the century enclosing to stella some recklessly gross verses of his own upon bolingbroke and habitually writing to fine ladies in a way that falstaff might have thought too bad for doll tearsheet in saying that these coarse impurities are only points of manners we are as far as possible from meaning that they are on that account unimportant but it is childish to waste our time in censorious judgment on the individual who does no worse than represent a ruling type we can only note the difference and pass on  a characteristic trait in this rural life is diderots passion for high winds they gave him a transport and to hear the storm at night tossing the trees drenching the ground with rain and filling the air with the bass of its hoarse groundtones was one of his keenest delights203 yet diderot was not of those in whom the feeling for the great effects of nature has something of savagery he was above all things human and the human lot was the central source of his innermost meditations in the midst of gossip is constantly interpolated some passage of fine reflection on lifereflection as sincere as real coming as spontaneously from the writers inmost mood and genuine sentiment as little tainted either by affectation or by commonness as ever passed through the mind of a man some of these are too characteristic to be omitted and there is so little of what is exquisite in the flavour of diderots style that he perhaps suffers less from the clumsiness of translation than writers of finer colour or more stirring melody one of these passages is as follows  the last news from paris has made the baron anxious as he has considerable sums in royal securities he said to his wife listen my friend if this is going on i put down the carriage i buy you a good cloak and a good parasol and for the rest of our days we will bless the minister for ridding us of horses lackeys coachmen ladiesmaids cooks great dinnerparties false friends tiresome bores and all the other privileges of opulence and for my part i began to think that for a man without a wife or child or any of those connections that make us long for money and never leave any superfluity it would be almost indifferent whether he were poor or rich this paradox comes of the equality that i discover among various conditions of life and in the little difference that i allow in point of happiness between the master of the house and the hallporter if i am sound in mind and body if i have worth and a pure conscience if i know the true from the false if i avoid evil and do good if i feel the dignity of my being if nothing lowers me in my own eyes then people may call me what they will my lord or sirrah to do what is good to know what is truethat is what distinguishes one man from another the rest is nothing the duration of life is so short its true needs are so narrow and when we go away it all matters so little whether we have been somebody or nobody when the end comes all that you want is a sorry piece of canvas and four deal boards in the morning i hear the labourers under my window scarce has the day dawned before they are at work with spade and barrow delving and wheeling they munch a crust of black bread they quench their thirst at the flowing stream at noon they snatch an hour of sleep on the hard ground they are cheerful they sing as they work they exchange their good broad pleasantries with one another they shout with laughter at sundown they go home to find their children naked round a smokeblackened hearth a woman hideous and dirty and their lot is neither worse nor better than mine i came down from my room in bad spirits i heard talk about the public misery i sat down to a table full of good cheer without an appetite i had a stomach overloaded with the dainties of the day before i grasped a stick and set out for a walk to find relief i returned to play cards and cheat the heavyweighing hours i had a friend of whom i could not hear i was far from a woman whom i sighed for troubles in the country troubles in the town troubles everywhere he who knows not trouble is not to be counted among the children of men all gets paid off in time the good by the evil evil by good and life is naught perhaps tomorrow night or monday morning we may go to pass a day in town so i shall see the woman for whom i sighed and recover the man of whom i could not hear but i shall lose them the next day and the more i feel the happiness of being with them the worse i shall suffer at parting that is the way that all things go turn and turn and turn again there is ever a crumpled roseleaf to vex you204  it is not often that we find such active benevolence as diderots in conjunction with such a vein of philosophy as follows  ah what a fine comedy this world would be if only one had not to play a part in it if one existed for instance in some point of space in that interval of the celestial orbs where the gods of epicurus slumber far far away whence one could see this globe on which we strut so big about the size of a pumpkin and whence one could watch all the airs and tricks of that twofooted mite who calls itself man i would fain only look at the scenes of life in reduced size so that those which are stamped with atrocity may be brought down to an inch in space and to actors half a line high but how bizarre that our sense of revolt against injustice is in the ratio of the space and the mass i am furious if a large animal unjustly attacks another i feel nothing at all if it is two atoms that tear and rend how our senses affect our morality there is a fine text for philosophising205  what i see every day of physic and physicians does not much heighten my opinion of them to come into the world in imbecility in the midst of anguish and cries to be the toy of ignorance of error of necessity of sickness of malice of all passions to return step by step to that imbecility whence one sprang from the moment when we lisp our first words down to the moment when we mumble the words of our dotage to live among rascals and charlatans of every kind to lie expiring between a man who feels your pulse and another man who frets and wearies your head not to know whence one comes nor why one has come nor whither one is goingthat is what we call the greatest gift of our parents and of naturehuman life206  these sombre meditations hardly represent diderots habitual vein they are rather a reaction and a relief from the busy intensity with which he watches the scene and is constantly putting interrogatories to human life as day by day its motley circumstance passes before his eyes we should scarcely suspect from his frequent repetitions of the mournful eternal chorus of the nullity of man and the vanity of all the things that are under the sun how alert a watch he kept on incident and character with what keen and open ear he listened for any curious note of pain or voice of fine emotion or odd perversity of fate all this he does not in the hard temper of a balzac not with the calm or pride of a goethe but with an overflowing fulness of spontaneous and uncontrollable sympathy he is a sentimentalist in the rationalistic century not with the sentimentalism of misanthropy such as fired or soured rousseau but social largehearted manysided careless of the wise rigours of morality he is never callous nor neutral on the contrary he is always approving or disapproving but not from the standards of the ethical textbooks the casuistry of feeling is of everlasting interest to him and he is never tired of inventing imaginary cases or pondering real ones in which pliant feeling is invoked against the narrowness of duty these are mostly in a kind of matter which modern taste hardly allows us to reproduce nor after all is there much to be gained by turning the sanctities of human relationship with all their immeasurable bliss their immeasurable woe into the playthings of an idle dialectic it is pleasanter and for us english not less instructive than pleasant to see this dreaming restless thrice ingenious spirit half titan of the skies half gnome of the lower earth entering joyously or pitifully into the simple charm and natural tenderness of life as it comes and passes nothing delights him more than to hear or to tell such a story as this of madame depinay she had given a small lad eighteen sous for a days work at night he went home without a farthing when his mother asked him whether they had given him nothing for his work he said no the mother found out that this was untrue and insisted on knowing what had become of the eighteen sous the poor little creature had given them to an alehousekeeper where his father had been drinking all day and so he had spared the worthy man a rough scene with his wife when he got home207  from the pathos of kindly youth to the grace of lovable age the step is not far today i have dined with a charming woman who is only eighty years old she is full of health and cheerfulness her soul is still all gentleness and tenderness she talks of love and friendship with the fire and sensibility of a girl of twenty there were three men of us at table with her she said to us my friends a delicate conversation a true and passionate look a tear a touched expression those are the good things of the world as for all besides it is hardly worth talking of there are certain things that were said to me when i was young and that i remember to this day and any one of those words is to be preferred before ten glorious deeds by my faith i believe if i heard them even now my old heart would beat the quicker madame the reason is that your heart has grown no older no my son you are right it is as young as ever it is not for having kept me alive so long that i thank god but for having kept me kindhearted gentle and full of feeling208 all this was after diderots own heart and he declares such a conversation to be worth more than all the hours of talk on politics and philosophy that he had been having a few days before with some english friends we may understand how as we shall presently see a member of a society that could relish the beauty of such a scene would be likely to think englishmen hard surly and cheerless  his letters constantly offer us sensible and imaginative reflection he amused himself in some country village by talking to an old man of eighty i love children and old men the latter seem to me like some singular creatures that have been spared by caprice of fate he meets some old schoolfellows at langres nearly all the rest having gone well there are two things that warn us of our end and set us musingold ruins and the short duration of those who began life with us he is taken by a host overdevoted to such joys to walk among dungheaps after all he says it ought not to offend ones sense to an honest nose that has preserved its natural innocence tis not a goat but a bemusked and ambrescented woman who smelleth ill  when i compare our friendships to our antipathies i find that the first are thin small pinched we know how to hate but we do not know how to love  a poet who becomes idle does excellently well to be idle he ought to be sure that it is not industry that fails but that his gift is departing from him  comfort the miserable that is the true way to console yourself for my absence i recollect saying to the baron when he lost his first wife and was sure that there was not another days happiness left for him in this world hasten out of doors seek out the wretched console them and then you will pity yourself if you dare209  an infinitude of tyrannical things interpose between us and the duties of love and friendship and we do nothing aright a man is neither free for his ambition nor free for his taste nor free for his passion and so we all live discontented with ourselves one of the great inconveniences of the state of society is the multitude of our occupations and above all the levity with which we make engagements to dispose of all our future happiness we marry we go into business we have children all before we have common sense210  after some equivocal speculations as to the conduct of a woman who by the surrender of herself for a quarter of an hour to the desires of a powerful minister wins an appointment for her husband and bread for her six children he exclaims in truth i think nature heeds neither good nor evil she is wholly wrapped up in two objects the preservation of the individual and the propagation of the species211 true but the moral distinction between right and wrong is so much wrung from the forces that diderot here calls nature  the intellectual excitement in which he lived and the energy with which he promoted it sought relief either in calm or else in the play of sensibility a delicious repose he writes in one of his most harassed moments a sweet book to read a walk in some open and solitary spot a conversation in which one discloses all ones heart a strong emotion that brings the tears to ones eyes and makes the heart beat faster whether it comes of some tale of generous action or of a sentiment of tenderness of health of gaiety of liberty of indolencethere is the true happiness nor shall i ever know any other  a point in rhetorictowards six in the evening the party broke up i remained alone with d and as we were talking about the eloges on descartes that had been sent in to the academy i made two remarks that pleased him upon eloquence one that it is a mistake to try to stir the passions before convincing the reason and that the pathetic remains without effect when it is not prepared by the syllogism second that after the orator had touched me keenly i could not endure that he should break in upon this melting of the soul with some violent stroke that the pathetic insists on being followed by something moderate weak vague that should leave room for no contention on my part212  holbachs impressions of englandthe baron has returned from england he started with the pleasantest anticipations he had a most agreeable reception he had excellent health and yet he has returned out of humour and discontented discontented with the country which he found neither as populous nor as well cultivated as people say discontented with the buildings that are nearly all bizarre and gothic with the gardens where the affectation of imitating nature is worse than the monotonous symmetry of art with the taste that heaps up in the palaces what is firstrate what is good what is bad what is detestable all pellmell he is disgusted at the amusements which have the air of religious ceremonies with the men on whose countenances you never see confidence friendship gaiety sociability but on every face the inscription what is there in common between me and you disgusted with the great people who are gloomy cold proud haughty and vain and with the small people who are hard insolent and barbarous the only thing that i have heard him praise is the facility of travel he says there is not a village even on a crossroad where you do not find four or five postchaises and a score of horses ready to start there is no public education the collegessumptuous buildingspalaces to be compared to the tuileries are occupied by rich idlers who sleep and get drunk one part of the day and the rest they spend in training clumsily enough a parcel of uncouth lads to be clergymen in the fine places that have been built for public amusements you could hear a mouse run a hundred stiff and silent women walk round and round an orchestra that is set up in the middle the baron compares these circuits to the seven processions of the egyptians round the tomb of osiris a charming mot of my good friend garrick is that london is good for the english but paris is good for all the world there is a great mania for conversions and missionaries mr hume told me a story which will let you know what to think of these pretended conversions of cannibals and hurons a minister thought he had done a great stroke in this line he had the vanity to wish to show his proselyte and brought him to london they question his little huron and he answers to perfection they take him to church and administer the sacrament where as you know the communion is in both kinds afterwards the minister says to him well my son do you not feel yourself more animated with the love of god does not the grace of the sacrament work within you is not all your soul warmed yes says the huron the wine does one good but i think it would have done still better if it had been brandy213  two cases of consciencethe curé said that unhappy lovers always talked about dying but that it was very rare to find one who kept his word still he had seen one case it was that of a young man of family called soulpse he fell in love with a young lady of beauty and of good character but without money and belonging to a dishonoured family her father was in the galleys for forgery the young man who foresaw all the opposition and all the good grounds for opposition that he would have to encounter among his family did all that he could to cure himself of his passion but when he was assured of the uselessness of his efforts he plucked up courage to open the matter to his parents who wearied themselves with remonstrances our lover suddenly stopped them short saying i know all that you have to say against me i cannot disapprove of your reasons which i should be the first to urge against my own son if i had one but consider whether you would rather have me dead or badly married for it is certain that if i do not marry the woman that i love i shall die of it they treated this speech as it deserved the result does not affect that the young man fell sick faded from day to day and died but curé said i in the place of the father what would you have done i would have called my son i would have said soulpse has been your name hitherto never forget that it is yours no more and call yourself by what other name you please here is your lawful share of our property marry the woman you love so far from here that i may never hear speak of you again and god bless you for my part said old madame desclavelles if i had been the mother of the young madman i would have done exactly as his father did and let him die and upon this there was a tremendous division of opinion and an uproar that made the room ring again  the dispute lasted a long time and would be going on now if the cure had not broken it off by putting to us another case a young priest discontented with his profession flees to england apostatises marries according to the law and has children after a certain time he longs for his native country he comes back to france with his children and his wife after that again he is stricken by remorse he returns to his religion has scruples about his marriage and thinks of separating from his wife he opens his heart to our curé who finds the case very embarrassing and not venturing to decide it refers him to casuists and lawyers they all decide that he cannot with a sure conscience remain with his wife when the separation which the wife opposed with all her might was about to be legally effectedrather against the wishes of our curéthe husband fell dangerously ill when he knew that he could not recover he said to the curé my friend i wish to make public amends for my backsliding to receive the sacraments and to die in the hospital be kind enough to have me taken there i will take care to do no such thing the curé replied to him this woman is innocent she married you according to law she knew nothing of the obstacles that existed and these children what share have they in your sin you are the only wrongdoer and it is they who are to be punished your wife will be disgraced your children will be declared illegitimate and what is the gain of it all and the good curé stuck to his text he confessed his man the illness grew worse he administered the last sacraments the man died and his wife and children remained in possession of the titles they had we all approved the curés wisdom and grimm insisted on having his portrait taken214  chinese superiorityapropos of the chinese do you know that with them nobility ascends and descends never it is the children who ennoble their ancestors and not the ancestors the children and upon my word that is most sensible we are greater poets greater philosophers greater orators greater architects greater astronomers greater geometers than these good people but they understand better than we the science of good sense and virtue and if peradventure that science should happen to be the first of all sciences they would be right in saying that they have two eyes and we have only one and all the rest of the world is blind215  why women write good lettersshe writes admirably really admirably that is because good style is in the heart and that is why so many women talk and write like angels without ever having learnt either to talk or to write and why so many pedants will both talk and write ill all the days of their life though they were never weary of studyingonly without learning216  a little adventure has just happened here that proves that all our fine sermons on intolerance have as yet produced but poor fruit a young man of respectable birth some say apprentice to an apothecary others to a grocer took it into his head to go through a course of chemistry his master consented on condition that he should pay for board the lad agreed at the end of the quarter the master demanded the money and it was paid soon after another demand from the master the apprentice replied that he barely owed a single quarter the master denied that the first quarter had been paid the affair was taken into court the master is put on his oath and swears he had no sooner perjured himself than the apprentice produced his receipt and the master was straightway fined and disgraced he was a scoundrel who deserved it but the apprentice was a rash fellow whose victory was bought at a price dearer than life he had received in payment or otherwise from some colporteur two copies of christianity unveiled and one of them he had sold to his master the master informs against him the colporteur his wife and his apprentice are all three arrested and they have just been pilloried whipped and branded and the apprentice condemned to nine years of the galleys the colporteur to five years and the woman to the hospital for life do you see the meaning of this judgment a colporteur brings me a prohibited book if i buy more than one copy i am declared to be encouraging unlawful trading and exposed to a frightful prosecution you have read the man with forty crowns217 and will hardly be able to guess why it is placed under the ban in the judgment i am telling you of it is in consequence of the profound resentment that our lords and masters feel about a certain article tyrant in the philosophical dictionary they will never forgive voltaire for saying that it was better to have to do with a single wild beast which one could avoid than with a band of little subaltern tigers who are incessantly getting between your legs to return to those two unfortunate wretches whom they have condemned to the galleys when they come out what will become of them there will be nothing left for them to do save to turn highway robbers the ignominious penalties which take away all resource from a man are worse than the capital punishment that takes away his life218  method and genius an apologuethere was a question between grimm and m le roy of creative genius and coordinating method grimm detests method according to him it is the pedantry of letters those who can only arrange would do as well to remain idle those who can only get instruction from what has been arranged would do as well to remain ignorant what necessity is there for so many people knowing anything else besides their trade they said a great many things that i dont report to you and they would be saying things still if the abbé galiani had not interrupted them  my friends i remember a fable pray listen to it one day in the depths of a forest a dispute arose between a nightingale and a cuckoo each prizes its own gift what bird said the cuckoo has a song so easy so simple so natural so measured as mine  what bird said the nightingale has a song sweeter more varied more brilliant more touching than mine  the cuckoo i say few things but they are things of weight of order and people retain them  the nightingale i love to use my voice but i am always fresh and i never weary i enchant the woods the cuckoo makes them dismal he is so attached to the lessons of his mother that he would not dare to venture a single note that he had not taken from her now for me i recognise no master i laugh at rules what comparison between his pedantic method and my glorious bursts  the cuckoo tried several times to interrupt the nightingale but nightingales always go on singing and never listen that is rather their weakness ours carried away by his ideas followed them with rapidity without paying the least attention to the answers of his rival  so after some talk and countertalk they agreed to refer their quarrel to the judgment of a third animal but where were they to find this third equally competent and impartial it is not so easy to find a good judge they sought on every side as they crossed a meadow they spied an ass one of the gravest and most solemn that ever was seen since the creation of the world no ass had ever had such long ears ah said the cuckoo our luck is excellent our quarrel is a matter of ears here is our judge god almighty made him for the very purpose  the ass went on browsing he little thought that one day he would have to decide a question of music but providence amuses itself with this and many another thing our two birds bow very low compliment him upon his gravity and his judgment explain the subject of their dispute and beseech him with all deference to listen to their case and decide  but the ass hardly turning his heavy head and without losing a single toothsome blade makes them a sign with his ears that he is hungry and that he does not hold his court today the birds persist the ass goes on browsing at last his hunger was appeased there were some trees planted by the edge of the meadow now if you like said he you go there i will follow you shall sing i will digest i will listen and ill give you my opinion  the birds instantly fly away and perch on branches the ass follows them with the air and the step of a chief justice crossing westminster hall he stretches himself flat on the ground and says begin the court listens  says the cuckoo my lord there is not a word to lose i beg of you to seize carefully the character of my singing above all things deign my lord to mark its artifice and its method then filling its throat and flapping its wings at each note it sang out coucou coucou coucou coucou coucou coucou and after having combined this in every possible way it fell silent  the nightingale without any prelude pours forth his voice at once launches into the most daring modulations pursues the freshest and most delicate melodies cadences pauses and trills now you heard the notes murmuring at the bottom of its throat like the ripple of the brook as it loses itself among the pebbles now you heard them rising and gradually swelling and filling the air and lingering longdrawn in the skies it was tender glad brilliant pathetic but his music was not made for everybody  carried away by enthusiasm he would be singing still but the ass who had already yawned more than once stopped him and said i suspect that all you have been singing there is uncommonly fine but i dont understand a word of it it strikes me as bizarre incoherent and confused it may be you are more scientific than your rival but he is more methodic than you and for my part im for method  and then the abbé addressing m le roy and pointing to grimm with his finger there he said is the nightingale and you the cuckoo and i am the ass who decide in your favour goodnight  the abbés stories are capital but he acts in a way that makes them better still you would have died with laughing to see him stretch his neck into the air and imitate the fine note of the nightingale then fill his throat and take up the hoarse tone for the cuckoo and all that naturally and without effort he is pantomime from head to foot219  conversationtis a singular thing conversation especially when the company is tolerably large look at the roundabout circuits we took the dreams of a patient in delirium are not more incongruous still just as there is nothing absolutely unconnected in the head either of a man who dreams or of a lunatic so all hangs together in conversation but it would often be extremely hard to find the imperceptible links that have brought so many disparate ideas together a man lets fall a word which he detaches from what has gone before and what has followed in his head another does the same and then let him catch the thread who can a single physical quality may lead the mind that is engaged upon it to an infinity of different things take a colouryellow for instance gold is yellow silk is yellow care is yellow bile is yellow straw is yellow to how many other threads does not this thread answer madness dreaming the rambling of conversation all consist in passing from one object to another through the medium of some common quality220  annihilationthe conversation took a serious turn they spoke of the horror that we all feel for annihilation  ah cried father hoop be good enough to leave me out if you please i have been too uncomfortable the first time to have any wish to come back if they would give me an immortality of bliss for a single day of purgatory i would not take it the best that can befall us is to cease to be  this set me musing and it seemed to me that so long as i was in good health i should agree with father hoop but that at the last instant i should perhaps purchase the happiness of living again by a thousand nay ten thousand years of hell ah my dear if i thought that i should see you again i should soon persuade myself of what a daughter once succeeded in persuading her father on his deathbed he was an old usurer a priest had sworn to him that he would be damned unless he made restitution he resolved to comply and calling his daughter to his bedside said to her my child you thought i should leave you very rich and so i should but the man there insists that i shall burn in hellfire for ever if i die without making restitution you are talking nonsense father with your restitution and your damnation the daughter answered with your character i you will not have been damned ten years before you will be perfectly used to it  this struck him as true and he died without making restitution  and so behold us launched into a discussion on life and death on the world and its alleged creator  some one remarked that whether there be a god or no it is impossible to introduce that device either into nature or into a discussion without darkening it  another said that if a single supposition explained all the phenomena it would not follow from this that it is true for who knows whether the general order only allows of one reason what then must we think of a supposition which so far from resolving the one difficulty for the sake of which people imagined it only makes an infinity of others spring up from it  i believe my dear that our chat by the fireside still amuses you so i go on  among these difficulties is one that has been proposed ever since the world has been a world tis that men suffer without having deserved suffering there has been no answer to it yet tis the incompatibility of physical and moral evil with the nature of the eternal being this is how the dilemma is put it is either impotence or bad will impotence if he wished to hinder evil and could not bad will if he could have hindered it and did not will it a child would understand that it is this that has led people to imagine the fault of the first father of us all original sin future rewards and punishments the incarnation immortality the two principles of the manicheans the ormuzd and ahriman of the persians the doctrine of emanations the empire of light and darkness metempsychosis optimism and other absurdities that have found credit among the different nations of the earth where there is always to be found some hollow vision of a dream by way of answer to a clear precise and definite fact  on such occasions what is the part of good sense why the part that we took whatever the optimists may say we will reply to them that if the universe could not exist without sensible creatures nor sensible creatures without pain there was nothing to do but to leave chaos at peace they had got on very well for a whole eternity without any such piece of folly  the world a piece of folly ah my dear a glorious folly for all that tis according to some of the inhabitants of malabar one of the seventyfour comedies with which the eternal amuses himself  leibnitz the founder of optimism tells somewhere how there was in the temple of memphis a high pyramid of globes placed one above the others how a priest being asked by a traveller about this pyramid and its globes made answer that these were all the possible worlds and that the most perfect of them all was at the summit how the traveller curious to see this most perfect of all possible worlds mounted to the top of the pyramid and the first thing that caught his eyes as they turned towards the globe at the summit was tarquin outraging lucretia221  almost every letter reminds us that we are in the very height of the disputing arguing rationalistic century diderot delighted in this kind of argument as socrates or dr johnson delighted in it he was above all others the archetype and representative of the passion for moralising analysing and philosophising which made the epoch what it was but the rest of the world was all in the same vein if he came to paris in a coach from the country he found a young lady in it eager to demonstrate that serious passions are nowadays merely ridiculous that people only promise themselves pleasure which they find or not as the case may be that thus they spare themselves all the broken oaths of old days i took the liberty of saying that i was still a man of those old days so much the worse for you she said you either deceive or are deceived and one is as bad as the other222 if grimm and madame depinay and he were together they discussed ethics from morning to night diderot always on the side of the view that made most for the dignity and worth of human nature grimm is described on one of these occasions as having rather displeased madame depinay he was not sufficiently ready to disapprove the remark of a man of our acquaintance who said that it was right to observe the most scrupulous probity with ones friends but that it was mere dupery to treat other people better than they would treat us we maintained she and i that it was right and necessary to be honest and good with all the world without distinction223  here is another picture of discussion with an introduction that is thoroughly characteristic of diderots temper  this man looks at the human race only on its dark side he does not believe in virtuous actions he disparages them and denies them if he tells a story it is always about something scandalous and abominable i have just told you of the two women of my acquaintance of whom he took occasion to speak as ill as he could to madame le gendre they have their defects no doubt but they have also their good qualities why be silent about the good qualities and only pick out the defects there is in all that a kind of envy that wounds meme who read men as i read authors and who never burden my memory except with things that are good to know and good to imitate the conversation between suard and madame le gendre had been very vivacious they sought the reasons why persons of sensibility were so readily so strongly so deliciously moved at the story of a good action suard maintained that it was due to a sixth sense that nature had endowed us with to judge the good and the beautiful they pressed to know what i thought of it i answered that this sixth sense was a chimæra that all was the result of experience in us that we learnt from our earliest infancy what it was in our instinct to hide or to show when the motives of our actions our judgments our demonstrations are present to us we have what is called science when they are not present to our memory we have only what is called taste instinct and tact the reasons for showing ourselves sensible to the recital of good actions are numberless we reveal a quality that is worthy of infinite esteem we promise to others our esteem if ever they deserve it by any uncommon or worthy piece of conduct independently of all these views of interest we have a notion of order and a taste for order which we cannot resist and which drags us along in spite of ourselves every fine action implies sacrifice and it is impossible for us not to pay our homage to selfsacrificeand so forth224  alas all these endless debates and dialogues lacked the inspiration and the charm with which the genius of a plato could adorn the narrowest quibble between socrates and a sophist diderot said mademoiselle de lespinasse is an extraordinary man he is out of his place in society he was meant for the chief of a sect a greek philosopher instructing youth he pleases me greatly but his manner does not touch my soul225 and we understand this people disputed what virtue is but the dispute failed in that undefined spirit which makes men love and adore virtue goodness is surrounded with no spacious beauty it is clothed with none of the high associations of spontaneous piety the discussion seems close stifling and airless yet ages of loftier speech and greater spirituality have not always been so favourable to the affections or to the attachments of life in amiability that society has never been surpassed in sincerity of mutual sympathy and kindliness of mutual regard the common irregularity of morals was seen to be perfectly compatible not merely with a desire to please but with an honest anxiety to serve  of the thorough excellence of diderots heart of his friendliness and unwearied helpfulness time would fail us to tell mens conceptions of friendship differ as widely as their conceptions of other things some look to friendship for absolute exemption from all criticism and for a mutual admiration without limit or conditions others mistake it for the right of excessive criticism in season and out of season  diderot was content to take friendship as the right the duty or the privilege of rendering services without thought of requiring either them or gratitude for them back in return this we must confess to be rare no man that ever lived showed more sterling interest in furthering the affairs of others around him he seemed to admit every claim on his time his purse and his talents a stranger called upon him one day and begged diderot to write for him a puffing advertisement of a new pomatum diderot with a laugh sat down and wrote what was wanted the graver occasions of life found him no less ready damilaville lost one of his children and his wife was inconsolable it was diderot who was summoned and who cheerfully went for days together to soothe and divert her mind for his correspondent and for us he makes the tedium of his story beautiful by recalling the fine saying of a griefstricken woman in metastasio when they tried to console her by the example of abraham who was ready even to slay his son at the command of god ah god would never have given such an order to his mother  the abbé le monnier wrote the worst verses that ever were read a play that was instantly damned and a translation of terence that came into the world dead but bad writers are always the most shameless intruders on the time of good critics and we find diderot willingly spending hours over the abbés handwriting which was as wretched as what he wrote and then spending hours more in offering critical observations on verses that were only fit to be thrown into the fire the abbé being absent from paris and falling short of money requested diderot to sell for him his copy of the encyclopædia i have sold your encyclopædia said diderot but did not get so much as i expected for the rumour spread abroad by those scoundrels of swiss booksellers that they were going to issue a revised edition has done us some harm send for the nine hundred and fifty livres about £40 that belong to you and if that is not enough for your expenses besides the drawer that holds your money is another that holds mine i dont know how much there is but i will count it all at your disposal226  one jodin again was a literary hack who had been employed on the encyclopædia he died leaving a foolish and extravagant widow and a perverse and violent daughter the latter went on to the stage and diderot took as much trouble in advising her in seeking appointments for her in executing her commissions in investing her earnings in dealing with her relatives as if he had been her own father if his counsels on her art are admirable there is something that moves us with more than admiration in the good sense the right feeling the worthiness of his counsels on conduct and diderot did not merely moralise at large all that he says is real pointed and apt for circumstance and person the petulant damsel to whom they were addressed would not be likely to yawn over the sharp remonstrances the vigorous plain speaking the downright honesty and visible sincerity of his friendliness it appears that she had sense enough not to be offended with the frankness of her fathers old employer for after he has plainly told her that she is violent rude vain and not always too truthful she still writes to him from warsaw from dresden from bordeaux praying him to procure a certain bracelet for her to arrange her mothers affairs to find a good investment for twelve thousand francs when the mother was in the depths of indigence diderot insisted that she should take her meals at his own table and all this for no other reason than that the troublesome pair had been thrown in his way by the chance of human circumstance and needed help which he was able not without sacrifice to give mademoiselle jodin was hardly worthy of so good a friend her parents were protestants and as she was a convert she enjoyed a pension of some eight pounds a year that did not prevent her from one day indulging in some too sprightly sallies as the host was carried along the street for this she was put into prison and that is our last glimpse of the light creature227  men knew how to be as wrongheaded and as graceless as women we have already mentioned the name of landois in connection with diderots article on liberty landois seems to have been a marvel of unreasonableness but he was a needy man of letters and that was enough to make diderot ready to bear with him and to succour him he wound up an epistle abounding after the manner of the worthless failures of the world in reproaches and grievances against his benefactor with a cool request about a manuscript that was full of dangerous matter why that replied diderot is a work that might well be the ruin of me and it is after you have on two separate occasions charged me with the most atrocious and deliberate offences towards you that you now propose that i should revise and print your work you know that i have a wife and child that i am a marked man that you are putting me into the class of hardened offenders never mind you dont think of one of these things you take me for an imbecile or else you are one but you are no imbecile i see through mens designs and often enough i lend myself to them without deigning to disabuse them as to the stupidity which they impute to me it is enough if i perceive in their design some great service for them and not an excess of inconvenience for myself it is not i who am the fool so often as people take me for one diderot then seems half to forget to whom he is writing and pours out what reads like a long soliloquy on morals conduct and the philosophy of life he insists that man with all his highflying freedom of will is but a little link in a great chain of events he is a creature to be modified from without hence the good effects of example discourse education pleasures pains greatness misery hence a sort of philosophy of commiseration which attaches us strongly to the good and irritates us no more against the bad than against a windstorm that fills our eyes with dust if you adopt such principles as these they will reconcile you with others and yourself you will neither praise nor blame yourself for what you are to reproach others with nothing to repent yourself of nothingthese are the two first steps towards wisdom this is the philosophy that reconciles us with the human race and with life228  when he was in the very midst of all the toil and strife that the encyclopædia brought upon him he could not refuse to spend three whole days in working like a galleyslave at an account of an important discovery that had been made by some worthy people with whom he was acquainted slightly but while i was busy about their affairs my own are at a standstill i write to you from le bretons with a mass of uncorrected proofs before me and the printers crying out for them still grimm must be right when he says that time is not a thing of which we are free to dispose at our own fancy that we owe it first and foremost to our friends our relations our daily duties and that in the lavish profusion of our time on people who are indifferent there is nothing less than vice229 yet in spite of grimms most just remonstrance the lavish profusion always went on as before  there was one man and only one man for whose perverse and intractable spirit diderots most friendly patience helpfulness and devotion were no match i have already in dealing with rousseau230 said as much of the quarrel which he picked with diderot as the matter requires and it would be superfluous to go over the ground again from another side whether we listen to rousseaus story or to diderots story our judgment on what happened remains unchanged we have already seen how warm and close an intimacy subsisted between them in the days when diderot was a prisoner at vincennes 1749 when rousseau made up his mind to leave paris and turn hermit 1756 there was a loud outcry from the social group at holbachs they said to him in the least theological dialect of their day what sir walter scott had said to ballantyne when ballantyne thought of leaving edinburgh that when our saviour himself was to be led into temptation the first thing the devil thought of was to get him into the wilderness diderot remonstrated rather more loudly than rousseaus other friends but there was no breach and even no coolness what sort of humours were bred by solitude in rousseaus wayward mind we know and the confessions tell us how for a year and a half he was silently brooding over fancied slights and perhaps real pieces of heedlessness grimm who was diderots closest friend next to mademoiselle voland despised rousseau and rousseau detested grimm grimm he one day said to a disciple is the only man whom i have ever been able to hate madame depinay was compelled to go to geneva for her health and grimm easily persuaded diderot that rousseau was bound by all the ties of gratitude to accompany his benefactress on the expedition diderot wrote to the hermit a very strong letter to this effect it made rousseau furious he declined the urgent counsel he quarrelled outright and violently with grimm and after an angry and confusing interview with diderot all intercourse ceased with him also that man wrote diderot on the evening of this their last interview intrudes into my work he fills me with trouble and i feel as if i were haunted by a damned soul at my side may i never see him more he would make me believe in devils and hell231 and writing afterwards to some friend at geneva he recalls the days when he used to pour out the talk of intimacy with the man who has buried himself at the bottom of a wood where his soul has been soured and his moral nature has been corrupted yet how i pity him imagine that i used to love him that i remember those old days of friendship and that i see him now with crime on one side and remorse on the other with deep waters in front of him he will many a time be the torment of my thought our common friends have judged between him and me i have kept them all and to him there remains not one232 it was not in diderots nature to bear malice and when eight years later rousseau passed through paris on his illstarred way to england and the derbyshire hills diderot described the great pleasure that a visit from rousseau would give to him ah i do well he says not to let the access to my heart be too easy when anybody has once found a place in it he does not leave it without making a grievous rent tis a wound that can never be thoroughly cauterised233  it is needless to remind the neutral reader that rousseau uses exactly the same kind of language about his heart for this is the worst of sentimentalism that it is so readily bent into a substitution of indulgence to oneself for upright and manly judgment about others still we may willingly grant that in the present rupture of a long friendship it was not diderot who was the real offender too many honest people would be in the wrong he most truly said if jean jacques were in the right  of grimm i have already said elsewhere as much as is needful to be said234 his judgment in matters of conduct and character was cool and rather hard but it was generally sound he had a keen eye for what was hollow in the pretensions of the society in which he lived above all he had the keen eye of his countrymen for his own interest and for the use which he could make of other people the best thing that we know in his favour is that he should have won the friendship of diderot diderots attachment to grimm seems like an exaggeration of the excesses of the epoch of sentimentalism in germany  he pines for a letter from him as he pined for letters from mademoiselle voland if grimm had been absent for a few months their meeting was like a scene in a melodrama with what ardour we enclasped one another my heart was swimming i could not speak a word nor could he we embraced without speaking and i shed tears we were not expecting him we were all at dessert when he was announced here is m grimm m grimm i exclaimed with a loud cry and starting up i ran to him and fell on his neck he sat down and ate a poor meal you may be sure as for me i could not open my lips either to eat or to speak he was next to me and i kept pressing his hand and gazing at him235 mademoiselle voland appears on some occasion to have compared diderot with his friend no more comparison i beseech you my good friend between grimm and me i console myself for his superiority by frankly recognising it i am vain of the victory that i thus gain over my selflove and you must not deprive me of that little advantage236 grimm however knew better than diderot how to unite german sentimentalism with a steady selfishness i have just received from grimm writes goodnatured diderot a note that wounds my too sensitive spirit i had promised to write him a few lines on the exhibition of pictures in the salon he writes to me that if it is not ready tomorrow it will be of no use i will be revenged for this kind of hardness and in a way that becomes me i worked all day yesterday and all day today i shall pass the night at work and all tomorrow and at nine oclock he shall receive a volume of manuscript237 we may doubt whether his german friend would feel the force of a rebuke so extremely convenient to himself  while grimm was amusing himself at madame depinays country house diderot was working at the literary correspondence which grimm was accustomed to send to st petersburg and the courts of germany while grimm was hunting pensions and honorary titles at saxegotha or currying favour with frederick and waiting for gold boxes at potsdam diderot was labouring like any journeyman in writing on his behalf accounts and reviews of the books good bad and indifferent with which the paris market teemed when there were no new books to talk about the ingenious man with the resource of the born journalist gave extracts from books that did not exist238 when we hear of paris being the centre of european intelligence and literary activity we may understand that these circular letters of grimm and diderot were the machinery by which the light of paris was diffused among darker lands it is not too much to say that no contemporary record so intelligent so independent so vigorous so complete exists of any other remarkable literary epoch  the abbé raynal of whom we shall have more to say in a later chapter had founded this counterpart of a modern review in 1747 and he sent a copy of it in manuscript once a month to anybody who cared to pay three hundred francs a year in 1753 raynal had handed the business over to grimm and by him it was continued until 1790 twelve years beyond the life of voltaire and of rousseau and six years after the death of the ablest most original and most ungrudging of all those who gave him their help  an interesting episode in diderots life brought him into direct relations with one of the two crowned patrons of the revolutionary literature who were philosophers in profession and the most arbitrary of despots in their practice frederick the great whose literary taste was wholly in the vein of the conventional french classic was never much interested by diderots writing and felt little curiosity about him catherine of russia was sufficiently an admirer of the encyclopædia to be willing to serve its muchenduring builder in 1765 when the enterprise was in full course diderot was moved by a provident anxiety about the future of his daughter he had no dower for her in case a suitor should present himself and he had but a scanty substance to leave her in case of his own death the income of the property which he inherited from his father was regularly handed to his wife for the maintenance of the household his own earnings as we have seen were of no considerable amount there are men of letters he wrote in 1767 to whom their industry has brought as much as twenty thirty eighty or even a hundred thousand francs as for himself he thought that perhaps the fruit of his literary occupations would come to about forty thousand crowns or some five thousand pounds sterling one could not amass wealth he said pensively and his words are of grievous generality for the literary tribe but one could acquire ease and comfort if only these sums were not spread over so many years did not vanish away as they were gathered in and had not all been scattered and spent by the time that years had multiplied wants grown more numerous eyes grown dim and mind become blunted and worn239 this was his own case his earnings were never thriftily husbanded diderot could not deny himself a book or an engraving that struck his fancy though he was quite willing to make a present of it to any appreciative admirer the day after he had bought it he was extravagant in hiring a hackneycoach where another person would have gone on foot and not seldom the coachman stood for half a day at the door while the heedless passenger was expatiating within upon truth virtue and the fine arts unconscious of the passing hours and the swollen reckoning hence when the time came there were no savings we have to take a man with the defects of his qualities and as diderot would not have been diderot if he had taken time to save money there is no more to be said  when it became his duty to provide for his daughter between 1763 and 1765 he resolved to sell his library through grimm diderots position reached the ears of the empress of russia her agent was instructed to buy the library at the price fixed by its possessor and diderot received sixteen thousand livres a sum equal to something more than seven hundred pounds sterling of that day the empress added a handsome bounty to the bargain she requested diderot to consider himself the custodian of the new purchase on her behalf and to receive a thousand livres a year for his pains the salary was paid for fifty years in advance and so diderot drew at once what must have seemed to him the royal sum of between two and three thousand pounds sterlinga figure that would have to be trebled or perhaps quadrupled to convey its value in the money of our own day we may wish for the honour of letters that diderot had been able to preserve his independence but pensions were the custom of the time voltaire though a man of solid wealth did not disdain an allowance from frederick the great and complained shrilly because it was irregularly paid at the very time when he knew that frederick was so short of money that he was driven to melt his plate dalembert also had his pension from berlin and grimm as we have seen picked up unconsidered trifles in half of the northern courts frederick offered an allowance to rousseau but that strange man in whom so much that was simple touching and lofty mingled with all that was wayward and perverse declined to tax the kings strained finances240  it would shed an instructive light upon authorship and the characters of famous men if we could always know the relations between a writer and his booksellers diderots point of view in considering the great modern enginery and processes of producing and selling books was invariably like his practice that of a man of sound common sense and sterling integrity we have seen in the previous chapter something of the difficulties of the trade in those days the booksellers were a close guild of three hundred and sixty members and the printers were limited to thirtysix their privileges brought them little fortune they were of the lowest credit and repute and most of them were hardly better than beggars it was said that not a dozen out of the three hundred and sixty could afford to have more than one coat for his back they were bound hand and foot by vexatious rules and their market was gradually spoiled by a band of men whom they hated as interlopers but whom the public had some reason to bless no bookseller nor printer could open an establishment outside of the quarter of the university or on the north side of the bridges the restriction which was as old as the introduction of printing into france had its origin in the days when the visits of the royal inspectors to the presses and bookshops were constant and rigorous and it saved the time of the officials to have all their business close to their hand inasmuch however as people insisted on having books and as they did not always choose to be at the pains of making a long journey to the region of the booksellers shops hawkers sprang into existence men bought books or got them on credit from the booksellers and carried them in a bag over their shoulders to the houses of likely customers just as a peddler now carries laces and calico cheap silks and trumpory jewellery round the country villages even poor women filled their aprons with a few books took them across the bridges and knocked at peoples doors this would have been well enough in the eyes of the guild if the hawkers had been content to buy from the legally patented booksellers but they began secretly to turn publishers in a small way on their own account contraband was here as always the natural substitute for free trade they both issued pirated editions of their own and they became the great purchasers and distributors of the pirated editions that came in vast bales from switzerland from holland from the popes country of avignon to their craft or courage the public owed its copies of works whose circulation was forbidden by the government the persian letters of montesquieu was a prohibited book but for all that there were a hundred editions of it before it had been published twenty years and every schoolboy could find a copy on the quays for a dozen halfpence bayles thoughts on the comet rousseaus emilius and heloïsa helvétiuss lesprit and a thousand other forbidden pieces were in every library both public and private the social contract printed over and over again in endless editions was sold for a shilling under the vestibule of the kings own palace when the police were in earnest the hawker ran horrible risks as we saw a few pages further back for these risks he recompensed himself by his prices a prohibition by the authorities would send a book up within fourandtwenty hours from half a crown to a couple of louis this only increased the public curiosity quickened the demand led to clandestine reprints and extended the circulation of the book that was nominally suppressed when the condemnation of a book was cried through the streets the compositors said good another edition there was no favour that an unknown author could have asked from the magistrates so valuable to him as a little decree condemning his work to be torn up and burnt at the foot of the great staircase of the palace of justice241  it was this practical impossibility of suppression that interested both the guild of publishers and the government in the conditions of the book trade the former were always harassed often kept poor and sometimes ruined by systematic piracy and the invasion of their rights the government on the other hand could not help seeing that as the books could not possibly be kept out of the realm it was to be regretted that their production conferred no benefit on the manufacturing industry of the realm the composition the printing the casting of type the fabrication of paper the preparation of leather and vellum the making of machines and tools when bayles dictionary appeared it was the rage of europe hundreds of the everrenowned folios found their way into france and were paid for by french money the booksellers addressed the minister and easily persuaded him of the difference according to the economic light of those days between an exchange of money against paper compared with an exchange of paper against paper the minister replied that this was true but still that the gates of the kingdom would never be opened to a single copy of bayle the best thing to do he said is to print it here and the third edition of bayle was printed in france much to the contentment of the french printers binders and booksellers  in 1761 the booksellers were afflicted by a new alarm foreign pirates and domestic hawkers were doing them mischief enough but in that year the government struck a blow at the very principle of literary property the kings council conferred upon the descendants of la fontaine the exclusive privilege of publishing their ancestors works that is to say the council took away without compensation from la fontaines publishers a copyright for which they had paid in hard cash the whole corporation naturally rose in arms and in due time the lieutenant of police was obliged to take the whole matter into serious considerationwhether the maintenance of the guild of publishers was expedient whether the royal privilege of publishing a book should be regarded as conferring a definite and unassailable right of property in the publication whether the tacit permission to publish what it would have been thought unbecoming to authorise expressly by royal sanction should not be granted liberally or even universally and whether the old restriction of the booksellers to one quarter of the town ought to remain in force any longer m de sartine invited diderot to write him a memorandum on the subject and was disappointed to find diderot staunchly on the side of the booksellers 1767 he makes no secret indeed that for his own part he would like to see the whole apparatus of restraint abolished but meanwhile he is strong for doing all that a system of regulation as opposed to a system of freedom can do to make the publication of books a source of prosperity to the bookseller and of cheap acquisition to the bookbuyer above all things diderot is vehemently in favour of the recognition of literary property and against such infringement of it as had been ventured upon in the case of la fontaine he had no reason to be especially friendly to booksellers but for one thing he saw that to nullify or to tamper with copyright was in effect to prevent an author from having any commodity to sell and so to do him the most serious injury possible and for another thing diderot had equity and common sense enough to see that no highflown nonsense about the dignity of letters and the spiritual power could touch the fact that a book is a piece of marketable ware and that the men who deal in such wares have as much claim to be protected in their contracts as those who deal in any other wares242  there is a vivid illustration of this unexpected businesslike quality in diderot in a conversation that he once had with dalembert the dialogue is interesting to those who happen to be curious as to the characters of two famous men it was in 1759 when dalembert was tired of the encyclopædia and was for making hard terms as the condition of his return to it if said diderot to him six months ago when we met to deliberate on the continuation of the work you had then proposed these terms the booksellers would have closed with them on the spot but now when they have the strongest reasons to be out of humour with you that is another thing  and pray what reasons  can you ask me  certainly  then i will tell you you have a bargain with the booksellers the terms are stipulated you have nothing to ask beyond them if you worked harder than you were bound to do that was out of your interest in the book out of friendship to me out of respect for yourself people do not pay in money for such motives as these still they sent you twenty louis a volume that makes a hundred and forty louis that you had beyond what was due to you you plan a journey to wesel in 1752 to meet frederick of prussia at a time when you were wanted by them here they do not detain you on the contrary you are short of money and they supply you you accept a couple of hundred louis this debt you forget for two or three years at the end of that rather long term you bethink you of paying what do they do they hand you back your note of hand torn up with all the air of being very glad to have served you then after all you turn your back on an undertaking in which they have embarked their whole fortunes an affair of a couple of millions is a trifle unworthy of the attention of a philosopher like you but that is not all you have a fancy for collecting together different pieces scattered through the encyclopædia nothing can be more opposed to their interests they put this to you you insist the edition is produced they advance the cost you share the profits it seemed that after having thus twice paid you for their work they had a right to look upon it as theirs yet you go in search of a bookseller in some quite different direction and sell him in a mass what does not belong to you  they gave me a thousand grounds for dissatisfaction  quelle défaite there are no small things between friends everything weighs because friendship is a commerce of purity and delicacy but are the booksellers your friends then your behaviour to them is horrible if not then you have nothing to say against them if the public were called upon to judge between you and them my friend you would be covered with shame  what can it be you diderot who thus take the side of the booksellers  my grievances against them do not prevent me from seeing their grievances against you after all this show of pride confess now that you are cutting a very sorry figure243  all this was the language of good sense and there is no evidence that diderot ever swerved from that fair and honourable attitude in his own dealings with the booksellers yet he was able to treat them with a sturdy spirit when they forgot themselves panckoucke one of the great publishers of the time came to him one day he was swollen with the arrogance of a parvenu and thinking apparently that he could use me like one of those poor devils who depend upon him for a crust of bread he permitted himself to fly into a passion but it did not succeed at all i let him go on as he pleased then i got up abruptly i took him by the arm and i said to him m panckoucke in whatever place it may be in the street in church in a bad house and to whomsoever it may be it is always right to keep a civil tongue in ones head but that is all the more necessary still when you speak to a man who has as little patience as i have and that too in his own house go to the devil you and your work if you would give me twenty thousand louis and i could do your business for you in the twinkling of an eye i would not stir a finger be kind enough to be off244  before returning from the author to his books it is interesting to know how he and his circle appeared at this period to some who did not belong to them gibbon for instance visited paris in the spring of 1763 the moment he says was happily chosen at the close of a successful war the british name was respected on the continent clarum et venerabile nomen gentibus our opinions our fashions even our games were adopted in france a ray of national glory illuminated each individual and every englishman was supposed to be born a patriot and philosopher he mentions dalembert and diderot as those among the men of letters whom he saw who held the foremost rank in merit or at least in fame245  horace walpole was often in paris and often saw the philosophic circle but it did not please his supercilious humour       there was no soul in paris but philosophers whom i wished in      heaven though they do not wish themselves so they are so      overbearing and underbred i sometimes go to baron      dholbachs but i have left off his dinners as there was no      bearing the authors and philosophers and savants of which he      has a pigeonhouse full they soon turned my head with a      system of antediluvian deluges which they have invented to      prove the eternity of matter in short nonsense for      nonsense i liked the jesuits better than the      philosophers246  hume as everybody knows found the men of letters really very agreeable all of them men of the world living in entire or almost entire harmony among themselves and quite irreproachable in their morals he places diderot among those whose person and conversation he liked best  we have always heard much of the power of the salon in the eighteenth century and it was no doubt a remarkable proof of the incorporation of intellectual interests in manners that so many groups of men and women should have met habitually every week for the purpose of conversing about the new books and new plays the fresh principles and fresh ideas that were produced by the incessant vivacity of the time the salon of the eighteenth century passed through various phases its character shifted with the intellectual mood of the day but in all its phases it was an institution in which women occupied a place that they have never acquired in any society out of france we are not here called upon to speculate as to the reasons for this it is only worth remarking that diderot was not commonly at his ease in the society of ladies and that though he was a visitor at madame geoffrins and at mademoiselle lespinasses yet he was not a constant attendant at any of the famous circles of which women had made themselves the centre the reader of madame depinays memoir is informed how hard she found it to tame diderot into sociability what a pity she exclaims that men of genius and of such eminent merit as m diderot should thus wrap themselves up in their philosophy and disdain the homage that people would eagerly pay them in any society that they would honour with their presence247 one of the soundest social observers of the time was undoubtedly duclos his considerations on the manners of the century which was published in 1751 abounds in admirable criticism he makes two remarks with which we may close our chapter the relaxation of morals does not prevent people from being very loud in praise of honour and virtue those who have least of them know very well how much they are concerned in other people having them again the french he said are the only people among whom it is possible for morals to be depraved without either the heart being corrupted or their courage being weakened     chapter vii  the stage   there is at first something incredible in the account given by some thinkers of diderot as the greatest genius of the eighteenth century and perhaps an adjustment of such nice degrees of comparison among the high men of the world is at no time very profitable what is intended by these thoroughgoing panegyrists is that diderot placed himself at the point of view whence more comprehensively than was possible from any other he discerned the long course and the many bearings the complex faces and the large ramifications of the huge movement of his day he seized the great transition at every point and grasped all the threads that were to be inwoven into the pattern of the new time  diderot is in a thousand respects one of the most unsatisfactory of men and of writers yet it is hard to deny that to whatever quarter he turned he caught the rising illumination and was shone upon by the spirit of the coming day it was no copious and overflowing radiance but they were the beams of the dawn hence what he has to say and we shall soon see how much he said about the two great arts of painting and the drama though it is fragmentary though it is insufficient yet points as all the rest of his thoughts pointed along the lines that the best minds of the western world have since traversed he would in the old metaphysical language have called the direction of it a turning to nature but if we translate this into more positive terms just as we have said that the encyclopædia was a glorification of pacific industry and of civil justice so we may say that his whole theory of the drama was a glorification of private virtues and domestic life and the definite rise of civil justice and industry over feudal privilege and a life of war and again the elevation of domestic virtue into the place formerly held by patriotic devotion are the two great sides of a single movement248 it is quite true that diderot and the french of that day had only a glimpse of the promised land in art and poetry the whole moral energy of the generation after diderot was drawn inevitably into the strong current of social action the freshly kindled torch of dramatic art passed for nearly half a century to the country of lessing and goethe  there is in the use of a certain kind of abstract language this inconvenience that the reader may suppose us to be imputing to diderot a deliberate and systematic survey of the whole movement of his time and a calculated resolution to further it now in this way and now in that it is not necessary to suppose that the movement as a whole was always present to him diderots mind was constantly feeling for explanations it was never a passive recipient the drama excited this alert interest just as everything else excited it he thought about that as about everything else originally that is to say sincerely and in the spirit of reality249 whoever turns with a clear eye and proper intellectual capacity in search of the real bearings of what he is about is sure to find out the strong currents of the time even though he may never consciously throw them into their most general and abstract expression  since aristotle said lessing no more philosophical mind than diderots has treated of the theatre lessing himself translated diderots two plays and the essay on dramatic poetry and repeatedly said that without the impulse of diderots principles and illustrations his own taste would have taken a different direction as a dramatist the author of miss sara sampson of emilia galotti and above all that noble dramatic poem nathan the wise could hardly have owed much to the author of such poor stuff as the natural son and the father of the family lessing had some dramatic fire invention spontaneous elevation he had a certain measure though not a very large one of poetic impulse diderot had nothing of all these but he had the eye of the philosophic critic  any one who reads lessings dramatic criticisms will see that he did not at all overrate his obligations to his french contemporary250 it has been replied to the absurd taunt about the french inventing nothing that at least descartes invented german philosophy still more true is it that diderot invented german criticism  diderots thoughts on the stage besides his completed plays and a number of fragmentary scenes are contained principally in the paradox on the player a short treatise on dramatic poetry and three dialogues appended to the natural son on the plays a very few words will suffice the natural son must by me at least be pronounced one of the most vapid performances in dramatic history even lessing unwilling as he was to say a word against a writer who had taught him so much is too good a critic not to recognise monotony in the characters stiffness and affectation in the dialogue and a pedantic ring in the sentences of newfangled philosophy251 even in the three critical dialogues that diderot added to the play lessing cannot help discerning the mixture of superficiality with an almost pompous pretension rosenkranz it is true finds the play rich in fine sentences in scenes full of effect in which diderots moral enthusiasm expresses itself with impetuous eloquence but even he admits that the heros servant is not so far wrong when he cries il semble que le bon sens se soit enfui de cette maison and adds that the whole atmosphere of the piece is sickly with conscious virtue252 for ourselves we are ready for once even to sympathise with palissot the hackwriter of the reactionary parties when he says that the natural son had neither invention nor style nor characters nor any other single unit of a truly dramatic work the reader who seeks to realise the nullity of the genre sérieux in diderots hands should turn from the natural son to goldonis play of the true friend from which diderot borrowed the structure of his play following it as narrowly as possible to the end of the third act seldom has transfusion turned a sparkling draught into anything so flat and vapid in spite of the applause of the philosophic claque led by grimm253 posterity has ratified the coldness with which it was received by contemporaries the natural son was written in 1757 but it was not until 1771 that the directors of the french comedy could be induced to place it on the stage the actors detested their task and as we can very well believe went sulkily through parts which they had not even taken the trouble to master254 the public felt as little interest in the piece as the actors had done and after a single representation the play was put aside  illnatured critics compared diderots play with rousseaus opera they insisted that the natural son and the village conjuror were a couple of monuments of the presumptuous incompetence of the encyclopædic cabal the failure of the natural son as a drama came after it had enjoyed considerable success as a piece of literature for it had been fourteen years in print we can only suppose that this success was the fruit of an unflinching partisanship  it is a curious illustration of the strength of the current passion for moral maxims in season and out of season that one scene which to the scoffers of that day seemed as it cannot but seem to everybody today a climax of absurdity and unbecomingness was hailed by the party as most admirable for no other reason than that it contained a number of high moralising saws constance a young widow and a model of reason takes upon herself to combat the resolution of dorval not to marry after he has led her to suppose that he has a passion for her and after a marriage between them has been arranged no he cries a man of my character is not such a husband as befits constance constance begs him to reassure himself tells him that he is mistaken to enjoy tranquillity a man must have the approval of his own heart and perhaps that of other men and he can have neither unless he remains at his post it is only the wicked who can bear isolation a tender soul cannot view the general system of sensible beings without a strong desire that they should be happy dorval who cuts an extremely sorry figure in such a scene exclaims ah but children dorval would have children when i think that we are thrown from our very birth into a chaos of prejudices extravagances vices and miseries the idea makes me shudderdorval you are beset by phantoms and no wonder the history of life is so little known while the appearance of evil in the universe is so glaring dorval your daughters will be modest and good your sons noble and highminded all your children will be charming there is no fear that a cruel soul should ever grow in my bosom from stock of yours255  we can hardly wonder that players were disgusted or critics moved to wicked jests the counterpart to the scene in which constance persuades dorval that they would be very happy in one case is the scene in which dorval persuades rosalie that they would be very unhappy in another case the situations in themselves may command our approval morally but they certainly do not attract our sympathies dramatically that a woman should demonstrate to a man in fine sententious language the expediency of marrying her is not inconsistent with good sense but it is displeasing when a man tells a woman that though love draws in one way duty draws in the other we may admire his prudence but we are glad when so delicate a business comes to an end in the natural son the latter scene though very long is the less disagreeable of the two and just as in diderots most wordy and tiresome pages we generally find some one phrase some epithet some turn of a sentence whose freshness or strength or daring reveals a genius so in this scene we find a few lines whose energy reminds us that we are not after all in the hands of some obscure playwright whose works ought long ago to have been eaten by moths or burnt by fire those lines are a warning against the temptation so familiar in every age since paris was a guest in the halls of menelaus to take that fatal resolve all for love and the world well lost to do wrong says dorval is to condemn ourselves to live and to find our pleasure with wrongdoers it is to pass an uncertain and troubled life in one long and neverending lie to have to praise with a blush the virtue that we flung behind us to hear from the lips of others harsh words for our own action to seek a little calm in sophistical systems that the breath of a single good man scatters to the winds to shut ourselves for ever out from the spring of true joys the only joys that are virtuous austere sublime and to give ourselves up simply as a way of escape from ourselves to the weariness of those frivolous diversions in which the day flows away in selfoblivion and our life glides slowly from us and loses itself in waste256 a very old story no doubt but natural true and in its place  what adds to the flatness of the play is a device which diderot introduced on a deliberately adopted principle we mean the elaborate setting out of the acting directions every movement every gesture every silent pause is written down and we have the impression less of a play than of some strangely bald romance in the versified declamation which then reigned on the french stage nothing was left to natural action nothing was told by change of position by movement without speech or in short by any means other than discourse diderot repudiating the conventions of dramatic art and consulting nature or reality saw that there are many scenes in life in which it is more natural to the personages of the scene to move than to speak in which indeed motion is natural and speech is altogether unnatural if this be so in real life he said it should be so on the stage because nothing passes in the world which may not pass also in the theatre and as pantomime or expression of emotion feeling purpose otherwise than by speech has so much to do in life the dramatist should make abundant use of pantomime in composing stageplays nor should he trust to the actors invention and spontaneous sense of appropriateness he ought to write down the pantomime whenever it adds energy or clearness to the dialogue when it binds the parts of the dialogue together when it consists in a delicate play that is not easily divined and almost always he ought to write it down in the opening of a scene if any one is inclined to regard this as superfluous let him try the experiment of composing a play and then writing the pantomime or business for it he will soon see what follies he commits257  whatever we may think of the practice of writing the action as well as the words for the player nobody would now dispute the wisdom of what diderot says as to the part that pantomime fills in the highest kind of dramatic representation we must agree with his repeated laments over the indigence for purposes of full and adequate expression of every language that ever has existed or ever can exist258 my dear master he wrote to voltaire on the occasion of a performance of tancred if you could have seen clairon passing across the stage her knees bending under her her eyes closed her arms falling stiff by her side as if they were dead if you heard the cry that she uttered when she perceives tancred you would remain more convinced than ever that silence and pantomime have sometimes a pathos that all the resources of speech can never approach259 if we wonder that he should have thought it worth while to lay so much emphasis on what seems so obvious we have to remember that it did not seem at all obvious to people who were accustomed to the substitution of a mannered and symmetrical declamation for the energetic variety and manifold exuberance of passion and judgment in the daily lives of men  we have already seen that even when he wrote the letter on the deaf and dumb diderots mind was exercised about gesture as a supplement to discourse in that letter he had told a curious story of a bizarre experiment that he was in the habit of making at the theatre he used to go to the highest seats in the house thrust his fingers into his ears and then to the astonishment of his neighbours watch the performance with the sharpest interest as a constant playgoer he knew the words of the plays by heart and what he sought was to isolate the gesture of the performers and to enjoy and criticise that by itself he kept his ears tightly stopped so long as the action and play went well with the words as he remembered them and he only listened when some discord in gesture made him suppose that he had lost his place the people around him were more and more amazed as they saw him notwithstanding his stopped ears shed copious tears in the pathetic passages they could not refrain from hazarding questions to which i answered coldly that everybody had his own way of listening and that my way was to stop my ears so as to understand betterlaughing within myself at the talk to which my oddity gave rise and still more so at the simplicity of some young people who also put their fingers into their ears to hear after my fashion and were quite astonished that the plan did not succeed260 this was an odd and whimsical way of acting on a conviction which lay deep in diderots mind namely that language is a very poor misleading and utterly inadequate instrument for representing what it professes and what we stupidly suppose it to represent rousseau had expressed the same kind of feeling when he said that definitions might be good things if only we did not employ words in making them  a curious circumstance is worth mentioning in connection with the three dialogues appended to the natural son diderot informs his readers that the incidents of the natural son had actually occurred in real life and that he knew the personages in the dialogues it is assumed that the play had been written by the hero himself and the hero is the chief speaker not a word is said from which the reader would guess that diderot had borrowed the substance of his plot and some of its least insipid scenes from goldoni we can hardly wonder that he was charged with plagiarism yet it was not deliberate we may be sure when diderot was strongly seized by an idea outer circumstances were as if they did not exist he was swept up into the clouds diderot is a good and worthy man wrote madame geoffrin to the king of poland but he has such a bad head and he is so curiously organised that he neither sees nor hears what he does see and hear as the thing really is he is always like a man who is dreaming and who thinks all that he has dreamed quite real261  the father of the family written in 1758 and first acted in 1761 is very superior to the natural son it even enjoyed a certain popularity in germany it became an established favourite and in italy it was only less popular than a piece of goldonis the french were not quite so easy to please in 1761 its reception was undoubtedly favourable and it ran for more than a week in 1769 it was reproduced and according to diderots own account with enthusiasm there was a frightful crowd he says and people hardly remember such a success i was surprised at it myself my friends are at the height of exultation my daughter came home intoxicated with wonder and delight even madame diderot at length grew ashamed at having to confess that she had not seen her husbands triumph and throwing aside her horror of the stage was as deeply moved as every one else262  notwithstanding this satisfactory degree of success and though it was performed as late as 1835 the play never struck root in france it is indeed a play without any real quality or distinction diderot in his plays said madame de staël put the affectation of nature in the place of the affectation of convention263 the effect is still more disagreeable in the first kind of affectation than the second the father of the family is made more endurable than the natural son by a certain rapidity and fire in the action and a certain vigour in the characters of the impetuous son saint albin and the malignant brotherinlaw the commander but the dialogue is poor and the father of the family himself is as woolly and mawkish a figure as is usually made out of benevolent intentions and weak purpose combined the woes of the heavy father of the stage where there is no true pathos but only a sentimental version of it find us very callous the language has none of that exquisite grace and flexibility which makes a good french comedy of own day a piece by augier sandeau feuillet sardou so delightful diderot was right in urging that there is no reason why a play should be in verse but then the prose of a play ought to have a point elegance and highlywrought perfection which shall fill us with a sense of art though not the art of the poet diderot not only did not write comedy in such a style but he does not even so much as show consciousness that any difference exists between one kind of prose and another the blurred phrases and clipped sentences of what diderot would have called nature that is to say of real life are intolerable on the stage even he felt this for his characters though their dialogue is without wit or finish are still dull and tame of speech in a different way from that in which the people whom we may meet are dull and tame there is an art of a kind though of an extremely vapid kind  again though he may be right in contending that there is a serious kind of comedy as distinct from that gay comedy which is neighbour to farceof this we shall see more presentlyyet he is certainly wrong in believing that we can willingly endure five acts of serious comedy without a single relieving passage of humour contrast of character where all the characters are realistic and common is not enough we crave contrast in the dramatic point of view we seek occasional change of key that serious comedy should move a sympathetic tear is reasonable enough but it is hard to find that it grudges us a single smile the result of diderots method is that the spectator or the reader speedily feels that what he has before him substitutes for dramatic fulness and variety the flat monotony of a homily or a tract it would be hard to show that there is no true comedy without laughterterences hecyra for instancebut diderot certainly overlooked what lessing and most other critics saw so clearly that laughter rightly stirred is one of the most powerful agencies in directing the moral sympathies of the audiencethe very end that diderot most anxiously sought  it is mere waste of time to bestow serious criticism on diderots two plays or on the various sketches outlines and fragments of scenes with which he amused his very slight dramatic faculty if we wish to study the masterpieces of french comedy in the eighteenth century we shall promptly shut up the volumes of diderot and turn to the ease and soft gracefulness of marivauxs game of love and chance to the forcible and concentrated sententiousness of pirons métromanie to the salt and racy flavour of le sages turcaret gresset again and destouches wrote at least two comedies that were really fit for the stage and may be read with pleasure today neither of these compliments can fairly be paid to the natural son and the father of the family diderots plays ought to be looked upon merely as sketchy illustrations of a favourite theory as the rough drawings on the black board with which a professor of the fine arts may accompany a lecture on oil painting  one radical part of diderots dramatic doctrine is wholly condemned by modern criticism and it is the part which his plays were especially designed to enforce it is always he says virtue and virtuous people that a man ought to have in view when he writes oh what good would men gain if all the arts of imitation proposed one common object and were one day to unite with the laws in making us love virtue and hate vice it is for the philosopher to address himself to the poet the painter the musician and to cry to them with all his might o men of genius to what end has heaven endowed you with gifts if they listen to him speedily will the images of debauch cease to cover the walls of our palaces our vices will cease to be the organs of crime and taste and manners will gain can we believe that the action of two old blind people man and wife as they sought one another in their aged days and with tears of tenderness clasped one anothers hands and exchanged caresses on the brink of the grave so to saythat this would not demand the same talent and would not interest me far more than the spectacle of the violent pleasures with which their senses in all the first freshness of youth were once made drunk264  the emphasising moralists of diderots school never understood that virtue may be made attractive without pulling the reader or the spectator by the sleeve and urgently shouting in his ear how attractive virtue is when the heart of midlothian appeared 1818 a lady wrote about it as follows of late days especially since it has been the fashion to write moral and even religious novels one might almost say of the wise good heroines what a lively girl once said of her wellmeaning aunton my word she is enough to make anybody wicked had this very story been conducted by a common hand effie would have attracted all our concern and sympathy jeanie only cold approbation whereas jeanie without youth beauty genius warm passions or any other novel perfection is here our object from beginning to end this is enlisting the affections in the cause of virtue ten times more than ever richardson did for whose male and female pedants all excelling as they are i never could care half as much as i found myself inclined to do for jeanie before i finished the first volume265  in other words you must win us by kindling our sympathy not by formally commanding our moral approval to kindle sympathy your personage must be interesting must touch our pity or wonder or energetic fellowfeeling or sense of moral loveliness which is a very different thing from touching our mere sense of the distinctions between right and wrong direct homily excites no sympathy with the homilist deep pensive meditations on the moral puzzles of the world are not at all like didactic discourse but the father of the family was exactly fulfilling diderots notion of dramatic purpose and utility when he talked to his daughter in such a strain as this marriage my daughter is a vocation imposed by nature he who counts on bliss without alloy knows neither the life of man nor the designs of heaven if marriage exposes us to cruel pain it is also the source of the sweetest pleasures where are the examples of pure and heartfelt interest of real tenderness of inmost confidence of daily help of griefs divided of tears mingled if they be not in marriage what is there in the world that the good man prefers to his wife what is there in the world that a father loves more dearly than his children o sacred bond if i think of thee my whole soul is warmed and elevated266  but these virtuous ejaculations do not warm and elevate us in such a case words count for nothing it is actual presentation of beautiful character and not talk about it that touches the spectator it is the association of interesting action with character that moves us and inspires such better moods as may be within our compass diderot like many other people before and since sought to make the stage the great moral teacher that it may become so is possible it will not be by imitating the methods of that colossal type of histrionic failure the churchpulpit exhortation in set speeches always has been and always will be the feeblest bulwark against the boiling floods of passion that helpless virtue ever invented and it matters not at all whether the hortatory speeches are placed on the lips of mr talkative the son of saywell or of some tearful dummy labelled the father of the family267  yet one is half ashamed to use hard words about diderot he was so modest about his work so simple and unpretending so wholly without restless and fretting ambitions and so generous in his judgment of others he made his own dramatic experiment he thought little enough of it and he was wholly above the hateful vice of sourly disparaging competitors whether dead or living he knew that he was himself no master but he was manly enough to admire anybody who was nearer to mastery he was full of unaffected delight at sedaines busy and pleasing little comedy the philosopher without knowing it it was so simple without being stiff so eloquent without the shadow of effort or rhetoric after seeing it diderot ran off to the author to embrace him with many tears of joyful sympathy and gratitude sedaine like lillo the author of diderots favourite play of george barnwell was a plain tradesman and the success of his libretti for comic operas had not spoiled him he could find no more expansive words for his excited admirer than ah monsieur diderot que vous étes beau268 diderot was just as sensible of the originality and aristophanic gaiety of collés brilliant play truth in wine though collé detested the philosophic school from voltaire downwards and left behind him a bitterly contemptuous account of the natural son269  of all comic writers however the author of the andria and the heautontimorumenos was diderots favourite the half dozen pages upon terence which he threw off while the printers boy waited in the passage 1762 are one of the most easy flowing and delightful of his fragments there is such appreciation of terences suavity and tact of his just and fine judgment of his discrimination and character he admits that terence had no verve for that he commends the young poet to molière or aristophanes but as verve was exactly the quality most wanting to diderot himself he easily forgave its absence in terence and thought it amply replaced by his moderation his truth and his fine taste colman is praised for translating terence for here says diderot is the lesson of which colmans countrymen stand most in need the english comic writers have more verve than taste vanbrugh wycherley congreve and some others have painted vices and foibles with vigour it is not either invention or warmth or gaiety or force that is wanting to their pencil but rather that unity in the drawing that precision in the stroke that truth in colouring which distinguish portrait from caricature especially are they wanting in the art of discerning and seizing those naïf simple and yet singular movements of character which always please and astonish and render the imitation at once true and piquant270 criticism has really nothing to add to these few lines and if diderot in his last years read the school for scandal or the rivals he would have found no reason to alter his judgment  one english play had the honour of being translated by diderot this was the gamester not the gamester of shirley nor of garrick but of edward moore 1753 it is a good example of the bourgeois tragedy or domestic drama which diderot was so eager to see introduced on to the french stage the infatuation of beverley the tears and virtue of mrs beverley the prudence of charlotte and the sage devotion of her lover the sympathetic remorse of bates and even the desperation of stukely made up a picture of domestic misery and moral sentiment with which diderot was sure to fall in love lillos george barnwell with its direct and urgent moral was a still greater favourite and diderot compared the scene between maria and barnwell in prison to the despair of the philocletes of sophocles as the hero is heard shrieking at the mouth of his cavern271 just as a more modern critic has thought lillos other play the fatal curiosity worthy of comparison with the oedipus tyrannus  diderots feeling for shakespeare seems to have been what we might have anticipated from the whole cast of his temperament one of the scenes which delighted him most was that moment of awe when lady macbeth silently advances down the stage with her eyes closed and imitates the action of washing her hands as wondering that the old man should have so much blood in him i know nothing he exclaims so pathetic in discourse as that womans silence and the movement of her hands what an image of remorse272  it was not to be expected that diderot should indulge in those undiscriminating superlatives about shakespeare which are common in shakespeares country but he knew enough about him to feel that he was dealing with a giant i will not compare shakespeare he said to the belvedere apollo nor to the gladiator nor to antinoushe had compared terence to the medicean venusbut to the saint christopher of notre dame an unshapely colossus rudely carven but between whose legs we could all pass without our brows touching him273 not very satisfactory recognition perhaps but the saint christopher is better than voltaires drunken savage  it is not every dramatist who treats the art of acting as seriously as the art of composition the great author of wilhelm meister is the most remarkable exception to this rule and lessing is only second to him it is hardly possible for a man to be a great dramatist and it is simply impossible for a man to be a great critic of the drama who has not seriously studied the rules aims and conditions of stage representation hazlitt for instance has written some admirable pages about the poetry the imaginative conception the language of shakespeares plays but we find his limit when he says that king lear is so noble a play that he cannot bear to see it acted as if a play could be fully judged without reference to the conditions of the very object with which it was written a play is to be criticised as a play not merely as a poem the whole structure of a piece depends on the fact that it is to be acted its striking moments must be great dramatic not merely beautiful poetic moments they must have the intensity of pitch by which the effect of action exceeds the effect of narrative this intensity is made almost infinitely variable with the variations in the actors mastery of his art  diderot who threw so penetrating a glance into every subject that he touched even if it were no more than a glance has left a number of excellent remarks on histrionics the key to them all is his everlasting watchword watch nature follow her simple and spontaneous leading the paradox on the player is one of the very few of diderots pieces of which we can say that besides containing vigorous thought it has real finish in point of literary form there is not the flat tone the heavy stroke the loose shamble that give a certain stamp of commonness to so many of his most elaborate discussions in the paradox the thoughts seem to fall with rapidity and precision into their right places they are direct they are not overloaded with qualifications their clear delivery is not choked by a throng of asides and casual ejaculations usually diderot writes as if he were loath to let the sentence go and to allow the paragraph to come to an end here he lays down his proposition and without rambling passes on to the next the effort is not kept up quite to the close for the last half dozen pages have the ordinary clumsy mannerism of their author  what is the paradox that a player of the first rank must have much judgment selfpossession and penetration but no sensibility an actor with nothing but sense and judgment is apt to be cold but an actor with nothing but verve and sensibility is crazy it is a certain temperament of good sense and warmth combined that makes the sublime player274 why should he differ from the poet the painter the orator the musician it is not in the fury of the first impulse that characteristic strokes occur to any of these men it is in moments when they are tranquil and cool and such strokes come by an unexpected inspiration275 it is for coolness to temper the delirium of enthusiasm it is not the violent man who is beside himself that disposes of us that is an advantage reserved for the man who possesses himself the great poets the great actors and perhaps generally all the great imitators of nature whatever they may be are gifted with a fine imagination a great judgment a subtle tact a sure taste but they are creatures of the smallest sensibility they are equally well fitted for too many things they are too busy in looking in recognising and in imitating to be violently affected within themselves sensibility is hardly the quality of a great genius he will have justice but he will practise it without reaping all the sweetness of it it is not his heart but his head that does it all well then what i insist upon says diderot is that it is extreme sensibility that makes mediocre actors it is mediocre sensibility that makes bad actors and it is the absolute want of sensibility that prepares actors who shall be sublime276  this is worked out with great clearness and decision and some of the illustrations to which he resorts to lighten the dialogue are amusing enough perhaps the most interesting to us english is his account of garrick whose acquaintance he made towards the year 1765 he says that he saw garrick pass his head between two folding doors and in the space of a few seconds his face went successively from mad joy to moderate joy from that to tranquillity from tranquillity to surprise from surprise to astonishment from astonishment to gloom from gloom to utter dejection from dejection to fear from fear to horror from horror to despair and then reascend from this lowest degree to the point whence he had started277  of course his soul felt none of these emotions if you asked this famous man who by himself was as well worth a journey to england to see as all the wonders of rome are worth a journey to italy if you asked him i say for the scene of the little bakers boy he played it if you asked him the next minute for the scene from hamlet he played that too for you equally ready to sob over the fall of his pies and to follow the path of the dagger in the air278  apart from the central proposition diderot makes a number of excellent observations which show his critical faculty at its best as for example in answering the question what is the truth of the stage is it to show things exactly as they are in nature by no means the true in that sense would only be the common the really true is the conformity of action speech countenance voice movement gesture with an ideal model imagined by the poet and often exaggerated by the player and the marvel is that this model influences not only the tone but the whole carriage and gait again what is the aim of multiplied rehearsals to establish a balance among the different talents of the actors the supreme excellence of one actor does not recompense you for the mediocrity of the others which is brought by that very superiority into disagreeable prominence again accent is easier to imitate than movement but movements are what strike us most violently hence a law to which there is no exception namely under pain of being cold to make your denouement an action and not a narrative279  one of the strongest satires on the reigning dramatic style diderot found in the need that the actor had of the mirror the fewer gestures he said the better frequent gesticulation impairs energy and destroys nobleness it is the countenance the eyes it is the whole body that ought to move and not the arms280 there is no maxim more forgotten by poets than that which says that great passions are mute it depends on the player to produce a greater effect by silence than the poet can produce by all his fine speeches281 above all the player is to study tranquil scenes for it is these that are the most truly difficult he commends a young actress to play every morning by way of orisons the scene of athalie with joas to say for evensong some scenes of agrippina with nero and for benedicite the first scene of phædra with her confidante especially there is to be little emphasisa warning grievously needed by ninetynine english speakers out of a hundredfor emphasis is hardly ever natural it is only a forced imitation of nature282  diderot had perceived very early that the complacency with which his countrymen regarded the national theatre was extravagant he would not allow a comparison between the conventional classic of the french stage and the works of the greek stage he insisted in the case of the greeks that their subjects are noble well chosen and interesting that the action seems to develop itself spontaneously that their dialogue is simple and very close to what is natural that the dénouements are not forced that the interest is not divided nor the action overloaded with episodes in the french classic he found none of these merits he found none of that truth which is the only secret of pleasing and touching us none of that simple and natural movement which is the only path to perfect and unbroken illusion the dialogue is all emphasis wit glitter all a thousand leagues away from nature instead of artificially giving to their characters esprit at every point poets ought to place them in such situations as will give it to them where in the world did men and women ever speak as we declaim why should princes and kings walk differently from any man who walks well did they then gesticulate like raving madmen do princesses when they speak utter sharp hissings  people believe us to have brought tragedy to a high degree of perfection it is not so of all kinds of literature it is the most imperfect283  the ideas which appeared thus incongruously in the tales of 1748 reappeared in the direct essays on the drama in 1757 and 1758 we have left nothing undone he said to corrupt dramatic style we have preserved from the ancients that emphasis of versification which was so well fitted to languages of strong quantity and marked accent to vast theatres to a declamation that had an instrumental accompaniment and then we have given up simplicity of plot and dialogue and all truth of situation284 la motte nearly fifty years before had attacked the pseudoclassic drama he had inveighed against the unities against long monologues against the device of confidants and against verse his assault in which he had the powerful aid of fontenelle was part of that battle between moderns and ancients with which the literary activity of the century had opened the brilliant success of the tragedies of voltaire had restored the lustre of the conventional drama though voltaire infused an element of the romantic under the severity of the old forms but the drama had become even less like sophocles and euripides in zaïre than in phédre or iphigénie voltaire intended to constitute the french drama into an independent form he expected to be told that he was not like sophocles and he did not abstain from some singularly free railing against euripides the greek pieces often smacked too much of the tone of the fair to satisfy him they were too familiar and colloquial for a taste that had been made fastidious by the courtpieces of lewis xiv diderot was kept free from such deplorable criticism as this by feeling that the greek drama was true to the sentiment of the age that gave it birth and that the french drama if not in the hands of racine still even in the hands of voltaire and much more in the hands of such men as lagrangechancel and the elder crébillon was true to no sentiment save one purely literary artificial and barren he insists on the hopelessness of the stage unless men prepared themselves at every part for a grand return to nature we have seen what is his counsel to the actor he preaches in the same key to the scenepainter and the maker of costumes scenepainting ought to be more rigorously true than any other kind of picture let there be no distraction no extraneous suggestion to interfere with the impression intended by the poet have you a salon to represent let it be that of a man of taste and no more no ostentation and no gilding unless the situation expressly demands the contrary  in the dresses the same rule holds good under robes that are overladen with gold lace i only see a rich man what i want to see is a man pretty and simple draperies of severe tints are what we need not a mass of tinsel and embroidery a courageous actress has just got rid of her panier and nobody has found her any the worse for it ah if she only dared one day to show herself on the stage with all the nobility and simplicity of adjustment that her characters demand nay in the disorder into which she would be thrown by an event so terrible as the death of a husband the loss of a son and the other catastrophes of the tragic stage what would become round her dishevelled figure of all those powdered curled frizzled trickedout creatures sooner or later they must put themselves in unison o nature nature we can never resist her285  from all this we turn for a few moments only and not too cheerfully to the serbonian bog of dramatic rules and the metaphysics of the theatre there is no subject in literature not even the interpretation of the apocalypse which has given birth to such pedantic dismal and futile discussion the immense controversy carried on in books pamphlets sheets and flying articles mostly german as to what it was that aristotle really meant by the famous words in the sixth chapter of the poetics about tragedy accomplishing the purification of our moods of pity and sympathetic fear is one of the disgraces of human intelligence a grotesque monument of sterility the great taproot of fallacy has been and remains the incessant imputation of ethical or social purpose to the dramatist and the demand of direct and combined ethical or social effect from the drama there is no critic from the great aristotle downwards who has steered quite clear of these evil shallows diderot as we have seen least of all but diderot disarms the impatience which narrower critics kindle by this magnificent concession coming at the close of all especially remember that there is no general principle i do not know a single one of those that i have indicated which a man of genius cannot infringe with success286 here we listen to the voice of the genuine diderot and if this be granted we need not give more than a passing attention to the rules that have gone beforeabout the danger of borrowing in the same composition the shades both of the comic and of the tragic styles about movement being injurious to dignity and of the importance therefore of not making the principal personage the machinist of the piece about the inexpediency of episodic personagesand so forth the only remark worth making on these propositions is that whatever their value may be diderot at any rate like a true philosopher generalised from the facts of nature and art he did not follow the too common critical method of reading ones own ideas into a work of art and then taking them back again in the more imposing form of inevitable deductions from the work itself  what diderot conceived himself really to have done was to have sketched and constituted a new species in the great dramatic kingdom every one knows he said that there is tragedy and that there is comedy but we have to learn that there is room in nature and the art of the stage for a third division namely the genre sérieux a kind of comedy that has for its object virtue and the duties of man why should the writer of comedy confine his work to what is vicious or ridiculous in men why should not the duties of men furnish the dramatist with as ample material as their vices surely in the genre honnête et sérieux the subject is as important as in gay comedy the characters are as varied and as original the passions are all the more energetic as the interest will be greater the style will be graver loftier more forcible more susceptible of what we call sentiment a quality without which no style ever yet spoke to the heart the ridiculous will not be absent for the madness of actions and speeches when they are suggested by the misunderstanding of interests or by the transport of passion is the truly ridiculous thing in men and in life287  besides his own two pieces diderot would probably have pointed to terence as the author coming nearest to the genre sérieux if goethes bad play of stella had retained the close as he originally wrote it with the bigamous fernando in the last scene rejoicing over the devoted agreement of the two ladies and his daughter to live with him in happy unity that would perhaps have been a comedy of the genre sérieux with the duties of man gracefully adapted to circumstances  the theory of the genre sérieux has not led to the formation of any school of writers adopting it and working it out or to the production of any masterpiece that has held its ground as has happened in tragedy comedy and farce beaumarchais who at last achieved such a dazzling and portentous success by one dramatic masterpiece began his career as a playwright by following the vein of the father of the family but the marriage of figaro though not without strong traces of diderotian sentiment in pungent application yet is in its structure and composition less french than spanish it is quite true as rosenkranz says that the prevailing taste on the french stage in our own times favours above all else bourgeois romantic comedy written in prose288 but the strength of the romantic element in them would have been as little satisfactory to diderots love of realistic moralising as the conventional tragedy of the court of lewis xiv the fable of most of them turns on adultery and this is not within the method of the genre sérieux as expounded by diderot perhaps half a dozen comedies such for instance as the ideas of madame aubray by m dumas are of the genre sérieux but certainly there are not enough of such comedies to constitute a genuine diderotian school in france there is no need therefore to say more about the theory than this namely that though the drama is an imitative art yet besides imitation its effects demand illusion what cries diderot you do not conceive the effect that would be produced on you by a real scene with real dresses with speech in true proportion to the action with the actions themselves simple with the very dangers that have made you tremble for your parents for your friends for yourselves no we answer reproduction of reality does not move us as a powerful work of imagination moves us we may as well urge said burke that stones sand clay and metals lie in a certain manner in the earth as a reason for building with these materials and in that manner as for writing according to the accidental disposition of characters in nature289 common dangers do not excite us it is the presentation of danger in some uncommon form in some new combination in some fresh play of motive and passion that quickens that sympathetic fear and pity which it is the end of a play to produce and if this be so there is another thing to be said if we are to be deliberately steeped in the atmosphere of duty illusion is out of place the constant presence of that severe and overpowering figure stern daughter of the voice of god checks the native wildness of imagination restricts the exuberance of fancy and sets a rigorous limit to invention diderot used to admit that the genre sérieux could never take its right place until it had been handled by a man of high dramatic genius the cause why this condition has never come to pass is simply that its whole structure and its regulations repel the faculties of dramatic genius  besides the perfection of the genre sérieux diderot insisted that the following tasks were also to be achieved before the stage could be said to have attained the full glory of the other arts first a domestic or bourgeois tragedy must be created second the conditions of men their callings and situations the types of classes in short must be substituted for mere individual characters third a real tragedy must be introduced upon the lyric theatre finally the dance must be brought within the forms of a true poem  the only remark to be made upon this scheme touches the second article of it to urge the substitution of types of classes for individual character was the very surest means that could have been devised for bringing back the conventional forms of the pseudoclassic drama the very mark of that drama was that it introduced types instead of vigorously stamped personalities what would be gained by driving the typical king off the stage only to make room for the generalisation of a shopkeeper this was not the path that led to romanticism to andré chenier to de vigny to lamartine to victor hugo théophile gautier has told us that the fiery chiefs of the romantic school who suddenly conquered france at the close of the restoration divided the whole world into flamboyant and drab in the literature of the past they counted voltaire one of the drab and diderot a flamboyant290 if it be not too presumptuous in a foreigner to dissent we cannot but think that they were mistaken nothing could be farther removed at every part from diderots dramatic scheme than faust or götz von berlichingen or hernani  the truth is that it was impossible for an effective antagonism to the classic school to rise in the mind of an encyclopædist for the reason that the encyclopædists hated and ignored what they called the dark ages yet it was exactly the dark ages from which the great romantic revival drew its very lifebreath in the eighteenth century it has been said it was really the reminiscence of the classic spirit which was awakened in the newer life of europe and made prominent291 this is true in a certain historic sense of rousseaus politics and perhaps of voltaires rationalism in spite of the vein of mysticism which occasionally shows in him it is true in some degree of diderot himself if by classicism we mean the tendency to make man the centre of the universe classicism treats man as worthy and great living his life among cold and neutral forces this is the very opposite of the sinfulness imperfection and nothingness habitually imputed to man and the hourly presence of a whole hierarchy of busy supernatural agents placed about man by the middle ages yet we cannot but see that diderot was feeling for dramatic forms and subjects that would have been as little classic as romantic he failed in the search there is one play and only one of his epoch that is not classic and is not romantic but speaks independently the truest and best mind of the eighteenth century itself in its own form and language that play is nathan the wise     chapter viii  rameaus nephew   in hypochondriacal moments it has been said the world viewed from the æsthetic side appears to many a one a cabinet of caricatures from the intellectual side a madhouse and from the moral side a harbouring place for rascals292 we might perhaps extend this saying beyond the accidents of hypochondriasis and urge that the few wide profound and real observers of human life have all known and known often this fantastic consciousness of living in a strange distorted universe of lunatics knaves grotesques it is an inevitable mood to any who dare to shake the kaleidoscopic fragments out of their conventional and accepted combination who does not remember deep traces of such a mood in plato shakespeare pascal goethe and diderot who went near to having something of the deep quality of those sovereign spirits did not escape any more than they the visitation of the misanthropic spectre the distinction of the greater minds is that they have no temptation to give the spectre a permanent home with them as is done by theologians in order to prove the necessity of grace and another world or by cynics in order to prove the wisdom of selfishness in this world the greater minds accept the worse facts of character for what they are worth and bring them into a right perspective with the better facts they have no expectation of escaping all perplexities nor of hitting on answers to all the moral riddles of the world yet are they ever drawn by an invincible fascination to the feet of the mighty sphinx of society she bewilders them with questions that are never overheard by common ears and torments them with a mockery that is unobserved by common eyes the energetica socrates a diderotcannot content themselves with merely recording her everlasting puzzles still less with merely writing over again the already recorded answers they insist on scrutinising the moral world afresh they resolve the magniloquent vocabulary of abstract ethics into the small realities from which it has come they break the complacent repose of opinion and usage by a graphic irony the definitions of moral beings said diderot are always made from what such beings ought to be and never from what they are people incessantly confound duty with the thing as it is293 we shall proceed to give a short account of one or two dialogues in which he endeavours to keep clear of this confusion  by far the most important of these is rameaus nephew the fortunes of this singular production are probably unique in literary history in the year 1804 schiller handed to goethe the manuscript of a piece by diderot with the wish that he might find himself able to translate it into german as i had long says goethe cherished a great regard for this author i cheerfully undertook the task after looking through the original people can see i hope that i threw my whole soul into it294 when he had done his work he returned the manuscript to schiller schiller died almost immediately may 1805 and the mysterious manuscript disappeared goethe could never learn either whence it had come or whither it went he always suspected that the autograph original had been sent to the empress catherine at st petersburg and that schillers manuscript was a copy from that though goethe had executed his translation as he says not merely with readiness but even with passion the violent and only too just hatred then prevailing in germany for france and for all that belonged to france hindered any vogue which rameaus nephew might otherwise have had on the eve of austerlitz and of jena there might well be little humour for a satire from the french  thirteen years afterwards an edition of diderots works appeared in paris belins edition of 1818 but the editors were obliged to content themselves for rameaus nephew with an analysis of goethes translation in 1821 a lively sensation was produced by the publication of what professed to be the original text of the missing dialogue it was really a retranslation into french from goethe the fraud was not discovered for some time until in 1823 brière announced for his edition of diderots works a reprint from a genuine original this original he had procured from madame de vandeul diderots daughter who still survived she described it as a copy made in 1760 under the authors own eyes and this may have been the case though if so it must from some of the references have been revised after 1773 the two young men who had tried to palm off their retranslation from goethe as diderots own text at once had the effrontery to accuse brière and diderots daughter of repeating their own fraud a vivacious dispute followed between the indignant publisher and his impudent detractors at length brière appealed to the great jove of weimar goethe expressed his conviction that brières text was the genuine text of the original and this was held to settle the question yet goethes voucher for its correspondence with the copy handed to him by schiller was not really decisive evidence he admits that he executed the translation very rapidly and had no time to compare it closely with the french an identification nearly twenty years afterwards of verbal resemblances and minute references in a work that had been only a short time in his hands cannot be counted testimony of the highest kind we have thus the extraordinary circumstance that for a great number of years down almost to the present decade the text of the one masterpiece of a famous man who died so recently as 1784 rested on a single manuscript and that a manuscript of disputed authenticity295  critics differ extremely in their answers to the question of the subject or object of diderots singular farcetragedy one declares it to be merely a satirical picture of contemporary manners another insists that it is meant to be an ironical reductio ad absurdum of the theory of selfinterest by exhibiting a concrete example of its working in all its grossness a third holds that it was composed by way of rejoinder to palissots comedy les philosophes 1760 which had brought the chiefs of the rationalistic school upon the stage and presented them as enemies of the human race a fourth suspects that the personal and dramatic portions are no more than a setting for the discussion of the comparative merits of the french and italian schools of music the true answer is that the dialogue is all of these things because it is none of them it is neither more nor less than the living picture and account of an original drawn by a man of genius who was accustomed to observe human nature and society with a free unblinking vision and to meditate upon them deeply and searchingly  diderot goes to work with rameau in some sort and to a certain extent as shakespeare went to work with falstaff he is the artist reproducing with the variety and perfection of art a whimsical figure that struck his fancy and stirred the creative impulse ethics æsthetics manners satire are all indeed to be found in the dialogue but they are only there as incident to the central figure of the sketch the prodigy of parasites diderot had no special fondness for these originals yet he had a keen and just sense of their interest their character stands out from the rest of the world it breaks that tiresome uniformity which our bringing up our social conventions and our arbitrary fashions have introduced if one of them makes his appearance in a company he is like leaven fermenting and restoring to each person present a portion of his natural individuality he stirs people up moves them provokes to praise or blame he is a means of bringing out reality gives honest people a chance of showing what they are made of and unmasks the rogues296  hearing that the subject of diderots dialogue is the parasite the scholar will naturally think of that savage satire in which juvenal rehearses the thousand humiliations that virro inflicts on trebius how the wretched follower has to drink fiery stuff from broken crockery while the patron quaffs of the costliest from splendid cups of amber and precious stones how the host has fine oil of venafrum while the guest munches cabbage that has been steeped in rancid lampoil one plays daintily with mullet and lamprey while the other has his stomach turned by an eel as long as a snake and bloated in the foul torrent of the sewers virro has apples that might have come from the gardens of the hesperides while trebius gnaws such musty things as are tossed to a performing monkey on the town wall but the distance is immeasurable between juvenals scorching truculence and diderots halfironical halfserious sufferance juvenal knows that trebius is a base and abject being he tells him what he is and in the process blasts him diderot knows that rameau too is base and abject but he is so little willing to rest in the fat and easy paradise of conventions that he seems to be all the time vaguely wondering in his own mind how far this genius of grossness and paradox and bestial sophism is a pattern of the many with the mask thrown off he seems to be inwardly musing whether it can after all be true that if one draws aside a fold of the gracious outer robe of conformity there is no comeliness of life shining underneath but only this horror of the skeleton and the worm he restrains exasperation at the brilliant effrontery of his man precisely as an anatomist would suppress disgust at a pathological monstrosity or an astonishing variation in which he hoped to surprise some vital secret rameau is not crudely analysed as a vile type he is searched as exemplifying on a prodigious scale elements of character that lie furtively in the depths of characters that are not vile it seems as if diderot unconsciously anticipated that terrible that woful that desolating sayingthere is in every man and woman something which if you knew it would make you hate them rameau is not all parasite he is your brother and mine a product from the same rudimentary factors of mental composition a figure cast equally with ourselves in one of the countless moulds of the huge social foundry  such is the scientific attitude of mind towards character it is not philanthropic nor pitiful the fact that base characters exist and are of intelligible origin is no reason why we should not do our best to shun and to extirpate them this assumption of the scientific point of view this change from mere praise and blame to scrutiny this comprehension that mere execration is not the last word is a mark of the modern spirit besides juvenal another writer of genius has shown us the parasite of an ancient society lucian whose fertility wit invention mockery freshness of spirit and honest hatred of false gods make him the voltaire of the second century has painted with all his native liveliness more than one picture of the parasite the great mans creature at rome endures exactly the same long train of affronts and humiliations as the great mans creature at paris sixteen centuries later beginning with the anguish of the mortified stomach as savoury morsels of venison or boar are given to more important guests and ending with the anguish of the mortified spirit as he sees himself supplanted by a rival of shapelier person a more ingenious versifier a cleverer mountebank the dialogue in which lucian ironically proves that parasitic or the honourable craft of spunging has as many of the marks of a genuine art as rhetoric gymnastic or music is a spirited parody of socratic catechising and platonic mannerisms simo shows to tychiades as ingeniously as rameau shows to diderot that the spunger has a far better life of it and is a far more rational and consistent person than the orator and the philosopher297 lucians satire is vivid brilliant and diverting yet every one feels that diderots performance while equally vivid is marked by greater depth of spirit comes from a soil that has been more freely broken up and has been enriched by a more copious experience the ancient turned upon these masterpieces of depravation the flash of intellectual scorn the modern eyes them with a certain moral patience and something of that curious kind of interest looking half like sympathy which a hunter has for the object of his chase  the rameau of the dialogue was a real personage and there is a dispute whether diderot has not calumniated him evidence enough remains that he was at least a person of singular character and irregular disastrous life diderots general veracity of temperament would make us believe that his picture is authentic but the interest of the dialogue is exactly the same in either case juvenals fifth satire would be worth neither more nor less however much were found out about trebius  rameau is one of the most eccentric figures in the country where god has not made them lacking he is a mixture of elevation and lowness of good sense and madness the notions of good and bad must be mixed up together in strange confusion in his head for he shows the good qualities that nature has bestowed on him without any ostentation and the bad ones without the smallest shame for the rest he is endowed with a vigorous frame a particular warmth of imagination and an uncommon strength of lungs if you ever meet him unless you happen to be arrested by his originality you will either stuff your fingers into your ears or else take to your heels heavens what a monstrous pipe nothing is so little like him as himself one time he is lean and wan like a patient in the last stage of consumption you could count his teeth through his cheeks you would say he must have passed some days without tasting a morsel or that he is fresh from la trappe a month after he is stout and sleek as if he had been sitting all the time at the board of a financier or had been shut up in a bernardine monastery today in dirty linen his clothes torn and patched with barely a shoe to his foot he steals along with a bent head one is tempted to hail him and toss him a shilling tomorrow all powdered curled in a good coat he marches about with head erect and open mien and you would almost take him for a decent worthy creature he lives from day to day from hand to mouth downcast or sad just as things may go his first care of a morning when he gets up is to know where he will dine after dinner he begins to think where he may pick up a supper night brings disquiets of its own either he climbs to a shabby garret he has unless the landlady weary of waiting for her rent has taken the key away from him or else he shrinks to some tavern on the outskirts of the town where he waits for daybreak over a crust of bread and a mug of beer when he has not threepence in his pocket as sometimes happens he has recourse either to a hackneycarriage belonging to a friend or to a coachman of some man of quality who gives him a bed on the straw beside the horses in the morning he still has bits of the mattress in his hair if the weather is mild he measures the champs elysées all night long with the day he reappears in the town dressed over night for the morrow and from the morrow sometimes dressed for the rest of the week  diderot is accosted by this curious being one afternoon on a bench in front of the café de la régence in the palais royal they proceed in the thoroughly natural and easy manner of interlocutors in a platonic dialogue it is not too much to say that rameaus nephew is the most effective and masterly use of that form of discussion since plato diderots vein of realism is doubtless in strong contrast with platos poetic and idealising touch yet imaginative strokes are not wanting to soften the repulsive theme and to bring the sordid and the foul within the sphere of art for an example time has passed says rameau and that is always so much gained  iso much lost you mean  heno no gained people grow rich every moment a day less to live or a crown piece to the good tis all one when the last moment comes one is as rich as another samuel bernard who by pillaging and stealing and playing bankrupt leaves sevenandtwenty million francs in gold is no better than rameau who leaves not a penny and will be indebted to charity for a shroud to wrap about him the dead man hears not the tolling of the bell tis in vain that a hundred priests bawl dirges for him in vain that a long file of blazing torches go before his soul walks not by the side of the master of the funeral ceremonies to moulder under marble or to moulder under clay tis still to moulder to have around ones bier children in red and children in blue or to have not a creature what matters it  these are the gleams of the mens divinior that relieve the perplexing moral squalor of the portrait even here we have the painful innuendo that a thought which is solemnising and holy to the noble serves equally well to point a trait of cynical defiance in the ignoble  again there is an indirectly imaginative element in the sort of terror which the thoroughness of the presentation inspires for indeed it is an emotion hardly short of terror that seizes us as we listen to the stringent unflinching paradox of this heterogeneous figure rameau is the squalid and tattered satan of the eighteenth century he is a mephistopheles out at elbows a lucifer in low water yet always diabolic with the bright flash of the pit in his eye disgust is transformed into horror and affright by the trenchant confidence of his spirit the daring thoroughness and consistency of his dialectic the lurid sarcasm the vile penetration he discusses a horrible action or execrable crime as a virtuoso examines a statue or a painting he has that rarest fortitude of the vicious not to shrink from calling his character and conduct by their names he is one of swifts yahoos with the courage of its opinions he seems to give one reason for hating and dreading oneself the effect is of mixed fear and fascination as of a magician whose miraculous crystal is to show us what and how we shall be twenty years from now or as when a surgeon tells the tale of some ghastly disorder that may at the very moment be stealthily preparing for us a doom of anguish  hence our dialogue is assuredly no meat for little people nor for fools some of it is revolting in its brutal indecency even goethes selfpossession cannot make it endurable to him but it is a study to be omitted by no one who judges the corruption of the old society in france an important historic subject the picture is very like the corruption of the old society in rome we see the rotten material which the purifying flame of jacobinism was soon to consume out of the land with fiery swiftness we watch the very classes from which as we have been so often told the regeneration of france would have come if only demagogues and rabble had not violently interposed there is no gaiety in the style none of that laughter which makes such a delineation of the manners of the time as we find in collés play of truth in wine naïf true to nature and almost exhilarating in rameau we are afflicted by the odour of deadly taint  as the dialogue is not in every handnor could any one wish that it should bei have thought it worth while to print an english rendering of a considerable part of it in an appendix mr carlyle told us long ago that it must be translated into english and although such a piece of work is less simple than it may seem it appears right to give the reader an opportunity of judging for himself of the flavour of the most characteristic of all diderots performances only let no reader turn to it who has any invincible repugnance to that curious turn for wildbret which goethe has described as the secret of some arts      dixeris hæc inter varicosos centuriones     continuo crassum ridet pulfenius ingens     et centum græcos curto centusse licebit  as i have already said it must be judged as something more than a literary diversion you do not suspect sir philosopher says rameau that at this moment i represent the most important part of the town and the court as the painter of the picture says rameau confessed the vices that he had and that most of the people about us have but he was no hypocrite he was neither more nor less abominable than they he was only more frank and systematic and profound in his depravity this is the social significance of the dialogue this is what apart from other considerations makes rameaus nephew so much more valuable a guide to the moral sentiment of the time than merely licentious compositions like those of louvet or la olos its instructiveness is immense to those who examine the conditions that prepared the revolution rameau is not the greek akolastos of aristotle nor the creature of greek aponoia described by theophrastusthe castaway by individual idiosyncrasy the reprobate by accident the men whom he represented the courtiers the financiers the merchants the shopkeepers were immoral by formula and depraved on principle vice was a doctrine to them and wretchlessness of unclean living was reduced to a system of philosophy any one i venture to repeat who realises the extent to which this had corroded the ruling powers in france will perceive that the furious flood of social energy which the jacobins poured over the country was not less indispensable to france than the flood of the barbarians was indispensable for the transformation of the roman empire  scattered among the more serious fragments of the dialogue is some excellent byplay of sarcasm upon palissot and one or two of the other assailants of the new liberal school palissot is an old story the palissots are an eternal species the family never dies out and it thrives in every climate all societies know the literary dangler in great houses and the purveyor to fashionable prejudices not that he is always servile the reader i daresay remembers that la bruyère described a curious being in troilus the despotic parasite palissot eighteenth century or nineteenth century is often like troilus parasite and tyrant at the same time he usually happens to have begun life with laudable aspirations and sincere interests of his own and when alas the mediocrity of his gifts proves too weak to bear the burden of his ambitions the recollection of a generous youth only serves to sour old age      bel esprit abhorré de tous les bons esprits     il pense par la haine échapper au mépris     a force dattentats il se croit illustré     et sil nétait méchant il serait ignoré  palissot began with a tragedy he proceeded to an angry pamphlet against the encyclopædists and the fury for innovation then he achieved immense vogue among fine ladies bishops and the lighter heads of the town by the comedy in which he held diderot dalembert and the others up to hatred and ridicule finally after coming to look upon himself as a serious personage he disappeared into the mire of halfoblivious contempt and disgust that happily awaits all the poor palissots and all their works his name only survives in connection with the men whom he maligned he lived to be old as oddly enough spite so often does in the terror he had a narrow escape for he was brought before chaumette chaumette apostrophised the assailant of rousseau and diderot with rude energy but did not send him to the guillotine in this the practical disciple only imitated the magnanimity of his theoretical masters rousseau had declined an opportunity of punishing palissots impertinences and diderot took no worse vengeance upon him than by making an occasional reference of contempt to him in a dialogue which he perhaps never intended to publish  another subject is handled in rameaus nephew which is interesting in connection with the mental activity of paris in the eighteenth century music was the field of as much passionate controversy as theology and philosophy the bull unigenitus itself did not lead to livelier disputes or more violent cabals than the conflict between the partisans of french music and the partisans of italian music the horror of a jansenist for a molinist did not surpass that of a lullist for a dunist or afterwards of a gluckist for a piccinist298 lulli and rameau the uncle of our parasite had undisputed possession of paris until the arrival in 1752 of a company of italian singers the great quarrel at once broke out as to the true method and destination of musical composition is music an independent art appealing directly to a special sense or is it to be made an instrument for expressing affections of the mind in a certain deeper way the italians asked only for delicious harmonies and exquisite melodies the french insisted that these should be subordinate to the work of the poet the former were content with delight the latter pressed for significance the one declared that italian music was no better than a silly tickling of the ears the other that the overture to a french opera was like a prelude to a miserere in plainsong in 177273 the illustrious gluck came to paris his art was believed to reconcile the two schools to have more melody than the old french style and more severity and meaning than the purely italian style french dignity was saved but soon the old battle which had been going on for twenty years began to rage with greater violence than ever piccini was brought to paris by the neapolitan ambassador the old cries were heard in a shriller key than before pamphlets broadsheets sarcasms flew over paris from every side  was music only to flatter the ear or was it to paint the passions in all their energy to harrow the soul to raise mens courage to form citizens and heroes the coffeehouses were thrown into dire confusion and literary societies were rent by fatal discord even dinnerparties breathed only constraint and mistrust and the intimacies of a lifetime came to cruel end rameaus nephew was composed in the midst of the first part of this long campaign of a quarter of a century and its seems to have been revised by its author in the midst of the second great episode diderot declares against the school of rameau and lulli that he should do so was a part of his general reaction in favour of what he called the natural against the artifice and affectation goethe has pointed out the inconsistency between diderots sympathy for the less expressive kind of music and his usual vehement passion for the expressive in art he truly observes that diderots sympathy went in this way because the novelty and agitation seemed likely to break up the old stiff and abhorred fashion and to clear the ground afresh for other efforts299     end of vol i  printed by r  r clark limited edinburgh footnotes     footnote 1 oeuv xviii 505  footnote 2

of method instead of leaving the pretensions of the various creeds to cancel one another he invented a rather striking scene in which the priests of each creed are made to listen to the professions of their rival and then inveigh against his superstition and inconsistency the assumption on which diderots argument rests is that as so many different creeds all make the same exclusive claim the claim is equally false throughout volneys argument turns more directly on the merits and implies that all religions are equally morbid or pathological products because they all lead to conduct condemned by their own most characteristic maxims volneys concrete presentation of comparative religion was highly effective for destructive purposes though it would now be justly thought inadequate see oeuv de

elaborate edition of the novum organum introduct p 104 he disputes the statement of montuola and others that the celebrity of bacon dates from the encyclopædia all turns upon what we mean by celebrity what the encyclopædists certainly did was to raise bacon for a time to the popular throne from which voltaires newtonianism had pushed descartes mr fowler traces a chain of baconian tradition no doubt but he perhaps surrenders nearly as much as is claimed when he admits that the patronage of voltaire and the encyclopædists did much to extend the study of bacons writings besides producing a considerable controversy as to his true meaning on many questions of philosophy and theology  footnote 159 see above p 62 note  footnote 160 dalembert was not afraid to contend against the great

interested in the history of authorship may care to know the end of the matter copyright is no modern practice and the perpetual right of authors or persons to whom they had ceded it was recognised in france through the whole of the seventeenth century and threequarters of the eighteenth the perpetuity of the right had produced literary properties of considerable value for example boudots dictionary was sold by his executors for 24000 livres prévots manual lexicon and two dictionaries for 115000 livres but in 1777ten years after diderots pleathe council decreed that copyright was a privilege and an exercise of the royal grace the motives for this reduction of an authors right from a transferable property to a terminable privilege seem to have been first the general mania of the time for drawing up the threads of national life into the hands of the administration and second the hope of making money by a tariff of permissions the constituent assembly dealt with the subject with no intelligence nor care but the convention passed a law recognising in the author an exclusive right for his life and giving a property for ten years after his death to heirs or cessionaires the

lichtenbergs briefe aus england 1776 there is a criticism of the most admirably intelligent kind on garrick lord lytton gave an account of it to english readers in the fortnightly review february 1871 the following passage confirms what diderot says above  you have doubtless heard much of his extraordinary power of change of face here is one example of it when he played the part of sir john brute i was close to the stage and could observe him narrowly he entered with the corners of his mouth so turned down as to give to his whole countenance the expression of habitual sottishness and debauchery and this artificial form of the mouth he retained unaltered from the beginning to the end of the play with the exception only that as the play went on the lips gaped and hung more and more in proportion to the gradually increasing drunkenness of the character represented this madeup face was not produced by stagepaint but solely by muscular contraction and it must be so identified by garrick with his idea of sir john brute as to be spontaneously assumed by him whenever he plays that part otherwise his retention of such a mask without even once dropping it either from fatigue or surprise even in the most boisterous action of his part would be quite inexplicable  footnote 278 viii 382  footnote 279 viii 373 376 etc  footnote 280 as hamlet to his players nor do not saw the air
