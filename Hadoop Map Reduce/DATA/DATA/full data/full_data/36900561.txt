36900561	tommy and co   by jerome k jerome author of paul kelver idle thoughts of an idle fellow three men in a boat etc  london hutchinson and co paternoster row 1904     story the firstpeter hope plans his prospectus   come in said peter hope  peter hope was tall and thin cleanshaven but for a pair of side whiskers closecropped and terminating just below the ear with hair of the kind referred to by sympathetic barbers as getting a little thin on the top sir but arranged with economy that everywhere is povertys true helpmate  about mr peter hopes linen which was white though somewhat frayed there was a selfassertiveness that invariably arrested the attention of even the most casual observer  decidedly there was too much of itits ostentation aided and abetted by the retiring nature of the cutaway coat whose chief aim clearly was to slip off and disappear behind its owners back  im a poor old thing it seemed to say  i dont shineor rather i shine too much among these uptodate young modes  i only hamper you  you would be much more comfortable without me  to persuade it to accompany him its proprietor had to employ force keeping fastened the lowest of its three buttons  at every step it struggled for its liberty  another characteristic of peters linking him to the past was his black silk cravat secured by a couple of gold pins chained together  watching him as he now sat writing his long legs encased in tightly strapped grey trousering crossed beneath the table the lamplight falling on his freshcomplexioned face upon the shapely hand that steadied the halfwritten sheet a stranger might have rubbed his eyes wondering by what hallucination he thus found himself in presence seemingly of some young beau belonging to the early forties but looking closer would have seen the many wrinkles  come in repeated mr peter hope raising his voice but not his eyes  the door opened and a small white face out of which gleamed a pair of bright black eyes was thrust sideways into the room  come in repeated mr peter hope for the third time  who is it  a hand not over clean grasping a greasy cloth cap appeared below the face  not ready yet said mr hope  sit down and wait  the door opened wider and the whole of the figure slid in and closing the door behind it sat itself down upon the extreme edge of the chair nearest  which are youcentral news or courier demanded mr peter hope but without looking up from his work  the bright black eyes which had just commenced an examination of the room by a careful scrutiny of the smokegrimed ceiling descended and fixed themselves upon the one clearly defined bald patch upon his head that had he been aware of it would have troubled mr peter hope  but the full red lips beneath the turnedup nose remained motionless  that he had received no answer to his question appeared to have escaped the attention of mr peter hope  the thin white hand moved steadily to and fro across the paper  three more sheets were added to those upon the floor  then mr peter hope pushed back his chair and turned his gaze for the first time upon his visitor  to peter hope hack journalist long familiar with the genus printers devil small white faces tangled hair dirty hands and greasy caps were common objects in the neighbourhood of that buried rivulet the fleet but this was a new species  peter hope sought his spectacles found them after some trouble under a heap of newspapers adjusted them upon his high arched nose leant forward and looked long and up and down  god bless my soul said mr peter hope  what is it  the figure rose to its full height of five foot one and came forward slowly  over a tightfitting garibaldi of blue silk excessively decollete it wore what once had been a boys pepperandsalt jacket  a worsted comforter wound round the neck still left a wide expanse of throat showing above the garibaldi  below the jacket fell a long black skirt the train of which had been looped up about the waist and fastened with a cricketbelt  who are you  what do you want asked mr peter hope  for answer the figure passing the greasy cap into its other hand stooped down and seizing the front of the long skirt began to haul it up  dont do that said mr peter hope  i say you know you  but by this time the skirt had practically disappeared leaving to view a pair of muchpatched trousers diving into the righthand pocket of which the dirty hand drew forth a folded paper which having opened and smoothed out it laid upon the desk  mr peter hope pushed up his spectacles till they rested on his eyebrows and read aloudsteak and kidney pie 4d do large size 6d boiled mutton  thats where ive been for the last two weeks said the figurehammonds eating house  the listener noted with surprise that the voicethough it told him as plainly as if he had risen and drawn aside the red rep curtains that outside in gough square the yellow fog lay like the ghost of a dead seabetrayed no cockney accent found no difficulty with its aitches  you ask for emma  shell say a good word for me  she told me so  but my good mr peter hope checking himself sought again the assistance of his glasses  the glasses being unable to decide the point their owner had to put the question bluntly  are you a boy or a girl  i dunno  you dont know  whats the difference  mr peter hope stood up and taking the strange figure by the shoulders turned it round slowly twice apparently under the impression that the process might afford to him some clue  but it did not  what is your name  tommy  tommy what  anything you like  i dunno  ive had so many of em  what do you want  what have you come for  youre mr hope aint you second floor 16 gough square  that is my name  you want somebody to do for you  you mean a housekeeper  didnt say anything about housekeeper  said you wanted somebody to do for youcook and clean the place up  heard em talking about it in the shop this afternoon  old lady in green bonnet was asking mother hammond if she knew of anyone  mrs postwhistleyes i did ask her to look out for someone for me why do you know of anyone  have you been sent by anybody  you dont want anything too laborate in the way o cooking  you was a simple old chap so they said not much trouble  nono  i dont want muchsomeone clean and respectable  but why couldnt she come herself  who is it  well whats wrong about me  i beg your pardon said mr peter hope  why wont i do  i can make beds and clean roomsall that sort o thing  as for cooking ive got a natural aptitude for it  you ask emma shell tell you  you dont want nothing laborate  elizabeth said mr peter hope as he crossed and taking up the poker proceeded to stir the fire are we awake or asleep  elizabeth thus appealed to raised herself on her hind legs and dug her claws into her masters thigh  mr hopes trousers being thin it was the most practical answer she could have given him  done a lot of looking after other people for their benefit continued tommy  dont see why i shouldnt do it for my own  my deari do wish i knew whether you were a boy or a girl  do you seriously suggest that i should engage you as my housekeeper asked mr peter hope now upright with his back to the fire  id do for you all right persisted tommy  you give me my grub and a shakedown and say sixpence a week and ill grumble less than most of em  dont be ridiculous said mr peter hope  you wont try me  of course not you must be mad  all right  no harm done  the dirty hand reached out towards the desk and possessing itself again of hammonds bill of fare commenced the operations necessary for bearing it away in safety  heres a shilling for you said mr peter hope  rather not said tommy  thanks all the same  nonsense said mr peter hope  rather not repeated tommy  never know where that sort of thing may lead you to  all right said mr peter hope replacing the coin in his pocket dont  the figure moved towards the door  wait a minute  wait a minute said mr peter hope irritably  the figure with its hand upon the door stood still  are you going back to hammonds  no  ive finished there  only took me on for a couple o weeks while one of the gals was ill  she came back this morning  who are your people  tommy seemed puzzled  what dye mean  well whom do you live with  nobody  youve got nobody to look after youto take care of you  take care of me  dye think im a bloomin kid  then where are you going to now  going  out  peter hopes irritation was growing  i mean where are you going to sleep  got any money for a lodging  yes ive got some money answered tommy  but i dont think much o lodgings  not a particular nice class as you meet there  i shall sleep out tonight  taint raining  elizabeth uttered a piercing cry  serves you right growled peter savagely  how can anyone help treading on you when you will get just between ones legs  told you of it a hundred times  the truth of the matter was that peter was becoming very angry with himself  for no reason whatever as he told himself his memory would persist in wandering to ilford cemetery in a certain desolate corner of which lay a fragile little woman whose lungs had been but ill adapted to breathing london fogs with on the top of her a still smaller and still more fragile mite of humanity that in compliment to its only relative worth a pennypiece had been christened thomasa name common enough in all conscience as peter had reminded himself more than once  in the name of common sense what had dead and buried tommy hope to do with this affair  the whole thing was the veriest sentiment and sentiment was mr peter hopes abomination  had he not penned articles innumerable pointing out its baneful influence upon the age  had he not always condemned it wherever he had come across it in play or book  now and then the suspicion had crossed peters mind that in spite of all this he was somewhat of a sentimentalist himselfthings had suggested this to him  the fear had always made him savage  you wait here till i come back he growled seizing the astonished tommy by the worsted comforter and spinning it into the centre of the room  sit down and dont you dare to move  and peter went out and slammed the door behind him  bit off his chump aint he remarked tommy to elizabeth as the sound of peters descending footsteps died away  people had a way of addressing remarks to elizabeth  something in her manner invited this  oh well its all in the days work commented tommy cheerfully and sat down as bid  five minutes passed maybe ten  then peter returned accompanied by a large restful lady to whom surpriseone felt it instinctivelyhad always been and always would remain an unknown quantity  tommy rose  thats thethe article explained peter  mrs postwhistle compressed her lips and slightly tossed her head  it was the attitude of not illnatured contempt from which she regarded most human affairs  thats right said mrs postwhistle i remember seeing er thereleastways it was an er right enough then  what ave you done with your clothes  they werent mine explained tommy  they were things what mrs hammond had lent me  is that your own asked mrs postwhistle indicating the blue silk garibaldi  yes  what went with it  tights  they were too far gone  what made you give up the tumbling business and go to mrs ammonds  it gave me up  hurt myself  who were you with last  martini troupe  and before that  oh heaps of em  nobody ever told you whether you was a boy or a girl  nobody as id care to believe  some of them called me the one some of them the other  it depended upon what was wanted  how old are you  i dunno  mrs postwhistle turned to peter who was jingling keys  well theres the bed upstairs  its for you to decide  what i dont want to do explained peter sinking his voice to a confidential whisper is to make a fool of myself  thats always a good rule agreed mrs postwhistle for those to whom its possible  anyhow said peter one night cant do any harm  tomorrow we can think whats to be done  tomorrow had always been peters lucky day  at the mere mention of the magic date his spirits invariably rose  he now turned upon tommy a countenance from which all hesitation was banished  very well tommy said mr peter hope you can sleep here tonight  go with mrs postwhistle and shell show you your room  the black eyes shone  youre going to give me a trial  well talk about all that tomorrow  the black eyes clouded  look here  i tell you straight it aint no good  what do you mean  what isnt any good demanded peter  youll want to send me to prison  to prison  oh yes  youll call it a school i know  you aint the first thats tried that on  it wont work  the bright black eyes were flashing passionately  i aint done any harm  im willing to work  i can keep myself  i always have  whats it got to do with anybody else  had the bright black eyes retained their expression of passionate defiance peter hope might have retained his common sense  only fate arranged that instead they should suddenly fill with wild tears  and at sight of them peters common sense went out of the room disgusted and there was born the history of many things  dont be silly said peter  you didnt understand  of course im going to give you a trial  youre going to do for me  i merely meant that wed leave the details till tomorrow  come housekeepers dont cry  the little wet face looked up  you mean it  honour bright  honour bright  now go and wash yourself  then you shall get me my supper  the odd figure still heaving from its paroxysm of sobs stood up  and i have my grub my lodging and sixpence a week  yes yes i think thats a fair arrangement agreed mr peter hope considering  dont you mrs postwhistle  with a frockor a suit of trousersthrown in suggested mrs postwhistle  its generally done  if its the custom certainly agreed mr peter hope  sixpence a week and clothes  and this time it was peter that in company with elizabeth sat waiting the return of tommy  i rather hope said peter its a boy  it was the fogs you know  if only i could have afforded to send him away  elizabeth looked thoughtful  the door opened  ah thats better much better said mr peter hope  pon my word you look quite respectable  by the practical mrs postwhistle a working agreement benefiting both parties had been arrived at with the longtrained skirt while an ample shawl arranged with judgment disguised the nakedness that lay below peter a fastidious gentleman observed with satisfaction that the hands now clean had been well cared for  give me that cap said peter  he threw it in the glowing fire  it burned brightly diffusing strange odours  theres a travelling cap of mine hanging up in the passage  you can wear that for the present  take this halfsovereign and get me some cold meat and beer for supper  youll find everything else you want in that sideboard or else in the kitchen  dont ask me a hundred questions and dont make a noise and peter went back to his work  good idea that halfsovereign said peter  shant be bothered with master tommy any more dont expect  starting a nursery at our time of life  madness  peters pen scratched and spluttered  elizabeth kept an eye upon the door  quarter of an hour said peter looking at his watch  told you so the article on which peter was now engaged appeared to be of a worrying nature  then why said peter why did he refuse that shilling  artfulness concluded peter pure artfulness  elizabeth old girl weve got out of this business cheaply  good idea that halfsovereign  peter gave vent to a chuckle that had the effect of alarming elizabeth  but luck evidently was not with peter that night  pingles was sold out explained tommy entering with parcels had to go to bows in farringdon street  oh said peter without looking up  tommy passed through into the little kitchen behind  peter wrote on rapidly making up for lost time  good murmured peter smiling to himself thats a neat phrase  that ought to irritate them  now as he wrote while with noiseless footsteps tommy unseen behind him moved to and fro and in and out the little kitchen there came to peter hope this very curious experience it felt to him as if for a long time he had been illso ill as not even to have been aware of itand that now he was beginning to be himself again consciousness of things returning to him  this solidly furnished long oakpanelled room with its air of oldworld dignity and reposethis sober kindly room in which for more than half his life he had lived and workedwhy had he forgotten it  it came forward greeting him with an amused smile as of some old friend long parted from  the faded photos in stiff wooden frames upon the chimneypiece among them that of the fragile little woman with the unadaptable lungs  god bless my soul said mr peter hope pushing back his chair  its thirty years ago  how time does fly  why let me see i must be  dyou like it with a head on it demanded tommy who had been waiting patiently for signs  peter shook himself awake and went to his supper  a bright idea occurred to peter in the night  of course why didnt i think of it before  settle the question at once  peter fell into an easy sleep  tommy said peter as he sat himself down to breakfast the next morning  bytheby asked peter with a puzzled expression putting down his cup what is this  cauffee informed him tommy  you said cauffee  oh replied peter  for the future tommy if you dont mind i will take tea of a morning  all the same to me explained the agreeable tommy its your breakfast  what i was about to say continued peter was that youre not looking very well tommy  im all right asserted tommy never nothing the matter with me  not that you know of perhaps but one can be in a very bad way tommy without being aware of it  i cannot have anyone about me that i am not sure is in thoroughly sound health  if you mean youve changed your mind and want to get rid of me began tommy with its chin in the air  i dont want any of your uppishness snapped peter who had wound himself up for the occasion to a degree of assertiveness that surprised even himself  if you are a thoroughly strong and healthy person as i think you are i shall be very glad to retain your services  but upon that point i must be satisfied  it is the custom explained peter  it is always done in good families  run round to this addresspeter wrote it upon a leaf of his notebookand ask dr smith to come and see me before he begins his round  you go at once and dont let us have any argument  that is the way to talk to that young personclearly said peter to himself listening to tommys footsteps dying down the stairs  hearing the streetdoor slam peter stole into the kitchen and brewed himself a cup of coffee  dr smith who had commenced life as herr schmidt but who in consequence of difference of opinion with his government was now an englishman with strong tory prejudices had but one sorrow it was that strangers would mistake him for a foreigner  he was short and stout with bushy eyebrows and a grey moustache and looked so fierce that children cried when they saw him until he patted them on the head and addressed them as mein leedle frent in a voice so soft and tender that they had to leave off howling just to wonder where it came from  he and peter who was a vehement radical had been cronies for many years and had each an indulgent contempt for the others understanding tempered by a sincere affection for one another they would have found it difficult to account for  what tink you is de matter wid de leedle wench demanded dr smith peter having opened the case  peter glanced round the room  the kitchen door was closed  how do you know its a wench  the eyes beneath the bushy brows grew rounder  if id is not a wench why dress it  havent dressed it interrupted peter  just what im waiting to doso soon as i know  and peter recounted the events of the preceding evening  tears gathered in the doctors small round eyes  his absurd sentimentalism was the quality in his friend that most irritated peter  poor leedle waif murmured the softhearted old gentleman  id was de good providence dat guided heror him whichever id be  providence be hanged snarled peter  what was my providence doinglanding me with a gutterbrat to look after  so like you radicals sneered the doctor to despise a fellow human creature just because id may not have been born in burble and fine linen  i didnt send for you to argue politics retorted peter controlling his indignation by an effort  i want you to tell me whether its a boy or a girl so that i may know what to do with it  what mean you to do wid id inquired the doctor  i dont know confessed peter  if its a boy as i rather think it is maybe ill be able to find it a place in one of the officesafter ive taught it a little civilisation  and if id be a girl  how can it be a girl when it wears trousers demanded peter  why anticipate difficulties  peter alone paced to and fro the room his hands behind his back his ear on the alert to catch the slightest sound from above  i do hope it is a boy said peter glancing up  peters eyes rested on the photo of the fragile little woman gazing down at him from its stiff frame upon the chimneypiece  thirty years ago in this same room peter had paced to and fro his hands behind his back his ear alert to catch the slightest sound from above had said to himself the same words  its odd mused petervery odd indeed  the door opened  the stout doctor preceded at a little distance by his watchchain entered and closed the door behind him  a very healthy child said the doctor as fine a child as any one could wish to see  a girl  the two old gentlemen looked at one another  elizabeth possibly relieved in her mind began to purr  what am i to do with it demanded peter  a very awkward bosition for you agreed the sympathetic doctor  i was a fool declared peter  you haf no one here to look after de leedle wench when you are away pointed out the thoughtful doctor  and from what ive seen of the imp added peter it will want some looking after  i tinki tink said the helpful doctor i see a way out  what  the doctor thrust his fierce face forward and tapped knowingly with his right forefinger the right side of his round nose  i will take charge of de leedle wench  you  to me de case will not present de same difficulties  i haf a housekeeper  oh yes mrs whateley  she is a goot woman when you know her explained the doctor  she only wants managing  pooh ejaculated peter  why do you say dat inquired the doctor  you bringing up a headstrong girl  the idea  i should be kind but firm  you dont know her  how long haf you known her  anyhow im not a softhearted sentimentalist that would just ruin the child  girls are not boys persisted the doctor dey want different treatment  well im not a brute snarled peter  besides suppose she turns out rubbish  what do you know about her  i take my chance agreed the generous doctor  it wouldnt be fair retorted honest peter  tink it over said the doctor  a place is never home widout de leedle feet  we englishmen love de home  you are different  you haf no sentiment  i cannot help feeling explained peter a sense of duty in this matter  the child came to me  it is as if this thing had been laid upon me  if you look upon id dat way peter sighed the doctor  with sentiment went on peter i have nothing to do but dutyduty is quite another thing  peter feeling himself an ancient roman thanked the doctor and shook hands with him  tommy summoned appeared  the doctor tommy said peter without looking up from his writing gives a very satisfactory account of you  so you can stop  told you so returned tommy  might have saved your money  but we shall have to find you another name  what for  if you are to be a housekeeper you must be a girl  dont like girls  cant say i think much of them myself tommy  we must make the best of it  to begin with we must get you proper clothes  hate skirts  they hamper you  tommy said peter severely dont argue  pointing out facts aint arguing argued tommy  they do hamper you you try em  the clothes were quickly made and after a while they came to fit but the name proved more difficult of adjustment  a sweetfaced laughing lady known to fame by a title respectable and orthodox appears an honoured guest today at many a literary gathering  but the old fellows pressing round still call her tommy  the weeks trial came to an end  peter whose digestion was delicate had had a happy thought  what i propose tommyi mean jane said peter is that we should get in a woman to do just the mere cooking  that will give you more time toto attend to other things tommyjane i mean  what other things chin in the air  thethe keeping of the rooms in order tommy  thethe dusting  dont want twentyfour hours a day to dust four rooms  then there are messages tommy  it would be a great advantage to me to have someone i could send on a message without feeling i was interfering with the housework  what are you driving at demanded tommy  why i dont have half enough to do as it is  i can do all  peter put his foot down  when i say a thing i mean a thing  the sooner you understand that the better  how dare you argue with me fiddlededee  for two pins peter would have employed an expletive even stronger so determined was he feeling  tommy without another word left the room  peter looked at elizabeth and winked  poor peter  his triumph was shortlived  five minutes later tommy returned clad in the long black skirt supported by the cricket belt the blue garibaldi cut decollete the pepperandsalt jacket the worsted comforter the red lips very tightly pressed the long lashes over the black eyes moving very rapidly  tommy severely what is this tomfoolery  i understand  i aint no good to you  thanks for giving me a trial  my fault  tommy less severely dont be an idiot  aint an idiot  twas emma  told me i was good at cooking  said id got an aptitude for it  she meant well  tommy no trace of severity sit down  emma was quite right  your cooking isis promising  as emma puts it you have aptitude yourperseverance your hopefulness proves it  then why dye want to get someone else in to do it  if peter could have answered truthfully  if peter could have replied  my dear i am a lonely old gentleman  i did not know it untiluntil the other day  now i cannot forget it again  wife and child died many years ago  i was poor or i might have saved them  that made me hard the clock of my life stood still  i hid away the key  i did not want to think  you crept to me out of the cruel fog awakened old dreams  do not go away any moreperhaps tommy in spite of her fierce independence would have consented to be useful and thus peter might have gained his end at less cost of indigestion  but the penalty for being an antisentimentalist is that you must not talk like this even to yourself  so peter had to cast about for other methods  why shouldnt i keep two servants if i like  it did seem hard on the old gentleman  whats the sense of paying two to do the work of one  you would only be keeping me on out of charity  the black eyes flashed  i aint a beggar  and you really think tommyi should say jane you can manage thethe whole of it  you wont mind being sent on a message perhaps in the very middle of your cooking  it was that i was thinking of tommysome cooks would  you go easy advised him tommy till i complain of having too much to do  peter returned to his desk  elizabeth looked up  it seemed to peter that elizabeth winked  the fortnight that followed was a period of trouble to peter for tommy her suspicions having been aroused was sceptical of business demanding that peter should dine with this man at the club lunch with this editor at the cheshire cheese  at once the chin would go up into the air the black eyes cloud threateningly  peter an unmarried man for thirty years lacking experience would under crossexamination contradict himself become confused break down over essential points  really grumbled peter to himself one evening sawing at a mutton chop really theres no other word for itim henpecked  peter that day had looked forward to a little dinner at a favourite restaurant with his dear old friend blenkinsopp a bit of a gourmet tommythat means a man who likes what you would call elaborate cookingforgetful at the moment that he had used up blenkinsopp three days before for a farewell supper blenkinsopp having to set out the next morning for egypt  peter was not facile at invention  names in particular had always been a difficulty to him  i like a spirit of independence continued peter to himself  wish she hadnt quite so much of it  wonder where she got it from  the situation was becoming more serious to peter than he cared to admit for day by day in spite of her tyrannies tommy was growing more and more indispensable to peter  tommy was the first audience that for thirty years had laughed at peters jokes tommy was the first public that for thirty years had been convinced that peter was the most brilliant journalist in fleet street tommy was the first anxiety that for thirty years had rendered it needful that peter each night should mount stealthily the creaking stairs steal with shaded candle to a bedside  if only tommy wouldnt do for him  if only she could be persuaded to do something else  another happy thought occurred to peter  tommyi mean jane said peter i know what ill do with you  whats the game now  ill make a journalist of you  dont talk rot  it isnt rot  besides i wont have you answer me like that  as a devilthat means tommy the unseen person in the background that helps a journalist to do his workyou would be invaluable to me  it would pay me tommypay me very handsomely  i should make money out of you  this appeared to be an argument that tommy understood  peter with secret delight noticed that the chin retained its normal level  i did help a chap to sell papers once remembered tommy he said i was fly at it  i told you so exclaimed peter triumphantly  the methods are different but the instinct required is the same  we will get a woman in to relieve you of the housework  the chin shot up into the air  i could do it in my spare time  you see tommy i should want you to go about with meto be always with me  better try me first  maybe youre making an error  peter was learning the wisdom of the serpent  quite right tommy  we will first see what you can do  perhaps after all it may turn out that you are better as a cook  in his heart peter doubted this  but the seed had fallen upon good ground  it was tommy herself that manoeuvred her first essay in journalism  a great man had come to londonwas staying in apartments especially prepared for him in st jamess palace  said every journalist in london to himself if i could obtain an interview with this big man what a big thing it would be for me  for a week past peter had carried everywhere about with him a paper headed interview of our special correspondent with prince blank questions down lefthand column very narrow space for answers right hand side very wide  but the big man was experienced  i wonder said peter spreading the neatly folded paper on the desk before him i wonder if there can be any way of getting at himany dodge or trick any piece of low cunning any plausible lie that i havent thought of  old man martincalled himself martiniwas just such another commented tommy  come pay time saturday afternoon you just couldnt get at himsimply wasnt any way  i was a bit too good for him once though remembered tommy with a touch of pride in her voice got half a quid out of him that time  it did surprise him  no communed peter to himself aloud i dont honestly think there can be any method creditable or discreditable that i havent tried  peter flung the onesided interview into the wastepaperbasket and slipping his notebook into his pocket departed to drink tea with a lady novelist whose great desire as stated in a postscript to her invitation was to avoid publicity if possible  tommy as soon as peters back was turned fished it out again  an hour later in the fog around st jamess palace stood an imp clad in patched trousers and a pepperandsalt jacket turned up about the neck gazing with admiring eyes upon the sentry  now then young seventeenandsixpence the soot said the sentry what do you want  makes you a bit anxious dont it suggested the imp having a big pot like him to look after  does get a bit on yer mind if yer thinks about it agreed the sentry  how do you find him to talk to like  well said the sentry bringing his right leg into action for the purpose of relieving his left aint ad much to do with im myself not personly as yet  oh e aint a bad sort when yer know im  thats his shakedown aint it asked the imp where the lights are  thats it admitted sentry  you aint an anarchist  tell me if you are  ill let you know if i feel it coming on the imp assured him  had the sentry been a man of swift and penetrating observationwhich he wasnthe might have asked the question in more serious a tone  for he would have remarked that the imps black eyes were resting lovingly upon a rainwaterpipe giving to a skilful climber easy access to the terrace underneath the princes windows  i would like to see him said the imp  friend o yours asked the sentry  well not exactly admitted the imp  but there you know everybodys talking about him down our street  well yerll ave to be quick about it said the sentry  es off to night  tommys face fell  i thought it wasnt till friday morning  ah said the sentry thats what the papers say is it  the sentrys voice took unconsciously the accent of those from whom no secret is hid ill tell yer what yer can do continued the sentry enjoying an unaccustomed sense of importance  the sentry glanced left then right es a slipping off all by imself down to osborne by the 640 from waterloo  nobody knows itcept o course just a few of us  thats is way all over  e just ates  a footstep sounded down the corridor  the sentry became statuesque  at waterloo tommy inspected the 640 train  only one compartment indicated possibilities an extra large one at the end of the coach next the guards van  it was labelled reserved and in the place of the usual fittings was furnished with a table and four easychairs  having noticed its position tommy took a walk up the platform and disappeared into the fog  twenty minutes later prince blank stepped hurriedly across the platform unnoticed save by half a dozen obsequious officials and entered the compartment reserved for him  the obsequious officials bowed  prince blank in military fashion raised his hand  the 640 steamed out slowly  prince blank who was a stout gentleman though he tried to disguise the fact seldom found himself alone  when he did he generally indulged himself in a little healthy relaxation  with two hours run to southampton before him free from all possibility of intrusion prince blank let loose the buttons of his powerfully built waistcoat rested his bald head on the top of his chair stretched his great legs across another and closed his terrible small eyes  for an instant it seemed to prince blank that a draught had entered into the carriage  as however the sensation immediately passed away he did not trouble to wake up  then the prince dreamed that somebody was in the carriage with himwas sitting opposite to him  this being an annoying sort of dream the prince opened his eyes for the purpose of dispelling it  there was somebody sitting opposite to hima very grimy little person wiping blood off its face and hands with a dingy handkerchief had the prince been a man capable of surprise he would have been surprised  its all right assured him tommy  i aint here to do any harm  i aint an anarchist  the prince by a muscular effort retired some four or five inches and commenced to rebutton his waistcoat  how did you get here asked the prince  twas a bigger job than id reckoned on admitted tommy seeking a dry inch in the smeared handkerchief and finding none  but that dont matter added tommy cheerfully now im here  if you do not wish me to hand you over to the police at southampton you had better answer my questions remarked the prince drily  tommy was not afraid of princes but in the lexicon of her harassed youth police had always been a word of dread  i wanted to get at you  i gather that  there didnt seem any other way  its jolly difficult to get at you youre so jolly artful  tell me how you managed it  theres a little bridge for signals just outside waterloo  i could see that the train would have to pass under it  so i climbed up and waited it being a foggy night you see nobody twigged me  i say you are prince blank aint you  i am prince blank  should have been mad if id landed the wrong man  go on  i knew which was your carriageleastways i guessed it and as it came along i did a drop  tommy spread out her arms and legs to illustrate the action  the lamps you know explained tommy still dabbing at her faceone of them caught me  and from the roof  oh well it was easy after that  theres an iron thing at the back and steps  youve only got to walk downstairs and round the corner and there you are  bit of luck your other door not being locked  i hadnt thought of that  havent got such a thing as a handkerchief about you have you  the prince drew one from his sleeve and passed it to her  you mean to tell me boy  aint a boy explained tommy  im a girl  she said it sadly  deeming her new friends such as could be trusted tommy had accepted their statement that she really was a girl  but for many a long year to come the thought of her lost manhood tinged her voice with bitterness  a girl  tommy nodded her head  umph said the prince i have heard a good deal about the english girl  i was beginning to think it exaggerated  stand up  tommy obeyed  it was not altogether her way but with those eyes beneath their shaggy brows bent upon her it seemed the simplest thing to do  so  and now that you are here what do you want  to interview you  tommy drew forth her list of questions  the shaggy brows contracted  who put you up to this absurdity  who was it  tell me at once  nobody  dont lie to me  his name  the terrible small eyes flashed fire  but tommy also had a pair of eyes  before their blaze of indignation the great man positively quailed  this type of opponent was new to him  im not lying  i beg your pardon said the prince  and at this point it occurred to the prince who being really a great man had naturally a sense of humour that a conference conducted on these lines between the leading statesman of an empire and an impertinent hussy of say twelve years old at the outside might end by becoming ridiculous  so the prince took up his chair and put it down again beside tommys and employing skilfully his undoubted diplomatic gifts drew from her bit by bit the whole story  im inclined miss jane said the great man the story ended to agree with our friend mr hope  i should say your metier was journalism  and youll let me interview you asked tommy showing her white teeth  the great man laying a hand heavier than he guessed on tommys shoulder rose  i think you are entitled to it  whats your views demanded tommy reading of the future political and social relationships  perhaps suggested the great man it will be simpler if i write it myself  well concurred tommy my spelling is a bit rocky  the great man drew a chair to the table  you wont miss out anythingwill you insisted tommy  i shall endeavour miss jane to give you no cause for complaint gravely he assured her and sat down to write  not till the train began to slacken speed had the prince finished  then blotting and refolding the paper he stood up  i have added some instructions on the back of the last page explained the prince to which you will draw mr hopes particular attention  i would wish you to promise me miss jane never again to have recourse to dangerous acrobatic tricks not even in the sacred cause of journalism  of course if you hadnt been so jolly difficult to get at  my fault i know agreed the prince  there is not the least doubt as to which sex you belong to  nevertheless i want you to promise me come urged the prince i have done a good deal for youmore than you know  all right consented tommy a little sulkily  tommy hated making promises because she always kept them  i promise  there is your interview  the first southampton platform lamp shone in upon the prince and tommy as they stood facing one another  the prince who had acquired the reputation not altogether unjustly of an illtempered and savage old gentleman did a strange thing taking the little bloodsmeared face between his paws he kissed it  tommy always remembered the smoky flavour of the bristly grey moustache  one thing more said the prince sternlynot a word of all this  dont open your mouth to speak of it till you are back in gough square  do you take me for a mug answered tommy  they behaved very oddly to tommy after the prince had disappeared everybody took a deal of trouble for her but none of them seemed to know why they were doing it  they looked at her and went away and came again and looked at her  and the more they thought about it the more puzzled they became  some of them asked her questions but what tommy really didnt know added to what she didnt mean to tell was so prodigious that curiosity itself paled at contemplation of it  they washed and brushed her up and gave her an excellent supper and putting her into a firstclass compartment labelled reserved sent her back to waterloo and thence in a cab to gough square where she arrived about midnight suffering from a sense of selfimportance traces of which to this day are still discernible  such and thus was the beginning of all things  tommy having talked for half an hour at the rate of two hundred words a minute had suddenly dropped her head upon the table had been aroused with difficulty and persuaded to go to bed  peter in the deep easychair before the fire sat long into the night  elizabeth liking quiet company purred softly out of the shadows crept to peter hope an old forgotten dreamthe dream of a wonderful new journal price one penny weekly of which the editor should come to be one thomas hope son of peter hope its honoured founder and originator a powerful journal that should supply a longfelt want popular but at the same time elevatinga pleasure to the public a profit to its owners  do you not remember me whispered the dream we had long talks together  the morning and the noonday pass  the evening still is ours  the twilight also brings its promise  elizabeth stopped purring and looked up surprised  peter was laughing to himself     story the secondwilliam clodd appoints himself managing director   mrs postwhistle sat on a windsorchair in the centre of rolls court mrs postwhistle who in the days of her hebehood had been likened by admiring frequenters of the old mitre in chancery lane to the ladies somewhat emaciated that an english artist since become famous was then commencing to popularise had developed with the passing years yet still retained a face of placid youthfulness  the two facts taken in conjunction had resulted in an asset to her income not to be despised the wanderer through rolls court this summers afternoon presuming him to be familiar with current journalism would have retired haunted by the sense that the restfullooking lady on the windsorchair was someone that he ought to know  glancing through almost any illustrated paper of the period the problem would have been solved for him  a photograph of mrs postwhistle taken quite recently he would have encountered with this legend before use of professor hardtops certain cure for corpulency  beside it a photograph of mrs postwhistle then arabella higgins taken twenty years ago the legend slightly varied after use etc  the face was the same the figurethere was no denying ithad undergone decided alteration  mrs postwhistle had reached with her chair the centre of rolls court in course of following the sun  the little shop over the lintel of which ran timothy postwhistle grocer and provision merchant she had left behind her in the shadow  old inhabitants of st dunstaninthewest retained recollection of a gentlemanly figure always in a very gorgeous waistcoat with dundreary whiskers to be seen occasionally there behind the counter  all customers it would refer with the air of a lord high chamberlain introducing debutantes to mrs postwhistle evidently regarding itself purely as ornamental  for the last ten years however no one had noticed it there and mrs postwhistle had a facility amounting almost to genius for ignoring or misunderstanding questions it was not to her taste to answer  most things were suspected nothing known  st dunstaninthewest had turned to other problems  if i wasnt wanting to see im remarked to herself mrs postwhistle who was knitting with one eye upon the shop ed a been ere fore id ad time to clear the dinner things away certain to ave been  its a strange world  mrs postwhistle was desirous for the arrival of a gentleman not usually awaited with impatience by the ladies of rolls courtto wit one william clodd rentcollector whose day for st dunstaninthewest was tuesday  at last said mrs postwhistle though without hope that mr clodd who had just appeared at the other end of the court could possibly hear her was beginning to be afraid as youd tumbled over yerself in your urry and urt yerself  mr clodd perceiving mrs postwhistle decided to abandon method and take no 7 first  mr clodd was a short thickset bulletheaded young man with ways that were bustling and eyes that though kind suggested trickiness  ah said mr clodd admiringly as he pocketed the six halfcrowns that the lady handed up to him  if only they were all like you mrs postwhistle  wouldnt be no need of chaps like you to worry em pointed out mrs postwhistle  its an irony of fate my being a rentcollector when you come to think of it remarked mr clodd writing out the receipt  if i had my way id put an end to landlordism root and branch  curse of the country  just the very thing i wanted to talk to you about returned the ladythat lodger o mine  ah dont pay dont he  you just hand him over to me  ill soon have it out of him  its not that explained mrs postwhistle  if a saturday morning appened to come round as e didnt pay up without me asking i should know id made a mistakethat it must be friday  if i dont appen to be in at alfpast ten e puts it in an envelope and leaves it on the table  wonder if his mother has got any more like him mused mr clodd  could do with a few about this neighbourhood  what is it you want to say about him then  merely to brag about him  i wanted to ask you continued mrs postwhistle ow i could get rid of im  it was rather a curious agreement  why do you want to get rid of him  too noisy  noisy  why the cat makes more noise about the ouse than e does  ed make is fortune as a burglar  come home late  never known im out after the shutters are up  gives you too much trouble then  i cant say that of im  never know whether es in the ouse or isnt without going upstairs and knocking at the door  here you tell it your own way suggested the bewildered clodd  if it was anyone else but you i should say you didnt know your own business  e gets on my nerves said mrs postwhistle  you aint in a urry for five minutes  mr clodd was always in a hurry  but i can forget it talking to you added the gallant mr clodd  mrs postwhistle led the way into the little parlour  just the name of it consented mr clodd  cheerfulness combined with temperance thats the ideal  ill tell you what appened only last night commenced mrs postwhistle seating herself the opposite side of the lootable  a letter came for im by the seven oclock post  id seen im go out two hours before and though id been sitting in the shop the whole blessed time i never saw or eard im pass through  es like that  its like aving a ghost for a lodger  i opened is door without knocking and went in  if youll believe me e was clinging with is arms and legs to the top of the bedsteadits one of those oldfashioned fourpost thingsis ead touching the ceiling  e adnt got too much clothes on and was cracking nuts with is teeth and eating em  e threw a andful of shells at me and making the most awful faces at me started off gibbering softly to himself  all play i suppose  no real vice commented the interested mr clodd  it will go on for a week that will continued mrs postwhistlee fancying imself a monkey  last week he was a tortoise and was crawling about on his stomach with a teatray tied on to is back  es as sensible as most men if thats saying much the moment es outside the front door but in the ousewell i suppose the fact is that es a lunatic  dont seem no hiding anything from you mrs postwhistle remarked mr clodd in tones of admiration  does he ever get violent  dont know what e would be like if e appened to fancy imself something really dangerous answered mrs postwhistle  i am a bit nervous of this new monkey game i dont mind confessing to youthe things that they do according to the picturebooks  up to now except for imagining imself a mole and taking all his meals underneath the carpet its been mostly birds and cats and armless sort o things i avent seemed to mind so much  how did you get hold of him demanded mr clodd  have much trouble in finding him or did somebody come and tell you about him  old gladman of chancery lane the law stationer brought im ere one evening about two months agosaid e was a sort of distant relative of is a bit soft in the ead but perfectly armlesswanted to put im with someone who wouldnt impose on im  well what between aving been empty for over five weeks the poor old gaby imself looking as gentle as a lamb and the figure being reasonable i rather jumped at the idea and old gladman explaining as ow e wanted the thing settled and done with got me to sign a letter  kept a copy of it asked the businesslike clodd  no  but i can remember what it was  gladman ad it all ready  so long as the money was paid punctual and e didnt make no disturbance and didnt fall sick i was to go on boarding and lodging im for seventeen andsixpence a week  it didnt strike me as anything to be objected to at the time but e payin regular as ive explained to you and beaving so far as disturbance is concerned more like a christian martyr than a man well it looks to me as if id got to live and die with im  give him rope and possibly hell have a week at being a howling hyaena or a laughing jackass or something of that sort that will lead to a disturbance thought mr clodd in which case of course you would have your remedy  yes thought mrs postwhistle and possibly also e may take it into what e calls is ead to be a tiger or a bull and then perhaps before es through with it ill be beyond the reach of remedies  leave it to me said mr clodd rising and searching for his hat  i know old gladman ill have a talk with him  you might get a look at that letter if you can suggested mrs postwhistle and tell me what you think about it  i dont want to spend the rest of my days in a lunatic asylum of my own if i can elp it  you leave it to me was mr clodds parting assurance  the july moon had thrown a silver veil over the grimness of rolls court when five hours later mr clodds nailed boots echoed again upon its uneven pavement but mr clodd had no eye for moon or stars or suchlike always he had things more important to think of  seen the old umbug asked mrs postwhistle who was partial to the air leading the way into the parlour  first and foremost commenced mr clodd as he laid aside his hat it is quite understood that you really do want to get rid of him  whats that demanded mr clodd a heavy thud upon the floor above having caused him to start out of his chair  e came in an hour after youd gone explained mrs postwhistle bringing with him a curtain pole as ed picked up for a shilling in clare market  es rested one end upon the mantelpiece and tied the other to the back of the easychairis idea is to twine imself round it and go to sleep upon it  yes youve got it quite right without a single blunder  i do want to get rid of im  then said mr clodd reseating himself it can be done  thank god for that was mrs postwhistles pious ejaculation  it is just as i thought continued mr clodd  the old innocenthes gladmans brotherinlaw by the wayhas got a small annuity  i couldnt get the actual figure but i guess its about sufficient to pay for his keep and leave old gladman who is running him a very decent profit  they dont want to send him to an asylum  they cant say hes a pauper and to put him into a private establishment would swallow up most likely the whole of his income  on the other hand they dont want the bother of looking after him themselves  i talked pretty straight to the old manlet him see i understood the business andwell to cut a long story short im willing to take on the job provided you really want to have done with it and gladman is willing in that case to let you off your contract  mrs postwhistle went to the cupboard to get mr clodd a drink  another thud upon the floor aboveone suggestive of exceptional velocityarrived at the precise moment when mrs postwhistle the tumbler level with her eye was in the act of measuring  i call this making a disturbance said mrs postwhistle regarding the broken fragments  its only for another night comforted her mr clodd  ill take him away some time tomorrow  meanwhile if i were you i should spread a mattress underneath that perch of his before i went to bed  i should like him handed over to me in reasonable repair  it will deaden the sound a bit anyow agreed mrs postwhistle  success to temperance drank mr clodd and rose to go  i take it youve fixed things up all right for yourself said mrs postwhistle and nobody can blame you if you ave  eaven bless you is what i say  we shall get on together prophesied mr clodd  im fond of animals  early the next morning a fourwheeled cab drew up at the entrance to rolls court and in it and upon it went away clodd and clodds lunatic as afterwards he came to be known together with all the belongings of clodds lunatic the curtainpole included and there appeared again behind the fanlight of the little grocers shop the intimation lodgings for a single man which caught the eye a few days later of a weirdlooking lanky rawboned laddie whose language mrs postwhistle found difficulty for a time in comprehending and that is why one sometimes meets today worshippers of kail yard literature wandering disconsolately about st dunstaninthewest seeking rolls court discomforted because it is no more  but that is the history of the wee laddie and this of the beginnings of william clodd now sir william clodd bart mp proprietor of a quarter of a hundred newspapers magazines and journals truthful billy we called him then  no one can say of clodd that he did not deserve whatever profit his unlicensed lunatic asylum may have brought him  a kindly man was william clodd when indulgence in sentiment did not interfere with business  theres no harm in him asserted mr clodd talking the matter over with one mr peter hope journalist of gough square  hes just a bit dotty same as you or i might get with nothing to do and all day long to do it in  kids play thats all it is  the best plan i find is to treat it as a game and take a hand in it  last week he wanted to be a lion  i could see that was going to be awkward he roaring for raw meat and thinking to prowl about the house at night  well i didnt nag himthats no good  i just got a gun and shot him  hes a duck now and im trying to keep him one sits for an hour beside his bath on three china eggs ive bought him  wish some of the sane ones were as little trouble  the summer came again  clodd and his lunatic a mildlooking little old gentleman of somewhat clerical cut one often met with arminarm bustling about the streets and courts that were the scene of clodds rent collecting labours  their evident attachment to one another was curiously displayed clodd the young and redhaired treating his white haired withered companion with fatherly indulgence the other glancing up from time to time into clodds face with a winning expression of infantile affection  we are getting much better explained clodd the pair meeting peter hope one day at the corner of newcastle street  the more we are out in the open air and the more we have to do and think about the better for useh  the mildlooking little old gentleman hanging on clodds arm smiled and nodded  between ourselves added mr clodd sinking his voice we are not half as foolish as folks think we are  peter hope went his way down the strand  clodds a good sorta good sort said peter hope who having in his time lived much alone had fallen into the habit of speaking his thoughts aloud but hes not the man to waste his time  i wonder  with the winter clodds lunatic fell ill  clodd bustled round to chancery lane  to tell you the truth confessed mr gladman we never thought he would live so long as he has  theres the annuity youve got to think of said clodd whom his admirers of today and they are many for he must be a millionaire by this time are fond of alluding to as that frank outspoken englishman wouldnt it be worth your while to try what taking him away from the fogs might do for him  old gladman seemed inclined to consider the question but mrs gladman a brisk cheerful little woman had made up her mind  weve had what there is to have said mrs gladman  hes seventythree  whats the sense of risking good money  be content  no one could sayno one ever did saythat clodd under the circumstances did not do his best  perhaps after all nothing could have helped  the little old gentleman at clodds suggestion played at being a dormouse and lay very still  if he grew restless thereby bringing on his cough clodd as a terrible black cat was watching to pounce upon him  only by keeping very quiet and artfully pretending to be asleep could he hope to escape the ruthless clodd  doctor william smith ne wilhelm schmidt shrugged his fat shoulders  we can do noding  dese fogs of ours id is de one ting dat enables the foreigner to crow over us  keep him quiet  de dormouseid is a goot idea  that evening william clodd mounted to the second floor of 16 gough square where dwelt his friend peter hope and knocked briskly at the door  come in said a decided voice which was not peter hopes  mr william clodds ambition was and always had been to be the owner or partowner of a paper  today as i have said he owns a quarter of a hundred and is in negotiation so rumour goes for seven more  but twenty years ago clodd and co limited was but in embryo  and peter hope journalist had likewise and for many a long year cherished the ambition to be before he died the owner or partowner of a paper  peter hope today owns nothing except perhaps the knowledge if such things be permitted that whenever and wherever his name is mentioned kind thoughts arise unbiddenthat someone of the party will surely say dear old peter  what a good fellow he was  which also may be in its way a valuable possession who knows  but twenty years ago peters horizon was limited by fleet street  peter hope was fortyseven so he said a dreamer and a scholar  william clodd was threeandtwenty a born hustler very wide awake  meeting one day by accident upon an omnibus when clodd lent peter who had come out without his purse threepence to pay his fare with drifting into acquaintanceship each had come to acquire a liking and respect for the other  the dreamer thought with wonder of clodds shrewd practicability the cute young man of business was lost in admiration of what seemed to him his old friends marvellous learning  both had arrived at the conclusion that a weekly journal with peter hope as editor and william clodd as manager would be bound to be successful  if only we could scrape together a thousand pounds had sighed peter  the moment we lay our hands upon the coin well start that paper remember its a bargain had answered william clodd  mr william clodd turned the handle and walked in  with the door still in his hand he paused to look round the room  it was the first time he had seen it  his meetings hitherto with peter hope had been chance rencontres in street or restaurant  always had he been curious to view the sanctuary of so much erudition  a large oakpanelled room its three high windows each with a low cushioned seat beneath it giving on to gough square  thirtyfive years before peter hope then a young dandy with side whiskers closecropped and terminating just below the ear with wavy brown hair giving to his freshcomplexioned face an appearance almost girlish in cutaway blue coat flowered waistcoat black silk cravat secured by two gold pins chained together and tightly strapped grey trouserings had aided and abetted by a fragile little lady in crinoline and muchflounced skirt and bodice somewhat low with corkscrew curls each movement of her head set ringing planned and furnished it in accordance with the sober canons then in vogue spending thereupon more than they should as is to be expected from the young to whom the future promises all things  the fine brussels carpet  a little too bright had thought the shaking curls the colours will tone down missmaam  the shopman knew  only by the help of the round island underneath the massive empire table by excursions into untrodden corners could peter recollect the rainbow floor his feet had pressed when he was twentyone  the noble bookcase surmounted by minervas bust  really it was too expensive  but the nodding curls had been so obstinate  peters silly books and papers must be put away in order the curls did not intend to permit any excuse for untidiness  so too the handsome brassbound desk it must be worthy of the beautiful thoughts peter would pen upon it  the great sideboard supported by two such angrylooking mahogany lions it must be strong to support the weight of silver clever peter would one day purchase to place upon it  the few oil paintings in their heavy frames  a solidly furnished sober apartment about it that subtle atmosphere of dignity one finds but in old rooms long undisturbed where one seems to read upon the walls i joy and sorrow twain in one have dwelt here  one item only there was that seemed out of place among its grave surroundingsa guitar hanging from the wall ornamented with a ridiculous blue bow somewhat faded  mr william clodd demanded the decided voice  clodd started and closed the door  guessed it in once admitted mr clodd  i thought so said the decided voice  we got your note this afternoon  mr hope will be back at eight  will you kindly hang up your hat and coat in the hall  you will find a box of cigars on the mantelpiece  excuse my being busy  i must finish this then ill talk to you  the owner of the decided voice went on writing  clodd having done as he was bid sat himself in the easychair before the fire and smoked  of the person behind the desk mr clodd could see but the head and shoulders  it had black curly hair cut short  its only garment visible below the white collar and red tie might have been a boys jacket designed more like a girls or a girls designed more like a boys partaking of the genius of english statesmanship it appeared to be a compromise  mr clodd remarked the long drooping lashes over the bright black eyes  its a girl said mr clodd to himself rather a pretty girl  mr clodd continuing downward arrived at the nose  no said mr clodd to himself its a boya cheeky young beggar i should say  the person at the desk giving a grunt of satisfaction gathered together sheets of manuscript and arranged them then resting its elbows on the desk and taking its head between its hands regarded mr clodd  dont you hurry yourself said mr clodd but when you really have finished tell me what you think of me  i beg your pardon apologised the person at the desk  i have got into a habit of staring at people  i know its rude  im trying to break myself of it  tell me your name suggested mr clodd and ill forgive you  tommy was the answeri mean jane  make up your mind advised mr clodd dont let me influence you  i only want the truth  you see explained the person at the desk everybody calls me tommy because that used to be my name  but now its jane  i see said mr clodd  and which am i to call you  the person at the desk pondered  well if this scheme you and mr hope have been talking about really comes to anything we shall be a good deal thrown together you see and then i expect youll call me tommymost people do  youve heard about the scheme  mr hope has told you  why of course replied tommy  im mr hopes devil  for the moment clodd doubted whether his old friend had not started a rival establishment to his own  i help him in his work tommy relieved his mind by explaining  in journalistic circles we call it devilling  i understand said mr clodd  and what do you think tommy of the scheme  i may as well start calling you tommy because between you and me i think the idea will come to something  tommy fixed her black eyes upon him  she seemed to be looking him right through  you are staring again tommy clodd reminded her  youll have trouble breaking yourself of that habit i can see  i was trying to make up my mind about you  everything depends upon the business man  glad to hear you say so replied the selfsatisfied clodd  if you are very cleverdo you mind coming nearer to the lamp  i cant quite see you over there  clodd never could understand why he did itnever could understand why from first to last he always did what tommy wished him to do his only consolation being that other folks seemed just as helpless  he rose and crossing the long room stood at attention before the large desk nervousness to which he was somewhat of a stranger taking possession of him  you dont look very clever  clodd experienced another new sensationthat of falling in his own estimation  and yet one can see that you are clever  the mercury of clodds conceit shot upward to a point that in the case of anyone less physically robust might have been dangerous to health  clodd held out his hand  well pull it through tommy  the guvnor shall find the literature you and i will make it go  i like you  and peter hope entering at the moment caught a spark from the light that shone in the eyes of william clodd and tommy whose other name was jane as gripping hands they stood with the desk between them laughing they knew not why  and the years fell from old peter and again a boy he also laughed he knew not why  he had sipped from the winecup of youth  its all settled guvnor cried clodd  tommy and i have fixed things up  well start with the new year  youve got the money  im reckoning on it  i dont see very well how i can miss it  sufficient  just about  you get to work  ive saved a little began peter  it ought to have been more but somehow it isnt  perhaps we shall want it clodd replied perhaps we shant  you are supplying the brains  the three for a few moments remained silent  i think tommy said peter i think a bottle of the old madeira  not tonight said clodd next time  to drink success urged peter  one mans success generally means some other poor devils misfortune answered clodd  cant be helped of course but dont want to think about it tonight must be getting back to my dormouse  good night  clodd shook hands and bustled out  i thought as much mused peter aloud  what an odd mixture the man is  kindno one could have been kinder to the poor old fellow  yet all the whilewe are an odd mixture tommy said peter hope an odd mixture we men and women  peter was a philosopher  the whitewhiskered old dormouse soon coughed himself to sleep for ever  i shall want you and the missis to come to the funeral gladman said mr clodd as he swung into the stationers shop and bring pincer with you  im writing to him  dont see what good we can do demurred gladman  well you three are his only relatives its only decent you should be present urged clodd  besides theres the will to be read  you may care to hear it  the dry old law stationer opened wide his watery eyes  his will  why what had he got to leave  there was nothing but the annuity  you turn up at the funeral clodd told him and youll learn all about it  bonners clerk will be there and will bring it with him  everything is going to be done comme il faut as the french say  i ought to have known of this began mr gladman  glad to find you taking so much interest in the old chap said clodd pity hes dead and cant thank you  i warn you shouted old gladman whose voice was rising to a scream he was a helpless imbecile incapable of acting for himself  if any undue influence  see you on friday broke in clodd who was busy  fridays ceremony was not a sociable affair  mrs gladman spoke occasionally in a shrill whisper to mr gladman who replied with grunts both employed the remainder of their time in scowling at clodd  mr pincer a stout heavy gentleman connected with the house of commons maintained a ministerial reserve  the undertakers foreman expressed himself as thankful when it was over  he criticised it as the humpiest funeral he had ever known for a time he had serious thoughts of changing his profession  the solicitors clerk was waiting for the party on its return from kensal green  clodd again offered hospitality  mr pincer this time allowed himself a glass of weak whiskyandwater and sipped it with an air of doing so without prejudice  the clerk had one a little stronger mrs gladman dispensing with consultation declined shrilly for self and partner  clodd explaining that he always followed legal precedent mixed himself one also and drank to our next happy meeting  then the clerk read  it was a short and simple will dated the previous august  it appeared that the old gentleman unknown to his relatives had died possessed of shares in a silver mine once despaired of now prospering  taking them at present value they would produce a sum well over two thousand pounds the old gentleman had bequeathed five hundred pounds to his brotherin law mr gladman five hundred pounds to his only other living relative his first cousin mr pincer the residue to his friend william clodd as a return for the many kindnesses that gentleman had shown him  mr gladman rose more amused than angry  and you think you are going to pocket that one thousand to twelve hundred pounds  you really do he asked mr clodd who with legs stretched out before him sat with his hands deep in his trousers pockets  thats the idea admitted mr clodd  mr gladman laughed but without much lightening the atmosphere  upon my word clodd you amuse meyou quite amuse me repeated mr gladman  you always had a sense of humour commented mr clodd  you villain  you doubledyed villain screamed mr gladman suddenly changing his tone  you think the law is going to allow you to swindle honest men  you think we are going to sit still for you to rob us  that will  mr gladman pointed a lank forefinger dramatically towards the table  you mean to dispute it inquired mr clodd  for a moment mr gladman stood aghast at the others coolness but soon found his voice again  dispute it he shrieked  do you dispute that you influenced himdictated it to him word for word made the poor old helpless idiot sign it he utterly incapable of even understanding  dont chatter so much interrupted mr clodd  its not a pretty voice yours  what i asked you was do you intend to dispute it  if you will kindly excuse us struck in mrs gladman addressing mr clodd with an air of much politeness we shall just have time if we go now to catch our solicitor before he leaves his office  mr gladman took up his hat from underneath his chair  one moment suggested mr clodd  i did influence him to make that will  if you dont like it theres an end of it  of course commenced mr gladman in a mollified tone  sit down suggested mr clodd  lets try another one  mr clodd turned to the clerk  the previous one mr wright if you please the one dated june the 10th  an equally short and simple document it bequeathed three hundred pounds to mr william clodd in acknowledgment of kindnesses received the residue to the royal zoological society of london the deceased having been always interested in and fond of animals  the relatives who have never shown me the slightest affection or given themselves the slightest trouble concerning me and who have already received considerable sums out of my income being by name excluded  i may mention observed mr clodd no one else appearing inclined to break the silence that in suggesting the royal zoological society to my poor old friend as a fitting object for his benevolence i had in mind a very similar case that occurred five years ago  a bequest to them was disputed on the grounds that the testator was of unsound mind  they had to take their case to the house of lords before they finally won it  anyhow remarked mr gladman licking his lips which were dry you wont get anything mr cloddno not even your threehundred pounds clever as you think yourself  my brotherinlaws money will go to the lawyers  then mr pincer rose and spoke slowly and clearly  if there must be a lunatic connected with our family which i dont see why there should be it seems to me to be you nathaniel gladman  mr gladman stared back with open mouth  mr pincer went on impressively  as for my poor old cousin joe he had his eccentricities but that was all  i for one am prepared to swear that he was of sound mind in august last and quite capable of making his own will  it seems to me that the other thing dated in june is just waste paper  mr pincer having delivered himself sat down again  mr gladman showed signs of returning language  oh whats the use of quarrelling chirped in cheery mrs gladman its five hundred pounds we never expected  live and let live is what i always say  its the damned artfulness of the thing said mr gladman still very white about the gills  oh you have a little something to thaw your face suggested his wife  mr and mrs gladman on the strength of the five hundred pounds went home in a cab  mr pincer stayed behind and made a night of it with mr clodd and bonners clerk at clodds expense  the residue worked out at eleven hundred and sixtynine pounds and a few shillings  the capital of the new company established for the purpose of carrying on the business of newspaper publishers and distributors printers

in the first number the song of the pen  choosing a title for the paper cost much thought  driven to despair they called it good humour     story the thirdgrindley junior drops into the position of publisher   few are the ways of the west central district that have changed less within the last halfcentury than nevills court leading from great new street into fetter lane  its north side still consists of the same quaint row of small low shops that stood theredoing perhaps a little brisker businesswhen george the fourth was king its southern side of the same three substantial houses each behind a strip of garden pleasant by contrast with surrounding grimness built long agosome say before queen anne was dead  out of the largest of these passing through the garden then well cared for came one sunny sunday morning some fifteen years before the commencement proper of this story one solomon appleyard pushing in front of him a perambulator  at the brick wall surmounted by wooden railings that divides the garden from the court solomon paused hearing behind him the voice of mrs appleyard speaking from the doorstep  if i dont see you again until dinnertime ill try and get on without you understand  dont think of nothing but your pipe and forget the child  and be careful of the crossings  mrs appleyard retired into the darkness  solomon steering the perambulator carefully emerged from nevills court without accident  the quiet streets drew solomon westward  a vacant seat beneath the shade overlooking the long water in kensington gardens invited to rest  piper suggested a small boy to solomon  sunday times server  my boy said mr appleyard speaking slowly when youve been mewed up with newspapers eighteen hours a day for six days a week you can do without em for a morning  take em away  i want to forget the smell of em  solomon having assured himself that the party in the perambulator was still breathing crossed his legs and lit his pipe  hezekiah  the exclamation had been wrung from solomon appleyard by the approach of a stout short man clad in a remarkably illfitting broadcloth suit  what sol my boy  it looked like you said solomon  and then i said to myself no surely it cant be hezekiah hell be at chapel  you run about said hezekiah addressing a youth of some four summers he had been leading by the hand  dont you go out of my sight and whatever you do dont you do injury to those new clothes of yours or youll wish youd never been put into them  the truth is continued hezekiah to his friend his sole surviving son and heir being out of earshot the morning tempted me  taint often i get a bit of fresh air  doing well  the business replied hezekiah is going up by leaps and boundsleaps and bounds  but of course all that means harder work for me  its from six in the morning till twelve oclock at night  theres nothing i know of returned solomon who was something of a pessimist thats given away free gratis for nothing except misfortune  keeping yourself up to the mark aint too easy continued hezekiah and when it comes to other folks plays all they think of  talk religion to themwhy they laugh at you  what the worlds coming to i dont know  hows the printing business doing  the printing business responded the other removing his pipe and speaking somewhat sadly the printing business looks like being a big thing  capital of course is what hampers meor rather the want of it  but janet shes careful she dont waste much janet dont  now with anne replied hezekiah its all the other waypleasure gaiety a day at rosherville or the crystal palaceanything to waste money  ah she was always fond of her bit of fun remembered solomon  fun retorted hezekiah  i like a bit of fun myself  but not if youve got to pay for it  wheres the fun in that  what i ask myself sometimes said solomon looking straight in front of him is what do we do it for  what do we do what for  work like blessed slaves depriving ourselves of all enjoyments  whats the sense of it  what  a voice from the perambulator beside him broke the thread of solomon appleyards discourse  the sole surviving son of hezekiah grindley seeking distraction and finding none had crept back unperceived  a perambulator  a thing his experience told him out of which excitement in some form or another could generally be obtained  you worried it and took your chance  either it howled in which case you had to run for your life followedand unfortunately overtaken nine times out of tenby a whirlwind of vengeance or it gurgled in which case the heavens smiled and halos descended on your head  in either event you escaped the deadly ennui that is the result of continuous virtue  master grindley his star having pointed out to him a peacocks feather lying on the ground had with one eye upon his unobservant parent removed the complicated coverings sheltering miss helvetia appleyard from the world and anticipating by a quarter of a century the prime enjoyment of british youth had set to work to tickle that lady on the nose  miss helvetia appleyard awakened did precisely what the tickled british maiden of to day may be relied upon to do under corresponding circumstances she first of all took swift and comprehensive survey of the male thing behind the feather  had he been displeasing in her eyes she would one may rely upon it have anteceded the behaviour in similar case of her descendant of todaythat is to say have expressed resentment in no uncertain terms  master nathaniel grindley proving however to her taste that which might have been considered impertinence became accepted as a fit and proper form of introduction  miss appleyard smiled graciouslynay further intimated desire for more  that your only one asked the paternal grindley  shes the only one replied solomon speaking in tones less pessimistic  miss appleyard had with the help of grindley junior wriggled herself into a sitting posture  grindley junior continued his attentions the lady indicating by signs the various points at which she was most susceptible  pretty picture they make together eh suggested hezekiah in a whisper to his friend  never saw her take to anyone like that before returned solomon likewise in a whisper  a neighbouring church clock chimed twelve  solomon appleyard knocking the ashes from his pipe arose  dont know any reason myself why we shouldnt see a little more of one another than we do suggested grindley senior shaking hands  give us a lookup one sunday afternoon suggested solomon  bring the youngster with you  solomon appleyard and hezekiah grindley had started life within a few months of one another some fiveandthirty years before  likewise within a few hundred yards of one another solomon at his fathers bookselling and printing establishment on the east side of the high street of a small yorkshire town hezekiah at his fathers grocery shop upon the west side opposite  both had married farmers daughters  solomons natural bent towards gaiety fate had corrected by directing his affections to a partner instinct with yorkshire shrewdness and with shrewdness go other qualities that make for success rather than for happiness  hezekiah had circumstances been equal might have been his friends rival for janets capable and saving hand had not sweettempered laughing annie glossopdirected by providence to her moral welfare one must presumefallen in love with him  between janes virtues and annies three hundred golden sovereigns hezekiah had not hesitated a moment golden sovereigns were solid facts wifely virtues by a seriousminded and strongwilled husband could be instilledat all events lightheartedness suppressed  the two men hezekiah urged by his own ambition solomon by his wifes had arrived in london within a year of one another hezekiah to open a grocers shop in kensington which those who should have known assured him was a hopeless neighbourhood  but hezekiah had the instinct of the moneymaker  solomon after looking about him had fixed upon the roomy substantial house in nevills court as a promising foundation for a printers business  that was ten years ago  the two friends scorning delights living laborious days had seen but little of one another  lighthearted annie had borne to her dour partner two children who had died  nathaniel george with the luck supposed to wait on number three had lived on and inheriting fortunately the temperament of his mother had brought sunshine into the gloomy rooms above the shop in high street kensington mrs grindley grown weak and fretful had rested from her labours  mrs appleyards guardian angel prudent like his protege had waited till solomons business was well established before despatching the stork to nevills court with a little girl  later had sent a boy who not finding the close air of st dunstan to his liking had found his way back again thus passing out of this story and all others  and there remained to carry on the legend of the grindleys and the appleyards only nathaniel george now aged five and janet helvetia quite a beginner who took lift seriously  there are no such things as facts  narrowminded folksurveyors auctioneers and such likewould have insisted that the garden between the old georgian house and nevills court was a strip of land one hundred and eighteen feet by ninetytwo containing a laburnum tree six laurel bushes and a dwarf deodora  to nathaniel george and janet helvetia it was the land of thule the furthest boundaries of which no man has reached  on rainy sunday afternoons they played in the great gloomy pressroom where silent ogres standing motionless stretched out iron arms to seize them as they ran  then just when nathaniel george was eight and janet helvetia four and a half hezekiah launched the celebrated grindleys sauce  it added a relish to chops and steaks transformed cold mutton into a luxury and swelled the head of hezekiah grindleywhich was big enough in all conscience as it wasand shrivelled up his little hard heart  the grindleys and the appleyards visited no more  as a sensible fellow ought to have seen for himself so thought hezekiah the sauce had altered all things  the possibility of a marriage between their children things having remained equal might have been a pretty fancy but the son of the great grindley whose name in threefoot letters faced the world from every hoarding would have to look higher than a printers daughter  solomon a sudden and vehement convert to the principles of mediaeval feudalism would rather see his only child granddaughter of the author of the history of kettlewell and other works dead and buried than married to a grocers son even though he might inherit a fortune made out of poisoning the public with a mixture of mustard and sour beer  it was many years before nathaniel george and janet helvetia met one another again and when they did they had forgotten one another        hezekiah s grindley a short stout and pompous gentleman sat under a palm in the gorgeously furnished drawingroom of his big house at notting hill  mrs grindley a thin faded woman the despair of her dressmaker sat as near to the fire as its massive and imposing copper outworks would permit and shivered  grindley junior a fairhaired wellshaped youth with eyes that the other sex found attractive leant with his hands in his pockets against a scrupulously robed statue of diana and appeared uncomfortable  im making the moneymaking it hand over fist  all youll have to do will be to spend it grindley senior was explaining to his son and heir  ill do that all right dad  im not so sure of it was his fathers opinion  youve got to prove yourself worthy to spend it  dont you think i shall be content to have slaved all these years merely to provide a brainless young idiot with the means of selfindulgence  i leave my money to somebody worthy of me understand sirsomebody worthy of me  mrs grindley commenced a sentence mr grindley turned his small eyes upon her  the sentence remained unfinished  you were about to say something her husband reminded her  mrs grindley said it was nothing  if it is anything worth hearingif it is anything that will assist the discussion lets have it  mr grindley waited  if not if you yourself do not consider it worth finishing why have begun it  mr grindley returned to his son and heir  you havent done too well at schoolin fact your school career has disappointed me  i know im not clever grindley junior offered as an excuse  why not  why arent you clever  his son and heir was unable to explain  you are my sonwhy arent you clever  its laziness sir sheer laziness  ill try and do better at oxford sirhonour bright i will  you had better advised him his father because i warn you your whole future depends upon it  you know me  youve got to be a credit to me to be worthy of the name of grindleyor the name my boy is all youll have  old grindley meant it and his son knew that he meant it  the old puritan principles and instincts were strong in the old gentlemanformed perhaps the better part of him  idleness was an abomination to him devotion to pleasure other than the pleasure of moneymaking a grievous sin in his eyes  grindley junior fully intended to do well at oxford and might have succeeded  in accusing himself of lack of cleverness he did himself an injustice  he had brains he had energy he had character  our virtues can be our stumblingblocks as well as our vices young grindley had one admirable virtue that needs above all others careful controlling he was amiability itself  before the charm and sweetness of it oxford snobbishness went down  the sauce against the earnest counsel of its own advertisement was forgotten the pickles passed by  to escape the natural result of his popularity would have needed a stronger will than young grindley possessed  for a time the true state of affairs was hidden from the eye of grindley senior  to slack it this term with the full determination of swotting it the next is always easy the difficulty beginning only with the new term possibly with luck young grindley might have retrieved his position and covered up the traces of his folly but for an unfortunate accident returning to college with some other choice spirits at two oclock in the morning it occurred to young grindley that trouble might be saved all round by cutting out a pane of glass with a diamond ring and entering his rooms which were on the groundfloor by the window  that in mistake for his own he should have selected the bedroom of the college rector was a misfortune that might have occurred to anyone who had commenced the evening on champagne and finished it on whisky  young grindley having been warned already twice before was sent down  and then of course the whole history of the three wasted years came out  old grindley in his study chair having talked for half an hour at the top of his voice chose partly by reason of physical necessity partly by reason of dormant dramatic instinct to speak quietly and slowly  ill give you one chance more my boy and one only  ive tried you as a gentlemanperhaps that was my mistake  now ill try you as a grocer  as a what  as a grocer sirgrocergrocer a man who stands behind a counter in a white apron and his shirtsleeves who sells tea and sugar and candied peel and suchlike things to customersold ladies little girls who rises at six in the morning takes down the shutters sweeps out the shop cleans the windows who has half an hour for his dinner of corned beef and bread who puts up the shutters at ten oclock at night tidies up the shop has his supper and goes to bed feeling his day has not been wasted  i meant to spare you  i was wrong  you shall go through the mill as i went through it  if at the end of two years youve done well with your time learned somethinglearned to be a man at all eventsyou can come to me and thank me  im afraid sir suggested grindley junior whose handsome face during the last few minutes had grown very white i might not make a very satisfactory grocer  you see sir ive had no experience  i am glad you have some sense returned his father drily  you are quite right  even a grocers business requires learning  it will cost me a little money but it will be the last i shall ever spend upon you for the first year you will have to be apprenticed and i shall allow you something to live on  it shall be more than i had at your agewell say a pound a week  after that i shall expect you to keep yourself  grindley senior rose  you need not give me your answer till the evening  you are of age  i have no control over you unless you are willing to agree  you can go my way or you can go your own  young grindley who had inherited a good deal of his fathers grit felt very much inclined to go his own but hampered on the other hand by the sweetness of disposition he had inherited from his mother was unable to withstand the argument of that ladys tears so that evening accepted old grindleys terms asking only as a favour that the scene of his probation might be in some outoftheway neighbourhood where there would be little chance of his being met by old friends  i have thought of all that answered his father  my object isnt to humiliate you more than is necessary for your good  the shop i have already selected on the assumption that you would submit is as quiet and outoftheway as you could wish  it is in a turning off fetter lane where youll see few other people than printers and caretakers youll lodge with a woman a mrs postwhistle who seems a very sensible person  shell board you and lodge you and every saturday youll receive a postoffice order for six shillings out of which youll find yourself in clothes  you can take with you sufficient to last you for the first six months but no more  at the end of the year you can change if you like and go to another shop or make your own arrangements with mrs postwhistle  if all is settled you go there tomorrow  you go out of this house tomorrow in any event  mrs postwhistle was a large placid lady of philosophic temperament hitherto the little grocers shop in rolls court fetter lane had been easy of management by her own unaided efforts but the neighbourhood was rapidly changing  other grocers shops were disappearing one by one making way for huge blocks of buildings where hundreds of iron presses singing day and night spread to the earth the song of the mighty pen there were hours when the little shop could hardly accommodate its crowd of customers  mrs postwhistle of a bulk not to be moved quickly had after mature consideration conquering a natural disinclination to change decided to seek assistance  young grindley alighting from a fourwheeled cab in fetter lane marched up the court followed by a weakkneed wastrel staggering under the weight of a small box  in the doorway of the little shop young grindley paused and raised his hat  mrs postwhistle  the lady from her chair behind the counter rose slowly  i am mr nathaniel grindley the new assistant  the weakkneed wastrel let fall the box with a thud upon the floor  mrs postwhistle looked her new assistant up and down  oh said mrs postwhistle  well i shouldnt ave felt instinctively it must be you not if id ad to pick you out of a crowd  but if you tell me so why i suppose you are  come in  the weakkneed wastrel receiving to his astonishment a shilling departed  grindley senior had selected wisely  mrs postwhistles theory was that although very few people in this world understood their own business they understood it better than anyone else could understand it for them if handsome welleducated young gentlemen who gave shillings to wastrels felt they wanted to become smart and capable grocers assistants that was their affair  her business was to teach them their work and for her own sake to see that they did it  a month went by mrs postwhistle found her new assistant hardworking willing somewhat clumsy but with a smile and a laugh that transformed mistakes for which another would have been soundly rated into welcome variations of the days monotony  if you were the sort of woman that cared to make your fortune said one william clodd an old friend of mrs postwhistles young grindley having descended into the cellar to grind coffee id tell you what to do  take a bunshop somewhere in the neighbourhood of a girls school and put that assistant of yours in the window  youd do a roaring business  theres a mystery about im said mrs postwhistle  know what it is  if i knew what it was i shouldnt be calling it a mystery replied mrs postwhistle who was a stylist in her way  how did you get him  win him in a raffle  jones the agent sent im to me all in a urry  an assistant is what i really wanted not an apprentice but the premium was good and the references everything one could desire  grindley grindley murmured clodd  any relation to the sauce i wonder  a bit more wholesome i should say from the look of him thought mrs postwhistle  the question of a post office to meet its growing need had long been under discussion by the neighbourhood  mrs postwhistle was approached upon the subject  grindley junior eager for anything that might bring variety into his new cramped existence undertook to qualify himself  within two months the arrangements were complete  grindley junior divided his time between dispensing groceries and despatching telegrams and letters and was grateful for the change  grindley juniors mind was fixed upon the fashioning of a cornucopia to receive a quarter of a pound of moist  the customer an extremely young lady was seeking to hasten his operations by tapping incessantly with a penny on the counter  it did not hurry him it only worried him grindley junior had not acquired facility in the fashioning of cornucopiasthe vertex would invariably become unrolled at the last moment allowing the contents to dribble out on to the floor or counter grindley junior was sweettempered as a rule but when engaged upon the fashioning of a cornucopia was irritable  hurry up old man urged the extremely young lady  ive got another appointment in less than half an hour  oh damn the thing said grindley junior as the paper for the fourth time reverted to its original shape  an older lady standing behind the extremely young lady and holding a telegramform in her hand looked indignant  temper temper remarked the extremely young lady in reproving tone  the fifth time was more successful  the extremely young lady went out commenting upon the waste of time always resulting when boys were employed to do the work of men  the older lady a haughty person handed across her telegram with the request that it should be sent off at once  grindley junior took his pencil from his pocket and commenced to count  digniori not digniorus commented grindley junior correcting the word datur digniori dative singular  grindley junior still irritable from the struggle with the cornucopia spoke sharply  the haughty lady withdrew her eyes from a spot some ten miles beyond the back of the shop where hitherto they had been resting and fixed them for the first time upon grindley junior  thank you said the haughty lady  grindley junior looked up and immediately to his annoyance felt that he was blushing  grindley junior blushed easilyit annoyed him very much  the haughty young lady also blushed  she did not often blush when she did she felt angry with herself  a shilling and a penny demanded grindley junior  the haughty young lady counted out the money and departed  grindley junior peeping from behind a tin of abernethy biscuits noticed that as she passed the window she turned and looked back  she was a very pretty haughty lady  grindley junior rather admired dark level brows and finely cut tremulous lips especially when combined with a mass of soft brown hair and a rich olive complexion that flushed and paled as one looked at it  might send that telegram off if youve nothing else to do and theres no particular reason for keeping it back suggested mrs postwhistle  its only just been handed in explained grindley junior somewhat hurt  youve been looking at it for the last five minutes by the clock said mrs postwhistle  grindley junior sat down to the machine  the name and address of the sender was helvetia appleyard nevills court  three days passedsingularly empty days they appeared to grindley junior  on the fourth helvetia appleyard had occasion to despatch another telegramthis time entirely in english  oneandfourpence sighed grindley junior  miss appleyard drew forth her purse  the shop was empty  how did you come to know latin inquired miss appleyard in quite a casual tone  i picked up a little at school  it was a phrase i happened to remember confessed grindley junior wondering why he should be feeling ashamed of himself  i am always sorry said miss appleyard when i see anyone content with the lower life whose talents might perhaps fit him for the higher something about the tone and manner of miss appleyard reminded grindley junior of his former rector  each seemed to have arrived by different roads at the same philosophical aloofness from the world tempered by chastened interest in human phenomena  would you like to try to raise yourselfto improve yourselfto educate yourself  an unseen little rogue who was enjoying himself immensely whispered to grindley junior to say nothing but yes he should  will you let me help you asked miss appleyard  and the simple and heartfelt gratitude with which grindley junior closed upon the offer proved to miss appleyard how true it is that to do good to others is the highest joy  miss appleyard had come prepared for possible acceptance  you had better begin with this thought miss appleyard  i have marked the passages that you should learn by heart  make a note of anything you do not understand and i will explain it to you whenwhen next i happen to be passing  grindley junior took the bookbells introduction to the study of the classics for use of beginnersand held it between both hands  its price was ninepence but grindley junior appeared to regard it as a volume of great value  it will be hard work at first miss appleyard warned him but you must persevere  i have taken an interest in you you must try not to disappoint me  and miss appleyard feeling all the sensations of a hypatia departed taking light with her and forgetting to pay for the telegram  miss appleyard belonged to the class that young ladies who pride themselves on being tiresomely ignorant and foolish sneer at as bluestockings that is to say possessing brains she had felt the necessity of using them solomon appleyard widower a sensible old gentleman prospering in the printing business and seeing no necessity for a woman regarding herself as nothing but a doll a somewhat uninteresting plaything the newness once worn off thankfully encouraged her  miss appleyard had returned from girton wise in many things but not in knowledge of the world which knowledge too early acquired does not always make for good in young man or woman  a serious little virgin miss appleyards ambition was to help the human race  what more useful work could have come to her hand than the raising of this poor but intelligent young grocers assistant unto the knowledge and the love of higher things  that grindley junior happened to be an exceedingly goodlooking and charming young grocers assistant had nothing to do with the matter so miss appleyard would have informed you  in her own reasoning she was convinced that her interest in him would have been the same had he been the least attractive of his sex  that there could be danger in such relationship never occurred to her  miss appleyard a convinced radical could not conceive the possibility of a grocers assistant regarding the daughter of a welltodo printer in any other light than that of a graciously condescending patron  that there could be danger to herself you would have been sorry you had suggested the idea  the expression of lofty scorn would have made you feel yourself contemptible  miss appleyards judgment of mankind was justified no more promising pupil could have been selected  it was really marvellous the progress made by grindley junior under the tutelage of helvetia appleyard  his earnestness his enthusiasm it quite touched the heart of helvetia appleyard  there were many points it is true that puzzled grindley junior  each time the list of them grew longer  but when helvetia appleyard explained them all became clear  she marvelled herself at her own wisdom that in a moment made darkness luminous to this young man his rapt attention while she talked it was most encouraging  the boy must surely be a genius  to think that but for her intuition he might have remained wasted in a grocers shop  to rescue such a gem from oblivion to polish it was surely the duty of a conscientious hypatia two visitsthree visits a week to the little shop in rolls court were quite inadequate so many passages there were requiring elucidation london in early morning became their classroom the great wide empty silent streets the mistcurtained parks the silence broken only by the blackbirds amorous whistle the thrushes invitation to delight the old gardens hidden behind narrow ways  nathaniel george and janet helvetia would rest upon a seat no living creature within sight save perhaps a passing policeman or some dissipated cat  janet helvetia would expound nathaniel george his fine eyes fixed on hers seemed never to tire of drinking in her wisdom  there were times when janet helvetia to reassure herself as to the maidenly correctness of her behaviour had to recall quite forcibly the fact that she was the daughter of solomon appleyard owner of the big printing establishment and he a simple grocer  one day raised a little in the social scale thanks to her nathaniel george would marry someone in his own rank of life  reflecting upon the future of nathaniel george janet helvetia could not escape a shade of sadness  it was difficult to imagine precisely the wife she would have chosen for nathaniel george she hoped he would do nothing foolish  rising young men so often marry wives that hamper rather than help them  one sunday morning in late autumn they walked and talked in the shady garden of lincolns inn  greek they thought it was they had been talking as a matter of fact a much older language  a young gardener was watering flowers and as they passed him he grinned  it was not an offensive grin rather a sympathetic grin but miss appleyard didnt like being grinned at  what was there to grin at  her personal appearance some gaucherie in her dress  impossible  no lady in all st dunstan was ever more precise  she glanced at her companion a cleanlooking wellgroomed welldressed youth  suddenly it occurred to miss appleyard that she and grindley junior were holding each others hand  miss appleyard was justly indignant  how dare you said miss appleyard  i am exceedingly angry with you how dare you  the olive skin was scarlet  there were tears in the hazel eyes  leave me this minute commanded miss appleyard  instead of which grindley junior seized both her hands  i love you  i adore you  i worship you poured forth young grindley forgetful of all miss appleyard had ever told him concerning the folly of tautology  you had no right said miss appleyard  i couldnt help it pleaded young grindley  and that isnt the worst  miss appleyard paled visibly  for a grocers assistant to dare to fall in love with her especially after all the trouble she had taken with him  what could be worse  im not a grocer continued young grindley deeply conscious of crime i mean not a real grocer  and grindley junior then and there made a clean breast of the whole sad terrible tale of shameless deceit practised by the greatest villain the world had ever produced upon the noblest and most beautiful maiden that ever turned grim london town into a fairy city of enchanted ways  not at first could miss appleyard entirely grasp it not till hours later when she sat alone in her own room where fortunately for himself grindley junior was not did the whole force and meaning of the thing come home to her  it was a large room taking up half of the top story of the big georgian house in nevills court but even as it was miss appleyard felt cramped  for a yearfor nearly a whole year said miss appleyard addressing the bust of william shakespeare have i been slaving my life out teaching him elementary latin and the first five books of euclid  as it has been remarked it was fortunate for grindley junior he was out of reach  the bust of william shakespeare maintained its irritating aspect of benign philosophy  i suppose i should mused miss appleyard if he had told me at firstas he ought to have told meof course i should naturally have had nothing more to do with him  i suppose mused miss appleyard a man in love if he is really in love doesnt quite know what hes doing  i suppose one ought to make allowances  but oh when i think of it  and then grindley juniors guardian angel must surely have slipped into the room for miss appleyard irritated beyond endurance at the philosophical indifference of the bust of william shakespeare turned away from it and as she did so caught sight of herself in the looking glass  miss appleyard approached the glass a little nearer  a womans hair is never quite as it should be  miss appleyard standing before the glass began she knew not why to find reasons excusing grindley junior after all was not forgiveness an excellent thing in woman  none of us are quite perfect  the guardian angel of grindley junior seized the opportunity  that evening solomon appleyard sat upright in his chair feeling confused  so far as he could understand it a certain young man a grocers assistant but not a grocers assistantbut that of course was not his fault his father being an old brutehad behaved most abominably but not on reflection as badly as he might have done and had acted on the whole very honourably taking into consideration the fact that one supposed he could hardly help it  helvetia was of course very indignant with him but on the other hand did not quite see what else she could have done she being not at all sure whether she really cared for him or whether she didnt that everything had been quite proper and would not have happened if she had known it that everything was her fault except most things which werent but that of the two she blamed herself entirely seeing that she could not have guessed anything of the kind  and did he solomon appleyard think that she ought to be very angry and never marry anybody else or was she justified in overlooking it and engaging herself to the only man she felt she could ever love  you mustnt think dad that i meant to deceive you  i should have told you at the beginningyou know i wouldif it hadnt all happened so suddenly  let me see said solomon appleyard did you tell me his name or didnt you  nathaniel said miss appleyard  didnt i mention it  dont happen to know his surname do you inquired her father  grindley explained miss appleyardthe son of grindley the sauce man  miss appleyard experienced one of the surprises of her life  never before to her recollection had her father thwarted a single wish of her life  a widower for the last twelve years his chief delight had been to humour her  his voice as he passionately swore that never with his consent should his daughter marry the son of hezekiah grindley sounded strange to her  pleadings even tears for the first time in her life proved fruitless  here was a pretty kettle of fish  that grindley junior should defy his own parent risk possibly the loss of his inheritance had seemed to both a not improper proceeding  when nathaniel george had said with fine enthusiasm let him keep his money if he will ill make my own way there isnt enough money in the world to pay for losing you  janet helvetia though she had expressed disapproval of such unfilial attitude had in secret sympathised  but for her to disregard the wishes of her own doting father was not to be thought of  what was to be done  perhaps one peter hope residing in gough square hard by might help young folks in sore dilemma with wise counsel  peter hope editor and part proprietor of good humour one penny weekly was much esteemed by solomon appleyard printer and publisher of aforesaid paper  a good fellow old hope solomon would often impress upon his managing clerk  dont worry him more than you can help things will improve  we can trust him  peter hope sat at his desk facing miss appleyard  grindley junior sat on the cushioned seat beneath the middle window  good humours sub editor stood before the fire her hands behind her back  the case appeared to peter hope to be one of exceeding difficulty  of course explained miss appleyard i shall never marry without my fathers consent  peter hope thought the resolution most proper  on the other hand continued miss appleyard nothing shall induce me to marry a man i do not love  miss appleyard thought the probabilities were that she would end by becoming a female missionary  peter hopes experience had led him to the conclusion that young people sometimes changed their mind  the opinion of the house clearly though silently expressed was that peter hopes experience as regarded this particular case counted for nothing  i shall go straight to the governor explained grindley junior and tell him that i consider myself engaged for life to miss appleyard  i know what will happeni know the sort of idea he has got into his head he will disown me and i shall go off to africa  peter hope was unable to see how grindley juniors disappearance into the wilds of africa was going to assist the matter under discussion  grindley juniors view was that the wilds of africa would afford a fitting background to the passing away of a blighted existence  peter hope had a suspicion that grindley junior had for the moment parted company with that sweet reasonableness that otherwise so peter hope felt sure was grindley juniors guiding star  i mean it sir reasserted grindley junior  i am grindley junior was about to add well educated but divining that education was a topic not pleasing at the moment to the ears of helvetia appleyard had tact enough to substitute not a fool  i can earn my own living and i should like to get away  it seems to me said the subeditor  now tommyi mean jane warned her peter hope  he always called her jane in company unless he was excited  i know what you are going to say  i wont have it  i was only going to say urged the subeditor in tone of one suffering injustice  i quite know what you were going to say retorted peter hotly  i can see it by your chin  you are going to take their partand suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents  i wasnt returned the subeditor  i was only  you were persisted peter  i ought not to have allowed you to be present  i might have known you would interfere  going to say we are in want of some help in the office  you know we are  and that if mr grindley would be content with a small salary  small salary be hanged snarled peter  there would be no need for his going to africa  and how would that help us demanded peter  even if the boy were soso headstrong so unfilial as to defy his father who has worked for him all these years how would that remove the obstacle of mr appleyards refusal  why dont you see explained the subeditor  no i dont snapped peter  if on his declaring to his father that nothing will ever induce him to marry any other woman but miss appleyard his father disowns him as he thinks it likely  a dead cert was grindley juniors conviction  very well he is no longer old grindleys son and what possible objection can mr appleyard have to him then  peter hope arose and expounded at length and in suitable language the folly and uselessness of the scheme  but what chance had ever the wisdom of age against the enthusiasm of youth reaching for its object  poor peter expostulating was swept into the conspiracy  grindley junior the next morning stood before his father in the private office in high holborn  i am sorry sir said grindley junior if i have proved a disappointment to you  damn your sympathy said grindley senior  keep it till you are asked for it  i hope we part friends sir said grindley junior holding out his hand  why do you irate me asked grindley senior  i have thought of nothing but you these fiveandtwenty years  i dont sir answered grindley junior  i cant say i love you  it did not seem to me youyou wanted it  but i like you sir and i respect you  andand im sorry to have to hurt you sir  and you are determined to give up all your prospects all the money for the sake of thisthis girl  it doesnt seem like giving up anything sir replied grindley junior simply  it isnt so much as i thought it was going to be said the old man after a pause  perhaps it is for the best  i might have been more obstinate if things had been going all right  the lord has chastened me  isnt the business doing well dad asked the young man with sorrow in his voice  whats it got to do with you snapped his father  youve cut yourself adrift from it  you leave me now i am going down  grindley junior not knowing what to say put his arms round the little old man  and in this way tommys brilliant scheme fell through and came to naught instead old grindley visited once again the big house in nevills court and remained long closeted with old solomon in the office on the second floor  it was late in the evening when solomon opened the door and called upstairs to janet helvetia to come down  i used to know you long ago said hezekiah grindley rising  you were quite a little girl then  later the troublesome sauce disappeared entirely cut out by newer flavours  grindley junior studied the printing business  it almost seemed as if old appleyard had been waiting but for this  some six months later they found him dead in his countinghouse  grindley junior became the printer and publisher of good humour     story the fourthmiss ramsbotham gives her services   to regard miss ramsbotham as a marriageable quantity would have occurred to few men  endowed by nature with every feminine quality calculated to inspire liking she had on the other hand been disinherited of every attribute calculated to excite passion  an ugly woman has for some men an attraction the proof is ever present to our eyes  miss ramsbotham was plain but pleasant looking  large healthy in mind and body capable selfreliant and cheerful blessed with a happy disposition together with a keen sense of humour there was about her absolutely nothing for tenderness to lay hold of  an ideal wife she was an impossible sweetheart  every man was her friend  the suggestion that any man could be her lover she herself would have greeted with a clear ringing laugh  not that she held love in despite for such folly she was possessed of far too much sound sense  to have somebody in love with yousomebody strong and good so she would confess to her few close intimates a dreamy expression clouding for an instant her broad sunny face why it must be just lovely  for miss ramsbotham was prone to american phraseology and had even been at some pains during a six months journey through the states whither she had been commissioned by a conscientious trade journal seeking reliable information concerning the condition of female textile workers to acquire a slight but decided american accent  it was her one affectation but assumed as one might feel certain for a practical and legitimate object  you can have no conception she would explain laughing what a help i find it  im muriken is the civis romanus sum of the modern womans world  it opens every door to us  if i ring the bell and say oh if you please i have come to interview mr soandso for suchandsuch a paper the footman looks through me at the opposite side of the street and tells me to wait in the hall while he inquires if mr soandso will see me or not  but if i say thats my keerd young man  you tell your master miss ramsbotham is waiting for him in the showroom and will take it real kind if hell just bustle himself the poor fellow walks backwards till he stumbles against the bottom stair and my gentleman comes down with profuse apologies for having kept me waiting three minutes and a half  and to be in love with someone she would continue someone great that one could look up to and honour and worshipsomeone that would fill ones whole life make it beautiful make every day worth living i think that would be better still  to work merely for ones self to think merely for ones self it is so much less interesting  then at some such point of the argument miss ramsbotham would jump up from her chair and shake herself indignantly  why what nonsense im talking she would tell herself and her listeners  i make a very fair income have a host of friends and enjoy every hour of my life  i should like to have been pretty or handsome of course but no one can have all the good things of this world and i have my brains  at one time perhaps yes but nowno honestly i would not change myself  miss ramsbotham was sorry that no man had ever fallen in love with her but that she could understand  it is quite clear to me  so she had once unburdened herself to her bosom friend  man for the purposes of the race has been given two kinds of love between which according to his opportunities and temperament he is free to choose he can fall down upon his knees and adore physical beauty for nature ignores entirely our mental side or he can take delight in circling with his protecting arm the weak and helpless  now i make no appeal to either instinct  i possess neither the charm nor beauty to attract  beauty reminded her the bosom friend consolingly dwells in the beholders eye  my dear cheerfully replied miss ramsbotham it would have to be an eye of the range and capacity sam weller frankly owned up to not possessinga patent doublemillion magnifying capable of seeing through a deal board and round the corner sort of eyeto detect any beauty in me  and i am much too big and sensible for any man not a fool ever to think of wanting to take care of me  i believe remembered miss ramsbotham if it does not sound like idle boasting i might have had a husband of a kind if fate had not compelled me to save his life  i met him one year at huyst a small quiet wateringplace on the dutch coast  he would walk always half a step behind me regarding me out of the corner of his eye quite approvingly at times  he was a widowera good little man devoted to his three charming children  they took an immense fancy to me and i really think i could have got on with him  i am very adaptable as you know  but it was not to be  he got out of his depth one morning and unfortunately there was no one within distance but myself who could swim i knew what the result would be  you remember labiches comedy les voyage de monsieur perrichon  of course every man hates having had his life saved after it is over and you can imagine how he must hate having it saved by a woman  but what was i to do  in either case he would be lost to me whether i let him drown or whether i rescued him  so as it really made no difference i rescued him  he was very grateful and left the next morning  it is my destiny  no man has ever fallen in love with me and no man ever will  i used to worry myself about it when i was younger  as a child i hugged to my bosom for years an observation i had overheard an aunt of mine whisper to my mother one afternoon as they sat knitting and talking not thinking i was listening  you never can tell murmured my aunt keeping her eyes carefully fixed upon her needles children change so  i have known the plainest girls grow up into quite beautiful women i should not worry about it if i were younot yet awhile  my mother was not at all a badlooking woman and my father was decidedly handsome so there seemed no reason why i should not hope  i pictured myself the ugly duckling of andersens fairytale and every morning on waking i would run straight to my glass and try to persuade myself that the feathers of the swan were beginning at last to show themselves  miss ramsbotham laughed a genuine laugh of amusement for of selfpity not a trace was now remaining to her  later i plucked hope again continued miss ramsbotham her confession from the reading of a certain school of fiction more popular twenty years ago than now  in these romances the heroine was never what you would call beautiful unless in common with the hero you happened to possess exceptional powers of observation  but she was better than that she was good  i do not regard as time wasted the hours i spent studying this quaint literature  it helped me i am sure to form habits that have since been of service to me  i made a point when any young man visitor happened to be staying with us of rising exceptionally early in the morning so that i always appeared at the breakfasttable fresh cheerful and carefully dressed with when possible a dewbesprinkled flower in my hair to prove that i had already been out in the garden  the effort as far as the young man visitor was concerned was always thrown away as a general rule he came down late himself and generally too drowsy to notice anything much  but it was excellent practice for me  i wake now at seven oclock as a matter of course whatever time i go to bed  i made my own dresses and most of our cakes and took care to let everybody know it  though i say it who should not i play and sing rather well  i certainly was never a fool  i had no little brothers and sisters to whom to be exceptionally devoted but i had my cousins about the house as much as possible and damaged their characters if anything by overindulgence  my dear it never caught even a curate  i am not one of those women to run down men i think them delightful creatures and in a general way i find them very intelligent  but where their hearts are concerned it is the girl with the frizzy hair who wants two people to help her over the stile that is their idea of an angel  no man could fall in love with me he couldnt if he tried  that i can understand butmiss ramsbotham sunk her voice to a more confidential tonewhat i cannot understand is that i have never fallen in love with any man because i like them all  you have given the explanation yourself suggested the bosom friendone susan fossett the aunt emma of the ladies journal a nice woman but talkative  you are too sensible  miss ramsbotham shook her head i should just love to fall in love  when i think about it i feel quite ashamed of myself for not having done so  whether it was this idea namely that it was her duty or whether it was that passion came to her unsought somewhat late in life and therefore all the stronger she herself would perhaps have been unable to declare certain only it is that at over thirty years of age this clever sensible clearseeing woman fell to sighing and blushing starting and stammering at the sounding of a name as though for all the world she had been a lovesick girl in her teens  susan fossett her bosom friend brought the strange tidings to bohemia one foggy november afternoon her opportunity being a teaparty given by peter hope to commemorate the birthday of his adopted daughter and sub editor jane helen commonly called tommy  the actual date of tommys birthday was known only to the gods but out of the london mist to wifeless childless peter she had come the evening of a certain november the eighteenth and therefore by peter and his friends november the eighteenth had been marked upon the calendar as a day on which they should rejoice together  it is bound to leak out sooner or later susan fossett was convinced so i may as well tell you that gaby mary ramsbotham has got herself engaged  nonsense was peter hopes involuntary ejaculation  precisely what i mean to tell her the very next time i see her added susan  who to demanded tommy  you mean to whom  the preeposition governs the objective case corrected her james douglas mctear commonly called the wee laddie who himself wrote english better than he spoke it  i meant to whom explained tommy  ye didna say it persisted the wee laddie  i dont know to whom replied miss ramsbothams bosom friend sipping tea and breathing indignation  to something idiotic and incongruous that will make her life a misery to her  somerville the briefless held that in the absence of all data such conclusion was unjustifiable  if it had been to anything sensible was miss fossetts opinion she would not have kept me in the dark about it to spring it upon me like a bombshell  ive never had so much as a hint from her until i received this absurd scrawl an hour ago  miss fossett produced from her bag a letter written in pencil  there can be no harm in your hearing it was miss fossetts excuse it will give you an idea of the state of the poor things mind  the teadrinkers left their cups and gathered round her  dear susan read miss fossett i shall not be able to be with you tomorrow  please get me out of it nicely  i cant remember at the moment what it is youll be surprised to hear that im engagedto be married i mean i can hardly realise it  i hardly seem to know where i am  have just made up my mind to run down to yorkshire and see grandmamma  i must do something  i must talk to somebody andforgive me dearbut you are so sensible and just nowwell i dont feel sensible  will tell you all about it when i see younext week perhaps  you must try to like him  he is so handsome and really cleverin his own way  dont scold me  i never thought it possible that anyone could be so happy its quite a different sort of happiness to any other sort of happiness  i dont know how to describe it  please ask burcot to let me off the antequarian congress  i feel i should do it badly  i am so thankful he has no relativesin england  i should have been so terribly nervous  twelve hours ago i could not have dreamt of it and now i walk on tiptoe for fear of waking up  did i leave my chinchilla at your rooms  dont be angry with me  i should have told you if i had known  in haste  yours mary  its dated from marylebone road and yesterday afternoon she did leave her chinchilla in my rooms which makes me think it really must be from mary ramsbotham  otherwise i should have my doubts added miss fossett as she folded up the letter and replaced it in her bag  id is love was the explanation of dr william smith his round red face illuminated with poetic ecstasy  love has gone to herhas dransformed her once again into the leedle maid  love retorted susan fossett doesnt transform an intelligent educated woman into a person who writes a letter all in jerks underlines every other word spells antiquarian with an e and burcotts name whom she has known for the last eight years with only one t  the woman has gone stark staring mad  we must wait until we have seen him was peters judicious view  i should be so glad to think that the dear lady was happy  so should i added miss fossett drily  one of the most sensible women i have ever met commented william clodd  lucky man whoever he is  half wish id thought of it myself  i am not saying that he isnt retorted miss fossett  it isnt him im worrying about  i preesume you mean he suggested the wee laddie  the verb to be  for goodness sake suggested miss fossett to tommy give that man something to eat or drink  thats the worst of people who take up grammar late in life  like all converts they become fanatical  shes a ripping good sort is mary ramsbotham exclaimed grindley junior printer and publisher of good humour  the marvel to me is that no man hitherto has ever had the sense to want her  oh you men cried miss fossett  a pretty face and an empty head is all you want  must they always go together laughed mrs grindley junior nee helvetia appleyard  exceptions prove the rule grunted miss fossett  what a happy saying that is smiled mrs grindley junior  i wonder sometimes how conversation was ever carried on before it was invented  de man who would fall in love wid our dear frent mary thought dr smith he must be quite egsceptional  you neednt talk about her as if she was a monsteri mean were corrected herself miss fossett with a hasty glance towards the wee laddie  there isnt a man i know thats worthy of her  i mean explained the doctor dat he must be a man of characterof brain  id is de noble man dat is attracted by de noble woman  by the chorusgirl more often suggested miss fossett  we must hope for the best counselled peter  i cannot believe that a clever capable woman like mary ramsbotham would make a fool of herself  from what i have seen replied miss fossett its just the clever peopleas regards this particular matterwho do make fools of themselves  unfortunately miss fossetts judgment proved to be correct  on being introduced a fortnight later to miss ramsbothams fiance the impulse of bohemia was to exclaim great scott  whatever in the name of  then on catching sight of miss ramsbothams transfigured face and trembling hands bohemia recollected itself in time to murmur instead delighted im sure and to offer mechanical congratulations  reginald peters was a pretty but remarkably foolishlooking lad of about twoandtwenty with curly hair and receding chin but to miss ramsbotham evidently a promising apollo  her first meeting with him had taken place at one of the many political debating societies then in fashion attendance at which miss ramsbotham found useful for purposes of journalistic copy miss ramsbotham hitherto a radical of pronounced views he had succeeded under three months in converting into a strong supporter of the gentlemanly party  his feeble political platitudes which a little while before she would have seized upon merrily to ridicule she now sat drinking in her plain face suffused with admiration  away from him and in connection with those subjectssomewhat numerousabout which he knew little and cared less she retained her sense and humour but in his presence she remained comparatively speechless gazing up into his somewhat watery eyes with the grateful expression of one learning wisdom from a master  her absurd adorationirritating beyond measure to her friends and which even to her lover had he possessed a grain of sense would have appeared ridiculousto master peters was evidently a gratification  of selfish exacting nature he must have found the services of this brilliant woman of the world of much practical advantage  knowing all the most interesting people in london it was her pride and pleasure to introduce him everywhere  her friends put up with him for her sake to please her made him welcome did their best to like him and disguised their failure  the free entry to a places of amusement saved his limited purse  her influence he had instinct enough to perceive could not fail to be of use to him in his profession that of a barrister  she praised him to prominent solicitors took him to tea with judges wives interested examiners on his behalf  in return he overlooked her many disadvantages and did not fail to let her know it  miss ramsbothams gratitude was boundless  i do so wish i were younger and better looking she sighed to the bosom friend  for myself i dont mind i have got used to it  but it is so hard on reggie  he feels it i know he does though he never openly complains  he would be a cad if he did answered susan fossett who having tried conscientiously for a month to tolerate the fellow had in the end declared her inability even to do more than avoid open expression of cordial dislike  added to which i dont quite see of what use it would be  you never told him you were young and pretty did you  i told him my dear replied miss ramsbotham the actual truth  i dont want to take any credit for doing so it seemed the best course you see unfortunately i look my age  with most men it would have made a difference  you have no idea how good he is  he assured me he had engaged himself to me with his eyes open and that there was no need to dwell upon unpleasant topics  it is so wonderful to me that he should care for mehe who could have half the women in london at his feet  yes hes the type that would attract them i daresay agreed susan fossett  but are you quite sure that he doescare for you i mean  my dear returned miss ramsbotham you remember rochefoucaulds definition  one loves the other consents to be loved  if he will only let me do that i shall be content  it is more than i had any right to expect  oh you are a fool told her bluntly her bosom friend  i know i am admitted miss ramsbotham but i had no idea that being a fool was so delightful  bohemia grew day by day more indignant and amazed  young peters was not even a gentleman  all the little offices of courtship he left to her  it was she who helped him on with his coat and afterwards adjusted her own cloak she who carried the parcel she who followed into and out of the restaurant  only when he thought anyone was watching would he make any attempt to behave to her with even ordinary courtesy  he bullied her contradicted her in public ignored her openly  bohemia fumed with impotent rage yet was bound to confess that so far as miss ramsbotham herself was concerned he had done more to make her happy than had ever all bohemia put together  a tender light took up its dwelling in her eyes which for the first time it was noticed were singularly deep and expressive  the blood of which she possessed if anything too much now came and went so that her cheeks in place of their insistent red took on a varied pink and white  life had entered her thick dark hair giving to it shade and shadow  the woman began to grow younger  she put on flesh  sex hitherto dormant began to show itself femininities peeped out  new tones suggesting possibilities crept into her voice  bohemia congratulated itself that the affair after all might turn out well  then master peters spoiled everything by showing a better side to his nature and careless of all worldly considerations falling in love himself honestly with a girl at the bun shop  he did the best thing under the circumstances that he could have done told miss ramsbotham the plain truth and left the decision in her hands  miss ramsbotham acted as anyone who knew her would have foretold possibly in the silence of her delightful little fourroomed flat over the tailors shop in marylebone road her sober worthy maid dismissed for a holiday she may have shed some tears but if so no trace of them was allowed to mar the peace of mind of mr peters  she merely thanked him for being frank with her and by a little present pain saving them both a future of disaster  it was quite understandable she knew he had never really been in love with her  she had thought him the type of man that never does fall in love as the word is generally understoodmiss ramsbotham did not add with anyone except himselfand had that been the case and he content merely to be loved they might have been happy together  as it waswell it was fortunate he had found out the truth before it was too late  now would he take her advice  mr peters was genuinely grateful as well he might be and would consent to any suggestion that miss ramsbotham might make felt he had behaved shabbily was very much ashamed of himself would be guided in all things by miss ramsbotham whom he should always regard as the truest of friends and so on  miss ramsbothams suggestion was this mr peters no more robust of body than of mind had been speaking for some time past of travel  having nothing to do now but to wait for briefs why not take this opportunity of visiting his only welltodo relative a canadian farmer  meanwhile let miss peggy leave the bun shop and take up her residence in miss ramsbothams flat  let there be no engagementmerely an understanding the girl was pretty charming good miss ramsbotham felt sure butwell a little education a little training in manners and behaviour would not be amiss would it  if on returning at the end of six months or a year mr peters was still of the same mind and peggy also wishful the affair would be easier would it not  there followed further expressions of eternal gratitude  miss ramsbotham swept all such aside  it would be pleasant to have a bright young girl to live with her teaching moulding such an one would be a pleasant occupation  and thus it came to pass that mr reginald peters disappeared for a while from bohemia to the regret of but few and there entered into it one peggy nutcombe as pretty a child as ever gladdened the eye of man  she had wavy flaxen hair a complexion that might have been manufactured from the essence of wild roses the nose that tennyson bestows upon his millers daughter and a mouth worthy of the lowther arcade in its days of glory  add to this the quick grace of a kitten with the appealing helplessness of a baby in its first short frock and you will be able to forgive mr reginald peters his faithlessness  bohemia looked from one to the otherfrom the fairy to the womanand ceased to blame  that the fairy was as stupid as a camel as selfish as a pig and as lazy as a nigger bohemia did not know norso long as her figure and complexion remained what it waswould its judgment have been influenced even if it had  i speak of the bohemian male  but that is just what her figure and complexion did not do  mr reginald peters finding his uncle old feeble and inclined to be fond deemed it to his advantage to stay longer than he had intended  twelve months went by  miss peggy was losing her kittenish grace was becoming lumpy  a couple of pimplesone near the righthand corner of her rosebud mouth and another on the lefthand side of her tiptilted nosemarred her baby face  at the end of another six months the men called her plump and the women fat  her walk was degenerating into a waddle stairs caused her to grunt  she took to breathing with her mouth and bohemia noticed that her teeth were small badly coloured and uneven  the pimples grew in size and number  the cream and white of her complexion was merging into a general yellow  a certain greasiness of skin was manifesting itself babyish ways in connection with a woman who must have weighed about eleven stone struck bohemia as incongruous  her manners judged alone had improved  but they had not improved her  they did not belong to her they did not fit her  they sat on her as sunday broadcloth on a yokel  she had learned to employ her hs correctly and to speak good grammar  this gave to her conversation a painfully artificial air  the little learning she had absorbed was sufficient to bestow upon her an angry consciousness of her own invincible ignorance  meanwhile miss ramsbotham had continued upon her course of rejuvenation at twentynine she had looked thirtyfive at thirtytwo she looked not a day older than fiveandtwenty  bohemia felt that should she retrograde further at the same rate she would soon have to shorten her frocks and let down her hair  a nervous excitability had taken possession of her that was playing strange freaks not only with her body but with her mind  what it gave to the one it seemed to take from the other  old friends accustomed to enjoy with her the luxury of plain speech wondered in vain what they had done to offend her  her desire was now towards new friends new faces  her sense of humour appeared to be departing from her it became unsafe to jest with her  on the other hand she showed herself greedy for admiration and flattery  her former chums stepped back astonished to watch brainless young fops making their way with her by complimenting her upon her blouse or whispering to her some trite nonsense about her eyelashes  from her work she took a good percentage of her brain power to bestow it on her clothes  of course she was successful  her dresses suited her showed her to the best advantage  beautiful she could never be and had sense enough to know it but a charming distinguishedlooking woman she had already become also she was on the high road to becoming a vain egotistical commonplace woman  it was during the process of this her metamorphosis that peter hope one evening received a note from her announcing her intention of visiting him the next morning at the editorial office of good humour  she added in a postscript that she would prefer the interview to be private  punctually to the time appointed miss ramsbotham arrived  miss ramsbotham contrary to her custom opened conversation with the weather miss ramsbotham was of opinion that there was every possibility of rain peter hopes experience was that there was always possibility of rain  how is the paper doing demanded miss ramsbotham  the paperfor a paper not yet two years oldwas doing well  we expect very shortlyvery shortly indeed explained peter hope to turn the corner  ah that corner sympathised miss ramsbotham  i confess smiled peter hope it doesnt seem to be exactly a right angled corner  one reaches it as one thinks  but it takes some getting roundwhat i should describe as a cornery corner  what you want thought miss ramsbotham are one or two popular features  popular features agreed peter guardedly scenting temptation are not to be despised provided one steers clear of the vulgar and the commonplace  a ladies page suggested miss ramsbothama page that should make the woman buy it  the women believe me are going to be of more and more importance to the weekly press  but why should she want a special page to herself demanded peter hope why should not the paper as a whole appeal to her  it doesnt was all miss ramsbotham could offer in explanation  we give her literature and the drama poetry fiction the higher politics the  i know i know interrupted miss ramsbotham who of late among other failings new to her had developed a tendency towards impatience but she gets all that in half a dozen other papers  i have thought it out miss ramsbotham leaned further across the editorial desk and sunk her voice unconsciously to a confidential whisper  tell her the coming fashions  discuss the question whether hat or bonnet makes you look the younger  tell her whether red hair or black is to be the new colour what size waist is being worn by the best people  oh come laughed miss ramsbotham in answer to peters shocked expression one cannot reform the world and human nature all at once  you must appeal to peoples folly in order to get them to listen to your wisdom  make your paper a success first  you can make it a power afterwards  but argued peter there are already such paperspapers devoted toto that sort of thing and to nothing else  at sixpence replied the practical miss ramsbotham  i am thinking of the lower middleclass woman who has twenty pounds a year to spend on dress and who takes twelve hours a day to think about it poor creature my dear friend there is a fortune in it  think of the advertisements  poor peter groanedold peter the dreamer of dreams  but for thought of tommy one day to be left alone to battle with a stonyeyed deaf world peter most assuredly would have risen in his wrath would have said to his distinguishedlooking temptress get thee behind me miss ramsbotham  my journalistic instinct whispers to me that your scheme judged by the mammon of unrighteousness is good  it is a new departure ten years hence half the london journals will have adopted it  there is money in it  but what of that  shall i for mere dross sell my editorial soul turn the temple of the mighty pen into a den ofof milliners  good morning miss ramsbotham  i grieve for you  i grieve for you as for a fellowworker once inspired by devotion to a noble calling who has fallen from her high estate  good morning madam  so peter thought as he sat tattooing with his fingertips upon the desk but only said  it would have to be well done  everything would depend upon how it was done agreed miss ramsbotham badly done the idea would be wasted  you would be merely giving it away to some other paper  do you know of anyone queried peter  i was thinking of myself answered miss ramsbotham  i am sorry said peter hope  why demanded miss ramsbotham  dont you think i could do it  i think said peter no one could do it better  i am sorry you should wish to do itthat is all  i want to do it replied miss ramsbotham a note of doggedness in her voice  how much do you propose to charge me peter smiled  nothing  my dear lady  i could not in conscience explained miss ramsbotham take payment from both sides  i am going to make a good deal out of it  i am going to make out of it at least three hundred a year and they will be glad to pay it  who will  the dressmakers  i shall be one of the most stylish women in london laughed miss ramsbotham  you used to be a sensible woman peter reminded her  i want to live  cant you manage to do it withoutwithout being a fool my dear  no answered miss ramsbotham a woman cant  ive tried it  very well agreed peter be it so  peter had risen  he laid his shapely white old hand upon the womans shoulder  tell me when you want to give it up  i shall be glad  thus it was arranged  good humour gained circulation andof more importance yetadvertisements and miss ramsbotham as she had predicted the reputation of being one of the bestdressed women in london  her reason for desiring such reputation peter hope had shrewdly guessed  two months later his suspicions were confirmed  mr reginald peters his uncle being dead was on his way back to england  his return was awaited with impatience only by the occupants of the little flat in the marylebone road and between these two the difference of symptom was marked  mistress peggy too stupid to comprehend the change that had been taking place in her looked forward to her lovers arrival with delight  mr reginald peters independently of his profession was in consequence of his uncles death a man of means  miss ramsbothams tutelage which had always been distasteful to her would now be at an end  she would be a lady in the true sense of the wordaccording to miss peggys definition a woman with nothing to do but eat and drink and nothing to think of but dress  miss ramsbotham on the other hand who might have anticipated the homecoming of her quondam admirer with hope exhibited a strange condition of alarmed misery which increased from day to day as the date drew nearer  the meetingwhether by design or accident was never knowntook place at an evening party given by the proprietors of a new journal  the circumstance was certainly unfortunate for poor peggy whom bohemia began to pity  mr peters knowing both women would be there and so on the lookout saw in the distance among the crowd of notabilities a superbly millinered tall graceful woman whose face recalled sensations he could not for the moment place  chiefly noticeable about her were her exquisite neck and arms and the air of perfect breeding with which she moved talking and laughing through the distinguished fashionable throng  beside her strutted nervously aggressive a vulgar fat pimply shapeless young woman attracting universal attention by the incongruity of her presence in the room  on being greeted by the graceful lady of the neck and arms the conviction forced itself upon him that this could be no other than the once miss ramsbotham plain of face and indifferent of dress whose very appearance he had almost forgotten on being greeted gushingly as reggie by the sallowcomplexioned over dressed young woman he bowed with evident astonishment and apologised for a memory that so he assured the lady had always been to him a source of despair  of course he thanked his starsand miss ramsbothamthat the engagement had never been formal  so far as mr peters was concerned there was an end to mistress peggys dream of an existence of everlasting breakfasts in bed  leaving the ramsbotham flat she returned to the maternal roof and there a course of hard work and plain living tended greatly to improve her figure and complexion so that in course of time the gods smiling again upon her she married a foreman printer and passes out of this story  meanwhile mr reginald petersolder and the possessor perhaps of more senselooked at miss ramsbotham with new eyes and now not tolerated but desired her  bohemia waited to assist at the happy termination of a pretty and somewhat novel romance  miss ramsbotham had shown no sign of being attracted elsewhere  flattery compliment she continued to welcome but merely so it seemed as favourable criticism suitors more fit and proper were now not lacking for miss ramsbotham though a woman less desirable when won came readily to the thought of wooing  but to all such she turned a laughing face  i like her for it declared susan fossett and he has improvedthere was room for itthough i wish it could have been some other  there was jack herringit would have been so much more suitable  or even joe in spite of his size  but its her wedding not ours and she will never care for anyone else  and bohemia bought its presents and had them ready but never gave them a few months later mr reginald peters returned to canada a bachelor miss ramsbotham expressed her desire for another private interview with peter hope  i may as well keep on the letter to clorinda thought miss ramsbotham i have got into the knack of it  but i will get you to pay me for it in the ordinary way  i would rather have done so from the beginning explained peter  i know  i could not in conscience as i told you take from both sides for the futurewell they have said nothing but i expect they are beginning to get tired of it  and you questioned peter  yes  i am tired of it myself laughed miss ramsbotham  life isnt long enough to be a welldressed woman  you have done with all that  i hope so answered miss ramsbotham  and dont want to talk any more about it suggested peter  not just at present  i should find it so difficult to explain  by others less sympathetic than old peter vigorous attempts were made to solve the mystery  miss ramsbotham took enjoyment in cleverly evading these tormentors  thwarted at every point the gossips turned to other themes  miss ramsbotham found interest once again in the higher branches of her calling became again by slow degrees the sensible frank good sort that bohemia had known liked respectedeverything but loved  years later to susan fossett the case was made clear and through susan fossett a nice enough woman but talkative those few still interested learned the explanation  love said miss ramsbotham to the bosom friend is not regulated by reason  as you say there were many men i might have married with much more hope of happiness  but i never cared for any other man  he was not intellectual was egotistical possibly enough selfish  the man should always be older than the woman he was younger and he was a weak character  yet i loved him  i am glad you didnt marry him said the bosom friend  so am i agreed miss ramsbotham  if you cant trust me had said the bosom friend at this point dont  i meant to do right said miss ramsbotham upon my word of honour i did in the beginning  i dont understand said the bosom friend  if she had been my own child continued miss ramsbotham i could not have done morein the beginning  i tried to teach her to put some sense into her  lord the hours i wasted on that little idiot  i marvel at my own patience  she was nothing but an animal  an animal she had only an animals vices  to eat and drink and sleep was her idea of happiness her one ambition male admiration and she hadnt character enough to put sufficient curb upon her stomach to retain it  i reasoned with her i pleaded with her i bullied her  had i persisted i might have succeeded by sheer physical and mental strength in restraining her from ruining herself  i was winning  i had made her frightened of me had i gone on i might have won  by dragging her out of bed in the morning by insisting upon her taking exercise by regulating every particle of food and drink she put into her mouth i kept the little beast in good condition for nearly three months  then i had to go away into the country for a few days she swore she would obey my instructions  when i came back i found she had been in bed most of the time and had been living chiefly on chocolate and cakes  she was curled up asleep in an easychair snoring with her mouth wide open when i opened the door  and at sight of that picture the devil came to me and tempted me  why should i waste my time wear myself out in mind and body that the man i loved should marry a pig because it looked like an angel  six months wallowing according to its own desires would reveal it in its true shape  so from that day i left it to itself  no worse than thati dont want to spare myselfi encouraged her  i let her have a fire in her bedroom and half her meals in bed  i let her have chocolate with tablespoonfuls of cream floating on the top she loved it she was never really happy except when eating  i let her order her own meals  i took a fiendish delight watching the dainty limbs turning to shapeless fat the pinkandwhite complexion growing blotchy  it is flesh that man loves brain and mind and heart and soul he never thinks of them  this little pinkandwhite sow could have cut me out with solomon himself  why should such creatures have the world arranged for them and we not be allowed to use our brains in our own defence  but for my lookingglass i might have resisted the temptation but i always had something of the man in me the sport of the thing appealed to me  i suppose it was the nervous excitement under which i was living that was changing me  all my sap was going into my body  given sufficient time i might meet her with her own weapons animal against animal  well you know the result i won  there was no doubt about his being in love with me  his eyes would follow me round the room feasting on me  i had become a fine animal  men desired me do you know why i refused him  he was in every way a better man than the silly boy i had fallen in love with but he came back with a couple of false teeth i saw the gold setting one day when he opened his mouth to laugh  i dont say for a moment my dear there is no such thing as lovelove pure ennobling worthy of men and women its roots in the heart and nowhere else  but that love i had missed and the other  i saw it in its true light  i had fallen in love with him because he was a pretty curlyheaded boy  he had fallen in love with peggy when she was pinkandwhite and slim  i shall always see the look that came into his eyes when she spoke to him at the hotel the look of disgust and loathing  the girl was the same it was only her body that had grown older  i could see his eyes fixed upon my arms and neck  i had got to grow old in time brown skinned and wrinkled  i thought of him growing bald fat  if you had fallen in love with the right man had said susan fossett those ideas would not have come to you  i know said miss ramsbotham  he will have to like me thin and in these clothes just because i am nice and good company and helpful that is the man i am waiting for  he never came along  a charming brighteyed whitehaired lady occupies alone a little flat in the marylebone road looks in occasionally at the writers club  she is still miss ramsbotham  baldheaded gentlemen feel young again talking to her she is so sympathetic so bigminded so understanding  then hearing the clock strike tear themselves from her with a sigh and return homesome of themto stupid shrewish wives     story the fifthjoey loveredge agreeson certain termsto join the company   the most popular member of the autolycus club was undoubtedly joseph loveredge  small chubby cleanshaven his somewhat longish soft brown hair parted in the middle strangers fell into the error of assuming him to be younger than he really was  it is on record that a leading lady novelistaccepting her at her own estimateirritated by his polite but firm refusal to allow her entrance into his own editorial office without appointment had once boxed his ears under the impression that he was his own officeboy  guests to the autolycus club on being introduced to him would give to him kind messages to take home to his father with whom they remembered having been at school together  this sort of thing might have annoyed anyone with less sense of humour  joseph loveredge would tell such stories himself keenly enjoying the jestwas even suspected of inventing some of the more improbable  another fact tending to the popularity of joseph loveredge among all classes over and above his amiability his wit his genuine kindliness and his neverfailing fund of good stories was that by care and inclination he had succeeded in remaining a bachelor  many had been the attempts to capture him nor with the passing of the years had interest in the sport shown any sign of diminution  well over the frailties and distempers so dangerous to youth of staid and sober habits with an everincreasing capital invested in sound securities together with an everincreasing income from his pen with a tastefully furnished house overlooking regents park an excellent and devoted cook and housekeeper and relatives mostly settled in the colonies joseph loveredge though inexperienced girls might pass him by with a contemptuous sniff was recognised by ladies of maturer judgment as a prize not too often dangled before the eyes of spinsterhood  old foxesso we are assured by kind hearted country gentlemenrather enjoy than otherwise a day with the hounds  however that may be certain it is that joseph loveredge confident of himself one presumes showed no particular disinclination to the chase  perhaps on the whole he preferred the society of his own sex with whom he could laugh and jest with more freedom to whom he could tell his stories as they came to him without the trouble of having to turn them over first in his own mind but on the other hand joey made no attempt to avoid female company whenever it came his way and then no cavalier could render himself more agreeable more unobtrusively attentive  younger men stood by in envious admiration of the ease with which in five minutes he would establish himself on terms of cosy friendship with the brilliant beauty before whose gracious coldness they had stood shivering for months the daring with which he would tuck under his arm so to speak the prettiest girl in the room smooth down as if by magic her hundred prickles and tease her out of her overwhelming sense of her own selfimportance  the secret of his success was probably that he was not afraid of them  desiring nothing from them beyond companionableness a reasonable amount of appreciation for his jokeswhich without being exceptionally stupid they would have found it difficult to withholdwith just sufficient information and intelligence to make conversation interesting there was nothing about him by which they could lay hold of him  of course that rendered them particularly anxious to lay hold of him  josephs lady friends might roughly speaking be divided into two groups the unmarried who wanted to marry him to themselves and the married who wanted to marry him to somebody else  it would be a social disaster the latter had agreed among themselves if joseph loveredge should never wed  he would make such an excellent husband for poor bridget  or gladys  i wonder how old gladys really is  such a nice kind little man  and when one thinks of the sort of men that are married it does seem such a pity  i wonder why he never has married because hes just the sort of man youd think would have married  i wonder if he ever was in love  oh my dear you dont mean to tell me that a man has reached the age of forty without ever being in love  the ladies would sigh  i do hope if ever he does marry it will be somebody nice  men are so easily deceived  i shouldnt be surprised myself a bit if something came of it with bridget  shes a dear girl bridgetso genuine  well i think myself dear if its anyone its gladys  i should be so glad to see poor dear gladys settled  the unmarried kept their thoughts more to themselves  each one upon reflection saw ground for thinking that joseph loveredge had given proof of feeling preference for herself  the irritating thing was that on further reflection it was equally clear that joseph loveredge had shown signs of preferring most of the others  meanwhile joseph loveredge went undisturbed upon his way  at eight oclock in the morning josephs housekeeper entered the room with a cup of tea and a dry biscuit  at eightfifteen joseph loveredge arose and performed complicated exercises on an indiarubber pulley warranted if persevered in to bestow grace upon the figure and elasticity upon the limbs  joseph loveredge persevered steadily and had done so for years and was himself contented with the result which seeing it concerned nobody else was all that could be desired  at halfpast eight on mondays wednesdays and fridays joseph loveredge breakfasted on one cup of tea brewed by himself one egg boiled by himself and two pieces of toast the first one spread with marmalade the second with butter  on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays joseph loveredge discarded eggs and ate a rasher of bacon  on sundays joseph loveredge had both eggs and bacon but then allowed himself half an hour longer for reading the paper  at ninethirty joseph loveredge left the house for the office of the oldestablished journal of which he was the incorruptible and honoured city editor  at onefortyfive having left his office at one thirty joseph loveredge entered the autolycus club and sat down to lunch  everything else in josephs life was arranged with similar preciseness so far as was possible with the duties of a city editor monday evening joseph spent with musical friends at brixton  friday was josephs theatre night  on tuesdays and thursdays he was open to receive invitations out to dinner on wednesdays and saturdays he invited four friends to dine with him at regents park  on sundays whatever the season joseph loveredge took an excursion into the country  he had his regular hours for reading his regular hours for thinking  whether in fleet street or the tyrol on the thames or in the vatican you might recognise him from afar by his grey frockcoat his patentleather boots his brown felt hat his lavender tie  the man was a born bachelor  when the news of his engagement crept through the smoky portals of the autolycus club nobody believed it  impossible asserted jack herring  ive known joeys life for fifteen years  every five minutes is arranged for  he could never have found the time to do it  he doesnt like women not in that way ive heard him say so explained alexander the poet  his opinion is that women are the artists of societydelightful as entertainers but troublesome to live with  i call to mind said the wee laddie a story he told me in this verra room barely three months agone some half a dozen of them were gong home together from the devonshire  they had had a joyous evening and one of themjoey did not notice whichsuggested their dropping in at his place just for a final whisky  they were laughing and talking in the dining room when their hostess suddenly appeared upon the scene in a costumeso joey described itthe charm of which was its variety  she was a nice looking woman joey said but talked too much and when the first lull occurred joey turned to the man sitting nighest to him and who looked bored and suggested in a whisper that it was about time they went  perhaps you had better go assented the boredlooking man  wish i could come with you but you see i live here  i dont believe it said somerville the briefless  hes been cracking his jokes and some silly woman has taken him seriously  but the rumour grew into report developed detail lost all charm expanded into plain recital of fact  joey had not been seen within the club for more than a weekin itself a deadly confirmation  the question became who was shewhat was she like  its none of our set or we should have heard something from her side before now argued acutely somerville the briefless  some beastly kid who will invite us to dances and forget the supper feared johnny bulstrode commonly called the babe  old men always fall in love with young girls  forty explained severely peter hope editor and part proprietor of good humour is not old  well it isnt young persisted johnny  good thing for you johnny if it is a girl thought jack herring somebody for you to play with  i often feel sorry for you having nobody but grownup people to talk to  they do get a bit stodgy after a certain age agreed the babe  i am hoping said peter it will be some sensible pleasant woman a little over thirty  he is a dear fellow loveredge and forty is a very good age for a man to marry  well if im not married before im forty said the babe  oh dont you fret jack herring interrupted hima pretty boy like you  we will give a ball next season and bring you out if youre goodget you off our hands in no time  it was august  joey went away for his holiday without again entering the club  the ladys name was henrietta elizabeth doone  it was said by the morning post that she was connected with the doones of gloucestershire  doones of gloucestershiredoones of gloucestershire mused miss ramsbotham society journalist who wrote the weekly letter to clorinda discussing the matter with peter hope in the editorial office of good humour  knew a doon who kept a big secondhand store in euston road and called himself an auctioneer  he bought a small place in gloucestershire and added an e to his name  wonder if its the same  i had a cat called elizabeth once said peter hope  i dont see what thats got to do with it  no of course not agreed peter  but i was rather fond of it  it was a quaint sort of animal considered as a catwould never speak to another cat and hated being out after ten oclock at night  what happened to it demanded miss ramsbotham  fell off a roof sighed peter hope  wasnt used to them  the marriage took place abroad at the english church at montreux  mr and mrs loveredge returned at the end of september  the autolycus club subscribed to send a present of a punchbowl left cards and waited with curiosity to see the bride  but no invitation arrived  nor for a month was joey himself seen within the club  then one foggy afternoon waking after a doze with a cold cigar in his mouth jack herring noticed he was not the only occupant of the smokingroom  in a far corner near a window sat joseph loveredge reading a magazine  jack herring rubbed his eyes then rose and crossed the room  i thought at first explained jack herring recounting the incident later in the evening that i must be dreaming  there he sat drinking his five oclock whiskyandsoda the same joey loveredge i had known for fifteen years yet not the same  not a feature altered not a hair on his head changed yet the whole face was different the same body the same clothes but another man  we talked for half an hour he remembered everything that joey loveredge had known  i couldnt understand it then as the clock struck and he rose saying he must be home at half past five the explanation suddenly occurred to me joey loveredge was dead this was a married man  we dont want your feeble efforts at psychological romance told him somerville the briefless  we want to know what you talked about  dead or married the man who can drink whiskyandsoda must be held responsible for his actions  whats the little beggar mean by cutting us all in this way  did he ask after any of us  did he leave any message for any of us  did he invite any of us to come an see him  yes he did ask after nearly everybody i was coming to that  but he didnt leave any message  i didnt gather that he was pining for old relationships with any of us  well i shall go round to the office tomorrow morning said somerville the briefless and force my way in if necessary  this is getting mysterious  but somerville returned only to puzzle the autolycus club still further joey had talked about the weather the state of political parties had received with unfeigned interest all gossip concerning his old friends but about himself his wife nothing had been gleaned  mrs loveredge was well mrs loveredges relations were also well  but at present mrs loveredge was not receiving  members of the autolycus club with time upon their hands took up the business of private detectives  mrs loveredge turned out to be a handsome welldressed lady of about thirty as peter hope had desired at eleven in the morning mrs loveredge shopped in the neighbourhood of the hampstead road  in the afternoon mrs loveredge in a hired carriage would slowly promenade the park looking it was noticed with intense interest at the occupants of other carriages as they passed but evidently having no acquaintances among them  the carriage as a general rule would call at joeys office at five and mr and mrs loveredge would drive home  jack herring as the oldest friend urged by the other members took the bull by the horns and called boldly  on neither occasion was mrs loveredge at home  im damned if i go again said jack  she was in the second time i know  i watched her into the house  confound the stuckup pair of them  bewilderment gave place to indignation  now and again joey would creep a mental shadow of his former self into the club where once every member would have risen with a smile to greet him  they gave him curt answers and turned away from him  peter hope one afternoon found him there alone standing with his hands in his pockets looking out of window peter was fifty so he said maybe a little older men of forty were to him mere boys  so peter who hated mysteries stepped forward with a determined air and clapped joey on the shoulder  i want to know joey said peter i want to know whether i am to go on liking you or whether ive got to think poorly of you  out with it  joey turned to him a face so full of misery that peters heart was touched  you cant tell how wretched it makes me said joey  i didnt know it was possible to feel so uncomfortable as i have felt during these last three months  its the wife i suppose suggested peter  shes a dear girl  she only has one fault  its a pretty big one returned peter  i should try and break her of it if i were you  break her of it cried the little man  you might as well advise me to break a brick wall with my head  i had no idea what they were like  i never dreamt it  but what is her objection to us  we are clean we are fairly intelligent  my dear peter do you think i havent said all that and a hundred things more  a woman she gets an idea into her head and every argument against it hammers it in further  she has gained her notion of what she calls bohemia from the comic journals  its our own fault we have done it ourselves  theres no persuading her that its a libel  wont she see a few of usjudge for herself  theres porsonwhy porson might have been a bishop  or somervillesomervilles oxford accent is wasted here  it has no chance  it isnt only that explained joey she has ambitions social ambitions  she thinks that if we begin with the wrong set well never get into the right  we have three friends at present and so far as i can see are never likely to have any more  my dear boy youd never believe there could exist such bores  theres a man and his wife named holyoake  they dine with us on thursdays and we dine with them on tuesdays  their only title to existence consists in their having a cousin in the house of lords they claim no other right themselves  he is a widower getting on for eighty  apparently hes the only relative they have and when he dies they talk of retiring into the country theres a fellow named cutler who visited once at marlborough house in connection with a charity  youd think to listen to him that he had designs upon the throne  the most tiresome of them all is a noisy woman who as far as i can make out hasnt any name at all  miss montgomery is on her cards but that is only what she calls herself  who she really is  it would shake the foundations of european society if known  we sit and talk about the aristocracy we dont seem to know anybody else  i tried on one occasion a little sarcasm as a correctiverecounted conversations between myself and the prince of wales in which i invariably addressed him as teddy  it sounds tall i know but those people took it in  i was too astonished to undeceive them at the time the consequence is i am a sort of little god to them  they come round me and ask for more  what am i to do  i am helpless among them  ive never had anything to do before with the really firstprize idiot the usual type of course one knows but these if you havent met them are inconceivable  i try insulting them they dont even know i am insulting them  short of dragging them out of their chairs and kicking them round the room i dont see how to make them understand it  and mrs loveredge asked the sympathetic peter is she  between ourselves said joey sinking his voice to a needless whisper seeing he and peter were the sole occupants of the smokingroomi couldnt of course say it to a younger manbut between ourselves my wife is a charming woman  you dont know her  doesnt seem much chance of my ever doing so laughed peter  so graceful so dignified soso queenly continued the little man with rising enthusiasm  she has only one faultshe has no sense of humour  to peter as it has been said men of forty were mere boys  my dear fellow whatever could have induced you  i knowi know all that interrupted the mere boy  nature arranges it on purpose  tall and solemn prigs marry little women with turnedup noses  cheerful little fellows like myselfwe marry serious stately women  if it were otherwise the human race would be split up into species  of course if you were actuated by a sense of public duty  dont be a fool peter hope returned the little man  im in love with my wife just as she is and always shall be  i know the woman with a sense of humour and of the two i prefer the one without  the juno type is my ideal  i must take the rough with the smooth  one cant have a jolly chirpy juno and wouldnt care for her if one could  then are you going to give up all your old friends  dont suggest it pleaded the little man  you dont know how miserable it makes methe mere idea  tell them to be patient  the secret of dealing with women i have found is to do nothing rashly  the clock struck five  i must go now said joey  dont misjudge her peter and dont let the others  shes a dear girl  youll like her all of you when you know her  a dear girl  she only has that one fault  joey went out  peter did his best that evening to explain the true position of affairs without imputing snobbery to mrs loveredge  it was a difficult task and peter cannot be said to have accomplished it successfully  anger and indignation against joey gave place to pity  the members of the autolycus club also experienced a little irritation on their own account  what does the woman take us for demanded somerville the briefless doesnt she know that we lunch with real actors and actresses that once a year we are invited to dine at the mansion house  has she never heard of the aristocracy of genius demanded alexander the poet  the explanation may be that possibly she has seen it feared the wee laddie  one of us ought to waylay the woman argued the babeinsist upon her talking to him for ten minutes  ive half a mind to do it myself  jack herring said nothingseemed thoughtful  the next morning jack herring still thoughtful called at the editorial offices of good humour in crane court and borrowed miss ramsbothams debrett  three days later jack herring informed the club casually that he had dined the night before with mr and mrs loveredge  the club gave jack herring politely to understand that they regarded him as a liar and proceeded to demand particulars  if i wasnt there explained jack herring with unanswerable logic how can i tell you anything about it  this annoyed the club whose curiosity had been whetted  three members acting in the interests of the whole solemnly undertook to believe whatever he might tell them  but jack herrings feelings had been wounded  when gentlemen cast a doubt upon another gentlemans veracity  we didnt cast a doubt explained somerville the briefless  we merely said that we personally did not believe you  we didnt say we couldnt believe you it is a case for individual effort  if you give us particulars bearing the impress of reality supported by details that do not unduly contradict each other we are prepared to put aside our natural suspicions and face the possibility of your statement being correct  it was foolish of me said jack herring  i thought perhaps it would amuse you to hear what sort of a woman mrs loveredge was likesome description of mrs loveredges uncle  miss montgomery friend of mrs loveredge is certainly one of the most remarkable women i have ever met of course that isnt her real name  but as i have said it was foolish of me  these peopleyou will never meet them you will never see them of what interest can they be to you  they had forgotten to draw down the blinds and he climbed up a lamp post and looked through the window was the solution of the problem put forward by the wee laddie  im dining there again on saturday volunteered jack herring  if any of you will promise not to make a disturbance you can hang about on the park side underneath the shadow of the fence and watch me go in  my hansom will draw up at the door within a few minutes of eight  the babe and the poet agreed to undertake the test  you wont mind our hanging round a little while in case youre thrown out again asked the babe  not in the least so far as i am concerned replied jack herring dont leave it too late and make your mother anxious  its true enough the babe recounted afterwards  the door was opened by a manservant and he went straight in  we walked up and down for half an hour and unless they put him out the back way hes telling the truth  did you hear him give his name asked somerville who was stroking his moustache  no we were too far off explained the babe  butill swear it was jackthere couldnt be any mistake about that  perhaps not agreed somerville the briefless  somerville the briefless called at the offices of good humour in crane court the following morning and he also borrowed miss ramsbothams debrett  whats the meaning of it demanded the subeditor  meaning of what  this sudden interest of all you fellows in the british peerage  all of us  well herring was here last week poring over that book for half an hour with the morning post spread out before him  now youre doing the same thing  ah  jack herring was he  i thought as much  dont talk about it tommy  ill tell you later on  on the following monday the briefless one announced to the club that he had received an invitation to dine at the loveredges on the following wednesday  on tuesday the briefless one entered the club with a slow and stately step  halting opposite old goslin the porter who had emerged from his box with the idea of discussing the oxford and cambridge boat race somerville removing his hat with a sweep of the arm held it out in silence  old goslin much astonished took it mechanically whereupon the briefless one shaking himself free from his inverness cape flung it lightly after the hat and strolled on not noticing that old goslin unaccustomed to coats lightly and elegantly thrown at him dropping the hat had caught it on his head and had been in the language of the promptbook left struggling  the briefless one entering the smokingroom lifted a chair and let it fall again with a crash and sitting down upon it crossed his legs and rang the bell  yere doing it verra weel remarked approvingly the wee laddie  yere just fitted for it by nature  fitted for what demanded the briefless one waking up apparently from a dream  for an adelphi guest at eighteenpence the night assured him the wee laddie  yere just splendid at it  the briefless one muttering that the worst of mixing with journalists was that if you did not watch yourself you fell into their ways drank his whisky in silence  later the babe swore on a copy of sells advertising guide that crossing the park he had seen the briefless one leaning over the railings of rotten row clad in a pair of new kid gloves swinging a silverheaded cane  one morning towards the end of the week joseph loveredge looking twenty years younger than when peter had last seen him dropped in at the editorial office of good humour and demanded of peter hope how he felt and what he thought of the present price of emma mines  peter hopes fear was that the gambling fever was spreading to all classes of society  i want you to dine with us on sunday said joseph loveredge  jack herring will be there  you might bring tommy with you  peter hope gulped down his astonishment and said he should be delighted he thought that tommy also was disengaged  mrs loveredge out of town i presume questioned peter hope  on the contrary replied joseph loveredge i want you to meet her  joseph loveredge removed a pile of books from one chair and placed them carefully upon another after which he went and stood before the fire  dont if you dont like said joseph loveredge but if you dont mind you might call yourself just for the eveningsay the duke of warrington  say the what demanded peter hope  the duke of warrington repeated joey  we are rather short of dukes tommy can be the lady adelaide your daughter  dont be an ass said peter hope  im not an ass assured him joseph loveredge  he is wintering in egypt  you have run back for a week to attend to business  there is no lady adelaide so thats quite simple  but what in the name of began peter hope  dont you see what im driving at persisted joey  it was jacks idea at the beginning  i was frightened myself at first but it is working to perfection  she sees you and sees that you are a gentleman  when the truth comes outas of course it must later onthe laugh will be against her  you thinkyou think thatll comfort her suggested peter hope  its the only way and it is really wonderfully simple  we never mention the aristocracy nowit would be like talking shop  we just enjoy ourselves  you by the way i met in connection with the movement for rational dress  you are a bit of a crank fond of frequenting bohemian circles  i am risking something i know continued joey but its worth it  i couldnt have existed much longer  we go slowly and are very careful jack is lord mountprimrose who has taken up with antivaccination and who never goes out into society  somerville is sir francis baldwin the great authority on centipedes  the wee laddie is coming next week as lord garrick who married that dancinggirl prissy something and started a furniture shop in bond street  i had some difficulty at first she wanted to send out paragraphs but i explained that was only done by vulgar personsthat when the nobility came to you as friends it was considered bad taste  she is a dear girl as i have always told you with only one fault  a woman easier to deceive one could not wish for  i dont myself see why the truth ever need come outprovided we keep our heads  seems to me youve lost them already commented peter youre overdoing it  the more of us the better explained joey we help each other besides i particularly want you in it  theres a sort of superior pickwickian atmosphere surrounding you that disarms suspicion  you leave me out of it growled peter  see here laughed joey you come as the duke of warrington and bring tommy with you and ill write your city article  for how long snapped peter  incorruptible city editors are not easily picked up  oh well for as long as you like  on that understanding agreed peter im willing to make a fool of myself in your company  youll soon get used to it joey told him eight oclock then on sunday plain evening dress  if you like to wear a bit of red ribbon in your buttonhole why do so  you can get it at evans in covent garden  and tommy is the lady  adelaide  let her have a taste for literature then she neednt wear gloves  i know she hates them  joey turned to go  am i married asked peter  joey paused  i should avoid all reference to your matrimonial affairs if i were you was joeys advice  you didnt come out of that business too well  oh as bad as that was i  you dont think mrs loveredge will object to me  i have asked her that  shes a dear broadminded girl  ive promised not to leave you alone with miss montgomery and willis has had instructions not to let you mix your drinks  id have liked to have been someone a trifle more respectable grumbled peter  we rather wanted a duke explained joey and he was the only one that fitted in all round  the dinner a was a complete success  tommy entering into the spirit of the thing bought a new pair of openwork stockings and assumed a languid drawl  peter who was growing forgetful introduced her as the lady alexandra it did not seem to matter both beginning with an a  she greeted lord mountprimrose as billy and asked affectionately after his mother  joey told his raciest stories  the duke of warrington called everybody by their christian names and seemed well acquainted with bohemian societya more amiable nobleman it would have been impossible to discover  the lady whose real name was not miss montgomery sat in speechless admiration  the hostess was the personification of gracious devotion  other little dinners equally successful followed  joeys acquaintanceship appeared to be confined exclusively to the higher circles of the british aristocracywith one exception that of a german baron a short stout gentleman who talked english well but with an accent and who when he desired to be impressive laid his right forefinger on the right side of his nose and thrust his whole face forward  mrs loveredge wondered why her husband had not introduced them sooner but was too blissful to be suspicious  the autolycus club was gradually changing its tone  friends could no longer recognise one another by the voice  every corner had its solitary student practising highclass intonation  members dropped into the habit of addressing one another as dear chappie and discarding pipes took to cheap cigars many of the older habitues resigned  all might have gone well to the end of time if only mrs loveredge had left all social arrangements in the hands of her husbandhad not sought to aid his efforts  to a certain political gardenparty one day in the height of the season were invited joseph loveredge and mrs joseph loveredge his wife  mr joseph loveredge at the last moment found himself unable to attend  mrs joseph loveredge went alone met there various members of the british aristocracy  mrs joseph loveredge accustomed to friendship with the aristocracy felt at her ease and was natural and agreeable  the wife of an eminent peer talked to her and liked her  it occurred to mrs joseph loveredge that this lady might be induced to visit her house in regents park there to mingle with those of her own class  lord mountprimrose the duke of warrington and a few others will be dining with us on sunday next suggested mrs loveredge  will not you do us the honour of coming  we are of course only simple folk ourselves but somehow people seem to like us  the wife of the eminent peer looked at mrs loveredge looked round the grounds looked at mrs loveredge again and said she would like to come mrs joseph loveredge intended at first to tell her husband of her success but a little devil entering into her head and whispering to her that it would be amusing she resolved to keep it as a surprise to be sprung upon him at eight oclock on sunday  the surprise proved all she could have hoped for  the duke of warrington having journalistic matters to discuss with joseph loveredge arrived at halfpast seven wearing on his shirtfront a silver star purchased in eagle street the day before for eightand six  there accompanied him the lady alexandra wearing the identical ruby necklace that every night for the past six months and twice on saturdays john strongheart had been falsely accused of stealing  lord garrick having picked up his wife miss ramsbotham outside the mother redcap arrived with her on foot at a quarter to eight  lord mountprimrose together with sir francis baldwin dashed up in a hansom at sevenfifty  his lordship having lost the toss paid the fare  the hon harry sykes commonly called the babe was ushered in five minutes later  the noble company assembled in the drawingroom chatted blithely while waiting for dinner to be announced  the duke of warrington was telling an anecdote about a cat which nobody appeared to believe  lord mountprimrose desired to know whether by any chance it might be the same animal that every night at halfpast nine had been in the habit of climbing up his graces railings and knocking at his graces door  the honourable harry was saying that speaking of cats he once had a sort of terrierwhen the door was thrown open and willis announced the lady mary sutton  mr joseph loveredge who was sitting near the fire rose up  lord mount primrose who was standing near the piano sat down  the lady mary sutton paused in the doorway  mrs loveredge crossed the room to greet her  let me introduce you to my husband said mrs loveredge  joey my dear the lady mary sutton  i met the lady mary at the omeyers the other day and she was good enough to accept my invitation  i forgot to tell you  mr loveredge said he was delighted after which although as a rule a chatty man he seemed to have nothing else to say  and a silence fell  somerville the brieflesstill then  that evening has always been reckoned the startingpoint of his career  up till then nobody thought he had much in himwalked up and held out his hand  you dont remember me lady mary said the briefless one  i met you some years ago we had a most interesting conversationsir francis baldwin  the lady mary stood for a moment trying apparently to recollect  she was a handsome freshcomplexioned woman of about forty with frank agreeable eyes  the lady mary glanced at lord garrick who was talking rapidly to lord mountprimrose who was not listening and who could not have understood even if he had been lord garrick without being aware of it having dropped into broad scotch  from him the lady mary glanced at her hostess and from her hostess to her host  the lady mary took the hand held out to her  of course said the lady mary how stupid of me  it was the day of my own wedding too  you really must forgive me  we talked of quite a lot of things  i remember now  mrs loveredge who prided herself upon maintaining oldfashioned courtesies proceeded to introduce the lady mary to her fellowguests a little surprised that her ladyship appeared to know so few of them  her ladyships greeting of the duke of warrington was accompanied it was remarked by a somewhat curious smile  to the duke of warringtons daughter alone did the lady mary address remark  my dear said the lady mary how you have grown since last we met  the announcement of dinner as everybody felt came none too soon  it was not a merry feast  joey told but one story he told it three times and twice left out the point  lord mountprimrose took sifted sugar with pate de foie gras and ate it with a spoon  lord garrick talking a mixture of scotch and english urged his wife to give up housekeeping and take a flat in gower street which as he pointed out was central  she could have her meals sent in to her and so avoid all trouble  the lady alexandras behaviour appeared to mrs loveredge not altogether wellbred  an eccentric young noblewoman mrs loveredge had always found her but wished on this occasion that she had been a little less eccentric  every few minutes the lady alexandra buried her face in her serviette and shook and rocked emitting stifled sounds apparently those of acute physical pain  mrs loveredge hoped she was not feeling ill but the lady alexandra appeared incapable of coherent reply  twice during the meal the duke of warrington rose from the table and began wandering round the room on each occasion asked what he wanted had replied meekly that he was merely looking for his snuffbox and had sat down again  the only person who seemed to enjoy the dinner was the lady mary sutton  the ladies retired upstairs into the drawingroom  mrs loveredge breaking a long silence remarked it as unusual that no sound of merriment reached them from the diningroom  the explanation was that the entire male portion of the party on being left to themselves had immediately and in a body crept on tiptoe into joeys study which fortunately happened to be on the ground floor  joey unlocking the bookcase had taken out his debrett but appeared incapable of understanding it  sir francis baldwin had taken it from his unresisting hands the remaining aristocracy huddled themselves into a corner and waited in silence  i think ive got it all clearly announced sir francis baldwin after five minutes which to the others had been an hour  yes i dont think im making any mistake  shes the daughter of the duke of truro married in 53 the duke of warrington at st peters eaton square gave birth in 55 to a daughter the lady grace alexandra warberton sutton which makes the child just thirteen  in 63 divorced the duke of warrington lord mountprimrose so far as i can make out must be her second cousin i appear to have married her in 66 at hastings  it doesnt seem to me that we could have got together a homelier little party to meet her even if we had wanted to  nobody spoke nobody had anything particularly worth saying  the door opened and the lady alexandra otherwise tommy entered the room  isnt it time suggested the lady alexandra that some of you came upstairs  i was thinking myself explained joey the host with a grim smile it was about time that i went out and drowned myself  the canal is handy  put it off till tomorrow tommy advised him  i have asked her ladyship to give me a lift home and she has promised to do so  she is evidently a woman with a sense of humour  wait till after i have had a talk with her  six men whispering at the same time were prepared with advice but tommy was not taking advice  come upstairs all of you insisted tommy and make yourselves agreeable  shes going in a quarter of an hour  six silent men the host leading the two husbands bringing up the rear ascended the stairs each with the sensation of being twice his usual weight  six silent men entered the drawingroom and sat down on chairs six silent men tried to think of something interesting to say  miss ramsbothamit was that or hysterics as she afterwards explainedstifling a sob opened the piano  but the only thing she could remember was champagne charlie is my name a song then popular in the halls  five men when she had finished begged her to go on  miss ramsbotham speaking in a shrill falsetto explained it was the only tune she knew  four of them begged her to play it again  miss ramsbotham played it a second time with involuntary variations  the lady marys carriage was announced by the imperturbable willis  the party with the exception of the lady mary and the hostess suppressed with difficulty an inclination to burst into a cheer  the lady mary thanked mrs loveredge for a most interesting evening and beckoned tommy to accompany her  with her disappearance a wild hilarity uncanny in its suddenness took possession of the remaining guests  a few days later the lady marys carriage again drew up before the little house in regents park  mrs loveredge fortunately was at home the carriage remained waiting for quite a long time  mrs loveredge after it was gone locked herself in her own room  the underhousemaid reported to the kitchen that passing the door she had detected sounds indicative of strong emotion  through what ordeal joseph loveredge passed was never known  for a few weeks the autolycus club missed him  then gradually as aided by time they have a habit of doing things righted themselves  joseph loveredge received his old friends his friends received joseph loveredge  mrs loveredge as a hostess came to have only one failinga marked coldness of demeanour towards all people with titles whenever introduced to her     story the sixththe babe applies for shares   people said of the new journal good humourpeople of taste and judgment that it was the brightest the cleverest the most literary penny weekly that ever had been offered to the public  this made peter hope editor and partproprietor very happy  william clodd business manager and also partproprietor it left less elated  must be careful said william clodd that we dont make it too clever happy medium thats the ideal  people saidpeople of taste and judgment that good humour was more worthy of support than all the other penny weeklies put together  people of taste and judgment even went so far some of them as to buy it  peter hope looking forward saw fame and fortune coming to him  william clodd looking round about him said  doesnt it occur to you guvnor that were getting this thing just a trifle too high class  what makes you think that demanded peter hope  our circulation for one thing explained clodd  the returns for last month  id rather you didnt mention them if you dont mind interrupted peter hope somehow hearing the actual figures always depresses me  cant say i feel inspired by them myself admitted clodd  it will come said peter hope it will come in time  we must educate the public up to our level  if there is one thing so far as i have noticed said william clodd that the public are inclined to pay less for than another it is for being educated  what are we to do asked peter hope  what you want answered william clodd is an officeboy  how will our having an officeboy increase our circulation demanded peter hope  besides it was agreed that we could do without one for the first year  why suggest more expense  i dont mean an ordinary officeboy explained clodd  i mean the sort of boy that i rode with in the train going down to stratford yesterday  what was there remarkable about him  nothing  he was reading the current number of the penny novelist over two hundred thousand people buy it  he is one of them  he told me so  when he had done with it he drew from his pocket a copy of the halfpenny jokerthey guarantee a circulation of seventy thousand  he sat and chuckled over it until we got to bow  but  you wait a minute  im coming to the explanation  that boy represents the reading public  i talked to him  the papers he likes best are the papers that have the largest sales  he never made a single mistake  the othersthose of them he had seenhe dismissed as rot  what he likes is what the great mass of the journalbuying public likes  please himi took his name and address and he is willing to come to us for eight shillings a weekand you please the people that buy  not the people that glance through a paper when it is lying on the smokingroom table and tell you it is damned good but the people that plank down their penny  thats the sort we want  peter hope able editor with ideals was shockedindignant  william clodd business man without ideals talked figures  theres the advertiser to be thought of persisted clodd  i dont pretend to be a george washington but whats the use of telling lies that sound like lies even to ones self while ones telling them  give me a genuine sale of twenty thousand and ill undertake without committing myself to convey an impression of forty  but when the actual figures are under eight thousandwell it hampers you if you happen to have a conscience  give them every week a dozen columns of good sound literature continued clodd insinuatingly but wrap it up in twentyfour columns of jam  its the only way theyll take it and you will be doing them goodeducating them without their knowing it  all powder and no jam well they dont open their mouths thats all  clodd was a man who knew how to get his way  flippspelled philiptweetel arrived in due course of time at 23 crane court ostensibly to take up the position of good humours officeboy in reality and without his being aware of it to act as its literary taster  stories in which flipp became absorbed were accepted  peter groaned but contented himself with correcting only their grosser grammatical blunders the experiment should be tried in all good faith humour at which flipp laughed was printed  peter tried to ease his conscience by increasing his subscription to the fund for destitute compositors but only partially succeeded  poetry that brought a tear to the eye of flipp was given leaded type  people of taste and judgment said good humour had disappointed them  its circulation slowly but steadily increased  see cried the delighted clodd told you so  its sad to think began peter  always is interrupted clodd cheerfully  moraldont think too much  tell you what well do added clodd  well make a fortune out of this paper  then when we can afford to lose a little money well launch a paper that shall appeal only to the intellectual portion of the public meanwhile  a squat black bottle with a label attached standing on the desk arrested clodds attention  when did this come asked clodd  about an hour ago peter told him  any order with it  i think so  peter searched for and found a letter addressed to william clodd esq advertising manager good humour  clodd tore it open hastily devoured it  not closed up yet are you  no not till eight oclock  good  i want you to write me a par  do it now then you wont forget it  for the walnuts and wine column  peter sat down headed a sheet of paper for w and w col  what is it questioned petersomething to drink  its a sort of port explained clodd that doesnt get into your head  you consider that an advantage queried peter  of course  you can drink more of it  peter continued to write possesses all the qualities of an old vintage port without those deleterious properties  i havent tasted it clodd hinted peter  thats all righti have  and was it good  splendid stuff  say its delicious and invigorating  theyll be sure to quote that  peter wrote on personally i have found it delicious and peter left off writing  i really think clodd i ought to taste it  you see i am personally recommending it  finish that par  let me have it to take round to the printers  then put the bottle in your pocket  take it home and make a night of it  clodd appeared to be in a mighty hurry  now this made peter only the more suspicious  the bottle was close to his hand  clodd tried to intercept him but was not quick enough  youre not used to temperance drinks urged clodd  your palate is not accustomed to them  i can tell whether its delicious or not surely pleaded peter who had pulled out the cork  its a quarterpage advertisement for thirteen weeks  put it down and dont be a fool urged clodd  im going to put it down laughed peter who was fond of his joke peter poured out half a tumblerful and dranksome of it  like it demanded clodd with a savage grin  you are sureyou are sure it was the right bottle gasped peter  bottles all right clodd assured him  try some more  judge it fairly  peter ventured on another sip  you dont think they would be satisfied if i recommended it as a medicine insinuated petersomething to have about the house in case of accidental poisoning  better go round and suggest the idea to them yourself  ive done with it  clodd took up his hat  im sorryim very sorry sighed peter  but i couldnt conscientiously  clodd put down his hat again with a bang  oh confound that conscience of yours  dont it ever think of your creditors  whats the use of my working out my lungs for you when all you do is to hamper me at every step  wouldnt it be better policy urged peter to go for the better class of advertiser who doesnt ask you for this sort of thing  go for him snorted clodd  do you think i dont go for him  they are just sheep  get one you get the lot  until youve got the one the others wont listen to you  thats true mused peter  i spoke to wilkinson of kingsleys myself  he advised me to try and get landors  he thought that if i could get an advertisement out of landor he might persuade his people to give us theirs  and if you had gone to landor he would have promised you theirs provided you got kingsleys  they will come thought hopeful peter  we are going up steadily  they will come with a rush  they had better come soon thought clodd  the only things coming with a rush just now are bills  those articles of young mctears attracted a good deal of attention expounded peter  he has promised to write me another series  jowett is the one to get hold of mused clodd  jowett all the others follow like a flock of geese waddling after the old gander  if only we could get hold of jowett the rest would be easy  jowett was the proprietor of the famous marble soap  jowett spent on advertising every year a quarter of a million it was said  jowett was the stay and prop of periodical literature  new papers that secured the marble soap advertisement lived and prospered the new paper to which it was denied languished and died  jowett and how to get hold of him jowett and how to get round him formed the chief topic of discussion at the councilboard of most new papers good humour amongst the number  i have heard said miss ramsbotham who wrote the letter to clorinda that filled each week the last two pages of good humour and that told clorinda who lived secluded in the country the daily history of the highest class society among whom miss ramsbotham appeared to live and have her being who they were and what they wore the wise and otherwise things they didi have heard said miss ramsbotham one morning jowett being as usual the subject under debate that the old man is susceptible to female influence  what i have always thought said clodd  a lady advertisingagent might do well  at all events they couldnt kick her out  they might in the end thought peter  female doorporters would become a profession for muscular ladies if ever the idea took root  the first one would get a good start anyhow thought clodd  the subeditor had pricked up her ears  once upon a time long ago the subeditor had succeeded when all other london journalists had failed in securing an interview with a certain great statesman  the subeditor had never forgotten thisnor allowed anyone else to forget it  i believe i could get it for you said the subeditor  the editor and the businessmanager both spoke together  they spoke with decision and with emphasis  why not said the subeditor  when nobody else could get at him it was i who interviewed prince  weve heard all about that interrupted the businessmanager  if i had been your father at the time you would never have done it  how could i have stopped her retorted peter hope  she never said a word to me  you could have kept an eye on her  kept an eye on her  when youve got a girl of your own youll know more about them  when i have asserted clodd ill manage her  we know all about bachelors children sneered peter hope the editor  you leave it to me  ill have it for you before the end of the week crowed the subeditor  if you do get it returned clodd i shall throw it out thats all  you said yourself a lady advertisingagent would be a good idea the subeditor reminded him  so she might be returned clodd but she isnt going to be you  why not  because she isnt thats why  but if  see you at the printers at twelve said clodd to peter and went out suddenly  well i think hes an idiot said the subeditor  i do not often said the editor but on this point i agree with him cadging for advertisements isnt a womans work  but what is the difference between  all the difference in the world thought the editor  you dont know what i was going to say returned his sub  i know the drift of it asserted the editor  but you let me  i know i doa good deal too much  im going to turn over a new leaf  all i propose to do  whatever it is youre not going to do it declared the chief  shall be back at halfpast twelve if anybody comes  it seems to me  but peter was gone  just like them all wailed the subeditor  they cant argue when you explain things to them they go out  it does make me so mad  miss ramsbotham laughed  you are a downtrodden little girl tommy  as if i couldnt take care of myself  tommys chin was high up in the air  cheer up suggested miss ramsbotham  nobody ever tells me not to do anything  i would change with you if i could  id have walked into that office and have had that advertisement out of old jowett in five minutes i know i would bragged tommy  i can always get on with old men  only with the old ones queried miss ramsbotham  the door opened  anybody in asked the face of johnny bulstrode appearing in the jar  cant you see they are snapped tommy  figure of speech explained johnny bulstrode commonly called the babe entering and closing the door behind him  what do you want demanded the subeditor  nothing in particular replied the babe  wrong time of the day to come for it halfpast eleven in the morning explained the subeditor  whats the matter with you asked the babe  feeling very cross confessed the subeditor  the childlike face of the babe expressed sympathetic inquiry  we are very indignant explained miss ramsbotham because we are not allowed to rush off to cannon street and coax an advertisement out of old jowett the soap man  we feel sure that if we only put on our best hat he couldnt possibly refuse us  no coaxing required thought the subeditor  once get in to see the old fellow and put the actual figures before him he would clamour to come in  wont he see clodd asked the babe  wont see anybody on behalf of anything new just at present apparently answered miss ramsbotham  it was my fault  i was foolish enough to repeat that i had heard he was susceptible to female charm they say it was mrs sarkitt that got the advertisement for the lamp out of him  but of course it may not be true  wish i was a soap man and had got advertisements to give away sighed the babe  wish you were agreed the subeditor  you should have them all tommy  my name corrected him the subeditor is miss hope  i beg your pardon said the babe  i dont know how it is but one gets into the way of calling you tommy  i will thank you said the subeditor to get out of it  i am sorry said the babe  dont let it occur again said the subeditor  the babe stood first on one leg and then on the other but nothing seemed to come of it  well said the babe i just looked in thats all nothing i can do for you  nothing thanked him the subeditor  good morning said the babe  good morning said the subeditor  the childlike face of the babe wore a chastened expression as it slowly descended the stairs  most of the members of the autolycus club looked in about once a day to see if they could do anything for tommy  some of them had luck  only the day before porsona heavy most uninteresting manhad been sent down all the way to plaistow to inquire after the wounded hand of a machineboy  young alexander whose poetry some people could not even understand had been commissioned to search london for a secondhand edition of maitlands architecture  since a fortnight nearly now when he had been sent out to drive away an organ that would not go johnny had been given nothing  johnny turned the corner into fleet street feeling bitter with his lot  a boy carrying a parcel stumbled against him  beg yer pardon the small boy looked up into johnnys face miss added the small boy dodging the blow and disappearing into the crowd  the babe by reason of his childlike face was accustomed to insults of this character but today it especially irritated him  why at twenty two could he not grow even a moustache  why was he only five feet five and a half  why had fate cursed him with a pinkandwhite complexion so that the members of his own club had nicknamed him the babe while streetboys as they passed pleaded with him for a kiss  why was his very voice a flutelike alto more suitablesuddenly an idea sprang to life within his brain  the idea grew  passing a barbers shop johnny went in  air cut sir remarked the barber fitting a sheet round johnnys neck  no shave corrected johnny  beg pardon said the barber substituting a towel for the sheet  do you shave up sir later demanded the barber  yes answered johnny  pleasant weather we are having said the barber  very assented johnny  from the barbers johnny went to stinchcombes the costumiers in drury lane  i am playing in a burlesque explained the babe  i want you to rig me out completely as a modern girl  peeth o luck said the shopman  goth the very bundle for you  juth come in  i shall want everything explained the babe from the boots to the hat stays petticoatsthe whole bag of tricks  regular troutheau there said the shopman emptying out the canvas bag upon the counter  thry em on  the babe contented himself with trying on the costume and the boots  juth made for you said the shopman  a little loose about the chest suggested the babe  thaths all right said the shopman  couple o thmall towelths all thaths wanted  you dont think it too showy queried the babe  thowy  sthylish thaths all  you are sure everythings here  everythinkth there  thept the bit o meat inthide assured him the shopman  the babe left a deposit and gave his name and address  the shopman promised the things should be sent round within an hour  the babe who had entered into the spirit of the thing bought a pair of gloves and a small reticule and made his way to bow street  i want a womans light brown wig said the babe to mr cox the perruquier  mr cox tried on two  the deceptive appearance of the second mr cox pronounced as perfect  looks more natural on you than your own hair blessed if it doesnt said mr cox  the wig also was promised within the hour  the spirit of completeness descended upon the babe  on his way back to his lodgings in great queen street he purchased a ladylike umbrella and a veil  now a quarter of an hour after johnny bulstrode had made his exit by the door of mr stinchcombes shop one harry bennett actor and member of the autolycus club pushed it open and entered  the shop was empty harry bennett hammered with his stick and waited  a piledup bundle of clothes lay upon the counter a sheet of paper with a name and address scrawled across it rested on the bundle  harry bennett given to idle curiosity approached and read the same  harry bennett with his stick poked the bundle scattering its items over the counter  donth do thath said the shopman coming up  juth been putting em together  what the devil said harry bennett is johnny bulstrode going to do with that rigout  how thoud i know answered the shopman  private theathricals i suppoth  friend o yourth  yes replied harry bennett  by jove he ought to make a good girl should like to see it  well arthk him for a ticket  donth make em dirty suggested the shopman  i must said harry bennett and talked about his own affairs  the rigout and the wig did not arrive at johnnys lodgings within the hour as promised but arrived there within three hours which was as much as johnny had expected  it took johnny nearly an hour to dress but at last he stood before the plateglass panel of the wardrobe transformed johnny had reason to be pleased with the result  a tall handsome girl looked back at him out of the glassa little showily dressed perhaps but decidedly chic  wonder if i ought to have a cloak mused johnny as a ray of sunshine streaming through the window fell upon the image in the glass  well anyhow i havent thought johnny as the sunlight died away again so its no good thinking about it  johnny seized his reticule and his umbrella and opened cautiously the door  outside all was silent  johnny stealthily descended in the passage paused again  voices sounded from the basement  feeling like an escaped burglar johnny slipped the latch of the big door and peeped out a policeman pasting turned and looked at him  johnny hastily drew back and closed the door again  somebody was ascending from the kitchen johnny caught between two terrors nearer to the front door than to the stairs having no time chose the street  it seemed to johnny that the street was making for him  a woman came hurriedly towards him  what was she going to say to him  what should he answer her  to his surprise she passed him hardly noticing him  wondering what miracle had saved him he took a few steps forward  a couple of young clerks coming up from behind turned to look at him but on encountering his answering stare of angry alarm appeared confused and went their way  it began to dawn upon him that mankind was less discerning than he had feared  gaining courage as he proceeded he reached holborn  here the larger crowd swept around him indifferent  i beg your pardon said johnny coming into collision with a stout gentleman  my fault replied the stout gentleman as smiling he picked up his damaged hat  i beg your pardon repeated johnny again two minutes later colliding with a tall young lady  should advise you to take something for that squint of yours remarked the tall young lady with severity  whats the matter with me thought johnny  seems to be a sort of mist  the explanation flashed across him  of course said johnny to himself its this confounded veil  johnny decided to walk to the marble soap offices  ill be more used to the hang of things by the time i get there if i walk thought johnny hope the old beggars in  in newgate street johnny paused and pressed his hands against his chest funny sort of pain ive got thought johnny  wonder if i should shock them if i went in somewhere for a drop of brandy  it dont get any better reflected johnny with some alarm on reaching the corner of cheapside  hope im not going to be ill  whatever  the explanation came to him  of course its these damned stays  no wonder girls are shorttempered at times  at the offices of the marble soap johnny was treated with marked courtesy  mr jowett was out was not expected back till five oclock would the lady wait or would she call again  the lady decided now she was there to wait  would the lady take the easychair  would the lady have the window open or would she have it shut  had the lady seen the times  or the hapenny joker suggested a junior clerk who thereupon was promptly sent back to his work  many of the senior clerks had occasion to pass through the waitingroom two of the senior clerks held views about the weather which they appeared wishful to express at length  johnny began to enjoy himself  this thing was going to be good fun  by the time the slamming of doors and the hurrying of feet announced the advent of the chief johnny was looking forward to his interview  it was briefer and less satisfactory than he had anticipated  mr jowett was very busydid not as a rule see anybody in the afternoon but of course a ladywould miss  montgomery  would miss montgomery inform mr jowett what it was he might have the pleasure of doing for her  miss montgomery explained  mr jowett seemed half angry half amused  really said mr jowett this is hardly playing the game  against our fellowmen we can protect ourselves but if the ladies are going to attack usreally it isnt fair  miss montgomery pleaded  ill think it over was all that mr jowett could be made to promise look me up again  when asked miss montgomery  whats todaythursday  say monday  mr jowett rang the bell  take my advice said the old gentleman laying a fatherly hand on johnnys shoulder leave business to us men  you are a handsome girl  you can do better for yourself than this  a clerk entered johnny rose  on monday next then johnny reminded him  at four oclock agreed mr jowett  good afternoon  johnny went out feeling disappointed and yet as he told himself he hadnt done so badly  anyhow there was nothing for it but to wait till monday  now he would go home change his clothes and get some dinner he hailed a hansom  number twentyeightno  stop at the queens street corner of lincolns inn fields johnny directed the man  quite right miss commented the cabman pleasantly  corners bestsaves all talk  what do you mean demanded johnny  no offence miss answered the man  we was all young once  johnny climbed in  at the corner of queen street and lincolns inn fields johnny got out  johnny who had been pondering other matters put his hand instinctively to where speaking generally his pocket should have been then recollected himself  let me see did i think to bring any money out with me or did i not mused johnny as he stood upon the kerb  look in the ridicule miss suggested the cabman  johnny looked  it was empty  perhaps i put it in my pocket thought johnny  the cabman hitched his reins to the whipsocket and leant back  its somewhere about here i know i saw it johnny told himself sorry to keep you waiting johnny added aloud to the cabman  dont you worry about that miss replied the cabman civilly we are used to it  a shilling a quarter of an hour is what we charge  of all the damned silly tricks muttered johnny to himself  two small boys and a girl carrying a baby paused interested  go away told them the cabman  youll have troubles of your own one day  the urchins moved a few steps further then halted again and were joined by a slatternly woman and another boy  got it cried johnny unable to suppress his delight as his hand slipped through a fold  the lady with the baby without precisely knowing why set up a shrill cheer  johnnys delight died away it wasnt the pockethole  short of taking the skirt off and turning it inside out it didnt seem to johnny that he ever would find that pocket  then in that moment of despair he came across it accidentally  it was as empty as the reticule  i am sorry said johnny to the cabman but i appear to have come out without my purse  the cabman said he had heard that tale before and was making preparations to descend  the crowd now numbering eleven looked hopeful  it occurred to johnny later that he might have offered his umbrella to the cabman at least it would have fetched the eighteenpence one thinks of these things afterwards  the only idea that occurred to him at the moment was that of getting home  ere old my orse a minute one of yer shouted the cabman  half a dozen willing hands seized the dozing steed and roused it into madness  hi stop er roared the cabman  shes down shouted the excited crowd  tripped over er skirt explained the slatternly woman  they do amper you  no shes not  shes up again vociferated a delighted plumber with a sounding slap on his own leg  gor blimy if she aint a good un  fortunately the square was tolerably clear and johnny a good runner holding now his skirt and petticoat high in his left hand johnny moved across the square at the rate of fifteen miles an hour  a butchers boy sprang in front of him with arms held out to stop him  the thing that for the next three months annoyed that butcher boy most was hearing shouted out after him yah who was knocked down and run over by a lidy by the time johnny reached the strand via clements inn the hue and cry was far behind  johnny dropped his skirts and assumed a more girlish pace  through bow street and long acre he reached great queen street in safety  upon his own doorstep he began to laugh  his afternoons experience had been amusing still on the whole he wasnt sorry it was over  one can have too much even of the best of jokes  johnny rang the bell  the door opened  johnny would have walked in had not a big rawboned woman barred his progress  what do you want demanded the rawboned woman  want to come in explained johnny  what do you want to come in for  this appeared to johnny a foolish question  on reflection he saw the sense of it  this rawboned woman was not mrs pegg his landlady  some friend of hers he supposed  its all right said johnny i live here  left my latchkey at home thats all  theres no females lodging here declared the rawboned lady  and whats more theres going to be none  all this was very vexing  johnny in his joy at reaching his own doorstep had not foreseen these complications  now it would be necessary to explain things  he only hoped the story would not get round to the fellows at the club  ask mrs pegg to step up for a minute requested johnny  not at ome explained the rawboned lady  notnot at home  gone to romford if you wish to know to see her mother  gone to romford  i said romford didnt i retorted the rawboned lady tartly  whatwhat time do you expect her in  sunday evening six oclock replied the rawboned lady  johnny looked at the rawboned lady imagined himself telling the raw boned lady the simple unvarnished truth and the rawboned ladys utter disbelief of every word of it  an inspiration came to his aid  i am mr bulstrodes sister said johnny meekly hes expecting me  thought you said you lived here reminded him the rawboned lady  i meant that he lived here replied poor johnny still more meekly  he has the second floor you know  i know replied the rawboned lady  not in just at present  not in  went out at three oclock  ill go up to his room and wait for him said johnny  no you wont said the rawboned lady  for an instant it occurred to johnny to make a dash for it but the raw boned lady looked both formidable and determined  there would be a big disturbanceperhaps the police called in  johnny had often wanted to see his name in print in connection with this affair he somehow felt he didnt  do let me in johnny pleaded i have nowhere else to go  you have a walk and cool yourself suggested the rawboned lady  dont expect he will be long  but you see  the rawboned lady slammed the door  outside a restaurant in wellington street from which proceeded savoury odours johnny paused and tried to think  what the devil did i do with that umbrella  i had itno i didnt must have dropped it i suppose when that silly ass tried to stop me  by jove i am having luck  outside another restaurant in the strand johnny paused again  how am i to live till sunday night  where am i to sleep  if i telegraph homedamn it how can i telegraph  i havent got a penny  this is funny said johnny unconsciously speaking aloud upon my word this is funny  oh you go to  johnny hurled this last at the head of an overgrown errandboy whose intention had been to offer sympathy  well i never commented a passing flowergirl  calls erself a lidy i suppose  nowadays observed the stud and button merchant at the corner of exeter street they make em out of anything  drawn by a notion that was forming in his mind johnny turned his steps up bedford street  why not mused johnny  nobody else seems to have a suspicion  why should they  ill never hear the last of it if they find me out  but why should they find me out  well somethings got to be done  johnny walked on quickly  at the door of the autolycus club he was undecided for a moment then took his courage in both hands and plunged through the swing doors  is mr herringmr jack herringhere  find him in the smokingroom mr bulstrode answered old goslin who was reading the evening paper  oh would you mind asking him to step out a moment  old goslin looked up took off his spectacles rubbed them put them on again  please say miss bulstrodemr bulstrodes sister  old goslin found jack herring the centre of an earnest argument on hamletwas he really mad  a lady to see you mr herring announced old goslin  a what  miss bulstrodemr bulstrodes sister  shes waiting in the hall  never knew he had a sister said jack herring rising  wait a minute said harry bennett  shut that door  dont go  this to old goslin who closed the door and returned  lady in a heliotrope dress with a lace collar three flounces on the skirt  thats right mr bennett agreed old goslin  its the babe himself asserted harry bennett  the question of hamlets madness was forgotten  was in at stinchcombes this morning explained harry bennett saw the clothes on the counter addressed to him  thats the identical frock this is just a try onthinks hes going to have a lark with us  the autolycus club looked round at itself  i can see verra promising possibilities in this provided the thing is properly managed said the wee laddie after a pause  so can i agreed jack herring  keep where you are all of you twould be a pity to fool it  the autolycus club waited  jack herring reentered the room  one of the saddest stories i have ever heard in all my life explained jack herring in a whisper  poor girl left derbyshire this morning to come and see her brother found him outhasnt been seen at his lodgings since three oclock fears something may have happened to him  landlady gone to romford to see her mother strange woman in charge wont let her in to wait for him  how sad it is when trouble overtakes the innocent and helpless murmured somerville the briefless  thats not the worst of it continued jack  the dear girl has been robbed of everything she possesses even of her umbrella and hasnt got a sou hasnt had any dinner and doesnt know where to sleep  sounds a bit elaborate thought porson  i think i can understand it said the briefless one  what has happened is this  hes dressed up thinking to have a bit of fun with us and has come out forgetting to put any money or his latchkey in his pocket  his landlady may have gone to romford or may not  in any case he would have to knock at the door and enter into explanations  what does he suggestthe loan of a sovereign  the loan of two replied jack herring  to buy himself a suit of clothes  dont you do it jack  providence has imposed this upon us  our duty is to show him the folly of indulging in senseless escapades  i think we might give him a dinner thought the stout and sympathetic porson  what i propose to do grinned jack is to take him round to mrs postwhistles  shes under a sort of obligation to me  it was i who got her the post office  well leave him there for a night with instructions to mrs p to keep a motherly eye on him  tomorrow he shall have his bit of fun and i guess hell be the first to get tired of the joke  it looked a promising plot  seven members of the autolycus club gallantly undertook to accompany miss bulstrode to her lodgings  jack herring excited jealousy by securing the privilege of carrying her reticule  miss bulstrode was given to understand that anything any of the seven could do for her each and every would be delighted to do if only for the sake of her brother one of the dearest boys that ever breatheda bit of an ass though that of course he could not help miss bulstrode was not as grateful as perhaps she should have been  her idea still was that if one of them would lend her a couple of sovereigns the rest need not worry themselves further  this purely in her own interests they declined to do  she had suffered one extensive robbery that day already as jack reminded her  london was a city of danger to the young and inexperienced  far better that they should watch over her and provide for her simple wants  painful as it was to refuse a lady a beloved companions sisters welfare was yet dearer to them  miss bulstrodes only desire was not to waste their time  jack herrings opinion was that there existed no true englishman who would grudge time spent upon succouring a beautiful maiden in distress  arrived at the little grocers shop in rolls court jack herring drew mrs postwhistle aside  shes the sister of a very dear friend of ours explained jack herring  a finelooking girl commented mrs postwhistle  i shall be round again in the morning  dont let her out of your sight and above all dont lend her any money directed jack herring  i understand replied mrs postwhistle  miss bulstrode having despatched an excellent supper of cold mutton and bottled beer leant back in her chair and crossed her legs  i have often wondered remarked miss bulstrode her eyes fixed upon the ceiling what a cigarette would taste like  taste nasty i should say the first time thought mrs postwhistle who was knitting  some girls so i have heard remarked miss bulstrode smoke cigarettes  not nice girls thought mrs postwhistle  one of the nicest girls i ever knew remarked miss bulstrode always smoked a cigarette after supper  said it soothed her nerves  wouldnt ave thought so if id ad charge of er said mrs postwhistle  i think said miss bulstrode who seemed restless i think i shall go for a little walk before turning in  perhaps it would do us good agreed mrs postwhistle laying down her knitting  dont you trouble to come urged the thoughtful miss bulstrode  you look tired  not at all replied mrs postwhistle  feel i should like it  in some respects mrs postwhistle proved an admirable companion  she asked no questions and only spoke when spoken to which during that walk was not often  at the end of half an hour miss bulstrode pleaded a headache and thought she would return home and go to bed  mrs postwhistle thought it a reasonable idea  well its better than tramping the streets muttered johnny as the bedroom door was closed behind him and thats all one can say for it must get hold of a smoke tomorrow if i have to rob the till  whats that  johnny stole across on tiptoe  confound it said johnny if she hasnt locked the door  johnny sat down upon the bed and took stock of his position  it doesnt seem to me thought johnny that im ever going to get out of this mess  johnny still muttering unfastened his stays  thank god thats off ejaculated johnny piously as he watched his form slowly expanding  suppose ill be used to them before ive finished with them  johnny had a night of dreams  for the whole of next day which was friday johnny remained miss bulstrode hoping against hope to find an opportunity to escape from his predicament without confession  the entire autolycus club appeared to have fallen in love with him  thought i was a bit of a fool myself mused johnny where a petticoat was concerned  dont believe these blithering idiots have ever seen a girl before  they came in ones they came in little parties and tendered him devotion  even mrs postwhistle accustomed to regard human phenomena without comment remarked upon it  when you are all tired of it said mrs postwhistle to jack herring let me know  the moment we find her brother explained jack herring of course we shall take her to him  nothing like looking in the right place for a thing when youve finished looking in the others observed mrs postwhistle  what do you mean demanded jack  just what i say answered mrs postwhistle  jack herring looked at mrs postwhistle  but mrs postwhistles face was not of the expressive order  post office still going strong asked jack herring  the post office as been a great elp to me admitted mrs postwhistle and im not forgetting that i owe it to you  dont mention it murmured jack herring  they brought her presentsnothing very expensive more as tokens of regard dainty packets of sweets nosegays of simple flowers bottles of scent  to somerville miss bulstrode hinted that if he really did desire to please her and wasnt merely talking through his hatmiss bulstrode apologised for the slang which she feared she must have picked up from her brotherhe might give her a box of messanis cigarettes size no 2  the suggestion pained him  somerville the briefless was perhaps oldfashioned  miss bulstrode cut him short by agreeing that he was and seemed disinclined for further conversation  they took her to madame tussauds  they took her up the monument  they took her to the tower of london  in the evening they took her to the polytechnic to see peppers ghost  they made a merry party wherever they went  seem to be enjoying themselves remarked other sightseers surprised and envious  girl seems to be a bit out of it remarked others more observant  sulkylooking bit o goods i call her remarked some of the ladies  the fortitude with which miss bulstrode bore the mysterious disappearance of her brother excited admiration  hadnt we better telegraph to your people in derbyshire suggested jack herring  dont do it vehemently protested the thoughtful miss bulstrode it might alarm them  the best plan is for you to lend me a couple of sovereigns and let me return home quietly  you might be robbed again feared jack herring  ill go down with you  perhaps hell turn up tomorrow thought miss bulstrode  expect hes gone on a visit  he ought not to have done it thought jack herring knowing you were coming  oh hes like that explained miss bulstrode  if i had a young and beautiful sister said jack herring  oh lets talk of something else suggested miss bulstrode  you make me tired  with jack herring in particular johnny was beginning to lose patience that miss bulstrodes charms had evidently struck jack herring all of a heap as the saying is had in the beginning amused master johnny indeedas in the seclusion of his bedchamber over the little grocers shop he told himself with bitter selfreproachhe had undoubtedly encouraged the man  from admiration jack had rapidly passed to infatuation from infatuation to apparent imbecility  had johnnys mind been less intent upon his own troubles he might have been suspicious  as it was and after all that had happened nothing now could astonish johnny  thank heaven murmured johnny as he blew out the light this mrs postwhistle appears to be a reliable woman  now about the same time that johnnys head was falling thus upon his pillow the autolycus club sat discussing plans for their next days entertainment  i think said jack herring the crystal palace in the morning when its nice and quiet  to be followed by greenwich hospital in the afternoon suggested somerville  winding up with the moore and burgess minstrels in the evening thought porson  hardly the place for the young person feared jack herring  some of the jokes  mr brandram gives a reading of julius caesar at st georges hall the wee laddie informed them for their guidance  hallo said alexander the poet entering at the moment  what are you all talking about  we were discussing where to take miss bulstrode tomorrow evening informed him jack herring  miss bulstrode repeated the poet in a tone of some surprise  do you mean johnny bulstrodes sister  thats the lady answered jack  but how do you come to know about her  thought you were in yorkshire  came up yesterday explained the poet  travelled up with her  travelled up with her  from matlock bath  whats the matter with you all demanded the poet you all of you look  sit down said the briefless one to the poet  lets talk this matter over quietly  alexander the poet mystified sat down  you say you travelled up to london yesterday with miss bulstrode  you are sure it was miss bulstrode  sure retorted the poet  why ive known her ever since she was a baby  about what time did you reach london  threethirty  and what became of her  where did she say she was going  i never asked her  the last i saw of her she was getting into a cab  i had an appointment myself and wasi say whats the matter with herring  herring had risen and was walking about with his head between his hands  never mind him  miss bulstrode is a lady of abouthow old  eighteenno nineteen last birthday  a tall handsome sort of girl  yes  i say has anything happened to her  nothing has happened to her assured him somerville  shes all right  been having rather a good time on the whole  the poet was relieved to hear it  i asked her an hour ago said jack herring who was still holding his head between his hands as if to make sure it was there if she thought she could ever learn to love me  would you say that could be construed into an offer of marriage  the remainder of the club was unanimously of opinion that practically speaking it was a proposal  i dont see it argued jack herring  it was merely in the nature of a remark  the club was of opinion that such quibbling was unworthy of a gentleman  it appeared to be a case for prompt action  jack herring sat down and then and there began a letter to miss bulstrode care of mrs postwhistle  but what i dont understand said alexander the poet  oh take him away somewhere and tell him someone moaned jack herring how can i think with all this chatter going on  but why did bennett whispered porson  where is bennett demanded half a dozen fierce voices  harry bennett had not been seen all day  jacks letter was delivered to miss bulstrode the next morning at breakfasttime  having perused it miss bulstrode rose and requested of mrs postwhistle the loan of half a crown  mr herrings particular instructions were explained mrs postwhistle that above all things i was not to lend you any money  when you have read that replied miss bulstrode handing her the letter perhaps you will agree with me that herring isan ass  mrs postwhistle read the letter and produced the halfcrown  better get a shave with part of it suggested mrs postwhistle  that is if you are going to play the fool much longer  miss bulstrode opened his eyes  mrs postwhistle went on with her breakfast  dont tell them said johnny not just for a little while at all events  nothing to do with me replied mrs postwhistle  twenty minutes later the real miss bulstrode on a visit to her aunt in kensington was surprised at receiving enclosed in an envelope the following hastily scrawled note     want to speak to you at oncealone  dont yell when you see me    its all right  can explain in two ticksyour loving brother    johnny  it took longer than two ticks but at last the babe came to an end of it  when you have done laughing said the babe  but you look so ridiculous said his sister  they didnt think so retorted the babe  i took them in all right guess youve never had as much attention all in one day  are you sure you took them in queried his sister  if you will come to the club at eight oclock this evening said the babe ill prove it to you  perhaps ill take you on to a theatre afterwardsif youre good  the babe himself walked into the autolycus club a few minutes before eight and encountered an atmosphere of restraint  thought you were lost remarked somerville coldly  called away suddenlyvery important business explained the babe awfully much obliged to all you fellows for all you have been doing for my sister  shes just been telling me  dont mention it said two or three  awfully good of you im sure persisted the babe  dont know what she would have done without you  a mere nothing the club assured him  the blushing modesty of the autolycus club at hearing of their own good deeds was touching  left to themselves they would have talked of quite other things  as a matter of fact they tried to  never heard her speak so enthusiastically of anyone as she does of you jack said the babe turning to jack herring  of course you know dear boy explained jack herring anything i could do for a sister of yours  i know dear boy replied the babe i always felt it  say no more about it urged jack herring  she couldnt quite make out that letter of yours this morning continued the babe ignoring jacks request  shes afraid you think her ungrateful  it seemed to me on reflection explained jack herring that on one or two little matters she may have misunderstood me  as i wrote her there are days when i dont seem altogether to quite know what im doing  rather awkward thought the babe  it is agreed jack herring  yesterday was one of them  she tells me you were most kind to her the babe reassured him  she thought at first it was a little uncivil your refusing to lend her any money  but as i put it to her  it was silly of me interrupted jack  i see that now  i went round this morning meaning to make it all right  but she was gone and mrs postwhistle seemed to think i had better leave things as they were  i blame myself exceedingly  my dear boy dont blame yourself for anything  you acted nobly the babe told him  shes coming here to call for me this evening on purpose to thank you  id rather not said jack herring  nonsense said the babe  you must excuse me insisted jack herring  i dont mean it rudely but really id rather not see her  but here she is said the babe taking at that moment the card from old goslins hand  she will think it so strange  id really rather not repeated poor jack  it seems discourteous suggested somerville  you go suggested jack  she doesnt want to see me explained somerville  yes she does corrected him the babe  id forgotten she wants to see you both  if i go said jack i shall tell her the plain truth  do you know said somerville im thinking that will be the shortest way  miss bulstrode was seated in the hall  jack herring and somerville both thought her present quieter style of dress suited her much better  here he is announced the babe in triumph  heres jack herring and heres somerville  do you know i could hardly persuade them to come out and see you  dear old jack he always was so shy  miss bulstrode rose  she said she could never thank them sufficiently for all their goodness to her  miss bulstrode seemed quite overcome  her voice trembled with emotion  before we go further miss bulstrode said jack herring it will be best to tell you that all along we thought you were your brother dressed up as a girl  oh said the babe so thats the explanation is it  if i had only known  then the babe stopped and wished he hadnt spoken  somerville seized him by the shoulders and with a sudden jerk stood him beside his sister under the gasjet  you little brute said somerville  it was you all along  and the babe seeing the game was up and glad that the joke had not been entirely on one side confessed  jack herring and somerville the briefless went that night with johnny and his sister to the theatreand on other nights  miss bulstrode thought jack herring very nice and told her brother so  but she thought somerville the briefless even nicer and later under crossexamination when somerville was no longer briefless told somerville so himself  but that has nothing to do with this particular story the end of which is that miss bulstrode kept the appointment made for monday afternoon between miss montgomery and mr jowett and secured thereby the marble soap advertisement for the back page of good humour for six months at twentyfive pounds a week     story the seventhdick danvers presents his petition   william clodd mopping his brow laid down the screwdriver and stepping back regarded the result of his labours with evident satisfaction  it looks like a bookcase said william clodd  you might sit in the room for half an hour and never know it wasnt a bookcase  what william clodd had accomplished was this he had had prepared after his own design what appeared to be four shelves laden with works suggestive of thought and erudition  as a matter of fact it was not a bookcase but merely a flat board the books merely the backs of volumes that had long since found their way into the papermill  this artful deception william clodd had screwed upon a cottage piano standing in the corner of the editorial office of good humour  half a dozen real volumes piled upon the top of the piano completed the illusion  as william clodd had proudly remarked a casual visitor might easily have been deceived  if you had to sit in the room while she was practising mixed scales youd be quickly undeceived said the editor of good humour one peter hope  he spoke bitterly  you are not always in explained clodd  there must be hours when she is here alone with nothing else to do  besides you will get used to it after a while  you i notice dont try to get used to it snarled peter hope  you always go out the moment she commences  a friend of mine continued william clodd worked in an office over a pianoshop for seven years and when the shop closed it nearly ruined his business couldnt settle down to work for want of it  why doesnt he come here asked peter hope  the floor above is vacant  cant explained william clodd  hes dead  i can quite believe it commented peter hope  it was a shop where people came and practised paying sixpence an hour and he had got to like itsaid it made a cheerful background to his thoughts  wonderful what you can get accustomed to  whats the good of it demanded peter hope  whats the good of it retorted william clodd indignantly  every girl ought to know how to play the piano  a nice thing if when her lover asks her to play something to him  i wonder you dont start a matrimonial agency sneered peter hope love and marriageyou think of nothing else  when you are bringing up a young girl argued clodd  but youre not interrupted peter thats just what im trying to get out of your head  it is i who am bringing her up  and between ourselves i wish you wouldnt interfere so much  you are not fit to bring up a girl  ive brought her up for seven years without your help  shes my adopted daughter not yours  i do wish people would learn to mind their own business  youve done very well  thank you said peter hope sarcastically  its very kind of you perhaps when youve time youll write me out a testimonial  up till now concluded the imperturbable clodd  a girl of eighteen wants to know something else besides mathematics and the classics  you dont understand them  i do understand them asserted peter hope  what do you know about them  youre not a father  youve done your best admitted william clodd in a tone of patronage that irritated peter greatly but youre a dreamer you dont know the world  the time is coming when the girl will have to think of a husband  theres no need for her to think of a husband not for years retorted peter hope  and even when she does is strumming on the piano going to help her  i tinki tink said dr smith who had hitherto remained a silent listener our young frent clodd is right  you haf never quite got over your idea dat she was going to be a boy  you haf taught her de tings a boy should know  you cut her hair added clodd  i dont snapped peter  you let her have it cutits the same thing  at eighteen she knows more about the ancient greeks and romans than she does about her own frocks  de young girl argued the doctor what is she  de flower dat makes bright for us de garden of life de gurgling brook dat murmurs by de dusty highway de cheerful fire  she cant be all of them snapped peter who was a stickler for style do keep to one simile at a time  now you listen to plain sense said william clodd  you wantwe all wantthe girl to be a success all round  i want her  peter hope was rummaging among the litter on the desk  it certainly was not there  peter pulled out a drawertwo drawers  i wish said peter hope i wish sometimes she wasnt quite so clever  the old doctor rummaged among dusty files of papers in a corner  clodd found it on the mantelpiece concealed beneath the hollow foot of a big brass candlestick and handed it to peter  peter had one vicethe taking in increasing quantities of snuff which was harmful for him as he himself admitted  tommy sympathetic to most masculine frailties was severe however upon this one  you spill it upon your shirt and on your coat had argued tommy  i like to see you always neat  besides it isnt a nice habit  i do wish dad youd give it up  i must peter had agreed  ill break myself of it  but not all at onceit would be a wrench by degrees tommy by degrees  so a compromise had been compounded  tommy was to hide the snuffbox  it was to be somewhere in the room and to be accessible but that was all peter when selfcontrol had reached the breakingpoint might try and find it  occasionally luck helping peter he would find it early in the day when he would earn his own bitter selfreproaches by indulging in quite an orgie  but more often tommys artfulness was such that he would be compelled by want of time to abandon the search  tommy always knew when he had failed by the air of indignant resignation with which he would greet her on her return  then perhaps towards evening peter looking up would see the box open before his nose above it a pair of reproving black eyes their severity counterbalanced by a pair of full red lips trying not to smile  and peter knowing that only one pinch would be permitted would dip deeply  i want her said peter hope feeling with his snuffbox in his hand more confidence in his own judgment to be a sensible clever woman capable of earning her own living and of being independent not a mere helpless doll crying for some man to come and take care of her  a womans business asserted clodd is to be taken care of  some women perhaps admitted peter but tommy you know very well is not going to be the ordinary type of woman  she has brains she will make her way in the world  it doesnt depend upon brains said clodd  she hasnt got the elbows  the elbows  they are not sharp enough  the last bus home on a wet night tells you whether a woman is capable of pushing her own way in the world  tommys the sort to get left on the kerb  shes the sort retorted peter to make a name for herself and to be able to afford a cab  dont you bully me  peter sniffed selfassertiveness from between his thumb and finger  yes i shall clodd told him on this particular point  the poor girls got no mother  fortunately for the general harmony the door opened at the moment to admit the subject of discussion  got that daisy blossom advertisement out of old blatchley announced tommy waving triumphantly a piece of paper over her head  no exclaimed peter  how did you manage it  asked him for it was tommys explanation  very odd mused peter asked the old idiot for it myself only last week  he refused it pointblank  clodd snorted reproof  you know i dont like your doing that sort of thing  it isnt proper for a young girl  its all right assured him tommy hes bald  that makes no difference was clodds opinion  yes it does was tommys  i like them bald  tommy took peters head between her hands and kissed it and in doing so noticed the telltale specks of snuff  just a pinch my dear explained peter the merest pinch  tommy took up the snuffbox from the desk  ill show you where im going to put it this time  she put it in her pocket  peters face fell  what do you think of it said clodd  he led her to the corner  good idea aint it  why wheres the piano demanded tommy  clodd turned in delighted triumph to the others  humbug growled peter  it isnt humbug cried clodd indignantly  she thought it was a bookcaseanybody would  youll be able to sit there and practise by the hour explained clodd to tommy  when you hear anybody coming up the stairs you can leave off  how can she hear anything when she  a bright idea occurred to peter dont you think clodd as a practical man suggested peter insinuatingly adopting the socratic method that if we got her one of those dummy pianosyou know what i mean its just like an ordinary piano only you dont hear it  clodd shook his head  no good at all  cant tell the effect she is producing  quite so  then on the other hand clodd dont you think that hearing the effect they are producing may sometimes discourage the beginner  clodds opinion was that such discouragement was a thing to be battled with  tommy who had seated herself commenced a scale in contrary motion  well im going across to the printers now explained clodd taking up his hat  got an appointment with young grindley at three  you stick to it  a spare halfhour now and then that you never miss does wonders youve got it in you  with these encouraging remarks to tommy clodd disappeared  easy for him muttered peter bitterly  always does have an appointment outside the moment she begins  tommy appeared to be throwing her very soul into the performance  passers by in crane court paused regarded the firstfloor windows of the publishing and editorial offices of good humour with troubled looks then hurried on  she hasremarkably firm douch shouted the doctor into peters ear will see youevening  sometingsay to you  the fat little doctor took his hat and departed  tommy ceasing suddenly came over and seated herself on the arm of peters chair  feeling grumpy asked tommy  it isnt explained peter that i mind the noise  id put up with that if i could see the good of it  its going to help me to get a husband dad  seems to me an odd way of doing it but billy says so and billy knows all about everything  i cant understand you a sensible girl listening to such nonsense said peter  its that that troubles me  dad where are your wits demanded tommy  isnt billy acting like a brick  why he could go into fleet street to half a dozen other papers and make five hundred a year as advertisingagentyou know he could  but he doesnt  he sticks to us  if my making myself ridiculous with that tin pot they persuaded him was a piano is going to please him isnt it common sense and sound business to say nothing of good nature and gratitude for me to do it  dad ive got a surprise for him  listen and tommy springing from the arm of peters chair returned to the piano  what was it questioned tommy having finished  could you recognise it  i think said peter it sounded likeit wasnt home sweet home was it  tommy clapped her hands  yes it was  youll end by liking it yourself dad  well have musical at homes  tommy have i brought you up properly do you think  no dad you havent  you have let me have my own way too much  you know the proverb good mothers make bad daughters  clodds right youve spoilt me dad  do you remember dad when i first came to you seven years ago a ragged little brat out of the streets that didnt know itself whether twas a boy or a girl  do you know what i thought to myself the moment i set eyes on you  heres a soft old juggins ill be all right if i can get in here  it makes you smart knocking about in the gutters and being knocked about you read faces quickly  do you remember your cooking tommy  you had an aptitude for it according to your own idea  tommy laughed  i wonder how you stood it  you were so obstinate  you came to me as cook and housekeeper and as cook and housekeeper and as nothing else would you remain  if i suggested any change up would go your chin into the air  i dared not even dine out too often you were such a little tyrant  the only thing you were always ready to do if i wasnt satisfied was to march out of the house and leave me  wherever did you get that savage independence of yours  i dont know  i think it must have been from a womanperhaps she was my mother i dont knowwho used to sit up in the bed and cough all night it seemed to me  people would come to see usladies in fine clothes and gentlemen with oily hair  i think they wanted to help us many of them had kind voices  but always a hard look would come into her face and she would tell them what even then i knew to be untrueit was one of the first things i can recollectthat we had everything we wanted that we needed no help from anyone  they would go away shrugging their shoulders  i grew up with the feeling that seemed to have been burnt into my brain that to take from anybody anything you had not earned was shameful  i dont think i could do it even now not even from you  i am useful to you dadi do help you  there had crept a terror into tommys voice  peter felt the little hands upon his arm trembling  help me  why you work like a niggerlike a nigger is supposed to work but doesnt  no onewhatever we paid himwould do half as much i dont want to make your head more swollen than it is young woman but you have talent i am not sure it is not genius  peter felt the little hands tighten upon his arm  i do want this paper to be a success that is why i strum upon the piano to please clodd  is it humbug  i am afraid it is but humbug is the sweet oil that helps this whirling world of ours to spin round smoothly  too much of it cloys we drop it very gently  but you are sure it is only humbug tommy  it was peters voice into which fear had entered now  it is not that you think he understands you better than i dowould do more for you  you want me to tell you all i think of you and that isnt good for you dadnot too often  it would be you who would have swelled head then  i am jealous tommy jealous of everyone that comes near you  life is a tragedy for us old folks  we know there must come a day when you will leave the nest leave us voiceless ridiculous flitting among bare branches  you will understand later when you have children of your own this foolish talk about a husband  it is worse for a man than it is for the woman  the mother lives again in her child the man is robbed of all  dad do you know how old i amthat you are talking terrible nonsense  he will come little girl  yes answered tommy i suppose he will but not for a long whileoh not for a very long while  dont  it frightens me  you  why should it frighten you  the pain  it makes me feel a coward  i want it to come i want to taste life to drain the whole cup to understand to feel  but that is the boy in me  i am more than half a boy i always have been  but the woman in me it shrinks from the ordeal  you talk tommy as if love were something terrible  there are all things in it i feel it dad  it is life in a single draught  it frightens me  the child was standing with her face hidden behind her hands  old peter always very bad at lying stood silent not knowing what consolation to concoct  the shadow passed and tommys laughing eyes looked out again  havent you anything to do dadoutside i mean  you want to get rid of me  well ive nothing else to occupy me till the proofs come in  im going to practise hard  i think ill turn over my article on the embankment said peter  theres one thing you all of you ought to be grateful to me for laughed tommy as she seated herself at the piano  i do induce you all to take more fresh air than otherwise you would  tommy left alone set herself to her task with the energy and thoroughness that were characteristic of her  struggling with complicated scales tommy bent her eyes closer and closer over the pages of czernys exercises  glancing up to turn a page tommy to her surprise met the eyes of a stranger  they were brown eyes their expression sympathetic  below them looking golden with the sunlight falling on it was a moustache and beard cut short in vandyke fashion not altogether hiding a pleasant mouth about the corners of which lurked a smile  i beg your pardon said the stranger  i knocked three times  perhaps you did not hear me  no i didnt confessed tommy closing the book of czernys exercises and rising with chin at an angle that to anyone acquainted with the chart of tommys temperament might have suggested the advisability of seeking shelter  this is the editorial office of good humour is it not inquired the stranger  it is  is the editor in  the editor is out  the subeditor suggested the stranger  i am the subeditor  the stranger raised his eyebrows  tommy on the contrary lowered hers  would you mind glancing through that  the stranger drew from his pocket a folded manuscript  it will not take you a moment  i ought of course to have sent it through the post but i am so tired of sending things through the post  the strangers manner was compounded of dignified impudence combined with pathetic humility  his eyes both challenged and pleaded  tommy held out her hand for the paper and retired with it behind the protection of the big editorial desk that flanked on one side by a screen and on the other by a formidable revolving bookcase stretched fortresslike across the narrow room  the stranger remained standing  yes  its pretty criticised the subeditor  worth printing perhaps not worth paying for  not merely aa nominal sum sufficient to distinguish it from the work of the amateur  tommy pursed her lips  poetry is quite a drug in the market  we can get as much as we want of it for nothing  say half a crown suggested the stranger  tommy shot a swift glance across the desk and for the first time saw the whole of him  he was clad in a threadbare long brown ulsterlong that is it would have been upon an ordinary man but the stranger happening to be remarkably tall it appeared on him ridiculously short reaching only to his knees  round his neck and tucked into his waistcoat thus completely hiding the shirt and collar he may have been wearing or may not was carefully arranged a blue silk muffler  his hands which were bare looked blue and cold  yet the black frockcoat and waistcoat and french grey trousers bore the unmistakable cut of a firstclass tailor and fitted him to perfection  his hat which he had rested on the desk shone resplendent and the handle of his silk umbrella was an eagles head in gold with two small rubies for the eyes  you can leave it if you like consented tommy  ill speak to the editor about it when he returns  you wont forget it urged the stranger  no answered tommy  i shall not forget it  her black eyes were fixed upon the stranger without her being aware of it  she had dropped unconsciously into her stocktaking attitude  thank you very much said the stranger  i will call again tomorrow  the stranger moving backward to the door went out  tommy sat with her face between her hands  czernys exercises lay neglected  anybody called asked peter hope  no answered tommy  oh just a man  left thisnot bad  the old story mused peter as he unfolded the manuscript  we all of us begin with poetry  then we take to prose romances poetry doesnt pay  finally we write articles how to be happy though married what shall we do with our daughters  it is life summarised  what is it all about  oh the usual sort of thing explained tommy  he wants half a crown for it  poor devil  let him have it  thats not business growled tommy  nobody will ever know said peter  well enter it as telegrams  the stranger called early the next day pocketed his halfcrown and left another manuscriptan essay  also he left behind him his goldhandled umbrella taking away with him instead an old alpaca thing clodd kept in reserve for exceptionally dirty weather  peter pronounced the essay usable  he has a style said peter he writes with distinction  make an appointment for me with him  clodd on missing his umbrella was indignant  whats the good of this thing to me commented clodd  sort of thing for a dude in a pantomime  the fellow must be a blithering ass  tommy gave to the stranger messages from both when next he called  he appeared more grieved than surprised concerning the umbrellas  you dont think mr clodd would like to keep this umbrella in exchange for his own he suggested  hardly his style explained tommy  its very peculiar said the stranger with a smile  i have been trying to get rid of this umbrella for the last three weeks  once upon a time when i preferred to keep my own umbrella people used to take it by mistake leaving all kinds of shabby things behind them in exchange  now when id really like to get quit of it nobody will have it  why do you want to get rid of it asked tommy  it looks a very good umbrella  you dont know how it hampers me said the stranger  i have to live up to it  it requires a certain amount of resolution to enter a cheap restaurant accompanied by that umbrella  when i do the waiters draw my attention to the most expensive dishes and recommend me special brands of their socalled champagne  they seem quite surprised if i only want a chop and a glass of beer  i havent always got the courage to disappoint them  it is really becoming quite a curse to me  if i use it to stop a bus three or four hansoms dash up and quarrel over me  i cant do anything i want to do  i want to live simply and inexpensively it will not let me  tommy laughed  cant you lose it  the stranger laughed also  lose it  you have no idea how honest people are  i hadnt myself  the whole world has gone up in my estimation within the last few weeks  people run after me for quite long distances and force it into my handpeople on rainy days who havent got umbrellas of their own  it is the same with this hat  the stranger sighed as he took it up  i am always trying to get off with something reasonably shabby in exchange for it  i am always found out and stopped  why dont you pawn them suggested the practicable tommy  the stranger regarded her with admiration  do you know i never thought of that said the stranger  of course what a good idea  thank you so much  the stranger departed evidently much relieved  silly fellow mused tommy  they wont give him a quarter of the value and he will say thank you so much and be quite contented  it worried tommy a good deal that day the thought of that strangers helplessness  the strangers name was richard danvers  he lived the other side of holborn in featherstone buildings but much of his time came to be spent in the offices of good humour  peter liked him  full of promise was peters opinion  his criticism of that article of mine on the education of woman showed both sense and feeling  a scholar and a thinker  flipp the officeboy spelt philip liked him and flipps attitude in general was censorial  hes all right pronounced flipp nothing stuckup about him  hes got plenty of sense lying hidden away  miss ramsbotham liked him  the menthe men we think about at all explained miss ramsbothammay be divided into two classes the men we ought to like but dont and the men there is no particular reason for our liking but that we do  personally i could get very fond of your friend dick  there is nothing whatever attractive about him except himself  even tommy liked him in her way though at times she was severe with him  if you mean a big street grumbled tommy who was going over proofs why not say a big street  why must you always call it a main artery  i am sorry apologised danvers  it is not my own idea  you told me to study the higherclass journals  i didnt tell you to select and follow all their faults  here it is again  your crowd is always a hydraheaded monster your tea the cup that cheers but not inebriates  i am afraid i am a deal of trouble to you suggested the staff  i am afraid you are agreed the subeditor  dont give me up pleaded the staff  i misunderstood you that is all  i will write english for the future  shall be glad if you will growled the subeditor  dick danvers rose  i am so anxious not to get what you call the sack from here  the subeditor mollified thought the staff need be under no apprehension provided it showed itself teachable  i have been rather a worthless fellow miss hope confessed dick danvers  i was beginning to despair of myself till i came across you and your father  the atmosphere herei dont mean the material atmosphere of crane courtis so invigorating its simplicity its sincerity  i used to have ideals  i tried to stifle them  there is a set that sneers at all that sort of thing  now i see that they are good you will help me  every woman is a mother  tommy felt for the moment that she wanted to take this big boy on her knee and talk to him for his good  he was only an overgrown lad  but so exceedingly overgrown  tommy had to content herself with holding out her hand  dick danvers grasped it tightly  clodd was the only one who did not approve of him  how did you get hold of him asked clodd one afternoon he and peter alone in the office  he came  he came in the usual way explained peter  what do you know about him  nothing  what is there to know  one doesnt ask for a character with a journalist  no i suppose that wouldnt work  found out anything about him since  nothing against him  why so suspicious of everybody  because you are just a woolly lamb and want a dog to look after you  who is he  on a first night he gives away his stall and sneaks into the pit when you send him to a picturegallery he dodges the private view and goes on the first shilling day  if an invitation comes to a public dinner he asks me to go and eat it for him and tell him what its all about  that doesnt suggest the frank and honest journalist does it  it is unusual it certainly is unusual peter was bound to admit  i distrust the man said clodd  hes not our class  what is he doing here  i will ask him clodd i will ask him straight out  and believe whatever he tells you  no i shant  then whats the good of asking him  well what am i to do demanded the bewildered peter  get rid of him suggested clodd  get rid of him  get him away  dont have him in and out of the office all day longlooking at her with those colliedog eyes of his arguing art and poetry with her in that cushatdove voice of his  get him clean awayif it isnt too late already  nonsense said peter who had turned white however  shes not that sort of girl  not that sort of girl  clodd had no patience with peter hope and told him so  why are there never inkstains on her fingers now  there used to be  why does she always keep a lemon in her drawer  when did she last have her hair cut  ill tell you if you care to knowthe week before he came five months ago  she used to have it cut once a fortnight said it tickled her neck  why does she jump on people when they call her tommy and tell them that her name is jane  it never used to be jane  maybe when youre a bit older youll begin to notice things for yourself  clodd jammed his hat on his head and flung himself down the stairs  peter slipping out a minute later bought himself an ounce of snuff  fiddlededee said peter as he helped himself to his thirteenth pinch dont believe it  ill sound her  i shant say a wordill just sound her  peter stood with his back to the fire  tommy sat at her desk correcting proofs of a fanciful story the man without a past  i shall miss him said peter i know i shall  miss whom demanded tommy  danvers sighed peter  it always happens so  you get friendly with a man then he goes awayabroad back to america lord knows where  you never see him again  tommy looked up  there was trouble in her face  how do you spell harassed questioned tommy two rs or one  one r peter informed her two ss  i thought so  the trouble passed from tommys face  you dont ask when hes going you dont ask where hes going complained peter  you dont seem to be interested in the least  i was going to ask so soon as i had finished correcting this sheet explained tommy  what reason does he give  peter had crossed over and was standing where he could see her face illumined by the lamplight  it doesnt upset youthe thought of his going away of your never seeing him again  why should it  tommy answered his searching gaze with a slightly puzzled look  of course im sorry  he was becoming useful  but we couldnt expect him to stop with us always could we  peter rubbing his hands broke into a chuckle  i told him twas all fiddlesticks  clodd he would have it you were growing to care for the fellow  for dick danvers tommy laughed  whatever put that into his head  oh well there were one or two little things that we had noticed  we  i mean that clodd had noticed  im glad it was clodd that noticed them not you dad thought tommy to herself  theyd have been pretty obvious if you had noticed them  it naturally made me anxious confessed peter  you see we know absolutely nothing of the fellow  absolutely nothing agreed tommy  he may be a man of the highest integrity  personally i think he is  i like him  on the other hand he may be a thoroughpaced scoundrel  i dont believe for a moment that he is but he may be  impossible to say  quite impossible agreed tommy  considered merely as a journalist it doesnt matter  he writes well he has brains  theres an end of it  he is very painstaking agreed tommy  personally added peter i like the fellow  tommy had returned to her work  of what use was peter in a crisis of this kind  peter couldnt scold peter couldnt bully  the only person to talk to tommy as tommy knew she needed to be talked to was one jane a young woman of dignity with sense of the proprieties  i do hope that at least you are feeling ashamed of yourself remarked jane to tommy that same night as the twain sat together in their little bedroom  done nothing to be ashamed of growled tommy  making a fool of yourself openly for everybody to notice  clodd aint everybody  hes got eyes at the back of his head  sees things before they happen  wheres your womans pride falling in love with a man who has never spoken to you except in terms of the most ordinary courtesy  im not in love with him  a man about whom you know absolutely nothing  not in love with him  where does he come from  who is he  i dont know dont care nothing to do with me  just because of his soft eyes and his wheedling voice and that half caressing halfdevotional manner of his  do you imagine he keeps it specially for you  i gave you credit for more sense  im not in love with him i tell you  hes down on his luck and im sorry for him thats all  and if he is whose fault was it do you think  it doesnt matter  we are none of us saints  hes trying to pull himself together and i respect him for it  its our duty to be charitable and kind to one another in this world  oh well ill tell you how you can be kind to him by pointing out to him that he is wasting his time  with his talents now that he knows his business he could be on the staff of some big paper earning a good income  put it nicely to him but be firm  insist on his going  that will be showing true kindness to himand to yourself too im thinking my dear  and tommy understood and appreciated the sound good sense underlying janes advice and the very next day but one seizing the first opportunity acted upon it and all would have gone as contemplated if only dick danvers had sat still and listened as it had been arranged in tommys programme that he should  but i dont want to go said dick  but you ought to want to go  staying here with us you are doing yourself no good  he rose and came to where she stood with one foot upon the fender looking down into the fire  his doing this disconcerted her  so long as he remained seated at the other end of the room she was the subeditor counselling the staff for its own good  now that she could not raise her eyes without encountering his she felt painfully conscious of being nothing more important than a little woman who was trembling  it is doing me all the good in the world he told her being near to you  oh please do sit down again she urged him  i can talk to you so much better when youre sitting down  but he would not do anything he should have done that day  instead he took her hands in his and would not let them go and the reason and the will went out of her leaving her helpless  let me be with you always he pleaded  it means the difference between light and darkness to me  you have done so much for me  will you not finish your work  will you not trust me  it is no hot passion that can pass away my love for you  it springs from all that is best in mefrom the part of me that is wholesome and joyous and strong the part of me that belongs to you  releasing her he turned away  the other part of methe blackguardit is dead deardead and buried  i did not know i was a blackguard i thought myself a fine fellow till one day it came home to me  suddenly i saw myself as i really was  and the sight of the thing frightened me and i ran away from it  i said to myself i would begin life afresh in a new country free of every tie that could bind me to the past  it would mean povertyprivation maybe in the beginning  what of that  the struggle would brace me  it would be good sport  ah well you can guess the result the awakening to the cold facts the reaction of feeling  in what way was i worse than other men  who was i to play the prig in a world where others were laughing and dining  i had tramped your city till my boots were worn into holes  i had but to abandon my quixotic idealsreturn to where shame lay waiting for me to be welcomed with the fatted calf  it would have ended so had i not chanced to pass by your door that afternoon and hear you strumming on the piano  so billy was right after all thought tommy to herself the piano does help  it was so incongruousa piano in crane courti looked to see where the noise came from  i read the name of the paper on the doorpost  it will be my last chance i said to myself  this shall decide it  he came back to her  she had not moved  i am not afraid to tell you all this  you are so bighearted so human you will understand you can forgive  it is all past  loving you tells a man that he has done with evil  will you not trust me  she put her hands in his  i am trusting you she said with all my life  dont make a muddle of it dear if you can help it  it was an odd wooing as tommy laughingly told herself when she came to think it over in her room that night  but that is how it shaped itself  what troubled her most was that he had not been quite frank with peter so that peter had to defend her against herself  i attacked you so suddenly explained peter you had not time to think  you acted from instinct  a woman seeks to hide her love even from herself  i expect after all i am more of a girl than a boy feared tommy i seem to have so many womanish failings  peter took himself into quite places and trained himself to face the fact that another would be more to her than he had ever been and clodd went about his work like a bear with a sore head but they neither of them need have troubled themselves so much  the marriage did not take place till nearly fifteen years had passed away and much water had to flow beneath old london bridge before that day  the past is not easily got rid of  a tale was once written of a woman who killed her babe and buried it in a lonely wood and later stole back in the night and saw there white in the moonlight a childs hand calling through the earth and buried it again and yet again but always that white baby hand called upwards through the earth trample it down as she would  tommy read the story one evening in an old miscellany and sat long before the dead fire the book open on her lap and shivered for now she knew the fear that had been haunting her  tommy lived expecting her  she came one night when tommy was alone working late in the office  tommy knew her the moment she entered the door a handsome woman with snakelike rustling skirts  she closed the door behind her and drawing forward a chair seated herself the other side of the desk and the two looked long and anxiously at one another  they told me i should find you here alone said the woman  it is better is it not  yes said tommy it is better  tell me said the woman are you very much in love with him  why should i tell you  because if notif you have merely accepted him thinking him a good catchwhich he isnt my dear hasnt a penny to bless himself with and never will if he marries youwhy then the matter is soon settled  they tell me you are a businesslike young lady and i am prepared to make a businesslike proposition  there was no answer  the woman shrugged her shoulders  if on the other hand you are that absurd creature a young girl in lovewhy then i suppose we shall have to fight for him  it would be more sporting would it not suggested tommy  let me explain before you decide continued the woman  dick danvers left me six months ago and has kept from me ever since because he loved me  it sounds a curious reason  i was a married woman when dick danvers and i first met  since he left mefor my sake and his owni have received information of my husbands death  and does dickdoes he know asked the girl  not yet  i have only lately learnt the news myself  then if it is as you say when he knows he will go back to you  there are difficulties in the way  what difficulties  my dear this  to try and forget me he has been making love to you men do these things  i merely ask you to convince yourself of the truth go away for six monthsdisappear entirely  leave him freeuninfluenced if he loves youif it be not merely a sense of honour that binds himyou will find him here on your return  if notif in the interval i have succeeded in running off with him well is not the two or three thousand pounds i am prepared to put into this paper of yours a fair price for such a lover  tommy rose with a laugh of genuine amusement  she could never altogether put aside her sense of humour let fate come with what terrifying face it would  you may have him for nothingif he is that man the girl told her he shall be free to choose between us  you mean you will release him from his engagement  that is what i mean  why not take my offer  you know the money is needed  it will save your father years of anxiety and struggle  go awaytravel for a couple of months if youre afraid of the six  write him that you must be alone to think things over  the girl turned upon her  and leave you a free field to lie and trick  the woman too had risen  do you think he really cares for you  at the moment you interest him  at nineteen every woman is a mystery  when the mood is pastand do you know how long a mans mood lasts you poor chit  till he has caught what he is running after and has tasted itthen he will think not of what he has won but of what he has lost of the society from which he has cut himself adrift of all the old pleasures and pursuits he can no longer enjoy of the luxuriesnecessities to a man of his stampthat marriage with you has deprived him of  then your face will be a perpetual reminder to him of what he has paid for it and he will curse it every time he sees it  you dont know him the girl cried  you know just a part of himthe part you would know  all the rest of him is a good man that would rather his selfrespect than all the luxuries you mentionyou included  it seems to resolve itself into what manner of man he is laughed the woman  the girl looked at her watch  he will be here shortly he shall tell us himself  how do you mean  that here between the two of us he shall decidethis very night  she showed her white face to the woman  do you think i could live through a second day like to this  the scene would be ridiculous  there will be none here to enjoy the humour of it  he will not understand  oh yes he will the girl laughed  come you have all the advantages you are rich you are clever you belong to his class  if he elects to stop with me it will be because he is my manmine  are you afraid  the woman shivered  she wrapped her fur cloak about her closer and sat down again and tommy returned to her proofs  it was pressnight and there was much to be done  he came a little later though how long the time may have seemed to the two women one cannot say  they heard his footstep on the stair  the woman rose and went forward so that when he opened the door she was the first he saw  but he made no sign  possibly he had been schooling himself for this moment knowing that sooner or later it must come  the woman held out her hand to him with a smile  i have not the honour he said  the smile died from her face  i do not understand she said  i have not the honour he repeated  i do not know you  the girl was leaning with her back against the desk in a somewhat mannish attitude  he stood between them  it will always remain lifes chief comic success the man between two women  the situation has amused the world for so many years  yet somehow he contrived to maintain a certain dignity  maybe he continued you are confounding me with a dick danvers who lived in new york up to a few months ago  i knew him wella worthless scamp you had done better never to have met  you bear a wonderful resemblance to him laughed the woman  the poor fool is dead he answered  and he left for you my dear lady this dying message that from the bottom of his soul he was sorry for the wrong he had done you  he asked you to forgive himand forget him  the year appears to be opening unfortunately for me said the woman first my lover then my husband  he had nerved himself to fight the living  this was a blow from the dead  the man had been his friend  dead  he was killed it appears in that last expedition in july answered the woman  i received the news from the foreign office only a fortnight ago  an ugly look came into his eyesthe look of a cornered creature fighting for its life  why have you followed me here  why do i find you here alone with her  what have you told her  the woman shrugged her shoulders  only the truth  all the truth he demandedall  ah be just  tell her it was not all my fault  tell her all the truth  what would you have me tell her  that i played potiphars wife to your joseph  ah no  the truthonly the truth  that you and i were a pair of idle fools with the devil dancing round us  that we played a fools game and that it is over  is it over  dick is it over  she flung her arms towards him but he threw her from him almost brutally  the man is dead i tell you  his folly and his sin lie dead with him  i have nothing to do with you nor you with me  dick she whispered  dick cannot you understand  i must speak with you alone  but they did not understand neither the man nor the child  dick are you really dead she cried  have you no pity for me  do you think that i have followed you here to grovel at your feet for mere whim  am i acting like a woman sane and sound  dont you see that i am mad and why i am mad  must i tell you before her  dick  she staggered towards him and the fine cloak slipped from her shoulders and then it was that tommy changed from a child into a woman and raised the other woman from the ground with crooning words of encouragement such as mothers use and led her to the inner room  do not go she said turning to dick i shall be back in a few minutes  he crossed to one of the windows against which beat the citys roar and it seemed to him as the throb of passing footsteps beating down through the darkness to where he lay in his grave  she reentered closing the door softly behind her  it is true she asked  it can be  i had not thought of it  they spoke in low matteroffact tones as people do who have grown weary of their own emotions  when did he go awayher husband  aboutit is february now is it not  about eighteen months ago  and died just eight months ago  rather conveniently poor fellow  yes im glad he is deadpoor lawrence  what is the shortest time in which a marriage can be arranged  i do not know he answered listlessly  i do not intend to marry her  you would leave her to bear it alone  it is not as if she were a poor woman  you can do anything with money  it will not mend reputation  her position in society is everything to that class of woman  my marrying her now he pointed out would not save her  practically speaking it would the girl pleaded  the world does not go out of its way to find out things it does not want to know  marry her as quietly as possible and travel for a year or two  why should i  ah it is easy enough to call a man a coward for defending himself against a woman  what is he to do when he is fighting for his life  men do not sin with good women  there is the child to be considered she urgedyour child  you see dear we all do wrong sometimes  we must not let others suffer for our fault moremore than we can help  he turned to her for the first time  and you  i  oh i shall cry for a little while but later on i shall laugh as often  life is not all love  i have my work  he knew her well by this time  and also it came to him that it would be a finer thing to be worthy of her than even to possess her  so he did her bidding and went out with the other woman  tommy was glad it was pressnight  she would not be able to think for hours to come and then perhaps she would be feeling too tired  work can be very kind  were this an artistic story here of course one would write finis but in the workaday world one never knows the ending till it comes  had it been otherwise i doubt i could have found courage to tell you this story of tommy  it is not all trueat least i do not suppose so  one drifts unconsciously a little way into dreamland when one sits oneself down to recall the happenings of long ago while fancy with a sly wink whispers ever and again to memory let me tell this incidentpicture that scene i can make it so much more interesting than you would  but tommyhow can i put it without saying too much there is someone i think of when i speak of her  to remember only her dear wounds and not the healing of them would have been a task too painful  i love to dwell on their next meeting  flipp passing him on the steps did not know him the tall sunburnt gentleman with the sweet gravefaced little girl  seen that face somewhere before mused flipp as at the corner of bedford street he climbed into a hansom seen it somewhere on a thinner man  for dick danvers that he did not recognise flipp there was more excuse a very old young man had flipp become at thirty  flipp no longer enjoyed popular journalism  he produced it  the goldbound doorkeeper feared the mighty clodd would be unable to see so insignificant an atom as an unappointed stranger but would let the card of mr richard danvers plead for itself  to the goldbound keepers surprise came down the message that mr danvers was to be at once shown up  i thought somehow you would come to me first said the portly clodd advancing with outstretched hand  and this is  my little girl honor  we have been travelling for the last few months  clodd took the grave small face between his big rough hands  yes  she is like you  but looks as if she were going to have more sense  forgive me i knew your father my dear laughed clodd when he was younger  they lit their cigars and talked  well not exactly dead we amalgamated it winked clodd in answer to danvers inquiry  it was just a trifle too highclass  besides the old gentleman was not getting younger  it hurt him a little at first but then came tommys great success and that has reconciled him to all things  do they know you are in england  no explained danvers we arrived only last night  clodd called directions down the speakingtube  you will find hardly any change in her  one still has to keep ones eye upon her chin  she has not even lost her old habit of taking stock of people  you remember  clodd laughed  they talked a little longer till there came a whistle and clodd put his ear to the tube  i have to see her on business said clodd rising you may as well come with me  they are still in the old place gough square  tommy was out but peter was expecting her every minute  peter did not know dick but would not admit it  forgetfulness was a sign of age and peter still felt young  i know your face quite well said peter cant put a name to it thats all  clodd whispered it to him together with information bringing history up to date  and then light fell upon the old lined face  he came towards dick meaning to take him by both hands but perhaps because he had become somewhat feeble he seemed glad when the younger man put his arms around him and held him for a moment  it was unenglish and both of them felt a little ashamed of themselves afterwards  what we want said clodd addressing peter we threeyou i and miss danversis tea and cakes with cream in them and i know a shop where they sell them  we will call back for your father in half an hour clodd explained to miss danvers he has to talk over a matter of business with miss hope  i know answered the gravefaced little person  she drew dicks face down to hers and kissed it  and then the three went out together leaving dick standing by the window  couldnt we hide somewhere till she comes suggested miss danvers  i want to see her  so they waited in the open doorway of a near printinghouse till tommy drove up  both peter and clodd watched the childs face with some anxiety  she nodded gravely to herself three times then slipped her hand into peters  tommy opened the door with her latchkey and passed in
