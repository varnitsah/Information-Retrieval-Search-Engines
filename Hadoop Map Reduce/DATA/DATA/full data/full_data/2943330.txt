2943330	historical lectures and essays by charles kingsley   contents  the first discovery of america cyrus servant of the lord ancient civilisation rondelet vesalius paracelsus buchanan     the first discovery of america   let me begin this lecture 1 with a scene in the north atlantic 863 years since  bjarne grimolfson was blown with his ship into the irish ocean and there came worms and the ship began to sink under them  they had a boat which they had payed with seals blubber for that the seaworms will not hurt  but when they got into the boat they saw that it would not hold them all  then said bjarne as the boat will only hold the half of us my advice is that we should draw lots who shall go in her for that will not be unworthy of our manhood  this advice seemed so good that none gainsaid it and they drew lots  and the lot fell to bjarne that he should go in the boat with half his crew  but as he got into the boat there spake an icelander who was in the ship and had followed bjarne from iceland art thou going to leave me here bjarne  quoth bjarne so it must be  then said the man another thing didst thou promise my father when i sailed with thee from iceland than to desert me thus  for thou saidst that we both should share the same lot  bjarne said and that we will not do  get thou down into the boat and i will get up into the ship now i see that thou art so greedy after life  so bjarne went up into the ship and the man went down into the boat and the boat went on its voyage till they came to dublin in ireland  most men say that bjarne and his comrades perished among the worms for they were never heard of after  this story may serve as a text for my whole lecture  not only does it smack of the seabreeze and the salt water like all the finest old norse sagas but it gives a glimpse at least of the nobleness which underlay the grim and often cruel nature of the norseman  it belongs too to the culminating epoch to the beginning of that era when the scandinavian peoples had their great times when the old fierceness of the worshippers of thor and odin was tempered without being effeminated by the faith of the white christ till the very men who had been the destroyers of western europe became its civilisers  it should have moreover a special interest to americans  foras american antiquaries are well awarebjarne was on his voyage home from the coast of new england possibly from that very mount hope bay which seems to have borne the same name in the time of those old norsemen as afterwards in the days of king philip the last sachem of the wampanong indians  he was going back to greenland perhaps for reinforcements finding he and his fellowcaptain thorfinn the esquimaux who then dwelt in that land too strong for them  for the norsemen were then on the very edge of discovery which might have changed the history not only of this continent but of europe likewise  they had found and colonised iceland and greenland  they had found labrador and called it helluland from its icepolished rocks  they had found nova scotia seemingly and called it markland from its woods  they had found new england and called it vinland the good  a fair land they found it well wooded with good pasturage so that they had already imported cows and a bull whose lowings terrified the esquimaux  they had found selfsown corn too probably maize  the streams were full of salmon  but they had called the land vinland by reason of its grapes  quaint enough and bearing in its very quaintness the stamp of truth is the story of the first finding of the wild foxgrapes  how leif the fortunate almost as soon as he first landed missed a little wizened old german servant of his fathers tyrker by name and was much vexed thereat for he had been brought up on the old mans knee and hurrying off to find him met tyrker coming back twisting his eyes abouta trick of hissmacking his lips and talking german to himself in high excitement  and when they get him to talk norse again he says i have not been far but i have news for you  i have found vines and grapes  is that true fosterfather says leif true it is says the old german for i was brought up where there was never any lack of them  the sagaas given by rafnhad a detailed description of this quaint personages appearance and it would not he amiss if american winegrowers should employ an american sculptorand there are great american sculptorsto render that description into marble and set up little tyrker in some public place as the silenus of the new world  thus the first cargoes homeward from vinland to greenland had been of timber and of raisins and of vinestocks which were not like to thrive  and more  beyond vinland the good there was said to be another land whitemans landor ireland the mickle as some called it  for these norse traders from limerick had found ari marson and ketla of ruykjanes supposed to have been long since drowned at sea and said that the people had made him and ketla chiefs and baptized ari  what is all this and what is this too which the esquimaux children taken in markland told the northmen of a land beyond them where the folk wore white clothes and carried flags on poles  are these all dreams or was some part of that great civilisation the relics whereof your antiquarians find in so many parts of the united states still in existence some 900 years ago and were these old norse cousins of ours upon the very edge of it  be that as it may how nearly did these fierce vikings some of whom seemed to have sailed far south along the shore become aware that just beyond them lay a land of fruits and spices gold and gems  the adverse current of the gulf stream it may be would have long prevented their getting past the bahamas into the gulf of mexico but sooner or later some storm must have carried a greenland viking to san domingo or to cuba and then as has been well said some scandinavian dynasty might have sat upon the throne of mexico  these stories are well known to antiquarians  they may be found almost all of them in professor rafns antiquitates americanae  the action in them stands out often so clear and dramatic that the internal evidence of historic truth is irresistible  thorvald who when he saw what seems to be they say the bluff head of alderton at the southeast end of boston bay said here should i like to dwell and shot by an esquimaux arrow bade bury him on that place with a cross at his head and a cross at his feet and call the place cross ness for evermore gudrida the magnificent widow who wins hearts and sees strange deeds from iceland to greenland and greenland to vinland and back and at last worn out and sad goes off on a pilgrimage to rome helgi and finnbogi the norwegians who like our arctic voyagers in after times devise all sorts of sports and games to keep the men in humour during the long winter at hope and last but not least the terrible freydisa who when the norse are seized with a sudden panic at the esquimaux and flee from them as they had three weeks before fled from thorfinns bellowing bull turns when so weak that she cannot escape singlehanded on the savages and catching up a slain mans sword puts them all to flight with her fierce visage and fierce criesfreydisa the terrible who in another voyage persuades her husband to fall on helgi and finnbogi when asleep and murder them and all their men and then when he will not murder the five women too takes up an axe and slays them all herself and getting back to greenland when the dark and unexplained tale comes out lives unpunished but abhorred henceforth  all these folks i say are no phantoms but realities at least if i can judge of internal evidence  but beyond them and hovering on the verge of mythus and fairyland there is a ballad called finn the fair and how     an upland earl had twa braw sons       my story to begin    the tane was light haldane the strong       the tither was winsome finn  and so forth which was still sung with other rimur or ballads in the faroes at the end of the last century  professor rafn has inserted it because it talks of vinland as a wellknown place and because the brothers are sent by the princess to slay american kings but that rime has another value  it is of a beauty so perfect and yet so like the old scotch ballads in its heroic conception of love and in all its forms and its qualities that it is one proof more to any student of early european poetry that we and these old norsemen are men of the same blood  if anything more important than is told by professor rafn and mr black 2 be now known to the antiquarians of massachusetts let me entreat them to pardon my ignorance  but let me record my opinion that though somewhat too much may have been made in past years of certain rockinscriptions and so forth on this side of the atlantic there can be no reasonable doubt that our own race landed and tried to settle on the shore of new england six hundred years before their kinsmen and in many cases their actual descendants the august pilgrim fathers of the seventeenth century  and so as i said a scandinavian dynasty might have been seated now upon the throne of mexico  and how was that strange chance lost  first of course by the length and danger of the coasting voyage  it was one thing to have like columbus and vespucci cortes and pizarro the azores as a halfway port another to have greenland or even iceland  it was one thing to run southwest upon columbuss track across the mar de damas the ladies sea which hardly knows a storm with the blazing blue above the blazing blue below in an everwarming climate where every breath is life and joy another to struggle against the fogs and icebergs the rocks and currents of the dreary north atlantic  no wonder then that the knowledge of markland and vinland and whitemans land died away in a few generations and became but fireside sagas for the winter nights  but there were other causes more honourable to the dogged energy of the norse  they were in those very years conquering and settling nearer home as no other peopleunless perhaps the old ionian greeksconquered and settled  greenland we have seen they heldthe western side at leastand held it long and well enough to afford it is said 2600 pounds of walrus teeth as yearly tithe to the pope besides peters pence and to build many a convent and church and cathedral with farms and homesteads round for one saga speaks of greenland as producing wheat of the finest quality  all is ruined now perhaps by gradual change of climate  but they had richer fields of enterprise than greenland iceland and the faroes  their boldest outlaws at that very timewhether from norway sweden denmark or britainwere forming the imperial lifeguard of the byzantine emperor as the once famous varangers of constantinople and that splendid epoch of their race was just dawning of which my lamented friend the late sir edmund head says so well in his preface to viga glums icelandic saga the sagas of which this tale is one were composed for the men who have left their mark in every corner of europe and whose language and laws are at this moment important elements in the speech and institutions of england america and australia  there is no page of modern history in which the influence of the norsemen and their conquests must not be taken into accountrussia constantinople greece palestine sicily the coasts of africa southern italy france the spanish peninsula england scotland ireland and every rock and island round them have been visited and most of them at one time or the other ruled by the men of scandinavia  the motto on the sword of roger guiscard was a proud one     appulus et calaber siculus mihi servit et afer  every island says sir edmund head and trulyfor the name of almost every island on the coast of england scotland and eastern ireland ends in either ey or ay or oe a norse appellative as is the word island itselfis a mark of its having been at some time or other visited by the vikings of scandinavia  norway meanwhile was convulsed by war and what perhaps was of more immediate consequence svend forkbeard whom we englishmen call sweynthe renegade from that christian faith which had been forced on him by his german conqueror the emperor otto iiwith his illustrious son cnut whom we call canute were just calling together all the most daring spirits of the baltic coasts for the subjugation of england and when that great feat was performed the scandinavian emigration was paralysed probably for a time by the fearful wars at home  while the king of sweden and st olaf tryggvason king of norway were setting on denmark during cnuts pilgrimage to rome and cnut sailing with a mighty fleet to norway was driving st olaf into russia to return and fall in the fratricidal battle of stiklesteadduring strangely enough a total eclipse of the sunvinland was like enough to remain still uncolonised after cnuts shortlived triumphking as he was of denmark norway england and half scotland and what not of wendish folk inside the balticthe force of the norsemen seems to have been exhausted in their native lands  once more only if i remember right did lochlin really and hopefully send forth her mailed swarm to conquer a foreign land and with a result unexpected alike by them and by their enemies  had it been otherwise we might not have been here this day  let me sketch for you once morethough you have heard it doubtless many a timethe tale of that tremendous fortnight which settled the fate of britain and therefore of north america which decidedjust in those great times when the decision was to be madewhether we should be on a par with the other civilised nations of europe like them the heirs of all the ages with our share not only of roman christianity and roman centralisationa member of the great comity of european nations held together in one christian bond by the popebut heirs also of roman civilisation roman literature roman law and therefore in due time of greek philosophy and art  no less a question than this it seems to me hung in the balance during that fortnight of autumn 1066  poor old edward the confessor holy weak and sad lay in his new choir of westminsterwhere the wicked ceased from troubling and the weary were at rest  the crowned ascetic had left no heir behind  england seemed as a corpse to which all the eagles might gather together and the southenglish in their utter need had chosen for their king the ablest and it may be the justest man in britainearl harold godwinsson himself like half the upper classes of england then of the alldominant norse blood for his mother was a danish princess  then out of norway with a mighty host came harold hardraade taller than all men the ideal viking of his time  halfbrother of the now dead st olaf severely wounded when he was but fifteen at stiklestead when olaf fell he had warred and plundered on many a coast  he had been away to russia to king jaroslaf he had been in the emperors varanger guard at constantinopleand it was whispered had slain a lion there with his bare hands he had carved his name and his comrades in runic charactersif you go to venice you may see them at this dayon the loins of the great marble lion which stood in his time not in venice but in athens  and now king of norway and conqueror for the time of denmark why should he not take england as sweyn and canute took it sixty years before when the flower of the english gentry perished at the fatal battle of assingdune  if he and his halfbarbarous host had conquered the civilisation of britain would have been thrown back perhaps for centuries  but it was not to be  england was to be conquered by the norman but by the civilised not the barbaric by the norse who had settled but four generations before in the north east of france under rou rollo rolf the gangersocalled they say because his legs were so long that when on horseback he touched the ground and seemed to gang or walk  he and his norsemen had taken their share of france and called it normandy to this day and meanwhile with that docility and adaptability which marks so often truly great spirits they had changed their creed their language their habits and had become from heathen and murderous berserkers the most truly civilised people of europe andas was most natural thenthe most faithful allies and servants of the pope of rome  so greatly had they changed and so fast that william duke of normandy the greatgreatgrandson of rolf the wild viking was perhaps the finest gentleman as well as the most cultivated sovereign and the greatest statesman and warrior in all europe  so harold of norway came with all his vikings to stamford bridge by york and took by coming only that which harold of england promised him namely forasmuch as he was taller than any other man seven feet of english ground  the story of that great battle told with a few inaccuracies but told as only great poets tell you should read if you have not read it already in the heimskringla of snorri sturluson the homer of the north     high feast that day held the birds of the air and the beasts of the    field    whitetailed erne and sallow glede    dusky raven with horny neb    and the gray deer the wolf of the wood  the bones of the slain men say whitened the place for fifty years to come  and remember that on the same day on which that fight befellseptember 27 1066william duke of normandy with all his frenchspeaking norsemen was sailing across the british channel under the protection of a banner consecrated by the pope to conquer that england which the norse speaking normans could not conquer  and now king harold showed himself a man  he turned at once from the north of england to the south  he raised the folk of the southern as he had raised those of the central and northern shires and in sixteen daysafter a march which in those times was a prodigious feathe was entrenched upon the fatal down which men called heathfield then and senlac but battle to this daywith william and his french normans opposite him on telham hill  then came the battle of hastings  you all know what befell upon that day and how the old weapon was matched against the newthe english axe against the norman lanceand beaten only because the english broke their ranks  if you wish to refresh your memories read the tale once more in mr freemans history of england or professor creasys fifteen decisive battles of the world or even best of all the late lord lyttons splendid romance of harold  and when you go to england go as some of you may have gone already to battle and there from off the abbey grounds or from mountjoye behind look down off what was then the heathy field over the long slopes of green pasture and the rich hop gardens where were no hopgardens then and the flat tidemarshes winding between the wooded heights towards the southern sea and imagine for yourselves the feelings of an englishman as he contemplates that broad green sloping lawn on which was decided the destiny of his native land  here right beneath rode taillefer up the slope before them all singing the song of roland tossing his lance in air and catching it as it fell with all the norse berserker spirit of his ancestors flashing out in him at the thought of one fair fight and then purgatory or valhallataillefer perhaps preferred the latter  yonder on the left in that copse where the redochre gully runs is sanguelac the drain of blood into which as the bayeux tapestry woven by matildas maids still shows the norman knights fell horse and man till the gully was bridged with writhing bodies for those who rode after  here where you standthe crest of the hill marks where it must have beenwas the stockade on which depended the fate of england  yonder perhaps stalked out one english squire or housecarle after another tall men with long handled battleaxesone specially terrible with a wooden helmet which no sword could piercewho hewed and hewed down knight on knight till they themselves were borne to earth at last  and here among the trees and ruins of the garden kept trim by those who know the treasure which they own stood harolds two standards of the fightingman and the dragon of wessex  and here close by for here for many a century stood the high altar of battle abbey where monks sang masses for harolds soul upon this very spot the swanneck found her herolovers corpse  ah says many an englishmanand who will blame him for ithow grand to have died beneath that standard on that day  yes and how right  and yet how right likewise that the normans cry of dexaiegod helpand not the english hurrah should have won that day till william rode up mountjoye in the afternoon to see the english army terrible even in defeat struggling through copse and marsh away toward brede and like retreating lions driven into their native woods slaying more in the pursuit than they slew even in the fight  but so it was to be for so it ought to have been  you my american friends delight as i have said already in seeing the old places of the old country  go i beg you and look at that old place and if you be wise you will carry back from it one lesson that gods thoughts are not as our thoughts nor his ways as our ways  it was a fearful time which followed  i cannot but believe that our forefathers had been in some way or other great sinners or two such conquests as canutes and williams would not have fallen on them within the short space of sixty years  they did not want for courage as stamford brigg and hastings showed full well  english swine their norman conquerors called them often enough but never english cowards their ruinous vice if we are to trust the records of the time was what the old monks called accidiagreek textand ranked it as one of the seven deadly sins a general careless sleepy comfortable habit of mind which lets all go its way for good or evila habit of mind too often accompanied as in the case of the angledanes with selfindulgence often coarse enough  huge eaters and huger drinkers fuddled with ale were the men who went down at hastingsthough they went down like heroesbefore the staid and sober norman out of france  but those were fearful times  as long as william lived ruthless as he was to all rebels he kept order and did justice with a strong and steady hand for he brought with him from normandy the instincts of a truly great statesman  and in his sons time matters grew worse and worse after that in the troubles of stephens reign anarchy let loose tyranny in its most fearful form and things were done which recall the cruelties of the old spanish conquistadores in america  scotts charming romance of ivanhoe must be taken i fear as a too true picture of english society in the time of richard i  and what came of it all  what was the result of all this misery and wrong  this paradoxical as it may seem that the norman conquest was the making of the english people of the free commons of england  paradoxical but true  first you must dismiss from your minds the too common notion that there is now in england a governing norman aristocracy or that there has been one at least since the year 1215 when magna charta was won from the norman john by normans and by english alike  for the first victors at hastings like the first conquistadores in america perished as the monk chronicles point out rapidly by their own crimes and very few of our nobility can trace their names back to the authentic battle abbey roll  the great majority of the peers have sprung from and all have intermarried with the commons and the peerage has been from the first and has become more and more as centuries have rolled on the prize of success in life  the cause is plain  the conquest of england by the normans was not one of those conquests of a savage by a civilised race or of a cowardly race by a brave race which results in the slavery of the conquered and leaves the gulf of caste between two racesmaster and slave  that was the case in france and resulted after centuries of oppression in the great and dreadful revolution of 1793 which convulsed not only france but the whole civilised world  but caste thank god has never existed in england since at least the first generation after the norman conquest  the vast majority all but the whole population of england have been always free and free as they are not where caste exists to change their occupations  they could intermarry if they were able men into the ranks above them as they could sink if they were unable men into the ranks below them  any man acquainted with the origin of our english surnames may verify this fact for himself by looking at the names of a single parish or a single street of shops  there jumbled together he will find names marking the noblest saxon or angle bloodkenward or kenric osgood or osborne side by side with cordery or banisternow names of farmers in my own parishor other normanfrench names which may be like those two last in battle abbey rolland side by side the almost ubiquitous brown whose ancestor was probably some danish or norwegian housecarle proud of his name biorn the bear and the ubiquitous smith or smythe the smiter whose forefather whether he be now peasant or peer assuredly handled the tongs and hammer at his own forge  this holds true equally in new england and in old  when i search through as i delight to do your new england surnames i find the same jumble of nameswest saxon angle danish norman and frenchnorman likewise many of primaeval and heathen antiquity many of high nobility all worked together as at home to form the free commoners of england  if any should wish to know more on this curious and important subject let me recommend them to study fergusons teutonic name system a book from which you will discover that some of our quaintest and seemingly most plebeian surnamesmany surnames too which are extinct in england but remain in americaare really corruptions of good old teutonic names which our ancestors may have carried in the german forest before an englishman set foot on british soil from which he will rise with the comfortable feeling that we englishspeaking men from the highest to the lowest are literally kinsmen  nay so utterly made up now is the old bloodfeud between norseman and englishman between the descendants of those who conquered and those who were conquered that in the children of our prince of wales after 800 years the blood of william of normandy is mingled with the blood of the very harold who fell at hastings  and so by the bitter woes which followed the norman conquest was the whole population dane angle and saxon earl and churl freeman and slave crushed and welded together into one homogeneous mass made just and merciful towards each other by the most wholesome of all teachings a community of suffering and if they had been as i fear they were a lazy and a sensual people were taught     that life is not as idle ore    but heated hot with burning fears    and bathed in baths of hissing tears    and battered with the strokes of doom    to shape and use  but how did these wild vikings become christian men  it is a long story so stanch a race was sure to be converted only very slowly  noble missionaries as ansgar rembert and poppo had worked for 150 years and more among the heathens of denmark  but the patriotism of the norseman always recoiled even though in secret from the fact that they were german monks backed by the authority of the german emperor and many a man like svend forkbeard father of the great canute though he had the kaiser himself for godfather turned heathen once more the moment he was free because his baptism was the badge of foreign conquest and neither pope nor kaiser should lord it over him body or soul  st olaf indeed forced christianity on the norse at the swords point often by horrid cruelties and perished in the attempt  but who forced it on the norsemen of scotland england ireland neustria russia and all the eastern baltic  it was absorbed and in most cases i believe gradually and willingly as a gospel and good news to hearts worn out with the storm of their own passions  and whence came their christianity  much of it as in the case of the danes and still more of the french normans came direct from rome the city which let them defy its influence as they would was still the fount of all theology as well as of all civilisation  but i must believe that much of it came from that mysterious ancient western church the church of st patric st bridget st columba which had covered with rude cells and chapels the rocky islets of the north atlantic even to iceland itself  even to iceland for when that island was first discovered about ad 840 the norsemen found in an isle on the east and west and elsewhere irish books and bells and wooden crosses and named that island papey the isle of the popessome little colony of monks who lived by fishing and who are said to have left the land when the norsemen settled in it  let us believe for it is consonant with reason and experience that the sight of those poor monks plundered and massacred again and again by the mailed swarms of lochlin yet never exterminated but springing up again in the same place ready for fresh massacre a sacred plant which god had planted and which no rage of man could trample outlet us believe i say that that sight taught at last to the buccaneers of the old world that there was a purer manliness a loftier heroism than the ferocious selfassertion of the berserker even the heroism of humility gentleness selfrestraint selfsacrifice that there was a strength which was made perfect in weakness a glory not of the sword but of the cross  we will believe that that was the lesson which the norsemen learnt after many a wild and bloodstained voyage from the monks of iona or of derry which caused the building of such churches as that which sightrys king of dublin raised about the year 1030 not in the norse but in the irish quarter of dublin a sacred token of amity between the new settlers and the natives on the ground of a common faith  let us believe too that the influence of woman was not wanting in the good workthat the story of st margaret and malcolm canmore was repeated though inversely in the case of many a heathen scandinavian jarl who marrying the princely daughter of some scottish chieftain found in her creed at last something more precious than herself while his brother or his cousin became at dublin or wexford or waterford the husband of some saffronrobed irish princess fair as an elf as the old saying was some maiden of the three transcendent hues of whom the old book of linane says     red as the blood which flowed from stricken deer    white as the snow on which that blood ran down    black as the raven who drank up that blood  and possibly as in the case of brian borus mother had given his fair haired sister in marriage to some irish prince and could not resist the spell of their new creed and the spell too it may be of some sister of theirs who had long given up all thought of earthly marriage to tend the undying fire of st bridget among the consecrated virgins of kildare  i am not drawing from mere imagination  that such things must have happened and happened again and again is certain to anyone who knows even superficially the documents of that time  and i doubt not that in manners as well as in religion the norse were humanised and civilised by their contact with the celts both in scotland and in ireland  both peoples had valour intellect imagination but the celt had that which the burly angular norse character however deep and stately and however humorous wanted namely music of nature tenderness grace rapidity playfulness just the qualities combining with the scandinavian and in scotland with the angle elements of character which have produced in ireland and in scotland two schools of lyric poetry second to none in the world  and so they were converted to what was then a dark and awful creed a creed of ascetic selftorture and purgatorial fires for those who escape the still more dreadful because endless doom of the rest of the human race  but because it was a sad creed it suited better men who had when conscience reawakened in them but too good reason to be sad and the minsters and cloisters which sprang up over the whole of northern europe and even beyond it along the dreary western shores of greenland itself are the symbols of a splendid repentance for their own sins and for the sins of their forefathers  gudruna herself of whom i spoke just now one of those old norse heroines who helped to discover america though a historic personage is a symbolic one likewise and the pattern of a whole class  she too after many journeys to iceland greenland and winland goes on a pilgrimage to rome to get i presume absolution from the pope himself for all the sins of her strange rich stormy wayward life  have you not readmany of you surely havela motte fouques romance of sintram  it embodies all that i would say  it is the spiritual drama of that early middle age very sad morbid if you will but true to fact the lady verena ought not perhaps to desert her husband and shut herself up in a cloister  but so she would have done in those old days and who shall judge her harshly for so doing  when the brutality of the man seems past all cure who shall blame the woman if she glides away into some atmosphere of peace and purity to pray for him whom neither warnings nor caresses will amend  it is a sad book sintram  and yet not too sad  for they were a sad people those old norse forefathers of ours  their christianity was sad their minsters sad there are few sadder though few grander buildings than a norman church  and yet perhaps their christianity did not make them sad  it was but the other and the healthier side of that sadness which they had as heathens  read which you will of the old sagasheathen or halfchristianthe eyrbiggia viga glum burnt niall grettir the strong and above all snorri sturlusons heimskringla itselfand you will see at once how sad they are  there is in the old sagas none of that enjoyment of life which shines out everywhere in greek poetry even through its deepest tragedies  not in complacency with natures beauty but in the fierce struggle with her wrath does the norseman feel pleasure  nature to him was not as in mr longfellows exquisite poem 3 the kind old nurse to take him on her knee and whisper to him ever anew the story without an end  she was a weird witchwife mother of storm demons and frost giants who must be fought with steadily warily wearily over dreary heaths and snowcapped fells and rugged nesses and tossing sounds and away into the boundless seaor who could livetill he got hardened in the fight into ruthlessness of need and greed  the poor strip of flat strath ploughed and reploughed again in the short summer days would yield no more or wet harvests spoiled the crops or heavy snows starved the cattle  and so the norseman launched his ships when the lands were sown in spring and went forth to pillage or to trade as luck would have to summerted as he himself called it and came back if he ever came in autumn to the women to help at harvest time with blood upon his hand  but had he stayed at home blood would have been there still  three out of four of them had been mixed up in some manslaying or had some bloodfeud to avenge among their own kin  the whole of scandinavia denmark sweden norway orkney and the rest remind me ever of that terrible picture of the great norse painter tiddeman in which two splendid youths lashed together in true norse duel fashion by the waist are hewing each other to death with the short axe about some hot words over their ale  the loss of life and that of the most gallant of the young in those days must have been enormous  if the vitality of the race had not been even more enormous they must have destroyed each other as the red indians have done off the face of the earth  they lived these norsemen not to livethey lived to die  for what cared they  deathwhat was death to them what it was to the jomsburger viking who when led out to execution said to the headsman die with all pleasure  we used to question in jomsburg whether a man felt when his head was off  now i shall know but if i do take care for i shall smite thee with my knife  and meanwhile spoil not this long hair of mine it is so beautiful  but oh what waste  what might not these men have done if they had sought peace not war if they had learned a few centuries sooner to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with their god  and yet one loves them bloodstained as they are  your own poets men brought up under circumstances under ideas the most opposite to theirs love them and cannot help it  and why  it is not merely for their bold daring it is not merely for their stern endurance nor again that they had in them that shift and thrift those steady and commonsense business habits which made their noblest men not ashamed to go on voyages of merchandise  nor is it again that grim humourhumour as of the modern scotchwhich so often flashes out into an actual jest but more usually underlies unspoken all their deeds  is it not rather that these men are our forefathers that their blood runs in the veins of perhaps three men out of four in any general assembly whether in america or in britain startling as the assertion may be i believe it to be strictly true  be that as it may i cannot read the stories of your western men the writings of bret harte or colonel john hay for instance without feeling at every turn that there are the old norse alive again beyond the very ocean which they first crossed 850 years ago  let me try to prove my point and end with a story as i began with one  it is just thirty years before the norman conquest of england the evening of the battle of sticklestead  st olafs corpse is still lying unburied on the hillside  the reforming and christian king has fallen in the attempt to force christianity and despotism on the conservative and halfheathen partythe free bonders or yeomanfarmers of norway thormod his poetthe man as his name means of thunder moodwho has been standing in the ranks at last has an arrow in his left side  he breaks off the shaft and thus sore wounded goes up when all is lost to a farm where is a great barn full of wounded  one kimbe comes a man out of the opposite or bonder part  there is great howling and screaming in there he says  king olafs men fought bravely enough but it is a shame brisk young lads cannot bear their wounds  on what side wert thou in the fight  on the best side says the beaten thormod  kimbe sees that thormod has a good bracelet on his arm  thou art surely a kings man  give me thy gold ring and i will hide thee ere the bonders kill thee  thormod said take it if thou canst get it  i have lost that which is worth more and he stretched out his left hand and kimbe tried to take it  but thormod swinging his sword cut off his hand and it is said kimbe behaved no better over his wound than those he had been blaming  then thormod went into the barn and after he had sung his song there in praise of his dead king he went into an inner room where was a fire and water warming and a handsome girl binding up mens wounds  and he sat down by the door and one said to him why art thou so dead pale why dost thou not call for the leech  then sung thormod     i am not blooming and the fair    and slender maiden loves to care    for blooming youths  few care for me    with fenris gold meal i cant fee  and so forth improvising after the old norse fashion  then thormod got up and went to the fire and stood and warmed himself  and the nurse girl said to him go out man and bring some of the splitfirewood which lies outside the door  he went out and brought an armful of wood and threw it down  then the nursegirl looked him in the face and said dreadful pale is this man  why art thou so  then sang thormod     thou wonderest sweet bloom at me    a man so hideous to see    the arrowdrift oertook me girl    a fineground arrow in the whirl    went through me and i feel the dart    sits lovely lass too near my heart  the girl said let me see thy wound  then thormod sat down and the girl saw his wounds and that which was in his side and saw that there was a piece of iron in it but could not tell where it had gone  in a stone pot she had leeks and other herbs and boiled them and gave the wounded man of it to eat  but thormod said take it away i have no appetite now for my broth  then she took a great pair of tongs and tried to pull out the iron but the wound was swelled and there was too little to lay hold of  now said thormod cut in so deep that thou canst get at the iron and give me the tongs  she did as he said  then took thormod the gold bracelet off his hand and gave it the nursegirl and bade her do with it what she liked  it is a good mans gift said he  king olaf gave me the ring this morning  then thormod took the tongs and pulled the iron out  but on the iron was a barb on which hung flesh from the heart some red some white  when he saw that he said the king has fed us well  i am fat even to the hearts roots  and so leant back and was dead     cyrus the servant ofthe lord 4   i wish to speak to you tonight about one of those old despotic empires which were in every case the earliest known form of civilisation  were i minded to play the cynic or the mountebank i should choose some corrupt and effete despotism already grown weak and ridiculous by its decayas did at last the roman and then the byzantine empireand after raising a laugh at the expense of the old system say see what a superior people you are nowhow impossible under free and enlightened institutions is anything so base and so absurd as went on even in despotic france before the revolution of 1793  well that would be on the whole true thank god but what need is there to say it  let us keep our scorn for our own weaknesses our blame for our own sins certain that we shall gain more instruction though not more amusement by hunting out the good which is in anything than by hunting out its evil  i have chosen not the worst but the best despotism which i could find in history founded and ruled by a truly heroic personage one whose name has become a proverb and a legend that so i might lift up your minds even by the contemplation of an old eastern empire to see that it too could be a work and ordinance of god and its hero the servant of the lord  for we are almost bound to call cyrus the founder of the persian empire by this august title for two reasonsfirst because the hebrew scriptures call him so the next because he proved himself to be such by his actions and their consequencesat least in the eyes of those who believe as i do in a farseeing and farreaching providence by which all human history is     bound by gold chains unto the throne of god  his work was very different from any that need be done or can be done in these our days  but while we thank god that such work is now as unnecessary as impossible we may thank god likewise that when such work was necessary and possible a man was raised up to do it and to do it as all accounts assert better perhaps than it had ever been done before or since  true the old conquerors who absorbed nation after nation tribe after tribe and founded empires on their ruins are now i trust about to be replaced throughout the world as here and in britain at home by free selfgoverned peoples     the old order changeth giving place to the new    and god fulfils himself in many ways    lest one good custom should corrupt the world  and that custom of conquest and empire and transplantation did more than once corrupt the world  and yet in it too god may have more than once fulfilled his own designs as he did if scripture is to be believed in cyrus well surnamed the great the founder of the persian empire some 2400 years ago  for these empires it must be remembered did at least that which the roman empire did among a scattered number of savage tribes or separate little races hating and murdering each other speaking different tongues and worshipping different gods and losing utterly the sense of a common humanity till they looked on the people who dwelt in the next valley as fiends to be sacrificed if caught to their own fiends at home  among such as these empires did introduce order law common speech common interest the notion of nationality and humanity  they as it were hammered together the fragments of the human race till they had moulded them into one  they did it cruelly clumsily ill but was there ever work done on earth however noble which was notalas alasdone somewhat ill  let me talk to you a little about the old hero  he and his hardy persians should be specially interesting to us  for in them first does our race the aryan race appear in authentic history  in them first did our race give promise of being the conquering and civilising race of the future world  and to the conquests of cyrusso strangely are all great times and great movements of the human family linked to each otherto his conquests humanly speaking is owing the fact that you are here and i am speaking to you at this moment  it is an ofttold story but so grand a one that i must sketch it for you however clumsily once more  in that mountain province called farsistan northeast of what we now call persia the dwellingplace of the persians there dwelt in the sixth and seventh centuries before christ a hardy tribe of the purest blood of iran a branch of the same race as the celtic teutonic greek and hindoo and speaking a tongue akin to theirs  they had wandered thither say their legends out of the far northeast from off some lofty plateau of central asia driven out by the increasing cold which left them but two mouths of summer to ten of winter  they despised at firstwould that they had despised alwaysthe luxurious life of the dwellers in the plains and the effeminate customs of the medesa branch of their own race who had conquered and intermarried with the turanian or finnish tribes and adopted much of their creed as well as of their morals throughout their vast but short lived median empire  soft countries said cyrus himselfso runs the talegave birth to small men  no region produced at once delightful fruits and men of a warlike spirit  letters were to them probably then unknown  they borrowed them in after years as they borrowed their art from babylonians assyrians and other semitic nations whom they conquered  from the age of five to that of twenty their lads were instructed but in two thingsto speak the truth and to shoot with the bow  to ride was the third necessary art introduced according to xenophon after they had descended from their mountain fastnessess to conquer the whole east  their creed was simple enough  ahura mazdaormuzd as he has been called sincewas the one eternal creator the source of all light and life and good  he spake his word and it accomplished the creation of heaven before the water before the earth before the cow before the tree before the fire before man the truthful before the devas and beasts of prey before the whole existing universe before every good thing created by ahura mazda and springing from truth  he needed no sacrifices of blood  he was to be worshipped only with prayers with offerings of the inspiring juice of the now unknown herb homa and by the preservation of the sacred fire which understand was not he but the symbolas was light and the sunof the good spiritof ahura mazda  they had no images of the gods these old persians no temples no altars so says herodotus and considered the use of them a sign of folly  they were as has been well said of them the puritans of the old world  when they descended from their mountain fastnesses they became the iconoclasts of the old world and the later isaiah out of the depths of national shame captivity and exile saw in them brotherspirits the chosen of the lord whose hero cyrus the lord was holding by his right hand till all the foul superstitions and foul effeminacies of the rotten semitic peoples of the east and even of egypt itself should be crushed though alas only for awhile by men who felt that they had a commission from the god of light and truth and purity to sweep out all that with the besom of destruction  but that was a later inspiration  in earlier and it may be happier times the duty of the good man was to strive against all evil disorder uselessness incompetence in their more simple forms  he therefore is a holy man says ormuzd in the zendavesta who has built a dwelling on the earth in which he maintains fire cattle his wife his children and flocks and herds he who makes the earth produce barley he who cultivates the fruits of the soil cultivates purity he advances the law of ahura mazda as much as if he had offered a hundred sacrifices  to reclaim the waste to till the land to make a corner of the earth better than they found it was to these men to rescue a bit of ormuzds world out of the usurped dominion of ahriman to rescue it from the spirit of evil and disorder for its rightful owner the spirit of order and of good  for they believed in an evil spirit these old persians  evil was not for them a lower form of good  with their intense sense of the difference between right and wrong it could be nothing less than hateful to be attacked exterminated as a personal enemy till it became to them at last impersonate and a person  zarathustra the mystery of evil weighed heavily on them and on their great prophet zoroastersplendour of gold as i am told his name signifieswho lived no man knows clearly when or clearly where but who lived and lives for ever for his works follow him  he too tried to solve for his people the mystery of evil and if he did not succeed who has succeeded yet  warring against ormuzd ahura mazda was ahriman angra mainyus literally the being of an evil mind the illconditioned being  he was labouring perpetually to spoil the good work of ormuzd alike in nature and in man  he was the cause of the fall of man the tempter the author of misery and death he was eternal and uncreate as ormuzd was  but that perhaps was a corruption of the purer and older zoroastrian creed  with it if ahriman were eternal in the past he would not be eternal in the future  somehow somewhen somewhere in the day when three prophetsthe increasing light the increasing truth and the existing truthshould arise and give to mankind the last three books of the zendavesta and convert all mankind to the pure creed then evil should be conquered the creation become pure again and ahriman vanish for ever and meanwhile every good man was to fight valiantly for ormuzd his true lord against ahriman and all his works  men who held such a creed and could speak truth and draw the bow what might they not do when the hour and the man arrived  they were not a big nation  no but they were a great nation even while they were eating barleybread and paying tribute to their conquerors the medes in the sterile valleys of farsistan  and at last the hour and the man came  the story is half legendarydifferently told by different authors  herodotus has one tale xenophon another  the first at least had ample means of information  astyages is the old shah of the median empire then at the height of its seeming might and splendour and effeminacy  he has married his daughter the princess mandane to cambyses seemingly a vassalking or prince of the pure persian blood  one night the old man is troubled with a dream  he sees a vine spring from his daughter which overshadows all asia  he sends for the magi to interpret and they tell him that mandane will have a son who will reign in his stead  having sons of his own and fearing for the succession he sends for mandane and when her child is born gives it to harpagus one of his courtiers to be slain the courtier relents and hands it over to a herdsman to be exposed on the mountains  the herdsman relents in turn and bring the babe up as his own child  when the boy who goes by the name of agradates is grown he is at play with the other herdboys and they choose him for a mimic king  some he makes his guards some he bids build houses some carry his messages  the son of a mede of rank refuses and agradates has him seized by his guards and chastised with the whip  the ancestral instincts of command and discipline are showing early in the lad  the young gentleman complains to his father the father to the old king who of course sends for the herdsman and his boy  the boy answers in a tone so exactly like that in which xenophons cyrus would have answered that i must believe that both xenophons cyrus and herodotuss cyrus like xenophons socrates and platos socrates are real pictures of a real character and that herodotuss story though xenophon says nothing of it is true  he has done nothing the noble boy says but what was just  he had been chosen king in play because the boys thought him most fit  the boy whom he had chastised was one of those who chose him  all the rest obeyed but he would not till at last he got his due reward  if i deserve punishment for that says the boy i am ready to submit  the old king looks keenly and wonderingly at the young king whose features seem somewhat like his own  likely enough in those days when an iranian noble or prince would have a quite different cast of complexion and of face from a turanian herdsman  a suspicion crosses him and by threats of torture he gets the truth from the trembling herdsman  to the poor wretchs rapture the old king lets him go unharmed  he has a more exquisite revenge to take and sends for harpagus who likewise confessed the truth  the wily old tyrant has naught but gentle words  it is best as it is  he has been very sorry himself for the child and mandanes reproaches had gone to his heart  let harpagus go home and send his son to be a companion to the newfound prince  tonight there will be great sacrifices in honour of the childs safety and harpagus is to be a guest at the banquet  harpagus comes and after eating his fill is asked how he likes the kings meat  he gives the usual answer and a covered basket is put before him out of which he is to takein median fashionwhat he likes he finds in it the head and hands and feet of his own son  like a true eastern he shows no signs of horror  the king asks him if he knew what flesh he had been eating  he answers that he knew perfectly  that whatever the king did pleased him  like an eastern courtier he knew how to dissemble but not to forgive and bided his time  the magi to their credit told astyages that his dream had been fulfilled that cyrusas we must now call the foundling princehad fulfilled it by becoming a king in play and the boy is let to go back to his father and his hardy persian life  but harpagus does not leave him alone nor perhaps do his own thoughts  he has wrongs to avenge on his grandfather  and it seems not altogether impossible to the young mountaineer  he has seen enough of median luxury to despise it and those who indulge in it  he has seen his own grandfather with his cheeks rouged his eyelids stained with antimony living a womanlike life shut up from all his subjects in the recesses of a vast seraglio  he calls together the mountain rulers makes friends with tigranes an armenian prince a vassal of the mede who has his wrongs likewise to avenge  and the two little armies of footsoldiersthe persians had no cavalrydefeat the innumerable horsemen of the mede take the old king keep him in honourable captivity and so change one legend says in a single battle the fortunes of the whole east  and then begins that series of conquests of which we know hardly anything save the fact that they were made  the young mountaineer and his playmates whom he makes his generals and satraps sweep onward towards the west teaching their men the art of riding till the persian cavalry becomes more famous than the median had been  they gather to them as a snowball gathers in rolling the picked youth of every tribe whom they overcome  they knit these tribes to them in loyalty and affection by that righteousnessthat truthfulness and justicefor which isaiah in his grandest lyric strains has made them illustrious to all time which xenophon has celebrated in like manner in that exquisite book of histhe cyropaedia  the great lydian kingdom of croesusasia minor as we call it nowgoes down before them  babylon itself goes down after that worldfamed siege which ended in belshazzars feast and when cyrus diedstill in the prime of life the legends seem to sayhe left a coherent and wellorganised empire which stretched from the mediterranean to hindostan  so runs the tale which to me i confess sounds probable and rational enough  it may not do so to you for it has not to many learned men they are inclined to relegate it into the region of myth in plain english to call old herodotus a liar or at least a dupe  what means those wise men can have at this distance of more than 2000 years of knowing more about the matter than herodotus who lived within 100 years of cyrus i for myself cannot discover  and i say this without the least wish to disparage these hypercritical persons  for there areand more there ought to be as long as lies and superstitions remain on this eartha class of thinkers who hold in just suspicion all stories which savour of the sensational the romantic even the dramatic  they know the terrible uses to which appeals to the fancy and the emotions have been applied and are still applied to enslave the intellects the consciences the very bodies of men and women  they dread so much from experience the abuse of that formula that a thing is so beautiful it must be true that they are inclined to reply rather let us say boldly it is so beautiful that it cannot be true  let us mistrust or even refuse to believe a priori and at first sight all startling sensational even poetic tales and accept nothing as history which is not as dull as the ledger of a drygoods store  but i think that experience both in nature and in society are against that ditchwater philosophy  the weather being governed by laws ought always to be equable and normal and yet you have whirlwinds droughts thunderstorms the sharemarket being governed by laws ought to be always equable and normal and yet you have startling transactions startling panics startling disclosures and a whole sensational romance of commercial crime and folly  which of us has lived to be fifty years old without having witnessed in private life sensation tragedies alas sometimes too fearful to be told or at least sensational romances which we shall take care not to tell because we shall not be believed  let the ditchwater philosophy say what it will human life is not a ditch but a wild and roaring river flooding its banks and eating out new channels with many a landslip  it is a strange world and man a strange animal guided it is true usually by most commonplace motives but for that reason ready and glad at times to escape from them and their dulness and baseness to give vent if but for a moment in wild freedom to that demoniac element which as goethe says underlies his nature and all nature and to prefer for an hour to the normal and respectable ditch water a bottle of champagne or even a carouse on firewater let the consequences be what they may  how else shall we explain such a phenomenon as those old crusades  were they undertaken for any purpose commercial or other  certainly not for lightening an overburdened population  nay is not the history of your own mormons and their exodus into the far west one of the most startling instances which the world has seen for several centuries of the unexpected and incalculable forces which lie hid in man  believe me mans passions heated to igniting point rather than his prudence cooled down to freezing point are the normal causes of all great human movement  and a truer law of social science than any that political economists are wont to lay down is that old dov e la donna of the italian judge who used to ask as a preliminary to every case civil or criminal which was brought before him dov e la donna  where is the lady certain like a wise old gentleman that a woman was most probably at the bottom of the matter  strangeness  romance  did any of you ever readif you have not you should readarchbishop whatelys historic doubts about the emperor napoleon the first  therein the learned and witty archbishop proved as early as 1819 by fair use of the criticism of mr hume and the sceptic school that the whole history of the great napoleon ought to be treated by wise men as a myth and a romance that there is little or no evidence of his having existed at all and that the story of his strange successes and strange defeats was probably invented by our government in order to pander to the vanity of the english nation  i will say this which archbishop whately in a late edition foreshadows wittily enoughthat if one or two thousand years hence when the history of the late emperor napoleon the third his rise and fall shall come to be subjected to critical analysis by future philistine historians of new zealand or australia it will be proved by them to be utterly mythical incredible monstrousand that all the more the more the actual facts remain to puzzle their unimaginative brains  what will they make two thousand years hence of the landing at boulogne with the tame eagle  will not that and stranger facts still but just as true be relegated to the region of myth with the dream of astyages and the young and princely herdsman playing at king over his fellowslaves  but enough of this  to me these bits of romance often seem the truest as well as the most important portions of history  when old herodotus tells me how king astyages having guarded the frontier harpagus sent a hunter to young cyrus with a freshkilled hare telling him to open it in private and how sewn up in it was the letter telling him that the time to rebel was come i am inclined to say that must be true  it is so beneath the dignity of history so quaint and unexpected that it is all the more likely not to have been invented  so with that other storyhow young cyrus giving out that his grandfather had made him general of the persians summoned them all each man with a sickle in his hand into a prairie full of thorns and bade them clear it in one day and how when they like loyal men had finished he bade them bathe and next day he took them into a great meadow and feasted them with corn and wine and all that his fathers farm would yield and asked them which day they liked best and when they answered as was to be expected how he opened his parable and told them choose then to work for the persians like slaves or to be free with me  such a tale sounds to me true  it has the very savour of the parables of the old testament as have surely the dreams of the old sultan with which the tale begins  do they not put us in mind of the dreams of nebuchadnezzar in the book of daniel  such stories are actually so beautiful that they are very likely to be true  understand me i only say likely the ditchwater view of history is not all wrong  its advocates are right in saying great historic changes are not produced simply by one great person by one remarkable event  they have been preparing perhaps for centuries  they are the result of numberless forces acting according to laws which might have been foreseen and will be foreseen when the science of history is more perfectly understood  for instance cyrus could not have conquered the median empire at a single blow if first that empire had not been utterly rotten and next if he and his handful of persians had not been tempered and sharpened by long hardihood to the finest cutting edge  yes there were all the materials for the catastrophethe cannon the powder the shot  but to say that the persians must have conquered the medes even if cyrus had never lived is to say as too many philosophers seem to me to say that given cannon powder and shot it will fire itself off some day if we only leave it alone long enough  it may be so  but our usual experience of nature and fact is that spontaneous combustion is a rare and exceptional phenomenon that if a cannon is to be fired someone must arise and pull the trigger  and i believe that in society and politics when a great event is ready to be done someone must come and do itdo it perhaps half unwittingly by some single rash actlike that first fatal shot fired by an electric spark  but to return to cyrus and his persians  i know not whether the cyropaedia is much read in your schools and universities  but it is one of the books which i should like to see either in a translation or its own exquisite greek in the hands of every young man  it is not all fact  it is but a historic romance  but it is better than history  it is an ideal book like sidneys arcadia or spensers fairy queenthe ideal selfeducation of an ideal hero  and the moral of the bookponder it well all young men who have the chance or the hope of exercising authority among your followmenthe noble and most christian moral of that heathen book is this that the path to solid and beneficent influence over our fellowmen lies not through brute force not through cupidity but through the highest morality through justice truthfulness humanity selfdenial modesty courtesy and all which makes man or woman lovely in the eyes of mortals or of god  yes the cyropaedia is a noble book about a noble personage  but i cannot forget that there are nobler words by far concerning that same noble personage in the magnificent series of hebrew lyrics which begins comfort ye comfort ye my people saith the lordin which the inspired poet watching the rise of cyrus and his puritans and the fall of babylon and the idolatries of the east and the coming deliverance of his own countrymen speaks of the persian hero in words so grand that they have been often enough applied and with all fitness to one greater than cyrus and than all men     who raised up the righteous man from the east    and called him to attend his steps    who subdued nations at his presence    and gave him dominion over kings    and made them like the dust before his sword    and the driven stubble before his bow    he pursueth them he passeth in safety    by a way never trodden before by his feet    who hath performed and made these things    calling the generations from the beginning    i jehovah the first and the last i am the same     behold my servant whom i will uphold    my chosen in whom my soul delighteth    i will make my spirit rest upon him    and he shall publish judgment to the nations    he shall not cry aloud nor clamour    nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets    the bruised reed he shall not break    and the smoking flax he shall not quench    he shall publish justice and establish it    his force shall not be abated nor broken    until he has firmly seated justice in the earth    and the distant nations shall wait for his law    thus saith the god even jehovah    who created the heavens and stretched them out    who spread abroad the earth and its produce    i jehovah have called thee for a righteous end    and i will take hold of thy hand and preserve thee    and i will give thee for a covenant to the people    and for a light to the nations    to open the eyes of the blind    to bring the captives out of prison    and from the dungeon those who dwell in darkness    i am jehovahthat is my name    and my glory will i not give to another    nor my praise to the graven idols     who saith to cyrusthou art my shepherd    and he shall fulfil all my pleasure    who saith to jerusalemthou shalt be built    and to the templethou shalt be founded    thus saith jehovah to his anointed    to cyrus whom i hold fast by his right hand    that i may subdue nations under him    and loose the loins of kings    that i may open before him the twoleaved doors    and the gates shall not be shut    i will go before thee    and bring the mountains low    the gates of brass will i break in sunder    and the bars of iron hew down    and i will give thee the treasures of darkness    and the hoards hid deep in secret places    that thou mayest know that i am jehovah    i have surnamed thee though thou knowest not me    i am jehovah and none else    beside me there is no god    i will gird thee though thou hast not known me    that they may know from the rising of the sun    and from the west that there is none beside me    i am jehovah and none else    forming light and creating darkness    forming peace and creating evil    i jehovah make all these  this is the hebrew prophets conception of the great puritan of the old world who went forth with such a commission as this to destroy the idols of the east while     the isles saw that and feared    and the ends of the earth were afraid    they drew near they came together    everyone helped his neighbour    and said to his brother be of good courage     the carver encouraged the smith    he that smoothed with the hammer    him that smote on the anvil    saying of the solder it is good    and fixing the idol with nails lest it be moved  but all in vain for as the poet goes on     bel bowed down and nebo stooped    their idols were upon the cattle    a burden to the weary beast    they stoop they bow down together    they could not deliver their own charge    themselves are gone into captivity  and what to return what was the end of the great cyrus and of his empire  alas alas as with all human glory the end was not as the beginning  we are scarce bound to believe positively the story how cyrus made one war too many and was cut off in the scythian deserts falling before the arrows of mere savages and how their queen tomyris poured blood down the throat of the dead corpse with the words glut thyself with the gore for which thou hast thirsted  but it may be truefor xenophon states it expressly and with detailthat cyrus from the very time of his triumph became an eastern despot a sultan or a shah living apart from his people in mysterious splendour in the vast fortified palace which he built for himself and imitating and causing his nobles and satraps to imitate in all but vice and effeminacy the very medes whom he had conquered  and of this there is no doubtthat his sons and their empire ran rapidly through that same vicious circle of corruption to which all despotisms are doomed and became within 250 years even as the medes the chaldeans the lydians whom they had conquered children no longer of ahura mazda but of ahriman of darkness and not of light to be conquered by alexander and his greeks even more rapidly and more shamefully than they had conquered the east  this is the short epic of the persian empire ending alas as all human epics are wont to end sadly if not shamefully  but let me ask you did i say too much when i said that to these persians we owe that we are here tonight  i do not say that without them we should not have been here  god i presume when he is minded to do anything has more than one way of doing it  but that we are now the last link in a chain of causes and effects which reaches as far back as the emigration of the persians southward from the plateau of pamir we cannot doubt  for see  by the fall of babylon and its empire the jews were freed from their captivitylarge numbers of them at leastand sent home to their own jerusalem  what motives prompted cyrus and darius after him to do that deed  those who like to impute the lowest motives may say if they will that daniel and the later isaiah found it politic to worship the rising sun and flatter the persian conquerors and that cyrus and darius in turn were glad to see jerusalem rebuilt as an impregnable frontier fortress between them and egypt  be it so i who wish to talk of things noble pure lovely and of good report would rather point you once more to the magnificent poetry of the later isaiah which commences at the 40th chapter of the book of isaiah and saythere upon the very face of the document stands written the fact that the sympathy between the faithful persian and the faithful jewthe two puritans of the old world the two haters of lies idolatries superstitions was actually as intense as it ought to have been as it must have been  be that as it may the return of the jews to jerusalem preserved for us the old testament while it restored to them a national centre a sacred city like that of delphi to the greeks rome to the romans mecca to the muslim loyalty to which prevented their being utterly absorbed by the more civilised eastern races among whom they had been scattered abroad as colonies of captives  then another and a seemingly needful link of cause and effect ensued alexander of macedon destroyed the persian empire and the east became greek and alexandria rather than jerusalem became the headquarters of jewish learning  but for that very cause the scriptures were not left inaccessible to the mass of mankind like the old pehlevi liturgies of the zendavesta or the old sanscrit vedas in an obsolete and hieratic tongue but were translated into and continued in the then all but worldwide hellenic speech which was to the ancient world what french is to the modern  then the east became roman without losing its greek speech  and under the wide domination of that later roman empirewhich had subdued and organised the whole known world save the parthian descendants of those old persians and our old teutonic forefathers in their german forests and on their scandinavian shoresthat divine book was carried far and wide east and west and south from the heart of abyssinia to the mountains of armenia and to the isles of the ocean beyond britain itself to ireland and to the hebrides  and that bookso strangely coinciding with the old creed of the earlier persiansthat book long misunderstood long overlain by the dust and overgrown by the parasitic fungi of centuries that book it was which sent to these transatlantic shores the founders of your great nation that book gave them their instinct of freedom tempered by reverence for law  that book gave them their hatred of idolatry and made them not only say but act upon their own words with these old persians and with the jewish prophets alike sacrifice and burnt offering thou wouldst not then said we lo we come  in the volume of the book it is written of us that we come to do thy will o god  yes long and fantastic is the chain of causes and effects which links you here to the old heroes who came down from central asia because the land had grown so wondrous cold that there were ten months of winter to two of summer and when simply after warmth and life and food for them and for their flocks they wandered forth to found and help to found a spiritual kingdom  and even in their migration far back in these dim and mystic ages have we found the earliest link of the long chain  not so  what if the legend of the change of climate be the dim recollection of an enormous physical fact  what if it and the gradual depopulation of the whole north of asia be owing as geologists now suspect to the slow and age long uprise of the whole of siberia thrusting the warm arctic sea farther and farther to the northward and placing between it and the highlands of thibet an everincreasing breadth of icy land destroying animals and driving whole races southward in search of the summer and the sun  what if the first link in the chain as yet conceivable by man should be the cosmic changes in the distribution of land and water which filled the mouths of the siberian rivers with frozen carcases of woolly mammoth and rhinoceros and those again doubt it not of other revolutions reaching back and back and on and on into the infinite unknown  why not  for so are all human destinies     bound with gold chains unto the throne of god     ancient civilisation 5 6   there is a theory abroad in the world just now about the origin of the human race which has so many patent and powerful physiological facts to support it that we must not lightly say that it is absurd or impossible and that is that mans mortal body and brain were derived from some animal and apelike creature  of that i am not going to speak now  my subject is how this creature called man from whatever source derived became civilised rational and moral  and i am sorry to say that there is tacked on by many to the first theory another which does not follow from it and which has really nothing to do with it and it is this that man with all his wonderful and mysterious aspirations always unfulfilled yet always precious at once his torment and his joy his very hope of everlasting life that man i say developed himself unassisted out of a state of primaeval brutishness simply by calculations of pleasure and pain by observing what actions would pay in the long run and what would not and so learnt to conquer his selfishness by a more refined and extended selfishness and exchanged his brutality for worldliness and then in a few instances his worldliness for next worldliness  i hope i need not say that i do not believe this theory  if i did i could not be a christian i think nor a philosopher either  at least if i thought that human civilisation had sprung from such a dunghill as that i should in honour to my race say nothing about it here or elsewhere  why talk of the shame of our ancestors  i want to talk of their honour and glory  i want to talk if i talk at all about great times about noble epochs noble movements noble deeds and noble folk about times in which the human raceit may be through many mistakes alas and sin and sorrow and bloodshedstruggled up one step higher on those great stairs which as we hope lead upward towards the faroff city of god the perfect polity the perfect civilisation the perfect religion which is eternal in the heavens  of great men then and noble deeds i want to speak  i am bound to do so first in courtesy to my hearers  for in choosing such a subject i took for granted a nobleness and greatness of mind in them which can appreciate and enjoy the contemplation of that which is lofty and heroic and that which is useful indeed though not to the purses merely or the mouths of men but to their intellects and spirits that highest philosophy which though she can as has been sneeringly said of her bake no bread sheand she alone can at least do thismake men worthy to eat the bread which god has given them  i am bound to speak on such subjects because i have never yet met or read of the human company who did not require now and then at least being reminded of such times and such personagesof whatsoever things are just pure true lovely and of good report if there be any manhood and any praise to think as st paul bids us all of such things that we may keep up in our minds as much as possible a lofty standard a pure ideal instead of sinking to the mere selfish standard which judges all things even those of the world to come by profit and by loss and into that sordid frame of mind in which a man grows to believe that the world is constructed of bricks and timber and kept going by the price of stocks  we are all tempted and the easier and more prosperous we are the more we are tempted to fall into that sordid and shallow frame of mind sordid even when its projects are most daring its outward luxuries most refined and shallow even when most acute when priding itself most on its knowledge of human nature and of the secret springs which so it dreams move the actions and make the history of nations and of men  all are tempted that way even the noblesthearted  adhaesit pavimento venter says the old psalmist  i am growing like the snake crawling in the dust and eating the dust in which i crawl  i try to lift up my eyes to the heavens to the true the beautiful the good the eternal nobleness which was before all time and shall be still when time has passed away  but to lift up myself is what i cannot do  who will help me  who will quicken me as our old english tongue has it  who will give me life  the true pure lofty human life which i did not inherit from the primaeval ape which the apenature in me is for ever trying to stifle and make me that which i know too well i could so easily becomea cunninger and more daintyfeatured brute  death itself which seems at times so fair is fair because even it may raise me up and deliver me from the burden of this animal and mortal body     tis life not death for which i pant    tis life whereof my nerves are scant    more life and fuller that i want  man  i am a man not by reason of my bones and muscles nerves and brain which i have in common with apes and dogs and horses  i am a manthou art a man or womannot because we have a fleshgod forbid but because there is a spirit in us a divine spark and ray which nature did not give and which nature cannot take away  and therefore while i live on earth i will live to the spirit not to the flesh that i may be indeed a man and this same gross flesh this animal apenature in me shall be the very element in me which i will renounce defy despise at least if i am minded to be not a merely higher savage but a truly higher civilised man  civilisation with me shall mean not more wealth more finery more selfindulgenceeven more aesthetic and artistic luxury but more virtue more knowledge more selfcontrol even though i earn scanty bread by heavy toil and when i compare the caesar of rome or the great king whether of egypt babylon or persia with the hermit of the thebaid starving in his frock of camels hair with his soul fixed on the ineffable glories of the unseen and striving however wildly and fantastically to become an angel and not an ape i will say the hermit and not the caesar is the civilised man  there are plenty of histories of civilisation and theories of civilisation abroad in the world just now and which profess to show you how the primeval savage has or at least may have become the civilised man  for my part with all due and careful consideration i confess i attach very little value to any of them and for this simple reason that we have no facts  the facts are lost  of course if you assume a proposition as certainly true it is easy enough to prove that proposition to be true at least to your own satisfaction  if you assert with the old proverb that you may make a silk purse out of a sows ear you will be stupider than i dare suppose anyone here to be if you cannot invent for yourselves all the intermediate stages of the transformation however startling  and indeed if modern philosophers had stuck more closely to this old proverb and its defining verb make and tried to show how some person or personslet them be who they maymen angels or godsmade the sows ear into the silk purse and the savage into the sagethey might have pleaded that they were still trying to keep their feet upon the firm ground of actual experience  but while their theory is that the sows ear grew into a silk purse of itself and yet unconsciously and without any intention of so bettering itself in life why i think that those who have studied the history which lies behind them and the poor human nature which is struggling and sinning and sorrowing and failing around them and which seems on the greater part of this planet going downwards and not upwards and by no means bettering itself save in the increase of operahouses liquorbars and gamblingtables and that which pertaineth thereto then we i think may be excused if we say with the old stoicsgreek texti withhold my judgment  i know nothing about the matter yet and you oh my imaginative though learned friends know i suspect very little either     eldest of things divine equality  so sang poor shelley and with a certain truth  for if as i believe the human race sprang from a single pair there must have been among their individual descendants an equality far greater than any which has been known on earth during historic times  but that equality was at best the infantile innocence of the primary race which faded away in the race as quickly alas as it does in the individual child  divinetherefore it was one of the first blessings which man lost one of the last i fear to which he will return that to which civilisation even at its best yet known has not yet attained save here and there for short periods but towards which it is striving as an ideal goal and as i trust not in vain  the eldest of things which we see actually as history is not equality but an already developed hideous inequality trying to perpetuate itself and yet by a most divine and gracious law destroying itself by the very means which it uses to keep itself alive  there were giants in the earth in those days  and nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth     a mighty hunter and his game was man  no it is not equality which we see through the dim mist of bygone ages  what we do see isi know not whether you will think me superstitious or oldfashioned but so i holdvery much what the earlier books of the bible show us under symbolic laws  greek histories roman histories egyptian histories eastern histories inscriptions national epics legends fragments of legendsin the new world as in the oldall tell the same story  not the story without an end but the story without a beginning  as in the hindoo cosmogony the world stands on an elephant and the elephant on a tortoise and the tortoise onwhat  no man knows i do not know  i only assert deliberately waiting as napoleon says till the world come round to me that the tortoise does not standas is held by certain anthropologists some honoured by me some personally dear to meupon the savages who chipped flints and fed on mammoth and reindeer in northwestern europe shortly after the age of ice a few hundred thousand years ago  these sturdy little fellowsthe kinsmen probably of the esquimaux and lappscould have been but the avantcouriers or more probably the fugitives from the true mass of mankindspreading northward from the tropics into climes becoming after the long catastrophe of the age of ice once more genial enough to support men who knew what decent comfort was and were strong enough to get the same by all means fair or foul  no  the tortoise of the human race does not stand on a savage  the savage may stand on an apelike creature  i do not say that he does not  i do not say that he does  i do not know and no man knows  but at least i say that the civilised man and his world stand not upon creatures like to any savage now known upon the earth  for first it seems to be most unlikely and next and more important to an inductive philosopher there is no proof of it  i see no savages becoming really civilised menthat is not merely men who will ape the outside of our socalled civilisation even absorb a few of our ideas not merely that but truly civilised men who will think for themselves invent for themselves act for themselves and when the sacred lamp of light and truth has been passed into their hands carry it on unextinguished and transmit it to their successors without running back every moment to get it relighted by those from whom they received it and who are boundremember thatpatiently and lovingly to relight it for them to give freely to all their fellowmen of that which god has given to them and to their ancestors and let god not man be judge of how much the red indian or the polynesian the caffre or the chinese is capable of receiving and of using  moreover in history there is no record absolutely no record as far as i am aware of any savage tribe civilising itself  it is a bold saying i stand by my assertion most happy to find myself confuted even in a single instance for my being wrong would give me what i can have no objection to possess a higher opinion than i have now of the unassisted capabilities of my fellowmen  but civilisation must have begun somewhen somewhere with some person or some family or some nation and how did it begin  i have said already that i do not know  but i have had my dreamlike the philosopherand as i have not been ashamed to tell it elsewhere i shall not be ashamed to tell it here  and it is this  what if the beginnings of true civilisation in this unique abnormal diseased unsatisfied incomprehensible and truly miraculous and supernatural race we call man had been literally and in actual fact miraculous and supernatural likewise  what if that be the true key to the mystery of humanity and its origin  what if the few first chapters of the most ancient and most sacred book should point under whatever symbols to the actual and the only possible origin of civilisation the education of a man or a family by beings of some higher race than man what if the old puritan doctrine of election should be even of a deeper and wider application than divines have been wont to think  what if individuals if peoples have been chosen out from time to time for a special illumination that they might be the lights of the earth and the salt of the world  what if they have each in their turn abused that divine teaching to make themselves the tyrants instead of the ministers of the less enlightened  to increase the inequalities of nature by their own selfishness instead of decreasing them into the equality of grace by their own selfsacrifice  what if the bible after all was right and even more right than we were taught to think  so runs my dream  if after i have confessed to it you think me still worth listening to in this enlightened nineteenth century i will go on  at all events what we see at the beginning of all known and halfknown history is not savagery but high civilisation at least of an outward and material kind  do you demur  then recollect i pray you that the three oldest peoples known to history on this planet are egypt china hindostan  the first glimpses of the world are always like those which the book of genesis gives us like those which your own continent gives us  as it was 400 years ago in america so it was in north africa and in asia 4000 years ago or 40000 for aught i know  nay if anyone should askand why not 400000 years ago on miocene continents long sunk beneath the tropic sea  i for one have no rejoinder savewe have no proofs as yet  there loom up out of the darkness of legend into the as yet dim dawn of history what the old arabs call races of preadamite sultanscolossal monarchies with fixed and often elaborate laws customs creeds with aristocracies priesthoodsseemingly always of a superior and conquering race with a mass of common folk whether free or halffree composed of older conquered races of imported slaves too and their descendants  but whence comes the royal race the aristocracy the priesthood  you inquire and you find that they usually know not themselves  they are usuallyi had almost dared to say alwaysforeigners  they have crossed the neighbouring mountains  the have come by sea like dido to carthage like manco cassae and mama belle to america and they have sometimes forgotten when  at least they are wiser stronger fairer than the aborigines  they are to themas jacques cartier was to the indians of canadaas gods  they are not sure that they are not descended from gods  they are the children of the sun or what not  the children of light who ray out such light as they have upon the darkness of their subjects  they are at first probably civilisers not conquerors  for if tradition is worth anythingand we have nothing else to go uponthey are at first few in number  they come as settlers or even as single sages  it is in all tradition not the many who influence the few but the few who influence the many  so aristocracies in the true sense are formed  but the higher calling is soon forgotten  the purer light is soon darkened in pride and selfishness luxury and lust as in genesis the sons of god see the daughters of men that they are fair and they take them wives of all that they choose  and so a mixed race springs up and increases without detriment at first to the commonwealth  for by a wellknown law of heredity the cross between two races probably far apart produces at first a progeny possessing the forces and alas probably the vices of both  and when the sons of god go in to the daughters of men there are giants in the earth in those days men of renown  the roman empire remember was never stronger than when the old patrician blood had mingled itself with that of every nation round the mediterranean  but it does not last  selfishness luxury ferocity spread from above as well as from below  the just aristocracy of virtue and wisdom becomes an unjust one of mere power and privilege that again one of mere wealth corrupting and corrupt and is destroyed not by the people from below but by the monarch from above  the hereditary bondsmen may know           who would be free    himself must strike the blow  but they dare not know not how  the king must do it for them  he must become the state  better one tyrant as voltaire said than many better stand in fear of one lion far away than of many wolves each in the nearest wood  and so arise those truly monstrous eastern despotisms of which modern persia is thank god the only remaining specimen for turkey and egypt are too amenable of late years to the influence of the free nations to be counted as despotisms pure and simpledespotisms in which men instead of worshipping a godman worship the hideous counterfeit a mangoda poor human being endowed by public opinion with the powers of deity while he is the slave of all the weaknesses of humanity  but such as an historic fact has been the last stage of every civilisationeven that of rome which ripened itself upon this earth the last in ancient times and i had almost said until this very day except among the men who speak teutonic tongues and who have preserved through all temptations and reasserted through all dangers the free ideas which have been our sacred heritage ever since tacitus beheld us with respect and awe among our german forests and saw in us the future masters of the roman empire  yes it is very sad the past history of mankind  but shall we despise those who went before us and on whose accumulated labours we now stand  shall we not reverence our spiritual ancestors  shall we not show our reverence by copying them at least whenever as in those old persians we see in them manliness and truthfulness hatred of idolatries and devotion to the god of light and life and good  and shall we not feel pity instead of contempt for their ruder forms of government their ignorances excesses failuresso excusable in men who with little or no previous teaching were trying to solve for themselves for the first time the deepest social and political problems of humanity  yes those old despotisms we trust are dead and never to revive  but their corpses are the corpses not of our enemies but of our friends and predecessors slain in the worldold fight of ormuzd against ahrimanlight against darkness order against disorder  confusedly they fought and sometimes ill but their corpses piled the breach and filled the trench for us and over their corpses we step on to what should be to us an easy victorywhat may be to us yet a shameful ruin  for if we be as we are wont to boast the salt of the earth and the light of the world what if the salt should lose its savour  what if the light which is in us should become darkness  for myself when i look upon the responsibilities of the free nations of modern times so far from boasting of that liberty in which i delightand to keep which i freely too could diei rather say in fear and trembling god help us on whom he has laid so heavy a burden as to make us free responsible each individual of us not only to ourselves but to him and all mankind for if we fall we shall fall i know not whither and i dare not think  how those old despotisms the mighty empires of old time fell we know and we can easily explain  corrupt luxurious effeminate eaten out by universal selfishness and mutual fear they had at last no organic coherence  the moral anarchy within showed through at last burst through the painted skin of prescriptive order which held them together some braver and abler and usually more virtuous people often some little hardy homely mountain tribe saw that the fruit was ripe for gathering and caring naught for superior numbersand saying with german alaric when the romans boasted of their numbers the thicker the hay the easier it is mowedstruck one brave blow at the huge inflated windbagas cyrus and his handful of persians struck at the medes as alexander and his handful of greeks struck afterwards at the persiansand behold it collapsed upon the spot  and then the victors took the place of the conquered and became in their turn an aristocracy and then a despotism and in their turn rotted down and perished  and so the vicious circle repeated itself age after age from egypt and assyria to mexico and peru  and therefore we free peoples as we are have need to watch and sternly watch ourselves  equality of some kind or other is as i said our natural and seemingly inevitable goal  but which equality  for there are twoa true one and a false a noble and a base a healthful and a ruinous  there is the truly divine equality and there is the brute equality of sheep and oxen and of flies and worms  there is the equality which is founded on mutual envy  the equality which respects others and the equality which asserts itself  the equality which longs to raise all alike and the equality which desires to pull down all alike  the equality which says thou art as good as i and it may be better too in the sight of god  and the equality which says i am as good as thou and will therefore see if i cannot master thee  side by side in the heart of every free man and every free people are the two instincts struggling for the mastery called by the same name but bearing the same relation to each other as marsyas to apollo the satyr to the god  marsyas and apollo the base and the noble are as in the old greek legend contending for the prize  and the prize is no less a one than all free people of this planet  in proportion as that nobler idea conquers and men unite in the equality of mutual respect and mutual service they move one step farther towards realising on earth that kingdom of god of which it is written the despots of the nations exercise dominion over them and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors  but he that will be great among you let him be the servant of all  and in proportion as that base idea conquers and selfishness not self sacrifice is the ruling spirit of a state men move on one step forward towards realising that kingdom of the devil upon earth every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost  only alas in that evil equality of envy and hate there is no hindmost and the devil takes them all alike  and so is a period of discontent revolution internecine anarchy followed by a tyranny endured as in old rome by men once free because tyranny will at least do for them what they were too lazy and greedy and envious to do for themselves     and all because they have forgot    what tis to be a manto curb and spurn    the tyrant in us the ignobler self    which boasts not loathes its likeness to the brute    and owns no good save ease no ill save pain    no purpose save its share in that wild war    in which through countless ages living things    compete in internecine greed  ah loving god    are we as creeping things which have no lord    that we are brutes great god we know too well    apes daintierfeatured silly birds who flaunt    their plumes unheeding of the fowlers step    spiders who catch with paper not with webs    tigers who slay with cannon and sharp steel    instead of teeth and clawsall these we are    are we no more than these save in degree    mere fools of nature puppets of strong lusts    taking the sword to perish by the sword    upon the universal battlefield    even as the things upon the moor outside        the heath eats up green grass and delicate herbs    the pines eat up the heath the grub the pine    the finch the grub the hawk the silly finch    and man the mightiest of all beasts of prey    eats what he lists  the strong eat up the weak    the many eat the few great nations small    and he who cometh in the name of all    shall greediest triumph by the greed of all    and armed by his own victims eat up all    while ever out of the eternal heavens    looks patient down the great magnanimous god    who master of all worlds did sacrifice    all to himself  nay but himself to all    who taught mankind on that first christmas day    what tis to be a manto give not take    to serve not rule to nourish not devour    to lift not crush if need to die not live  he that cometh in the name of allthe popular military despotthe saviour of his countryhe is our internecine enemy on both sides of the atlantic whenever he risesthe inaugurator of that imperialism that caesarism into which rome sank when not her liberties merely but her virtues were decaying out of herthe sink into which all wicked states whether republics or monarchies are sure to fall simply because men must eat and drink for tomorrow they die  the military and bureaucratic despotism which keeps the many quiet as in old rome by panem et circensesbread and gamesor if need be pilgrimages that the few may make money eat drink and be merry as long as it can last that let it ape as it mayas did the caesars of old rome at firstas another emperor did even in our own daysthe forms of dead freedom really upholds an artificial luxury by brute force and consecrates the basest of all aristocracies the aristocracy of the moneybag by the divine sanction of the bayonet  that at all risks even at the price of precious blood the free peoples of the earth must ward off from them for makeshift and stopgap as it is it does not even succeed in what it tries to do  it does not last have we not seen that it does not cannot last  how can it last  this falsehood like all falsehoods must collapse at one touch of ithuriels spear of truth and fact  and  then saw i the end of these men  namely how thou dost set them in slippery places and casteth them down  suddenly do they perish and come to a fearful end  yea like as a dream when one awaketh so shalt thou make their image to vanish out of the city  have we not seen that too though thank god neither in england nor in the united states  and then  what then  none knows and none can know  the future of france and spain the future of the tropical republics of spanish america is utterly blank and dark not to be prophesied i hold by mortal man simply because we have no like cases in the history of the past whereby to judge the tendencies of the present  will they revive under the genial influences of free institutions will the good seed which is in them take root downwards and bear fruit upwards and make them all what that fair france has been in spite of all her faults so often in past yearsa joy and an inspiration to all the nations round  shall it be thus  god grant it may but he and he alone can tell  we only stand by watching if we be wise with pity and with fear the working out of a tremendous new social problem which must affect the future of the whole civilised world  for if the agonising old nations fail to regenerate themselves what can befall  what when even imperialism has been tried and failed as fail it must  what but that lower depth within the lowest deep           that last dread mood    of sated lust and dull decrepitude    no law no art no faith no hope no god    when round the freezing founts of life in peevish ring    crouched on the bareworn sod    babbling about the unreturning spring    and whining for dead creeds which cannot save    the toothless nations shiver to their grave  and we who think we stand let us take heed lest we fall  let us accept in modesty and in awe the responsibility of our freedom and remember that that freedom can be preserved only in one oldfashioned way  let us remember that the one condition of a true democracy is the same as the one condition of a true aristocracy namely virtue  let us teach our children as grand old lilly taught our forefathers 300 years agoit is virtue gentlemen yea virtue that maketh gentlemen that maketh the poor rich the subject a king the lowborn noble the deformed beautiful  these things neither the whirling wheel of fortune can overturn nor the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate neither sickness abate nor age abolish  yes  let us teach our children thus on both sides of the atlantic  for if theywhich god forbidshould grow corrupt and weak by their own sins there is no hardier race now left on earth to conquer our descendants and bring them back to reason as those old jews were brought by bitter shame and woe  and all that is before them and the whole civilised world would be long centuries of anarchy such as the world has not seen for agesa true ragnarok a twilight of the very gods an age such as the wise woman foretold in the old voluspa     when brethren shall be    each others bane    and sisters sons rend    the ties of kin    hard will be that age    an age of bad women    an axeage a swordage    shields oft cleft in twain    a stormage a wolfage    ere earth meet its doom  so sang 2000 years ago perhaps the great unnamed prophetess of our own race of what might be if we should fail mankind and our own calling and election  god grant that day may never come  but god grant also that if that day does come then may come true also what that wise vala sang of the day when gods and men and earth should be burnt up with fire     when slaked surturs flame is    still the man and the maiden    hight valour and life    shall keep themselves hid    in the wood of remembrance    the dew of the dawning    for food it shall serve them    from them spring new peoples  new peoples  for after all is said the ideal form of human society is democracy  a nationand were it even possible a whole worldof free men lifting free foreheads to god and nature calling no man masterfor one is their master even god knowing and obeying their duties towards the maker of the universe and therefore to each other and that not from fear nor calculation of profit or loss but because they loved and liked it and had seen the beauty of righteousness and trust and peace because the law of god was in their hearts and needing at last it may be neither king nor priest for each man and each woman in their place were kings and priests to god  such a nationsuch a societywhat nobler conception of mortal existence can we form  would not that be indeed the kingdom of god come on earth  and tell me not that that is impossibletoo fair a dream to be ever realised  all that makes it impossible is the selfishness passions weaknesses of those who would be blest were they masters of themselves and therefore of circumstances who are miserable because not being masters of themselves they try to master circumstance to pull down iron walls with weak and clumsy hands and forget that he who would be free from tyrants must first be free from his worst tyrant self  but tell me not that the dream is impossible  it is so beautiful that it must be true  if not now nor centuries hence yet still hereafter  god would never as i hold have inspired man with that rich imagination had he not meant to translate some day that imagination into fact  the very greatness of the idea beyond what a single mind or generation can grasp will ensure failure on failurefollies fanaticisms disappointments even crimes bloodshed hasty furies as of children baulked of their holiday  but it will be at last fulfilled filled full and perfected not perhaps here or among our peoples or any people which now exist on earth but in some future civilisationit may be in far lands beyond the seawhen all that you and we have made and done shall be as the forestgrown mounds of the old nameless civilisers of the mississippi valley     rondelet 7 the huguenot naturalist 8   apollo god of medicine exiled from the rest of the earth was straying once across

mixture of the sacred and the profane  the theses which were sustained there began by an invocation to god the blessed virgin and st luke and ended by these words this thesis will be sustained in the sacred temple of apollo  but however extravagant chancellor fanchons praises of his native city may seem they are really not exaggerated  the narbonnaise or languedoc is perhaps the most charming district of charming france  in the far northeast gleam the white alps in the far southwest the white pyrenees and from the purple glens and yellow downs of the cevennes on the northwest the herault slopes gently down towards the etangs or great saltwater lagoons and the vast alluvial flats of the camargue the field of caius marius where still run herds of halfwild horses descended from some ancient roman stock while beyond all glitters the blue mediterranean  the great almond orchards each one sheet of rose colour in spring the mulberry orchards the oliveyards the vineyards cover every foot of available upland soil save where the rugged and arid downs are sweet with a thousand odoriferous plants from which the bees extract the famous white honey of narbonne  the native flowers and shrubs of a beauty and richness rather eastern than european have made the flora montpeliensis and with it the names of rondelet and his disciples famous among botanists and the strange fish and shells upon its shores afforded rondelet materials for his immortal work upon the animals of the sea  the innumerable wild fowl of the benches du rhone the innumerable songsters and other birds of passage many of them unknown in these islands and even in the north of france itself which haunt every copse of willow and aspen along the brooksides the gaudy and curious insects which thrive beneath that clear fierce and yet bracing sunlight all these have made the district of montpellier a home prepared by nature for those who study and revere her  neither was chancellor fanchon misled by patriotism when he said the pleasant people who inhabit that district are fit for all the labours of the intellect  they are a very mixed race and like most mixed races quickwitted and handsome also  there is probably much roman blood among them especially in the towns for languedoc or gallia narbonnensis as it was called of old was said to be more roman than rome itself  the roman remains are more perfect and more interestingso the late dr whewell used to saythan any to be seen now in italy and the old capital narbonne itself was a complete museum of roman antiquities ere francis i destroyed it in order to fortify the city upon a modern system against the invading armies of charles v  there must be much visigothic blood likewise in languedoc for the visigothic kings held their courts there from the fifth century until the time that they were crushed by the invading moors  spanish blood likewise there may be for much of languedoc was held in the early middle age by those descendants of eudes of aquitaine who established themselves as kings of majorca and arragon and languedoc did not become entirely french till 1349 when philip le bel bought montpellier of those potentates  the moors too may have left some traces of their race behind  they held the country from about ad 713 to 758 when they were finally expelled by charles martel and eudes  one sees to this day their towers of meagre stonework perched on the grand roman masonry of those old amphitheatres which they turned into fortresses  one may see tooso tradition holdsupon those very amphitheatres the stains of the fires with which charles martel smoked them out and one may see too or fancy that one sees in the aquiline features the bright black eyes the lithe and graceful gestures which are so common in languedoc some touch of the old mahommedan race which passed like a flood over that christian land  whether or not the moors left behind any traces of their blood they left behind at least traces of their learning for the university of montpellier claimed to have been founded by moors at a date of altogether abysmal antiquity  they looked upon the arabian physicians of the middle age on avicenna and averrhoes as modern innovators and derived their parentage from certain mythic doctors of cordova who when the moors were expelled from spain in the eighth century fled to montpellier bringing with them traditions of that primaeval science which had been revealed to adam while still in paradise and founded montpellier the mother of all the universities in europe  nay some went farther still and told of bengessaus and ferragius the physicians of charlemagne and of marilephus chief physician of king chilperic and evenif a letter of st bernards was to be believedof a certain bishop who went as early as the second century to consult the doctors of montpellier and it would have been in vain to reply to them that in those days and long after them montpellier was not yet built  the facts are said to be that as early as the beginning of the thirteenth century montpellier had its schools of law medicine and arts which were erected into a university by pope nicholas iv in 1289  the university of montpellier likei believemost foreign ones resembled more a scotch than an english university  the students lived for the most part not in colleges but in private lodgings and constituted a republic of their own ruled by an abbe of the scholars one of themselves chosen by universal suffrage  a terror they were often to the respectable burghers for they had all the right to carry arms and a plague likewise for if they ran in debt their creditors were forbidden to seize their books which with their swords were generally all the property they possessed  if moreover anyone set up a noisy or unpleasant trade near their lodgings the scholars could compel the town authorities to turn him out  they were most of them probably mere boys of from twelve to twenty living poorly working hard andthose at least of them who were in the collegescruelly beaten daily after the fashion of those times but they seem to have comforted themselves under their troubles by a good deal of wild life out of school by rambling into the country on the festivals of the saints and now and then by acting plays notably that famous one which rabelais wrote for them in 1531 the moral comedy of the man who had a dumb wife which joyous patelinage remains unto this day in the shape of a wellknown comic song  that comedy young rondelet must have seen acted  the son of a druggist spicer and grocerthe three trades were then combinedin montpellier and born in 1507 he had been destined for the cloister being a sickly lad  his uncle one of the canons of maguelonne near by had even given him the revenues of a small chapela job of nepotism which was common enough in those days  but his heart was in science and medicine  he set off still a mere boy to paris to study there and returned to montpellier at the age of eighteen to study again  the next year 1530 while still a scholar himself he was appointed procurator of the scholarsa post which brought him in a small fee on each matriculationand that year he took a fee among others from one of the most remarkable men of that or of any age francois rabelais himself  and what shall i say of himwho stands alone like shakespeare in his generation possessed of colossal learningof all science which could be gathered in his daysof practical and statesmanlike wisdomof knowledge of languages ancient and modern beyond all his compeersof eloquence which when he speaks of pure and noble things becomes heroic and as it were inspiredof scorn for meanness hypocrisy ignoranceof esteem genuine and earnest for the holy scriptures and for the more moderate of the reformers who were spreading the scriptures in europeand all this great light wilfully hidden not under a bushel but under a dunghill  he is somewhat like socrates in face and in character likewise in him as in socrates the demigod and the satyr the man and the ape are struggling for the mastery  in socrates the true man conquers and comes forth high and pure in rabelais alas the victor is the ape while the man himself sinks down in cynicism sensuality practical jokes foul talk  he returns to paris to live an idle luxurious life to diesays the legendsaying i go to seek a great perhaps and to leave behind him little save a school of pantagruelistscareless young gentlemen whose ideal was to laugh at everything to believe in nothing and to gratify their five senses like the brutes which perish  there are those who read his books to make them laugh the wise man when he reads them will be far more inclined to weep  let any young man who may see these words remember that in him as in rabelais the ape and the man are struggling for the mastery  let him take warning by the fate of one who was to him as a giant to a pigmy and think of tennysons words           arise and fly    the reeling faun the sensual feast    strive upwards working out the beast    and let the ape and tiger die  but to return  down among them there at montpellier like a brilliant meteor flashed this wonderful rabelais in the year 1530  he had fled some say for his life  like erasmus he had no mind to be a martyr and he had been terrified at the execution of poor louis de berquin his friend and the friend of erasmus likewise  this louis de berquin a man well known in those days was a gallant young gentleman and scholar holding a place in the court of francis i who had translated into french the works of erasmus luther and melancthon and had asserted that it was heretical to invoke the virgin mary instead of the holy spirit or to call her our hope and our life which titlesberquin averredbelonged alone to god  twice had the doctors of the sorbonne with that terrible persecutor noel beda at their head seized poor berquin and tried to burn his books and him twice had that angel in human form marguerite dangouleme sister of francis i saved him from their clutches but when francistaken prisoner at the battle of paviaat last returned from his captivity in spain the suppression of heresy and the burning of heretics seemed to him and to his mother louise of savoy a thankoffering so acceptable to god that louis berquinwho would not in spite of the entreaties of erasmus purchase his life by silencewas burnt at last on the place de greve being first strangled because he was of gentle blood  montpellier received its famous guest joyfully  rabelais was now forty two years old and a distinguished savant so they excused him his three years undergraduates career and invested him at once with the red gown of the bachelors  that red gownor rather the ragged phantom of itis still shown at montpellier and must be worn by each bachelor when he takes his degree  unfortunately antiquarians assure us that the precious garment has been renewed again and againthe students having clipped bits of it away for relics and clipped as earnestly from the new gowns as their predecessors had done from the authentic original  doubtless the coming of such a man among them to lecture on the aphorisms of hippocrates and the ars parva of galen not from the latin translations then in use but from original greek texts with comments and corrections of his own must have had a great influence on the minds of the montpellier students and still more influenceand that not altogether a good onemust rabelaiss lighter talk have had as he loungedso the story goesin his dressinggown upon the public place picking up quaint stories from the cattledrivers off the cevennes and the villagers who came in to sell their olives and their grapes their vinegar and their vinetwig faggots as they do unto this day  to him may be owing much of the sound respect for natural science and much too of the contempt for the superstition around them which is notable in that group of great naturalists who were boys in montpellier at that day  rabelais seems to have liked rondelet and no wonder he was a cheery lovable honest little fellow very fond of jokes a great musician and player on the violin and who when he grew rich liked nothing so well as to bring into his house any buffoon or strollingplayer to make fun for him  vivacious he was hottempered forgiving and with a power of learning and a power of work which were prodigious even in those hardworking days  rabelais chaffs rondelet under the name of rondibilis for indeed rondelet grew up into a very round fat little man but rabelais puts excellent sense into his mouth cynical enough and too cynical but both learned and humorous and if he laughs at him for being shocked at the offer of a fee and taking it nevertheless kindly enough rondelet is not the first doctor who has done that neither will he be the last  rondelet in his turn put on the red robe of the bachelor and received on taking his degree his due share of fisticuffs from his dearest friends according to the ancient custom of the university of montpellier  he then went off to practise medicine in a village at the foot of the alps and halfstarved to teach little children  then he found he must learn greek went off to paris a second time and alleviated his poverty there somewhat by becoming tutor to a son of the viscomte de turenne  there he met gonthier of andernach who had taught anatomy at louvain to the great vesalius and learned from him to dissect  we next find him setting up as a medical man amid the wild volcanic hills of the auvergne struggling still with poverty like erasmus like george buchanan like almost every great scholar in those days for students then had to wander from place to place generally on foot in search of new teachers in search of books in search of the necessaries of life undergoing such an amount of bodily and mental toil as makes it wonderful that all of them did notas some of them doubtless diddie under the hard training or at best desert the penurious muses for the paternal shop or plough  rondelet got his doctorate in 1537 and next year fell in love with and married a beautiful young girl called jeanne sandre who seems to have been as poor as he  but he had gained meanwhile a powerful patron and the patronage of the great was then as necessary to men of letters as the patronage of the public is now  guillaume pellicier bishop of maguelonneor rather then of montpellier itself whither he had persuaded paul ii to transfer the ancient seewas a model of the literary gentleman of the sixteenth century a savant a diplomat a collector of books and manuscripts greek hebrew and syriac which formed the original nucleus of the present library of the louvre a botanist too who loved to wander with rondelet collecting plants and flowers  he retired from public life to peace and science at montpellier when to the evil days of his master francis i succeeded the still worse days of henry ii and diana of poitiers  that jezebel of france could conceive no more natural or easy way of atoning for her own sins than that of hunting down heretics and feasting her wicked eyesso it is saidupon their dying torments bishop pellicier fell under suspicion of heresy very probably with some justice  he fell too under suspicion of leading a life unworthy of a celibate churchman a fault whichif it really existedwas in those days pardonable enough in an orthodox prelate but not so in one whose orthodoxy was suspected  and for awhile pellicier was in prison  after his release he gave himself up to science with rondelet and the school of disciples who were growing up around him  they rediscovered together the garum that classic sauce whose praises had been sung of old by horace martial and ausonius and so childlike superstitious if you will was the reverence in the sixteenth century for classic antiquity that when pellicier and rondelet discovered that the garum was made from the fish called picarelcalled garon by the fishers of antibes and giroli at venice both these last names corruptions of the latin gerresthen did the two fashionable poets of france etienne dolet and clement marot think it not unworthy of their muse to sing the praises of the sauce which horace had sung of old  a proud day too was it for pellicier and rondelet when wandering somewhere in the marshes of the camargue a scent of garlic caught the nostrils of the gentle bishop and in the lovely pink flowers of the watergermander he recognised the scordium of the ancients  the discovery says professor planchon made almost as much noise as that of the famous garum for at that moment of naive fervour on behalf of antiquity to rediscover a plant of dioscorides or of pliny was a good fortune and almost an event  i know not whether after his death the good bishops bones reposed beneath some gorgeous tomb bedizened with the incongruous halfpagan statues of the renaissance but this at least is certain that rondelets disciples imagined for him a monument more enduring than of marble or of brass more graceful and more curiously wrought than all the sculptures of torrigiano or cellini baccio bandinelli or michael angelo himself for they named a lovely little lilac snapdragon linaria domini pelliceriilord pelliciers toadflax and that name it will keep we may believe as long as winter and summer shall endure  but to return  to this good patronwho was the ambassador at venicethe newlymarried rondelet determined to apply for employment and to venice he would have gone leaving his bride behind had he not been stayed by one of those angels who sometimes walk the earth in womens shape  jeanne sandre had an elder sister catharine who had brought her up  she was married to a wealthy man but she had no children of her own  for four years she and her good husband had let the rondelets lodge with them and now she was a widow and to part with them was more than she could bear she carried rondelet off from the students who were seeing him safe out of the city brought him back settled on him the same day half her fortune and soon after settled on him the whole on the sole condition that she should live with him and her sister  for years afterwards she watched over the pretty young wife and her two girls and three boysthe three boys alas all died youngand over rondelet himself who immersed in books and experiments was utterly careless about money and was to them all a motheradvising guiding managing and regarded by rondelet with genuine gratitude as his guardian angel  honour and good fortune in a worldly sense now poured in upon the druggists son  pellicier his own bishop stood godfather to his first born daughter  montluc bishop of valence and that wise and learned statesman the cardinal of tournon stood godfathers a few years later to his twin boys and what was of still more solid worth to him cardinal tournon took him to antwerp bordeaux bayonne and more than once to rome and in these italian journeys of his he collected many facts for the great work of his life that history of fishes which he dedicated naturally enough to the cardinal  this book with its plates is for the time a masterpiece of accuracy  those who are best acquainted with the subject say that it is up to the present day a key to the whole ichthyology of the mediterranean  two other men belon and salviani were then at work on the same subject and published their books almost at the same time a circumstance which caused as was natural a three cornered duel between the supporters of the three naturalists each party accusing the other of plagiarism  the simple fact seems to be that the almost simultaneous appearance of the three books in 155455 is one of those coincidences inevitable at moments when many minds are stirred in the same direction by the same great thoughtscoincidences which have happened in our own day on questions of geology biology and astronomy and which when the facts have been carefully examined and the first flush of natural jealousy has cooled down have proved only that there were more wise men than one in the world at the same time  and this sixteenth century was an age in which the minds of men were suddenly and strangely turned to examine the wonders of nature with an earnestness with a reverence and therefore with an accuracy with which they had never been investigated before  nature says professor planchon long veiled in mysticism and scholasticism was opening up infinite vistas  a new superstition the exaggerated worship of the ancients was nearly hindering this movement of thought towards facts nevertheless learning did her work  she rediscovered reconstructed purified commented on the texts of ancient authors  then came in observation which showed that more was to be seen in one blade of grass than in any page of pliny  rondelet was in the middle of this crisis a man of transition while he was one of progress  he reflected the past he opened and prepared the future  if he commented on dioscorides if he remained faithful to the theories of galen he founded in his history of fishes a monument which our century respects  he is above all an inspirer an initiator and if he wants one mark of the leader of a school the foundation of certain scientific doctrines there is in his speech what is better than all systems the communicative power which urges a generation of disciples along the path of independent research with reason for guide and faith for aim  around rondelet in those years sometimes indeed in his housefor professors in those days took private pupils as lodgersworked the group of botanists whom linnaeus calls the fathers the authors of the descriptive botany of the sixteenth century  their names and those of their disciples and their disciples again are household words in the mouth of every gardener immortalised like good bishop pellicier in the plants that have been named after them  the lobelia commemorates lobel one of rondelets most famous pupils who wrote those adversaria which contain so many curious sketches of rondelets botanical expeditions and who inherited his botanical as joubert his biographer inherited his anatomical manuscripts  the magnolia commemorates the magnols the sarracenia sarrasin of lyons the bauhinia jean bauhin the fuchsia bauhins earlier german master leonard fuchs and the clusiathe received name of that terrible matapalo or scotch attorney of the west indies which kills the hugest tree to become as huge a tree itselfimmortalises the great clusius charles de lescluse citizen of arras who after studying civil law at louvain philosophy at marburg and theology at wittemberg under melancthon came to montpellier in 1551 to live in rondelets own house and become the greatest botanist of his age  these were rondelets palmy days  he had got a theatre of anatomy built at montpellier where he himself dissected publicly  he had says tradition a little botanic garden such as were springing up then in several universities specially in italy  he had a villa outside the city whose tower near the modern railway station still bears the name of the mas de rondelet  there too may be seen the remnants of the great tanks fed with water brought through earthen pipes from the fountain of albe wherein he kept the fish whose habits he observed professor planchon thinks that he had saltwater tanks likewise and thus he may have been the father of all aquariums  he had a large and handsome house in the city itself a large practice as physician in the country round money flowed in fast to him and flowed out fast likewise he spent much upon building pulling down rebuilding and sent the bills in seemingly to his wife and to his guardian angel catharine  he himself had never a penny in his purse but earned the money and let his ladies spend it an equitable and pleasant division of labour which most married men would do well to imitate  a generous affectionate careless little man he gave away says his pupil and biographer joubert his valuable specimens to any savant who begged for them or left them about to be stolen by visitors who like too many collectors in all ages possessed light fingers and lighter consciences  so pacific was he meanwhile and so brave withal that even in the fearful years of the troubles he would never carry sword nor even tuck or dagger but went about on the most lonesome journeys as one who wore a charmed life secure in god and in his calling which was to heal and not to kill  these were the golden years of rondelets life but trouble was coming on him and a stormy sunset after a brilliant day  he lost his sisterin law to whom he owed all his fortunes and who had watched ever since over him and his wife like a mother then he lost his wife herself under most painful circumstances then his bestbeloved daughter  then he married again and lost the son who was born to him and then came as to many of the best in those days even sorer trials trials of the conscience trials of faith  for in the meantime rondelet had become a protestant like many of the wisest men round him like so it would seem from the event the majority of the university and the burghers of montpellier  it is not to be wondered at  montpellier was a sort of halfway restingplace for protestant preachers whether fugitive or not who were passing from basle geneva or lyons to marguerite of navarres little protestant court at pan or at nerac where all wise and good men and now and then some foolish and fanatical ones found shelter and hospitality  thither calvin himself had been passing probably through montpellier and leavingas such a man was sure to leavethe mark of his foot behind him  at lyons no great distance up the rhone marguerite had helped to establish an organised protestant community and when in 1536 she herself had passed through montpellier to visit her brother at valence and montmorencys camp at avignon she took with her doubtless protestant chaplains of her own who spoke wise wordsit may be that she spoke wise words herselfto the ardent and inquiring students of montpellier moreover rondelet and his disciples had been for years past in constant communication with the protestant savants of switzerland and germany among whom the knowledge of nature was progressing as it never had progressed before  forit is a fact always to be rememberedit was only in the free air of protestant countries the natural sciences could grow and thrive  they sprung up indeed in italy after the restoration of greek literature in the fifteenth century but they withered there again only too soon under the blighting upas shade of superstition transplanted to the free air of switzerland of germany of britain and of montpellier then half protestant they developed rapidly and surely simply because the air was free to be checked again in france by the return of superstition with despotism superadded until the eve of the great french revolution  so rondelet had been for some years protestant  he had hidden in his house for a long while a monk who had left his monastery  he had himself written theological treatises but when his bishop pellicier was imprisoned on a charge of heresy rondelet burnt his manuscripts and kept his opinions to himself  still he was a suspected heretic at last seemingly a notorious one for only the year before his death going to visit patients at perpignan he was waylaid by the spaniards and had to get home through bypasses of the pyrenees to avoid being thrown into the inquisition  and those were times in which it was necessary for a man to be careful unless he had made up his mind to be burned  for more than thirty years of rondelets life the burning had gone on in his neighbourhood intermittently it is true the spasms of superstitious fury being succeeded one may charitably hope by pity and remorse but still the burnings had gone on  the benedictine monk of st maur who writes the history of languedoc says quite en passant how someone was burnt at toulouse in 1553 luckily only in effigy for he had escaped to geneva but he adds next year they burned several heretics it being not worth while to mention their names  in 1556 they burned alive at toulouse jean escalle a poor franciscan monk who had found his order intolerable while one pierre de lavaur who dared preach calvinism in the streets of nismes was hanged and burnt  so had the score of judicial murders been increasing year by year till it had to be as all evil scores have to be in this world paid off with interest and paid off especially against the ignorant and fanatic monks who for a whole generation in every university and school in france had been howling down sound science as well as sound religion and at montpellier in 156061 their debt was paid them in a very ugly way  news came down to the hot southerners of languedoc of the socalled conspiracy of amboisehow the duc de guise and the cardinal de lorraine had butchered the best blood in france under the pretence of a treasonable plot how the king of navarre and the prince de conde had been arrested then how conde and coligny were ready to take up arms at the head of all the huguenots of france and try to stop this lifelong torturing by sharp shot and cold steel then how in six months time the king would assemble a general council to settle the question between catholics and huguenots  the huguenots guessing how that would end resolved to settle the question for themselves  they rose in one city after another sacked the churches destroyed the images put down by main force superstitious processions and dances and did many things only to be excused by the exasperation caused by thirty years of cruelty  at montpellier there was hard fighting murdersso say the catholic historiansof priests and monks sack of the new cathedral destruction of the noble convents which lay in a ring round montpellier  the city and the university were in the hands of the huguenots and montpellier became protestant on the spot  next year came the counterblow  there were heavy battles with the catholics all round the neighbourhood destruction of the suburbs threatened siege and sack and years of misery and poverty for montpellier and all who were therein  horrible was the state of france in those times of the wars of religion which began in 1562 the times which are spoken of usually as the troubles as if men did not wish to allude to them too openly  then and afterwards in the wars of the league deeds were done for which language has no name  the population decreased  the land lay untilled the fair face of france was blackened with burnt homesteads and ruined towns  ghastly corpses dangled in rows upon the trees or floated down the bloodstained streams  law and order were at an end  bands of robbers prowled in open day and bands of wolves likewise  but all through the horrors of the troubles we catch sight of the little fat doctor riding all unarmed to see his patients throughout languedoc going vast distances his biographers say by means of regular relays of horses till he too broke down  well for him perhaps that he broke down when he did for capture and recapture massacre and pestilence were the fate of montpellier and the surrounding country till the better times of henry iv and the edict of nantes in 1598 when liberty of worship was given to the protestants for awhile  in the burning summer of 1566 rondelet went a long journey to toulouse seemingly upon an errand of charity to settle some law affairs for his relations  the sanitary state of the southern cities is bad enough still  it must have been horrible in those days of barbarism and misrule  dysentery was epidemic at toulouse then and rondelet took it he knew from the first that he should die  he was worn out it is said by overexertion by sorrow for the miseries of the land by fruitless struggles to keep the peace and to strive for moderation in days when men were all immoderate  but he rode away a days journeyhe took two days over it so weak he wasin the blazing july sun to a friends sick wife at realmont and there took to his bed and died a good mans death the details of his death and last illness were written and published by his cousin claude formy and well worth reading they are to any man who wishes to know how to die  rondelet would have no tidings of his illness sent to montpellier  he was happy he said in dying away from the tears of his household and safe from insult  he dreaded one may suppose lest priests and friars should force their way to his bedside and try to extort some recantation from the great savant the honour and glory of their city  so they sent for no priest to realmont but round his bed a knot of calvinist gentlemen and ministers read the scriptures and sang davids psalms and prayed and rondelet prayed with them through long agonies and so went home to god  the benedictine monkhistorian of languedoc in all his voluminous folios never mentions as far as i can find rondelets existence  why should he  the man was only a druggists son and a heretic who healed diseases and collected plants and wrote a book on fish  but the learned men of montpellier and of all europe had a very different opinion of him  his body was buried at realmont but before the schools of toulouse they set up a white marble slab and an inscription thereon setting forth his learning and his virtues and epitaphs on him were composed by the learned throughout europe not only in french and latin but in greek hebrew and even chaldee  so lived and so died a noble man more noble to my mind than many a victorious warrior or successful statesman or canonised saint  to know facts and to heal diseases were the two objects of his life  for them he toiled as few men have toiled and he died in harness at his workthe best death any man can die     vesalius the anatomist 9   i cannot begin a sketch of the life of this great man better than by trying to describe a scene so picturesque so tragic in the eyes of those who are wont to mourn over human follies so comic in the eyes of those who prefer to laugh over them that the reader will not be likely to forget either it or the actors in it  it is a darkened chamber in the college of alcala in the year 1562 where lies probably in a huge fourpost bed shrouded in stifling hangings the heirapparent of the greatest empire in the then world don carlos only son of philip ii and heirapparent of spain the netherlands and all the indies  a short sickly boy of sixteen with a bull head a crooked shoulder a short leg and a brutal temper he will not be missed by the world if he should die  his profligate career seems to have brought its own punishment  to the scandal of his father who tolerated no ones vices save his own as well as to the scandal of the university authorities of alcala he has been scouring the streets at the head of the most profligate students insulting women even ladies of rank and amenable only to his lovely young stepmother elizabeth of valois isabel de la paz as the spaniards call her the daughter of catherine do medicis and sister of the king of france  don carlos should have married her had not his worthy father found it more advantageous for the crown of spain as well as more pleasant for him philip to marry her himself  whence came heartburnings rage jealousies romances calumnies of which two lastin as far at least as they concern poor elizabethno wise man now believes a word  going on some errand on which he had no businessthere are two stories neither of them creditable nor necessary to repeatdon carlos has fallen downstairs and broken his head  he comes by his portuguese mothers side of a house deeply tainted with insanity and such an injury may have serious consequences  however for nine days the wound goes on well and don carlos having had a wholesome fright is according to doctor olivarez the medico de camara a very good lad and lives on chicken broth and dried plums  but on the tenth day comes on numbness of the left side acute pains in the head and then gradually shivering high fever erysipelas  his head and neck swell to an enormous size then comes raging delirium then stupefaction and don carlos lies as one dead  a modern surgeon would probably thanks to that training of which vesalius may be almost called the father have had little difficulty in finding out what was the matter with the luckless lad and little difficulty in removing the evil if it had not gone too far  but the spanish physicians were then as many of them are said to be still as far behind the world in surgery as in other things and indeed surgery itself was then in its infancy because men ever since the early greek schools of alexandria had died out had been for centuries feeding their minds with anything rather than with facts  therefore the learned morosophs who were gathered round don carloss sick bed had become according to their own confession utterly confused terrified and at their wits end  it is the 7th of may the eighteenth day after the accident according to olivarezs story he and dr vega have been bleeding the unhappy prince enlarging the wound twice and torturing him seemingly on mere guesses i believe says olivarez that all was done well but as i have said in wounds in the head there are strange labyrinths  so on the 7th they stand round the bed in despair  don garcia de toledo the princes faithful governor is sitting by him worn out with sleepless nights and trying to supply to the poor boy that mothers tenderness which he has never known  alva too is there stern selfcompressed most terrible and yet most beautiful  he has a god on earth and that is philip his master and though he has borne much from don carlos already and will have to bear more yet the wretched lad is to him as a son of god a second deity who will by right divine succeed to the inheritance of the first and he watches this lesser deity struggling between life and death with an intensity of which we in these less loyal days can form no notion  one would be glad to have a glimpse of what passed through that mind so subtle and so ruthless so disciplined and so loyal withal but alva was a man who was not given to speak his mind but to act it  one would wish too for a glimpse of what was passing through the mind of another man who has been daily in that sick chamber according to olivarezs statement since the first of the month but he is one who has had for some years past even more reason than alva for not speaking his mind  what he looked like we know well for titian has painted him from the lifea tall bold welldressed man with a noble brain square and yet lofty short curling locks and beard an eye which looks as though it feared neither man nor fiendand it has had good reason to fear bothand features which would be exceeding handsome but for the defiant snubnose  that is andreas vesalius of brussels dreaded and hated by the doctors of the old schoolsuspect moreover it would seem to inquisitors and theologians possibly to alva himself for he has dared to dissect human bodies he has insulted the mediaevalists at paris padua bologna pisa venice in open theatre he has turned the heads of all the young surgeons in italy and france he has written a great book with prints in it designed some say by titianthey were actually done by another netherlander john of calcar near clevesin which he has dared to prove that galens anatomy was at fault throughout and that he had been describing a monkeys inside when he had pretended to be describing a mans and thus by impudence and quackery he has wormed himselfthis netherlander a heretic at heart as all netherlanders are to god as well as to galeninto the confidence of the late emperor charles v and gone campaigning with him as one of his physicians anatomising human bodies even on the battlefield and defacing the likeness of deity and worse than that the most religious king philip is deceived by him likewise and keeps him in madrid in wealth and honour and now in the princes extreme danger the king has actually sent for him and bidden him try his skilla man who knows nothing save about bones and muscles and the outside of the body and is unworthy the name of a true physician  one can conceive the rage of the old spanish pedants at the netherlanders appearance and still more at what followed if we are to believe hugo bloet of delft his countryman and contemporary 10 vesalius he says saw that the surgeons had bound up the wound so tight that an abscess had formed outside the skull which could not break he asserted that the only hope lay in opening it and did so philip having given leave by two crosscuts  then the lad returned to himself as if awakened from a profound sleep affirming that he owed his restoration to life to the german doctor  dionysius daza who was there with the other physicians and surgeons tells a different story the most learned famous and rare baron vesalius he says advised that the skull should be trepanned but his advice was not followed  olivarezs account agrees with that of daza  they had opened the wounds he says down to the skull before vesalius came  vesalius insisted that the injury lay inside the skull and wished to pierce it  olivarez spends much labour in proving that vesalius had no great foundation for his opinion but confesses that he never changed that opinion to the last though all the spanish doctors were against him  then on the 6th he says the bachelor torres came from madrid and advised that the skull should be laid bare once more and on the 7th there being still doubt whether the skull was not injured the operation was performedby whom it is not saidbut without any good result or according to olivarez any discovery save that vesalius was wrong and the skull uninjured  whether this second operation of the 7th of may was performed by vesalius and whether it was that of which bloet speaks is an open question  olivarezs whole relation is apologetic written to justify himself and his seven spanish colleagues and to prove vesalius in the wrong  public opinion he confesses had been very fierce against him the credit of spanish medicine was at stake and we are not bound to believe implicitly a paper drawn up under such circumstances for philips eye  this at least we gather that don carlos was never trepanned as is commonly said and this also that whichever of the two stories is true equally puts vesalius into direct and most unpleasant antagonism to the spanish doctors 11  but don carlos still lay senseless and yielding to popular clamour the doctors called in the aid of a certain moorish doctor from valencia named priotarete whose unguents it was reported had achieved many miraculous cures  the unguent however to the horror of the doctors burned the skull till the bone was as black as the colour of ink and olivarez declares he believes it to have been a preparation of pure caustic  on the morning of the 9th of may the moor and his unguents were sent away and went to madrid to send to heaven hernando de vega while the prince went back to our method of cure  considering what happened on the morning of the 10th of may we should now presume that the second opening of the abscess whether by vesalius or someone else relieved the pressure on the brain that a critical period of exhaustion followed probably prolonged by the moors premature caustic which stopped the suppuration but that gods good handiwork called nature triumphed at last and that therefore it came to pass that the prince was out of danger within three days of the operation  but he was taught it seems to attribute his recovery to a very different source from that of a german knife  for on the morning of the 9th when the moor was gone and don carlos lay seemingly lifeless there descended into his chamber a deus e machina or rather a whole pantheon of greater or lesser deities who were to effect that which medical skill seemed not to have effected  philip sent into the princes chamber several of the precious relics which he usually carried about with him the miraculous image of the virgin of atocha in embroidering garments for whom spanish royalty male and female has spent so many an hour ere now was brought in solemn procession and placed on an altar at the foot of the princes bed and in the afternoon there entered with a procession likewise a shrine containing the bones of a holy anchorite one fray diego whose life and miracles says olivarez are so notorious and the bones of st justus and st pastor the tutelar saints of the university of alcala  amid solemn litanies the relics of fray diego were laid upon the princes pillow and the sudarium or mortuary cloth which had covered his face was placed upon the princes forehead  modern science might object that the presence of so many personages however pious or well intentioned in a sick chamber on a hot spanish may day especially as the bath had been for some generations past held in religious horror throughout spain as a sign of moorish and mussulman tendencies might have somewhat interfered with the chances of the poor boys recovery  nevertheless the event seems to have satisfied philips highest hopes for that same night so don carlos afterwards related the holy monk diego appeared to him in a vision wearing the habit of st francis and bearing in his hand a cross of reeds tied with a green band the prince stated that he first took the apparition to be that of the blessed st francis but not seeing the stigmata he exclaimed how dost thou not bear the marks of the wounds  what he replied don carlos did not recollect save that he consoled him and told him that he should not die of that malady  philip had returned to madrid and shut himself up in grief in the great jeronymite monastery  elizabeth was praying for her stepson before the miraculous images of the same city  during the night of the 9th of may prayers went up for don carlos in all the churches of toledo alcala and madrid  alva stood all that night at the beds foot  don garcia de toledo sat in the armchair where he had now sat night and day for more than a fortnight  the good preceptor honorato juan afterwards bishop of osma wrestled in prayer for the lad the whole night through  his prayer was answered probably it had been answered already without his being aware of it  be that as it may about dawn don carloss heavy breathing ceased he fell into a quiet sleep and when he awoke all perceived at once that he was saved  he did not recover his sight seemingly on account of the erysipelas for a week more  he then opened his eyes upon the miraculous image of atocha and vowed that if he recovered he would give to the virgin at four different shrines in spain gold plate of four times his weight and silver plate of seven times his weight when he should rise from his couch  so on the 6th of june he rose and was weighed in a fur coat and a robe of damask and his weight was three arrobas and one poundseventy six pounds in all  on the 14th of june he went to visit his father at the episcopal palace then to all the churches and shrines in alcala and of course to that of fray diego whose body it is said he contemplated for some time with edifying devotion  the next year saw fray diego canonised as a saint at the intercession of philip and his son and thus don carlos reentered the world to be a terror and a torment to all around him and to dienot by philips cruelty as his enemies reported too hastily indeed yet excusably for they knew him to be capable of any wickednessbut simply of constitutional insanity  and now let us go back to the history of that most learned famous and rare baron vesalius who had stood by and seen all these things done and try if we cannot after we have learned the history of his early life guess at some of his probable meditations on this celebrated clinical case and guess also how those meditations may have affected seriously the events of his afterlife  vesalius as i said was a netherlander born at brussels in 1513 or 1514  his father and grandfather had been medical men of the highest standing in a profession which then as now was commonly hereditary  his real name was wittag an ancient family of wesel on the rhine from which town either he or his father adopted the name of vesalius according to the classicising fashion of those days  young vesalius was sent to college at louvain where he learned rapidly  at sixteen or seventeen he knew not only latin but greek enough to correct the proofs of galen and arabic enough to become acquainted with the works of the mussulman physicians  he was a physicist too and a mathematician according to the knowledge of those times but his passionthe study to which he was destined to devote his lifewas anatomy  little or nothing it must be understood had been done in anatomy since the days of galen of pergamos in the second century after christ and very little even by him  dissection was all but forbidden among the ancients  the egyptians herodotus tells us used to pursue with stones and curses the embalmers as soon as they had performed their unpleasant office and though herophilus and erasistratus are said to have dissected many subjects under the protection of ptolemy soter in alexandria itself yet the public feeling of the greeks as well as of the romans continued the same as that of the ancient egyptians and galen was fainas vesalius provedto supplement his ignorance of the human frame by describing that of an ape  dissection was equally forbidden among the mussulmans and the great arabic physicians could do no more than comment on galen  the same prejudice extended through the middle age  medical men were all clerks clerici and as such forbidden to shed blood  the only dissection as far as i am aware made during the middle age was one by mundinus in 1306 and his subsequent commentaries on galenfor he dare allow his own eyes to see no more than galen had seen before himconstituted the best anatomical manual in europe till the middle of the fifteenth century  then in italy at least the classic renaissance gave fresh life to anatomy as to all other sciences  especially did the improvements in painting and sculpture stir men up to a closer study of the human frame leonardo da vinci wrote a treatise on muscular anatomy  the artist and the sculptor often worked together and realised that sketch of michael angelos in which he himself is assisting fallopius vesaliuss famous pupil to dissect  vesalius soon found that his thirst for facts could not be slaked by the theories of the middle age so in 1530 he went off to montpellier where francis i had just founded a medical school and where the ancient laws of the city allowed the faculty each year the body of a criminal  from thence after becoming the fellowpupil and the friend of rondelet and probably also of rabelais and those other luminaries of montpellier of whom i spoke in my essay on rondelet he returned to paris to study under old sylvius whose real name was jacques dubois alias jock o the wood and to learn lessas he complains himselfin an anatomical theatre than a butcher might learn in his shop  were it not that the whole question of dissection is one over which it is right to draw a reverent veil as a thing painful however necessary and however innocent it would be easy to raise ghastly laughter in many a reader by the stories which vesalius himself tells of his struggles to learn anatomy  how old sylvius tried to demonstrate the human frame from a bit of a dog fumbling in vain for muscles which he could not find or which ought to have been there according to galen and were not while young vesalius as soon as the old pedants back was turned took his place and to the delight of the students found for himprovided it were therewhat he could not find himselfhow he went bodysnatching and gibbetrobbing often at the danger of his life as when he and his friend were nearly torn to pieces by the cannibal dogs who haunted the butte de montfaucon or place of public executionhow he acquired by a long and dangerous process the only perfect skeleton then in the world and the hideous story of the robber to whom it had belongedall these horrors those who list may read for themselves elsewhere  i hasten past them with this remarkthat to have gone through the toils dangers and disgusts which vesalius faced argued in a superstitious and cruel age like his no common physical and moral courage and a deep conscience that he was doing right and must do it at all risks in the face of a generation which peculiarly reckless of human life and human agony allowed that frame which it called the image of god to be tortured maimed desecrated in every way while alive and yetstraining at the gnat after having swallowed the camelforbade it to be examined when dead though for the purpose of alleviating the miseries of mankind  the breaking out of war between francis i and charles v drove vesalius back to his native country and louvain and in 1535 we hear of him as a surgeon in charles vs army  he saw most probably the emperors invasion of provence and the disastrous retreat from before montmorencys fortified camp at avignon through a country in which that crafty general had destroyed every article of human food except the half ripe grapes  he saw perhaps the spanish soldiers poisoned alike by the sour fruit and by the blazing sun falling in hundreds along the white roads which led back into savoy murdered by the peasantry whose homesteads had been destroyed stifled by the weight of their own armour or desperately putting themselves with their own hands out of a world which had become intolerable  half the army perished  two thousand corpses lay festering between aix and frejus alone  if young vesalius needed subjects the ambition and the crime of man found enough for him in those blazing september days  he went to italy probably with the remnants of the army  where could he have rather wished to find himself  he was at last in the country where the human mind seemed to be growing young once more the country of revived arts revived sciences learning languages andthough alas only for awhile of revived free thought such as europe had not seen since the palmy days of greece  here at least he would be appreciated here at least he would be allowed to think and speak and he was appreciated  the italian cities who were then like the athenians of old spending their time in nothing else save to hear or to tell something new welcomed the brave young fleming and his novelties within two years he was professor of anatomy at padua then the first school in the world then at bologna and at pisa at the same time last of all at venice where titian painted that portrait of him which remains unto this day  these years were for him a continual triumph everywhere as he demonstrated on the human body students crowded his theatre or hung round him as he walked the streets professors left their own chairstheir scholars having deserted them alreadyto go and listen humbly or enviously to the man who could give them what all brave souls throughout half europe were craving for and craving in vainfacts  and so year after year was realised that scene which stands engraved in the frontispiece of his great bookwhere in the little quaint cinquecento theatre saucy scholars reverend doctors gay gentlemen and even cowled monks are crowding the floor peeping over each others shoulders hanging on the balustrades while in the centre over his subjectwhich one of those same cowled monks knew but too wellstands young vesalius upright proud almost defiant as one who knows himself safe in the impregnable citadel of fact and in his hand the little blade of steel destinedbecause wielded in obedience to the laws of nature which are the laws of godto work more benefit for the human race than all the swords which were drawn in those days or perhaps in any other at the bidding of most catholic emperors and most christian kings  those were indeed days of triumph for vesalius of triumph deserved because earned by patient and accurate toil in a good cause but vesalius being but a mortal man may have contracted in those same days a temper of imperiousness and selfconceit such as he showed afterwards when his pupil fallopius dared to add fresh discoveries to those of his master  and yet in spite of all vesalius knew how little he knew  how humbling to his pride it would have been had he known thenperhaps he does know nowthat he had actually again and again walked as it were round and round the true theory of the circulation of the blood and yet never seen it that that discovery which once made is intelligible as far as any phenomenon is intelligible to the merest peasant was reserved for another century and for one of those englishmen on whom vesalius would have looked as semibarbarians  to make a long story short three years after the publication of his famous book de corporis humani fabrica he left venice to cure charles v at regensburg and became one of the great emperors physicians  this was the crisis of vesaliuss life  the medicine with which he had worked the cure was chinasarsaparilla as we call it nowbrought home from the then newlydiscovered banks of the paraguay and uruguay where its beds of tangled vine they say tinge the clear waters a darkbrown like that of peat and convert whole streams into a healthful and pleasant tonic  on the virtues of this china then supposed to be a root vesalius wrote a famous little book into which he contrived to interweave his opinions on things in general as good bishop berkeley did afterwards into his essay on the virtues of tarwater  into this book however vesalius introducedas bishop berkeley did notmuch and perhaps too much about himself and much though perhaps not too much about poor old galen and his substitution of an apes inside for that of a human being  the storm which had been long gathering burst upon him the old school trembling for their timehonoured reign bespattered with all that pedantry ignorance and envy could suggest the man who dared not only to revolutionise surgery but to interfere with the privileged mysteries of medicine and over and above to become a greater favourite at the court of the greatest of monarchs  while such as eustachius himself an able discoverer could join in the cry it is no wonder if a lower soul like that of sylvius led it openmouthed  he was a mean covetous bad man as george bachanan well knew and according to his nature he wrote a furious bookad vesani calumnias depulsandas  the punning change of vesalius into vesanus madman was but a fair and gentle stroke for a polemic in days in which those who could not kill their enemies with steel or powder held themselves justified in doing so if possible by vituperation calumny and every engine of moral torture  but a far more terrible weapon and one which made vesalius rage and it may be for once in his life tremble was the charge of impiety and heresy  the inquisition was a very ugly place  it was very easy to get into it especially for a netherlander but not so easy to get out  indeed vesalius must have trembled when he saw his master charles v himself take fright and actually call on the theologians of salamanca to decide whether it was lawful to dissect a human body  the monks to their honour used their common sense and answered yes  the deed was so plainly useful that it must be lawful likewise  but vesalius did not feel that he had triumphed  he dreaded possibly lest the storm should only have blown over for a time  he fell possibly into hasty disgust at the folly of mankind and despair of arousing them to use their common sense and acknowledge their true interest and their true benefactors  at all events he threw into the fireso it is saidall his unpublished manuscripts the records of long years of observation and renounced science thenceforth  we hear of him after this at brussels and at basle likewisein which latter city in the company of physicians naturalists and grecians he must have breathed awhile a freer air  but he seems to have returned thence to his old master charles v and to have finally settled at madrid as a court surgeon to philip ii who sent him but too late to extract the lance splinters from the eye of the dying henry ii  he was now married to a lady of rank from brussels anne van hamme by name and their daughter married in time philip iis grand falconer who was doubtless a personage of no small social rank  vesalius was well off in worldly things somewhat fond it is said of good living and of luxury inclined it may be to say let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and to sink more and more into the mere worldling unless some shock should awake him from his lethargy  and the awakening shock did come  after eight years of court life he resolved early in the year 1564 to go on a pilgrimage to jerusalem  the reasons for so strange a determination are wrapped in mystery and contradiction  the common story was that he had opened a corpse to ascertain the cause of death and that to the horror of the bystanders the heart was still seen to beat that his enemies accused him to the inquisition and that he was condemned to death a sentence which was commuted to that of going on pilgrimage  but here at the very outset accounts differ  one says that the victim was a nobleman name not given another that it was a ladys maid name not given  it is most improbable if not impossible that vesalius of all men should have mistaken a living body for a dead one while it is most probable on the other hand that his medical enemies would gladly raise such a calumny against him when he was no longer in spain to contradict it  meanwhile llorente the historian of the inquisition makes no mention of vesalius having been brought before its tribunal while he does mention vesaliuss residence at madrid  another story is that he went abroad to escape the bad temper of his wife another that he wanted to enrich himself  another storyand that not an unlikely oneis that he was jealous of the rising reputation of his pupil fallopius then professor of anatomy at venice  this distinguished surgeon as i said before had written a book in which he added to vesaliuss discoveries and corrected certain of his errors  vesalius had answered him hastily and angrily quoting his anatomy from memory for as he himself complained he could not in spain obtain a subject for dissection not even he said a single skull he had sent his book to venice to be published and had heard seemingly nothing of it  he may have felt that he was falling behind in the race of science and that it was impossible for him to carry on his studies in madrid and so angry with his own laziness and luxury he may have felt the old sacred fire flash up in him and have determined to go to italy and become a student and a worker once more  the very day that he set out clusius of arras then probably the best botanist in the world arrived at madrid and asking the reason of vesaliuss departure was told by their fellowcountryman charles de tisnacq procurator for the affairs of the netherlands that vesalius had gone of his own free will and with all facilities which philip could grant him in performance of a vow which he had made during a dangerous illness  here at least we have a drop of information which seems taken from the stream sufficiently near to the fountainhead but it must be recollected that de tisnacq lived in dangerous times and may have found it necessary to walk warily in them that through him had been sent only the year before that famous letter from william of orange horn and egmont the fate whereof may be read in mr motleys fourth chapter that the crisis of the netherlands which sprung out of that letter was coming fast and that as de tisnacq was on friendly terms with egmont he may have felt his head at times somewhat loose on his shoulders especially if he had heard alva say as he wrote that every time he saw the despatches of those three senors they moved his choler so that if he did not take much care to temper it he would seem a frenzied man  in such times de tisnacq may have thought good to return a diplomatic answer to a fellowcountryman concerning a third fellowcountryman especially when that countryman as a former pupil of melancthon at wittemberg might himself be under suspicion of heresy and therefore of possible treason  be this as it may one cannot but suspect some strain of truth in the story about the inquisition for whether or not vesalius operated on don carlos he had seen with his own eyes that miraculous virgin of atocha at the beds foot of the prince  he had heard his recovery attributed not to the operation but to the intercession of fray now saint diego 12 and he must have had his thoughts thereon and may in an unguarded moment have spoken them  for he was be it always remembered a netherlander  the crisis of his country was just at hand  rebellion was inevitable and with rebellion horrors unutterable and meanwhile don carlos had set his mad brain on having the command of the netherlands  in his rage at not having it as all the world knows he nearly killed alva with his own hands some two years after  if it be true that don carlos felt a debt of gratitude to vesalius he may after his wont have poured out to him some wild confidence about the netherlands to have even heard which would be a crime in philips eyes  and if this be but a fancy still vesalius was as i just said a netherlander and one of a brain and a spirit to which philips doings and the air of the spanish court must have been growing ever more and more intolerable  hundreds of his country folk perhaps men and women whom he had known were being racked burnt alive buried alive at the bidding of a jocular ruffian peter titelmann the chief inquisitor  the day of the maubrulez and the wholesale massacre which followed it had happened but two years before and by all the signs of the times these murders and miseries were certain to increase and why were all these poor wretches suffering the extremity of horror but because they would not believe in miraculous images and bones of dead friars and the rest of that science of unreason and unfact against which vesalius had been fighting all his life consciously or not by using reason and observing fact  what wonder if in some burst of noble indignation and just contempt he forgot a moment that he had sold his soul and his love of science likewise to be a luxurious yet uneasy hangeron at the tyrants court and spoke unadvisedly some word worthy of a german man  as to the story of his unhappy quarrels with his wife there may be a grain of truth in it likewise  vesaliuss religion must have sat very lightly on him  the man who had robbed churchyards and gibbets from his youth was not likely to be much afraid of apparitions and demons  he had handled too many human bones to care much for those of saints  he was probably like his friends of basle montpellier and paris somewhat of a heretic at heart probably somewhat of a pagan while his lady anne van hamme was probably a strict catholic as her father being a councillor and master of the exchequer at brussels was bound to be and freethinking in the husband crossed by superstition in the wife may have caused in them that wretched vie a part that want of any true communion of soul too common to this day in catholic countries  be these things as they mayand the exact truth of them will now be never knownvesalius set out to jerusalem in the spring of 1564  on his way he visited his old friends at venice to see about his book against fallopius  the venetian republic received the great philosopher with open arms  fallopius was just dead and the senate offered their guest the vacant chair of anatomy  he accepted it but went on to the east  he never occupied that chair wrecked upon the isle of zante as he was sailing back from palestine he died miserably of fever and want as thousands of pilgrims returning from the holy land had died before him  a goldsmith recognised him buried him in a chapel of the virgin and put up over him a simple stone which remained till late years and may remain for aught i know even now  so perished in the prime of life a martyr to his love of science to quote the words of m burggraeve of ghent his able biographer and commentator the prodigious man who created a science at an epoch when everything was still an obstacle to his progress a man whose whole life was a long struggle of knowledge against ignorance of truth against lies  plaudite exeat with rondelet and buchanan  and whensoever this poor foolish world needs three such men may god of his great mercy send them     paracelsus 13   i told you of vesalius and rondelet as specimens of the men who three hundred years ago were founding the physical science of the present day by patient investigation of facts  but such an age as this would naturally produce men of a very different stamp men who could not imitate their patience and humility who were trying for royal roads to knowledge and to the fame and wealth which might be got out of knowledge who meddled with vain dreams about the occult sciences alchemy astrology magic the cabala and so forth who were reputed magicians courted and feared for awhile and then too often died sad deaths  such had been in the century before the famous dr faustfaustus who was said to have made a compact with satanactually one of the inventors of printingimmortalised in goethes marvellous poem  such in the first half of the sixteenth century was cornelius agrippaa doctor of divinity and a knightatarms secretservice diplomatist to the emperor maximilian in austria astrologer though unwilling to his daughter margaret regent of the low countries writer on the occult sciences and of the famous de vanitate scientiarum and what not who died miserably at the age of fortynine accused of magic by the dominican monks from whom he had rescued a poor girl who they were torturing on a charge of witchcraft and by them hunted to death nor to death only for they spread the fablesuch as you may find in delrio the jesuits disquisitions on magic 14that his little pet black dog was a familiar spirit as butler has it in hudibras     agrippa kept a stygian pug    i the garb and habit of a dog    that was his taste and the cur    read to th occult philosopher    and taught him subtly to maintain    all other sciences are vain  such also was jerome cardan the italian scholar and physician the father of algebraic science you all recollect cardans rule believer in dreams prognostics astrology who died too miserably enough in old age  cardans sad life and that of cornelius agrippa you can and ought to read for yourselves in two admirable biographies as amusing as they are learned by professor morley of the london university  i have not chosen either of them as a subject for this lecture because mr morley has so exhausted what is to be known about them that i could tell you nothing which i had not stolen from him  but what shall i say of the most famous of these menparacelsus whose name you surely know  he too has been immortalised in a poem which you all ought to have read one of robert brownings earliest and one of his best creations  i think we must accept as true mr brownings interpretation of paracelsuss character  we must believe that he was at first an honest and highminded as he was certainly a most gifted man that he went forth into the world with an intense sense of the worthlessness of the sham knowledge of the pedants and quacks of the schools an intense belief that some higher and truer science might be discovered by which diseases might be actually cured and health long life happiness all but immortality be conferred on man an intense belief that he paracelsus was called and chosen by god to find out that great mystery and be a benefactor to all future ages  that fixed idea might degeneratedid alas degenerateinto wild selfconceit rash contempt of the ancients violent abuse of his opponents  but there was more than this in paracelsus  he had one idea to which if he had kept true his life would have been a happier onethe firm belief that all pure science was a revelation from god that it was not to be obtained at second or third hand by blindly adhering to the words of galen or hippocrates or aristotle and putting them as the scholastic philosophers round him did in the place of god but by going straight to nature at first hand and listening to what bacon calls the voice of god revealed in facts true and noble is the passage with which he begins his labyrinthus medicorum one of his attacks on the false science of his day  the first and highest book of all healing he says is called wisdom and without that book no man will carry out anything good or useful    and that book is god himself  for in him alone who hath created all things the knowledge and principle of all things dwells    without him all is folly  as the sun shines on us from above so he must pour into us from above all arts whatsoever  therefore the root of all learning and cognition is that we should seek first the kingdom of godthe kingdom of god in which all sciences are founded    if any man think that nature is not founded on the kingdom of god he knows nothing about it  all gifts he repeats again and again confused and clumsily as is his wont but with a true earnestness are from god  the true man of science with paracelsus is he who seeks first the kingdom of god in facts investigating nature reverently patiently in faith believing that god who understands his own work best will make him understand it likewise  the false man of science is he who seeks the kingdom of this world who cares nothing about the real interpretation of facts but is content with such an interpretation as will earn him the good things of this worldthe red hat and gown the ambling mule the silk clothes the partridges capons and pheasants the gold florins chinking in his palm  at such pretenders paracelsus sneered at last only too fiercely not only as men whose knowledge consisted chiefly in wearing white gloves but as rogues liars villains and every epithet which his very racy vocabulary quickened it is to be feared by wine and laudanum could suggest  with these he contrasts the true men of science  it is difficult for us now to understand how a man setting out in life with such pure and noble views should descend at last if indeed he did descend to be a quack and a conjurorand die under the imputation that     bombastes kept a devils bird    hid in the pommel of his sword  and have indeed his very name bombast used to this day as a synonym of loud violent and empty talk  to understand it at all we must go back and think a little over these same occult sciences which were believed in by thousands during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the reverence for classic antiquity you must understand which sprang up at the renaissance in the fifteenth century was as indiscriminating as it was earnest  men caught the trash as well as the jewels  they put the dreams of the neoplatonists iamblicus porphyry or plotinus or proclus on the same level as the sound dialectic philosophy of plato himself  and these neoplatonists were all more or less believers in magictheurgy as it was calledin the power of charms and spells in the occult virtues of herbs and gems in the power of adepts to evoke and command spirits in the significance of dreams in the influence of the stars upon mens characters and destinies  if the great and wise philosopher iamblicus believed such things why might not the men of the sixteenth century  and so grew up again in europe a passion for what were called the occult sciences  it had always been haunting the european imagination  mediaeval monks had long ago transformed the poet virgil into a great necromancer and there were immense excuses for such a belief  there was a mass of collateral evidence that the occult sciences were true which it was impossible then to resist  races far more ancient learned civilised than any frenchman german englishman or even italian in the fifteenth century had believed in these things  the moors the best physicians of the middle ages had their heads full as the arabian nights prove of enchanters genii peris and what not  the jewish rabbis had their cabala which sprang up in alexandria a system of philosophy founded on the mystic meaning of the words and the actual letters of the text of scripture which some said was given by the angel ragiel to adam in paradise by which adam talked with angels the sun and moon summoned spirits interpreted dreams healed and destroyed and by that book of ragiel as it was called solomon became the great magician and master of all the spirits and their hoarded treasures  so strong indeed was the belief in the mysteries of the cabala that reuchlin the restorer of hebrew learning in germany and pico di mirandola the greatest of italian savants accepted them and not only pope leo x himself but even statesmen and warriors received with delight reuchlins cabalistic treatise de verbo mirifico on the mystic word schemhamphorashthat hidden name of god which whosoever can pronounce aright is for the moment lord of nature and of all daemons  amulets too and talismans the faith in them was exceeding ancient solomon had his seal by which he commanded all daemons and there is a whole literature of curious nonsense which you may read if you will about the abraxas and other talismans of the gnostics in syria and another of the secret virtues which were supposed to reside in gems especially in the old roman and greek gems carved into intaglios with figures of heathen gods and goddesses  lapidaria or lists of these gems and their magical virtues were not uncommon in the middle ages  you may read a great deal that is interesting about them at the end of mr kings book on gems  astrology too though pico di mirandola might set himself against the rest of the world few were found daring enough to deny so ancient a science  luther and melancthon merely followed the regular tradition of public opinion when they admitted its truth  it sprang probably from the worship of the seven planets by the old chaldees  it was brought back from babylon by the jews after the captivity and spread over all europeperhaps all asia likewise  the rich and mighty of the earth must needs have their nativities cast and consult the stars and cornelius agrippa gave mortal offence to the queendowager of france mother of francis i because when she compelled him to consult the stars about franciss chance of getting out of his captivity in spain after the battle of pavia he wrote and spoke his mind honestly about such nonsense  even newton seems to have hankered after it when young  among his mss in lord portsmouths library at hurstbourne are whole folios of astrologic calculations  it went on till the end of the seventeenth century and died out only when men had begun to test it and all other occult sciences by experience and induction founded thereon  countless students busied themselves over the transmutation of metals  as for magic necromancy pyromancy geomancy coscinomancy and all the other manciesthere was then a whole literature about them  and the witchburning inquisitors like sprenger bodin delrio and the rest believed as firmly in the magic powers of the poor wretches whom they tortured to death as did in many cases the poor wretches themselves  everyone almost believed in magic  take two cases  read the story which benvenuto cellini the sculptor tells in his life everyone should read it of the magician whom he consults in the coliseum at rome and the figure which he sees as he walks back with the magician jumping from roof to roof along the tiles of the houses  and listen to this story which mr froude has dug up in his researches a church commissioner at oxford at the beginning of the reformation being unable to track an escaped heretic caused a figure to be made by an expert in astronomy by which it was discovered that the poor wretch had fled in a tawny coat and was making for the sea  conceive the respected head of your collegeor whoever he may bein case you slept out all night without leave going to a witch to discover whether you had gone to london or to huntingdon and then writing solemnly to inform the bishop of ely of his meritorious exertions  in such a mad world as this was paracelsus born  the son of a swiss physician but of noble blood philip aureolus theophrastus was his christian name bombast von hohenheim his surname which last word he turned after the fashion of the times into paracelsus  born in 1493 at einsiedeln the hermitage in schweiz which is still a famous place of pilgrimage he was often called eremitathe hermit  erasmus in a letter still extant but suspected not to be genuine addressed him by that name  how he passed the first thirtythree years of his life it is hard to say he used to boast that he had wandered over all europe been in sweden italy in constantinople and perhaps in the far east with barbersurgeons alchemists magicians haunting mines and forges of sweden and bohemia especially those which the rich merchants of that day had in the tyrol  it was from that work he said that he learnt what he knew from the study of nature and of facts  he had heard all the learned doctors and professors he had read all their books and they could teach him nothing  medicine was his monarch and no one else  he declared that there was more wisdom under his bald pate than in aristotle and galen hippocrates and rhasis  and fact seemed to be on his side  he reappeared in germany about 1525 and began working wondrous cures  he had brought back with him from the east an arcanum a secret remedy and laudanum was its name  he boasted says one of his enemies that he could raise the dead to life with it and so the event all but proved basle was then the university where free thought and free creeds found their safest home and hither oecolampadius the reformer invited young paracelsus to lecture on medicine and natural science  it would have been well for him perhaps had he never opened his lips he might have done good enough to his fellowcreatures by his own undoubted powers of healing  he cured john frobenius the printer erasmuss friend at basle when the doctors were going to cut his leg off  his fame spread far and wide  round basle and away into alsace he was looked on even an enemy says as a new aesculapius  but these were days in which in a university everyone was expected to talk and teach and so paracelsus began lecturing and then the weakness which was mingled with his strength showed itself  he began by burning openly the books of galen and avicenna and declared that all the old knowledge was useless  doctors and students alike must begin over again with him  the dons were horrified  to burn galen and avicenna was as bad as burning the bible  and more horrified still were they when paracelsus began lecturing not in the timehonoured doglatin but in good racy german which everyone could understand  they shuddered under their red gowns and hats  if science was to be taught in german farewell to the galenists formulas and their lucrative monopoly of learning  paracelsus was bold enough to say that he wished to break up their monopoly to spread a popular knowledge of medicine  how much he wrote once would i endure and suffer to see every man his own shepherdhis own healer  he laughed to scorn their long prescriptions used the simplest drugs and declared nature after all to be the best physicianas a dog he says licks his wound well again without our help or as the broken rib of the ox heals of its own accord  such a man was not to be endured  they hated him he says for the same reason that they hated luther for the same reason that the pharisees hated christ  he met their attacks with scorn rage and language as coarse and violent as their own  the coarseness and violence of those days seem incredible to us now and indeed paracelsus as he confessed himself was though of gentle blood rough and unpolished and utterly as one can see from his writings unable to give and take to conciliateperhaps to pardon  he looked impatiently on these men who were not unreasonably opposing novelties which they could not understand as enemies of god who were balking him in his grand plan for regenerating science and alleviating the woes of humanity and he outraged their prejudices instead of soothing them  soon they had their revenge  ugly stories were whispered about oporinus the printer who had lived with him for two years and who left him it is said because he thought paracelsus concealed from him unfairly the secret of making laudanum told how paracelsus was neither more nor less than a sot who came drunk to his lectures used to prime himself with wine before going to his patients and sat all night in pothouses swilling with the boors  men looked coldly on himlonged to be rid of him  and they soon found an opportunity  he took in hand some canon of the city from whom it was settled beforehand that he was to receive a hundred florins  the priest found himself cured so suddenly and easily that by a strange logic he refused to pay the money and went to the magistrates  they supported him and compelled paracelsus to take six florins instead of the hundred he spoke his mind fiercely to them  i believe according to one story he drew his long sword on the canon  his best friends told him he must leave the place and within two years seemingly after his first triumph at basle he fled from it a wanderer and a beggar  the rest of his life is a blank  he is said to have recommenced his old wanderings about europe studying the diseases of every country and writing his books which were none of them published till after his death  his enemies joyfully trampled on the fallen man  he was a dull rustic a monster an atheist a quack a maker of gold a magician when he was drunk one wetter his servant told erastus one of his enemies that he used to offer to call up legions of devils to prove his skill while wetter in abject terror of his spells entreated him to leave the fiends alonethat he had sent his book by a fiend to the spirit of galen in hell and challenged him to say which was the better system his or paracelsus and what not  his books were forbidden to be printed  he himself was refused a hearing and it was not till after ten years of wandering that he found rest and protection in a little village of carinthia  three years afterwards he died in the hospital of st sebastian at salzburg in the tyrol  his death was the signal for empirics and visionaries to foist on the public book after book on occult philosophy written in his nameof which you may see ten foliosnot more than a quarter i believe genuine  and these foolish books as much as anything have helped to keep up the popular prejudice against one who in spite of all his faults was a true pioneer of science 15  i believe with those moderns who have tried to do him justice that under all his verbiage and confusion there was a vein of sound scientific experimental common sense  when he talks of astronomy as necessary to be known by a physician it seems to me that he laughs at astrology properly so called that is that the stars influence the character and destiny of man  mars he says did not make nero cruel  there would have been longlived men in the world if saturn had never ascended the skies and helen would have been a wanton though venus had never been created  but he does believe that the heavenly bodies and the whole skies have a physical influence on climate and on the health of men  he talks of alchemy but he means by it i think only that sound science which we call chemistry and at which he worked wandering he says among mines and forges as a practical metallurgist  he tells uswhat sounds startling enoughthat magic is the only preceptor which can teach the art of healing but he means it seems to me only an understanding of the invisible processes of nature in which sense an electrician or a biologist a faraday or a darwin would be a magician and when he compares medical magic to the cabalistic science of which i spoke just now and in which he seems to have believed he only means i think that as the cabala discovers hidden meaning and virtues in the text of scripture so ought the man of science to find them in the book of nature  but this kind of talk wrapt up too in the most confused style or rather no style at all is quite enough to account for ignorant and envious people accusing him of magic saying that he had discovered the philosophers stone and the secret of hermes trismegistus that he must make gold because though he squandered all his money he had always money in hand and that he kept a devilsbird a familiar spirit in the pommel of that famous long sword of his which he was only too ready to lug out on provocationthe said spirit agoth by name being probably only the laudanum bottle with which he worked so many wondrous cures and of which to judge from his writings he took only too freely himself  but the charm of paracelsus is in his humour his motherwit  he was blamed for consorting with boors in pothouses blamed for writing in racy german instead of bad schoollatin but you can hardly read a chapter either of his german or his doglatin without finding many a good thingwitty and weighty though often not a little coarse  he talks in parables  he draws illustrations like socrates of old from the commonest and the oddest matters to enforce the weightiest truths fortune and misfortune he says for instance nobly enough are not like snow and wind they must be deduced and known from the secrets of nature  therefore misfortune is ignorance fortune is knowledge  the man who walks out in the rain is not unfortunate if he gets a ducking  nature he says again makes the text and the medical man adds the gloss but the two fit each other no better than a dog does a bath and again when he is arguing against the doctors who hated chemistrywho hates a thing which has hurt nobody  will you complain of a dog for biting you if you lay hold of his tail  does the emperor send the thief to the gallows or the thing which he has stolen  the thief i think therefore science should not be despised on account of some who know nothing about it  you will say the reasoning is not very clear and indeed the passage like too many more smacks strongly of wine and laudanum  but such is his quaint racy style  as humorous a man it seems to me as you shall meet with for many a day and where there is humour there is pretty sure to be imagination tenderness and depth of heart  as for his notions of what a man of science should be the servant of god and of naturewhich is the work of godusing his powers not for money not for ambition but in love and charity as he says for the good of his fellowmanon that matter paracelsus is always noble  all that mr browning has conceived on that point all the noble speeches which he has put into paracelsuss mouth are true to his writings  how can they be otherwise if mr browning set them fortha genius as accurate and penetrating as he is wise and pure  but was paracelsus a drunkard after all  gentlemen what concern is that of yours or mine  i have gone into the question as mr browning did cannot say and dont care to say  oporinus who slandered him so cruelly recanted when paracelsus was dead and sang his praisestoo late  but i do not read that he recanted the charge of drunkenness  his defenders allow it only saying that it was the fault not of him alone but of all germans  but if so why was he specially blamed for what certainly others did likewise  i cannot but fear from his writings as well as from common report that there was something wrong with the man  i say only something  against his purity there never was a breath of suspicion  he was said to care nothing for women and even that was made the subject of brutal jests and lies  but it may have been that worn out with toil and poverty he found comfort in that laudanum which he believed to be the arcanumthe very elixir of life that he got more and more into the habit of exciting his imagination with the narcotic and then it may be when the fit of depression followed he strung his nerves up again by wine  it may have been so  we have had in the last generation an exactly similar case in a philosopher now i trust in heaven and to whose genius i owe too much to mention his name here  but that paracelsus was a sot i cannot believe  that face of his as painted by the great tintoretto is not the face of a drunkard quack bully but of such a man as browning has conceived  the great globular brain the sharp delicate chin is not that of a sot  nor are those eyes which gleam out from under the deep compressed brow wild intense hungry homeless defiant and yet complaining the eyes of a sotbut rather the eyes of a man who struggles to tell a great secret and cannot find words for it and yet wonders why men cannot understand will not believe what seems to him as clear as daya tragical face as you well can see  god keep us all from making our lives a tragedy by one great sin  and now let us end this sad story with the last words which mr browning puts into the mouth of paracelsus dying in the hospital at salzburg which have come literally true     meanwhile i have done well though not all well    as yet men cannot do without contempt    tis for their good and therefore fit awhile    that they reject the weak and scorn the false    rather than praise the strong and true in me    but after they will know me  if i stoop    into a dark tremendous sea of cloud    it is but for a time  i press gods lamp    close to my breast its splendour soon or late    will pierce the gloom  i shall emerge one day     george buchanan scholar   the scholar in the sixteenth century was a far more important personage than now  the supply of learned men was very small the demand for them very great  during the whole of the fifteenth and a great part of the sixteenth century the human mind turned more and more from the scholastic philosophy of the middle ages to that of the romans and the greeks and found more and more in old pagan art an element which monastic art had not and which was yet necessary for the full satisfaction of their craving after the beautiful  at such a crisis of thought and taste it was natural that the classical scholar the man who knew old rome and still more old greece should usurp the place of the monk as teacher of mankind and that scholars should form for a while a new and powerful aristocracy limited and privileged and all the more redoubtable because its power lay in intellect and had been won by intellect alone  those who whether poor or rich did not fear the monk and priest at least feared the scholar who held so the vulgar believed the keys of that magic lore by which the old necromancers had built cities like rome and worked marvels of mechanical and chemical skill which the degenerate modern could never equal  if the scholar stopped in a town his hostess probably begged of him a charm against toothache or rheumatism  the penniless knight discoursed with him on alchemy and the chances of retrieving his fortune by the art of transmuting metals into gold  the queen or bishop worried him in private about casting their nativities and finding their fates among the stars  but the statesman who dealt with more practical matters hired him as an advocate and rhetorician who could fight his masters enemies with the weapons of demosthenes and cicero  wherever the scholars steps were turned he might be master of others as long as he was master of himself  the complaints which he so often uttered concerning the cruelty of fortune the fickleness of princes and so forth were probably no more just then than such complaints are now  then as now he got his deserts and the world bought him at his own price  if he chose to sell himself to this patron and to that he was used and thrown away if he chose to remain in honourable independence he was courted and feared  among the successful scholars of the sixteenth century none surely is more notable than george buchanan  the poor scotch widows son by force of native wit and as i think by force of native worth fights his way upward through poverty and severest persecution to become the correspondent and friend of the greatest literary celebrities of the continent comparable in their opinion to the best latin poets of antiquity the preceptor of princes the counsellor and spokesman of scotch statesmen in the most dangerous of times and leaves behind him political treatises which have influenced not only the history of his own country but that of the civilised world  such a success could not be attained without making enemies perhaps without making mistakes  but the more we study george buchanans history the less we shall be inclined to hunt out his failings the more inclined to admire his worth  a shrewd soundhearted affectionate man with a strong love of right and scorn of wrong and a humour withal which saved himexcept on really great occasionsfrom bitterness and helped him to laugh where narrower natures would have only snarledhe is in many respects a type of those lowland scots who long preserved his jokes genuine or reputed as a common household book 16  a schoolmaster by profession and struggling for long years amid the temptations which in those days degraded his class into cruel and sordid pedants he rose from the mere pedagogue to be in the best sense of the word a courtier one says daniel heinsius who seemed not only born for a court but born to amend it  he brought to his queen that at which she could not wonder enough  for by affecting a certain liberty in censuring morals he avoided all offence under the cloak of simplicity  of him and his compeers turnebus and muretus and their friend andrea govea ronsard the french court poet said that they had nothing of the pedagogue about them but the gown and cap  austere in face and rustic in his looks says david buchanan but most polished in style and speech and continually even in serious conversation jesting most wittily  roughhewn slovenly and rude says peacham in his compleat gentleman speaking of him probably as he appeared in old age in his person behaviour and fashion seldom caring for a better outside than a ruggegown girt close about him yet his inside and conceipt in poesie was most rich and his sweetness and facilitie in verse most excellent  a typical lowland scot as i said just now he seems to have absorbed all the best culture which france could afford him without losing the strength honesty and humour which he inherited from his stirlingshire kindred  the story of his life is easily traced  when an old man he himself wrote down the main events of it at the request of his friends and his sketch has been filled out by commentators if not always favourable at least erudite  born in 1506 at the moss in killearnwhere an obelisk to his memory so one reads has been erected in this centuryof a family rather ancient than rich his father dead in the prime of manhood his grandfather a spendthrift he and his seven brothers and sisters were brought up by a widowed mother agnes heriotof whom one wishes to know more for the rule that great sons have great mothers probably holds good in her case  george gave signs while at the village school of future scholarship and when he was only fourteen his uncle james sent him to the university of paris  those were hard times and the youths or rather boys who meant to become scholars had a cruel life of it cast desperately out on the wide world to beg and starve either into selfrestraint and success or into ruin of body and soul and a cruel life george had  within two years he was down in a severe illness his uncle dead his supplies stopped and the boy of sixteen got home he does not tell how  then he tried soldiering and was with albanys french auxiliaries at the ineffectual attack on wark castle marching back through deep snow he got a fresh illness which kept him in bed all winter  then he and his brother were sent to st andrews where he got his ba at nineteen  the next summer he went to france once more and fell he says into the flames of the lutheran sect which was then spreading far and wide  two years of penury followed and then three years of schoolmastering in the college of st barbe which he has immortalisedat least for the few who care to read modern latin poetryin his elegy on the miseries of a parisian teacher of the humanities  the wretched regentmaster pale and suffering sits up all night preparing his lecture biting his nails and thumping his desk and falls asleep for a few minutes to start up at the sound of the fouroclock bell and be in school by five his virgil in one hand and his rod in the other trying to do work on his own account at old manuscripts and bawling all the while at his wretched boys who cheat him and pay each other to answer to truants names  the class is all wrong  one is barefoot anothers shoe is burst another cries another writes home  then comes the rod the sound of blows and howls and the day passes in tears  then mass then another lesson then more blows there is hardly time to eat  i have no space to finish the picture of the stupid misery which buchanan says was ruining his intellect while it starved his body  however happier days came  gilbert kennedy earl of cassilis who seems to have been a noble young gentleman took him as his tutor for the next five years and with him he went back to scotland  but there his plain speaking got him as it did more than once afterward into trouble  he took it into his head to write in imitation of dunbar a latin poem in which st francis asks him in a dream to become a gray friar and buchanan answered in language which had the unpleasant fault of being too clever andto judge from contemporary evidenceonly too true  the friars said nothing at first but when king james made buchanan tutor to one of his natural sons they men professing meekness took the matter somewhat more angrily than befitted men so pious in the opinion of the people  so buchanan himself puts it but to do the poor friars justice they must have been angels not men if they did not writhe somewhat under the scourge which he had laid on them to be told that there was hardly a place in heaven for monks was hard to hear and bear  they accused him to the king of heresy but not being then in favour with james they got no answer and buchanan was commanded to repeat the castigation  having found out that the friars were not to be touched with impunity he wrote he says a short and ambiguous poem but the king who loved a joke demanded something sharp and stinging and buchanan obeyed by writing but not publishing the franciscans a long satire compared to which the somnium was bland and merciful  the storm rose  cardinal beaten buchanan says wanted to buy him of the king and then of course burn him as he had just burnt five poor souls so knowing jamess avarice he fled to england through freebooters and pestilence  there he found he says men of both factions being burned on the same day and in the same firea pardonable exaggerationby henry viii in his old age more intent on his own safety than on the purity of religion  so to his beloved france he went again to find his enemy beaten ambassador at paris  the capital was too hot to hold him and he fled south to bordeaux to andrea govea the portuguese principal of the college of guienne  as professor of latin at bordeaux we find him presenting a latin poem to charles v and indulging that fancy of his for latin poetry which seems to us nowadays a childish pedantry which was thenwhen latin was the vernacular tongue of all scholarsa serious if not altogether a useful pursuit  of his tragedies so famous in their daythe baptist the medea the jephtha and the alcestisthere is neither space nor need to speak here save to notice the bold declamations in the baptist against tyranny and priestcraft and to notice also that these tragedies gained for the poor scotsman in the eyes of the best scholars of europe a credit amounting almost to veneration  when he returned to paris he found occupation at once and as his scots biographers love to record three of the most learned men in the world taught humanity in the same college viz  turnebus muretus and buchanan  then followed a strange episode in his life  a university had been founded at coimbra in portugal and andrea govea had been invited to bring thither what french savants he could collect  buchanan went to portugal with his brother patrick two more scotsmen dempster and ramsay and a goodly company of french scholars whose names and histories may be read in the erudite pages of dr irving went likewise all prospered in the new temple of the muses for a year or so  then its highpriest govea died and by a peripeteia too common in those days and countries buchanan and two of his friends migrated unwillingly from the temple of the muses for that of moloch and found themselves in the inquisition  buchanan it seems had said that st augustine was more of a lutheran than a catholic on the question of the mass  he and his friends had eaten flesh in lent which he says almost everyone in spain did  but he was suspected and with reason as a heretic the gray friars formed but one brotherhood throughout europe and news among them travelled surely if not fast so that the story of the satire written in scotland had reached portugal  the culprits were imprisoned examined bulliedbut not torturedfor a year and a half  at the end of that time the proofs of heresy it seems were insufficient but lest says buchanan with honest pride they should get the reputation of having vainly tormented a man not altogether unknown they sent him for some months to a monastery to be instructed by the monks  the men he says were neither inhuman nor bad but utterly ignorant of religion and buchanan solaced himself during the intervals of their instructions by beginning his latin translation of the psalms  at last he got free and begged leave to return to france but in vain and so wearied out he got on board a candian ship at lisbon and escaped to england  but england he says during the anarchy of edward vis reign was not a land which suited him and he returned to france to fulfil the hopes which he had expressed in his charming desiderium lutitiae and the still more charming because more simple adventus in galliam in which he bids farewell in most melodious verse to the hungry moors of wretched portugal and her clods fertile in naught but penury  some seven years succeeded of schoolmastering and versewriting the latin paraphrase of the psalms another of the alcestis of euripides an epithalamium on the marriage of poor mary stuart noble and sincere however fantastic and pedantic after the manner of the times pomps too for her wedding and for other public ceremonies in which all the heathen gods and goddesses figure epigrams panegyrics satires much of which latter productions he would have consigned to the dustheap in his old age had not his too fond friends persuaded him to republish the follies and coarsenesses of his youth  he was now one of the most famous scholars in europe and the intimate friend of all the great literary men  was he to go on to the end die and no more  was he to sink into the mere pedant or if he could not do that into the mere court versifier  the wars of religion saved him as they saved many another noble soul from that degradation  the events of 156062 forced buchanan as they forced many a learned man besides to choose whether he would be a child of light or a child of darkness whether he would be a dilettante classicist or a preacherit might be a martyrof the gospel  buchanan may have left france in the troubles merely to enjoy in his own country elegant and learned repose  he may have fancied that he had found it when he saw himself in spite of his public profession of adherence to the reformed kirk reading livy every afternoon with his exquisite young sovereign master by her favour of the temporalities of crossraguel abbey and by the favour of murray principal of st leonards college in st andrews  perhaps he fancied at times that tomorrow was to be as today and much more abundant that thenceforth he might read his folio and write his epigram and joke his joke as a lazy comfortable pluralist taking his morning stroll out to the corner where poor wishart had been burned above the blue sea and the yellow sands and looking up to the castle tower from whence his enemy beatons corpse had been hung out with the comfortable reflection that quieter times had come and that whatever evil deeds archbishop hamilton might dare he would not dare to put the principal of st leonards into the bottle dungeon  if such hopes ever crossed geordies keen fancy they were disappointed suddenly and fearfully  the fire which had been kindled in france was to reach to scotland likewise  revolutions are not made with rosewater and the time was at hand when all good spirits in scotland and george buchanan among them had to choose once and for all amid danger confusion terror whether they would serve god or mammon for to serve both would be soon impossible  which side in that war of light and darkness george buchanan took is notorious  he saw then as others have seen since that the two men in scotland who were capable of being her captains in the strife were knox and murray and to them he gave in his allegiance heart and soul  this is the critical epoch in buchanans life  by his conduct to queen mary he must stand or fall  it is my belief that he will stand  it is not my intention to enter into the details of a matter so painful so shocking so prodigious and now that that question is finally set at rest by the writings both of mr froude and mr burton there is no need to allude to it further save where buchanans name is concerned  one may now have every sympathy with mary stuart one may regard with awe a figure so stately so tragic in one sense so heroicfor she reminds one rather of the heroine of an old greek tragedy swept to her doom by some irresistible fate than of a being of our own flesh and blood and of our modern and christian times  one may sympathise with the great womanhood which charmed so many while she was alive which has charmed in later years so many noble spirits who have believed in her innocence and have doubtless been elevated and purified by their devotion to one who seemed to them an ideal being  so far from regarding her as a hateful personage one may feel oneself forbidden to hate a woman whom god may have loved and may have pardoned to judge from the punishment so swift and yet so enduring which he inflicted  at least he must so believe who holds that punishment is a sign of mercy that the most dreadful of all dooms is impunity  nay more those casket letters and sonnets may be a relief to the mind of one who believes in her guilt on other grounds a relief when one finds in them a tenderness a sweetness a delicacy a magnificent selfsacrifice however hideously misplaced which shows what a womanly heart was there a heart which joined to that queenly brain might have made her a blessing and a glory to scotland had not the whole character been warped and ruinate from childhood by an education so abominable that anyone who knows what words she must have heard what scenes she must have beheld in france from her youth up will wonder that she sinned so little not that she sinned so much  one may feel in a word that there is every excuse for those who have asserted marys innocence because their own highmindedness shrank from believing her guilty but yet buchanan in his own place and time may have felt as deeply that he could do no otherwise than he did  the charges against him as all readers of scotch literature know well may be reduced to two heads  1st  the letters and sonnets were forgeries  maitland of lethington may have forged the letters buchanan according to some the sonnets  whoever forged them buchanan made use of them in his detection knowing them to be forged  2nd  whether mary was innocent or not buchanan acted a base and ungrateful part in putting himself in the forefront amongst her accusers  he had been her tutor her pensioner  she had heaped him with favours and after all she was his queen and a defenceless woman and yet he returned her kindness in the hour of her fall by invectives fit only for a rancorous and reckless advocate determined to force a verdict by the basest arts of oratory  now as to the casket letters  i should have thought they bore in themselves the best evidence of being genuine  i can add nothing to the arguments of mr froude and mr burton save this that no one clever enough to be a forger would have put together documents so incoherent and so incomplete  for the evidence of guilt which they contain is after all slight and indirect and moreover superfluous altogether seeing that marys guilt was open and palpable before the supposed discovery of the letters to every person at home and abroad who had any knowledge of the facts  as for the alleged inconsistency of the letters with proven facts the answer is that whosoever wrote the letters would be more likely to know facts which were taking place around them than any critic could be one hundred or three hundred years afterwards  but if these mistakes as to facts actually exist in them they are only a fresh argument for their authenticity  mary writing in agony and confusion might easily make a mistake forgers would only take too good care to make none  but the strongest evidence in favour of the letters and sonnets in spite of the arguments of good dr whittaker and other apologists for mary is to be found in their tone  a forger in those coarse days would have made mary write in some semiramis or roxana vein utterly alien to the tenderness the delicacy the pitiful confusion of mind the conscious weakness the imploring and most feminine trust which makes the letters to those whoas i dobelieve in them more pathetic than any fictitious sorrows which poets could invent  more than one touch indeed of utter selfabasement in the second letter is so unexpected so subtle and yet so true to the heart of woman thatas has been well saidif it was invented there must have existed in scotland an earlier shakespeare who yet has died without leaving any other sign for good or evil of his dramatic genius  as for the theory totally unsupported that buchanan forged the poem usually called the sonnets it is paying old geordies genius however versatile it may have been too high a compliment to believe that he could have written both them and the detection while it is paying his shrewdness too low a compliment to believe that he could have put into them out of mere carelessness or stupidity the wellknown line which seems incompatible with the theory both of the letters and of his own detection and which has ere now been brought forward as a fresh proof of marys innocence  and as with the letters so with the sonnets their delicacy their grace their reticence are so many arguments against their having been forged by any scot of the sixteenth century and least of all by one in whose characterwhatever his other virtues may have beendelicacy was by no means the strongest point  as for the complaint that buchanan was ungrateful to mary it must be said that even if she and not murray had bestowed on him the temporalities of crossraguel abbey four years before it was merely fair pay for services fairly rendered and i am not aware that payment or even favours however gracious bind any mans soul and conscience in questions of highest morality and highest public importance  and the importance of that question cannot be exaggerated  at a moment when scotland seemed struggling in deaththroes of anarchy civil and religious and was in danger of becoming a prey either to england or to france if there could not be formed out of the heart of her a people steadfast trusty united strong politically because strong in the fear of god and the desire of righteousnessat such a moment as this a crime had been committed the like of which had not been heard in europe since the tragedy of joan of naples  all europe stood aghast  the honour of the scottish nation was at stake  more than mary or bothwell were known to be implicated in the deed andas buchanan puts it in the opening of his de jure regnithe fault of some few was charged upon all and the common hatred of a particular person did redound to the whole nation so that even such as were remote from any suspicion were inflamed by the infamy of mens crimes 17  to vindicate the national honour and to punish the guilty as well as to save themselves from utter anarchy the great majority of the scotch nation had taken measures against mary which required explicit justification in the sight of europe as buchanan frankly confesses in the opening of his de jure regni  the chief authors of those measures had been summoned perhaps unwisely and unjustly to answer for their conduct to the queen of england  queen elizabetha fact which was notorious enough then though it has been forgotten till the last few yearswas doing her utmost to shield mary  buchanan was deputed it seems to speak out for the people of scotland and certainly never people had an abler apologist  if he spoke fiercely savagely it must be remembered that he spoke of a fierce and savage matter if he usedand it may be abusedall the arts of oratory it must be remembered that he was fighting for the honour and it may be for the national life of his country and strikingas men in such cases have a right to strikeas hard as he could  if he makes no secret of his indignation and even contempt it must be remembered that indignation and contempt may well have been real with him while they were real with the soundest part of his countrymen with that reforming middle class comparatively untainted by french profligacy comparatively undebauched by feudal subservience which has been the leaven which has leavened the whole scottish people in the last three centuries with the elements of their greatness  if finally he heaps up against the unhappy queen charges which mr burton thinks incredible it must be remembered that as he well says these charges give the popular feeling about queen mary and it must be remembered also that that popular feeling need not have been altogether unfounded  stories which are incredible thank god in these milder days were credible enough then because alas they were so often true things more ugly than any related of poor mary were possible enoughas no one knew better than buchananin that very french court in which mary had been brought up things as ugly were possible in scotland then and for at least a century later and while we may hope that buchanan has overstated his case we must not blame him too severely for yielding to a temptation common to all men of genius when their creative power is roused to its highest energy by a great cause and a great indignation  and that the genius was there no man can doubt one cannot read that hideously eloquent description of kirk o field which mr burton has well chosen as a specimen of buchanans style without seeing that we are face to face with a genius of a very lofty order not indeed of the loftiestfor there is always in buchanans work it seems to me a want of unconsciousness and a want of tendernessbut still a genius worthy to be placed beside those ancient writers from whom he took his manner whether or not we agree with his contemporaries who say that he equalled virgil in latin poetry we may place him fairly as a prose writer by the side of demosthenes cicero or tacitus  and so i pass from this painful subject only quotingif i may be permitted to quotemr burtons wise and gentle verdict on the whole  buchanan he says though a zealous protestant had a good deal of the catholic and sceptical spirit of erasmus and an admiring eye for everything that was great and beautiful like the rest of his countrymen he bowed himself in presence of the lustre that surrounded the early career of his mistress  more than once he expressed his pride and reverence in the inspiration of a genius deemed by his contemporaries to be worthy of the theme  there is not perhaps to be found elsewhere in literature so solemn a memorial of shipwrecked hopes of a sunny opening and a stormy end as one finds in turning the leaves of the volume which contains the beautiful epigram nympha caledoniae in one part the detectio mariae reginae in another and this contrast is no doubt a faithful parallel of the reaction in the popular mind  this reaction seems to have been general and not limited to the protestant party for the conditions under which it became almost a part of the creed of the church of rome to believe in her innocence had not arisen  if buchanan as some of his detractors have thought raised himself by subserviency to the intrigues of the regent murray the best heads in scotland seem to have been of a different opinion  the murder of murray did not involve buchanans fall  he had avenged it as far as pen could do it by that admonition direct to the trew lordis in which he showed himself as great a master of scottish as he was of latin prose  his satire of the chameleon though its publication was stopped by maitland must have been read in manuscript by many of those same true lords and though there were nobler instincts in maitland than any buchanan gave him credit for the satire breathed an honest indignation against that wily turncoats misgoings which could not but recommend the author to all honest men  therefore it was i presume and not because he was a rogue and a hired literary spadassin that to the best heads in scotland he seemed so useful it may be so worthy a man that he be provided with continually increasing employment  as tutor to james i as director for a short time of the chancery as keeper of the privy seal and privy councillor as one of the commissioners for codifying the laws and againfor in the semianarchic state of scotland government had to do everything in the way of organisationin the committee for promulgating a standard latin grammar in the committee for reforming the university of st andrews in all these buchanans talents were again and again called for and always ready  the value of his work especially that for the reform of st andrews must be judged by scotsmen rather than by an englishman but all that one knows of it justifies melvilles sentence in the wellknown passage in his memoirs wherein he describes the tutors and household of the young king  mr george was a stoic philosopher who looked not far before him in plain words a highminded and rightminded man bent on doing the duty which lay nearest him  the worst that can be said against him during these times is that his name appears with the sum of 100 pounds against it as one of those who were to be entertained in scotland by pensions out of england and ruddiman of course comments on the fact by saying that buchanan was at length to act under the threefold character of malcontent reformer and pensioner but it gives no proof whatsoever that buchanan ever received any such bribe and in the very month seemingly in which that list was written10th march 1579buchanan had given a proof to the world that he was not likely to be bribed or bought by publishing a book as offensive probably to queen elizabeth as it was to his own royal pupil namely his famous de jure regni apud scotos the very primer according to many great thinkers of constitutional liberty  he dedicates that book to king james not only as his monitor but also as an importunate and bold exactor which in these his tender and flexible years may conduct him in safety past the rocks of flattery he has complimented james already on his abhorrence of flattery his inclination far above his years for undertaking all heroical and noble attempts his promptitude in obeying his instructors and governors and all who give him sound admonition and his judgment and diligence in examining affairs so that no mans authority can have much weight with him unless it be confirmed by probable reasons  buchanan may have thought that nine years of his stern rule had eradicated some of jamess ill conditions the petulance which made him kill the master of mars sparrow in trying to wrest it out of his hand the carelessness with whichif the story told by chytraeus on the authority of buchanans nephew be truejames signed away his crown to buchanan for fifteen days and only discovered his mistake by seeing bachanan act in open court the character of king of scots  buchanan had at last made him a scholar he may have fancied that he had made him likewise a manful man yet he may have dreaded that as james grew up the old inclinations would return in stronger and uglier shapes and that flattery might be as it was after all the cause of jamess moral ruin  he at least will be no flatterer  he opens the dialogue which he sends to the king with a calm but distinct assertion of his mothers guilt and a justification of the conduct of men who were now most of them past helping buchanan for they were laid in their graves and then goes on to argue fairly but to lay down firmly in a sort of socratic dialogue those very principles by loyalty to which the house of hanover has reigned and will reign over these realms  so with his history of scotland later antiquarian researches have destroyed the value of the earlier portions of it but they have surely increased the value of those later portions in which buchanan inserted so much which he had already spoken out in his detection of mary  in that book also liberavit animam suam he spoke his mind fearless of consequences in the face of a king who he must have knownfor buchanan was no dullardregarded him with deep dislike who might in a few years be able to work his ruin  but those few years were not given to buchanan  he had all but done his work and he hastened to get it over before the night should come wherein no man can work  one must be excused for tellingone would not tell it in a book intended to be read only by scotsmen who know or ought to know the tale alreadyhow the two melvilles and buchanans nephew thomas went to see him in edinburgh in september 1581 hearing that he was ill and his history still in the press and how they found the old sage true to his schoolmasters instincts teaching the hornbook to his servantlad and how he told them that doing that was better than stealing sheep or sitting idle which was as bad and showed them that dedication to james i in which he holds up to his imitation as a hero whose equal was hardly to be found in history that very king david whose liberality to the romish church provoked jamess witticism that david was a sair saint for the crown  andrew melville so james melville says found fault with the style  buchanan replied that he could do no more for thinking of another thing which was to die  they then went to arbuthnots printinghouse and inspected the history as far as that terrible passage concerning rizzios burial where mary is represented as laying the miscreant almost in the arms of maud de valois the late queen alarmed and not without reason at such plain speaking they stopped the press and went back to buchanans house  buchanan was in bed  he was going he said the way of welfare  they asked him to soften the passage the king might prohibit the whole work  tell me man said buchanan if i have told the truth  they could not or would not deny it  then i will abide his feud and all his kins pray pray to god for me and let him direct all  so says melville before the printing of his chronicle was ended this most learned wise and godly man ended his mortal life  camden has a hearsay storywritten it must be remembered in james is timethat buchanan on his deathbed repented of his harsh words against queen mary and an old lady rosyth is said to have said that when she was young a certain david buchanan recollected hearing some such words from george buchanans own mouth  those who will may read what ruddiman and love have said and oversaid on both sides of the question whatever conclusion they come to it will probably not be that to which george chalmers comes in his life of ruddiman that buchanan like other liars who by the repetition of falsehoods are induced to consider the fiction as truth had so often dwelt with complacency on the forgeries of his detections and the figments of his history that he at length regarded his fictions and his forgeries as most authentic facts  at all events his fictions and his forgeries had not paid him in that coin which base men generally consider the only coin worth having namely the good things of this life  he left nothing behind himif at least dr irving has rightly construed the testament dative which he gives in his appendixsave arrears to the sum of 100 pounds of his crossraguel pension  we may believe as we choose the story in mackenzies scotch writers that when he felt himself dying he asked his servant young about the state of his funds and finding he had not enough to bury himself withal ordered what he had to be given to the poor and said that if they did not choose to bury him they might let him lie where he was or cast him in a ditch the matter was very little to him  he was buried it seems at the expense of the city of edinburgh in the greyfriars churchyardone says in a plain turf graveamong the marble monuments which covered the bones of worse or meaner men and whether or not the throughstone which sunk under the ground in the greyfriars was raised and cleaned by the council of edinburgh in 1701 was really george buchanans the reigning powers troubled themselves little for several generations where he lay  for buchanans politics were too advanced for his age  not only catholic scotsmen like blackwood winzet and ninian but protestants like sir thomas craig and sir john wemyss could not stomach the de jure regni they may have had some reason on their side  in the then anarchic state of scotland organisation and unity under a common head may have been more important than the assertion of popular rights  be that as it may in 1584 only two years after his death the scots parliament condemned his dialogue and history as untrue and commanded all possessors of copies to deliver them up that they might be purged of the offensive and extraordinary matters which they contained  the de jure regni was again prohibited in scotland in 1664 even in manuscript and in 1683 the whole of buchanans political works had the honour of being burned by the university of oxford in company with those of milton languet and others as pernicious books and damnable doctrines destructive to the sacred persons of princes their state and government and of all human society  and thus the seed which buchanan had sown and milton had wateredfor the allegation that milton borrowed from buchanan is probably true and equally honourable to bothlay trampled into the earth and seemingly lifeless till it tillered out and blossomed and bore fruit to a good purpose in the revolution of 1688  to buchanans clear head and stout heart scotland owes as england owes likewise much of her modern liberty  but scotlands debt to him it seems to me is even greater on the count of morality public and private  what the morality of the scotch upper classes was like in buchanans early days is too notorious and there remains proof enoughin the writings for instance of sir david lindsaythat the morality of the populace which looked up to the nobles as its example and its guide was not a whit better  as anarchy increased immorality was likely to increase likewise and scotland was in serious danger of falling into such a state as that into which poland fell to its ruin within a hundred and fifty years after in which the savagery of feudalism without its order or its chivalry would be varnished over by a thin coating of french civilisation and as in the case of bothwell the vices of the court of paris should be added to those of the northern freebooter  to deliver scotland from that ruin it was needed that she should be united into one people strong not in mere political but in moral ideas strong by the clear sense of right and wrong by the belief in the government and the judgments of a living god  and the tone which buchanan like knox adopted concerning the great crimes of their day helped notably that national salvation  it gathered together organised strengthened the scattered and wavering elements of public morality  it assured the hearts of all men who loved the right and hated the wrong and taught a whole nation to call acts by their just names whoever might be the doers of them  it appealed to the common conscience of men  it proclaimed a universal and godgiven morality a bar at which all from the lowest to the highest must alike be judged  the tone was stern but there was need of sternness  moral life and death were in the balance  if the scots people were to be told that the crimes which roused their indignation were excusable or beyond punishment or to be hushed up and slipped over in any way there was an end of morality among them  every man from the greatest to the least would go and do likewise according to his powers of evil  that method was being tried in france and in spain likewise during those very years  notorious crimes were hushed up under pretence of loyalty excused as political necessities smiled away as natural and pardonable weaknesses  the result was the utter demoralisation both of france and spain  knox and buchanan the one from the standpoint of an old hebrew prophet the other rather from that of a juvenal or a tacitus tried the other method and called acts by their just names appealing alike to conscience and to god  the result was virtue and piety and that manly independence of soul which is thought compatible with hearty loyalty in a country labouring under heavy disadvantages long divided almost into two hostile camps two rival races  and the good influence was soon manifest not only in those who sided with buchanan and his friends but in those who most opposed them  the roman catholic preachers who at first asserted marys right to impurity while they allowed her guilt grew silent for shame and set themselves to assert her entire innocence while the scots who have followed their example have to their honour taken up the same ground  they have fought buchanan on the ground of fact not on the ground of morality they have allegedas they had a fair right to dothe probability of intrigue and forgery in an age so profligate the improbability that a queen so gifted by nature and by fortune and confessedly for a long while so strong and so spotless should as it were by a sudden insanity have proved so untrue to herself  their noblest and purest sympathies have been enlistedand who can blame themin loyalty to a queen chivalry to a woman pity for the unfortunate andas they conceivedthe innocent but whether they have been right or wrong in their view of facts the scotch partisans of mary have alwaysas far as i knowbeen right in their view of morals they have never deigned to admit marys guilt and then to palliate it by those sentimental or rather sensual theories of human nature too common in a certain school of french literature too common alas in a certain school of modern english novels  they have not said she did it but after all was the deed so very inexcusable  they have said the deed was inexcusable but she did not do it  and so the scotch admirers of mary who have numbered among them many a pure and noble as well as many a gifted spirit have kept at least themselves unstained and have shown whether consciously or not that they too share in that sturdy scotch moral sense which has been so much strengthenedas i believe by the plain speech of good old george buchanan     footnotes   1  this lecture was delivered in america in 1874  2  black translator of malletts northern antiquities
