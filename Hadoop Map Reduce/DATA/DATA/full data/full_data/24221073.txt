24221073	four years  by william butler yeats     four years 18871891  at the end of the eighties my father and mother my brother and sisters and myself all newly arrived from dublin were settled in bedford park in a redbrick house with several wood mantlepieces copied from marble mantlepieces by the brothers adam a balcony and a little garden shadowed by a great horsechestnut tree years before we had lived there when the crooked ostentatiously picturesque streets with great trees casting great shadows had been anew enthusiasm the preraphaelite movement at last affecting life but now exaggerated criticism had taken the place of enthusiasm the tiled roofs the first in modern london were said to leak which they did not  the drains to be bad though that was no longer true and i imagine that houses were cheap i remember feeling disappointed because the cooperative stores with their little seventeenth century panes were so like any common shop and because the public house called the tabard after chaucers inn was so plainly a common public house and because the great sign of a trumpeter designed by rooke the pre raphaelite artist had been freshened by some inferior hand the big redbrick church had never pleased me and i was accustomed when i saw the wooden balustrade that ran along the slanting edge of the roof where nobody ever walked or could walk to remember the opinion of some architect friend of my fathers that it had been put there to keep the birds from falling off still however it had some village characters and helped us to feel not wholly lost in the metropolis i no longer went to church as a regular habit but go i sometimes did for one sunday morning i saw these words painted on a board in the porch the congregation are requested to kneel during prayers the kneelers are afterwards to be hung upon pegs provided for the purpose in front of every seat hung a little cushion and these cushions were called kneelers presently the joke ran through the community where there were many artists who considered religion at best an unimportant accessory to good architecture and who disliked that particular church     ii   i could not understand where the charm had gone that i had felt when as a schoolboy of twelve or thirteen i had played among the unfinished houses once leaving the marks of my two hands blacked by a fall among some paint upon a white balustrade sometimes i thought it was because these were real houses while my play had been among toyhouses some day to be inhabited by imaginary people full of the happiness that one can see in picture books i was in all things preraphaelite when i was fifteen or sixteen my father had told me about rossetti and blake and given me their poetry to read  once in liverpool on my way to sligo i had seen dantes dream in the gallery therea picture painted when rossetti had lost his dramatic power and today not very pleasing to meand its colour its people its romantic architecture had blotted all other pictures away it was a perpetual bewilderment that my father who had begun life as a preraphaelite painter now painted portraits of the first comer children selling newspapers or a consumptive girl with a basket offish upon her head and that when moved perhaps by memory of his youth he chose some theme from poetic tradition he would soon weary and leave it unfinished i had seen the change coming bit by bit and its defence elaborated by young men fresh from the paris art schools we must paint what is in front of us or a man must be of his own time they would say and if i spoke of blake or rossetti they would point out his bad drawing and tell me to admire carolus duran and bastienlepage then too they were very ignorant men they read nothing for nothing mattered but knowing how to paint being in reaction against a generation that seemed to have wasted its time upon so many things i thought myself alone in hating these young men now indeed getting towards middle life their contempt for the past their monopoly of the future but in a few months i was to discover others of my own age who thought as i did for it is not true that youth looks before it with the mechanical gaze of a welldrilled soldier its quarrel is not with the past but with the present where its elders are so obviously powerful and no cause seems lost if it seem to threaten that power does cultivated youth ever really love the future where the eye can discover no persecuted royalty hidden among oak leaves though from it certainly does come so much proletarian rhetoric i was unlike others of my generation in one thing only i am very religious and deprived by huxley and tyndall whom i detested of the simpleminded religion of my childhood i had made a new religion almost an infallible church out of poetic tradition a fardel of stories and of personages and of emotions a bundle of images and of masks passed on from generation to generation by poets  painters with some help from philosophers and theologians i wished for a world where i could discover this tradition perpetually and not in pictures and in poems only but in tiles round the chimneypiece and in the hangings that kept out the draught i had even created a dogma because those imaginary people are created out of the deepest instinct of man to be his measure and his norm whatever i can imagine those mouths speaking may be the nearest i can go to truth when i listened they seemed always to speak of one thing only they their loves every incident of their lives were steeped in the supernatural could even titians ariosto that i loved beyond other portraits have its grave look as if waiting for some perfect final event if the painters before titian had not learned portraiture while painting into the corner of compositions full of saints and madonnas their kneeling patrons at seventeen years old i was already an oldfashioned brass cannon full of shot and nothing kept me from going off but a doubt as to my capacity to shoot straight     iii   i was not an industrious student and knew only what i had found by accident and i had found nothing i cared for after titianand titian i knew chiefly from a copy of the supper of emmaus in dublintill blake and the preraphaelites and among my fathers friends were no preraphaelites some indeed had come to bedford park in the enthusiasm of the first building and others to be near those that had there was todhunter a welloff man who had bought my fathers pictures while my father was still pre raphaelite once a dublin doctor he was a poet and a writer of poetical plays a tall sallow lank melancholy man a good scholar and a good intellect and with him my father carried on a warm exasperated friendship fed i think by old memories and wasted by quarrels over matters of opinion of all the survivors he was the most dejected and the least estranged and i remember encouraging him with a sense of worship shared to buy a very expensive carpet designed by morris he displayed it without strong liking and would have agreed had there been any to find fault if he had liked anything strongly he might have been a famous man for a few years later he was to write under some casual patriotic impulse certain excellent verses now in all irish anthologies but with him every book was a new planting and not a new bud on an old bough he had i think no peace in himself but my fathers chief friend was york powell a famous oxford professor of history a broadbuilt broadheaded brownbearded man clothed in heavy blue cloth and looking but for his glasses and the dim sight of a student like some captain in the merchant service one often passed with pleasure from todhunters company to that of one who was almost ostentatiously at peace he cared nothing for philosophy nothing for economics nothing for the policy of nations for history as he saw it was a memory of men who were amusing or exciting to think about he impressed all who met him  seemed to some a man of genius but he had not enough ambition to shape his thought or conviction to give rhythm to his style and remained always a poor writer i was too full of unfinished speculations and premature convictions to value rightly his conversation informed by a vast erudition which would give itself to every casual association of speech and company precisely because he had neither cause nor design my father however found powells concrete narrative manner a necessary completion of his own and when i asked him in a letter many years later where he got his philosophy replied from york powell and thereon added no doubt remembering that powell was without ideas by looking at him then there was a good listener a painter in whose hall hung a big picture painted in his student days of ulysses sailing home from the phaeacian court an orange and a skin of wine at his side blue mountains towering behind but who lived by drawing domestic scenes and lovers meetings for a weekly magazine that had an immense circulation among the imperfectly educated to escape the boredom of work which he never turned to but under pressure of necessity and usually late at night with the publishers messenger in the hall he had half filled his studio with mechanical toys of his own invention and perpetually increased their number a model railway train at intervals puffed its way along the walls passing several railway stations and signal boxes and on the floor lay a camp with attacking and defending soldiers and a fortification that blew up when the attackers fired a pea through a certain window while a large model of a thames barge hung from the ceiling opposite our house lived an old artist who worked also for the illustrated papers for a living but painted landscapes for his pleasure and of him i remember nothing except that he had outlived ambition was a good listener and that my father explained his gaunt appearance by his descent from pocahontas if all these men were a little like becalmed ships there was certainly one man whose sails were full three or four doors off on our side of the road lived a decorative artist in all the naive confidence of popular ideals and the public approval he was our daily comedy i myself and sir frederick leighton are the greatest decorative artists of the age was among his sayings  a great lychgate bought from some country churchyard reared its thatched roof meant to shelter bearers and coffin above the entrance to his front garden to show that he at any rate knew nothing of discouragement in this fairly numerous companythere were others though no other face rises before memy father and york powell found listeners for a conversation that had no special loyalties or antagonisms while i could only talk upon set topics being in the heat of my youth and the topics that filled me with excitement were never spoken of     iv   some quarter of an hours walk from bedford park out on the high road to richmond lived w e henley and i like many others began under him my education his portrait a lithograph by rothenstein hangs over my mantlepiece among portraits of other friends he is drawn standing but because doubtless of his crippled legs he leans forward resting his elbows upon some slightly suggested objecta table or a windowsill his heavy figure and powerful head the disordered hair standing upright his short irregular beard and moustache his lined and wrinkled face his eyes steadily fixed upon some object in complete confidence and selfpossession and yet as in halfbroken reverie all are exactly as i remember him i have seen other portraits and they too show him exactly as i remember him as though he had but one appearance and that seen fully at the first glance and by all alike he was most humanhuman i used to say like one of shakespeares charactersand yet pressed and pummelled as it were into a single attitude almost into a gesture and a speech as by some overwhelming situation i disagreed with him about everything but i admired him beyond words with the exception of some early poems founded upon old french models i disliked his poetry mainly because he wrote vers libre which i associated with tyndall and huxley and bastienlepages clownish peasant staring with vacant eyes at her great boots and filled it with unimpassioned description of an hospital ward where his leg had been amputated i wanted the strongest passions passions that had nothing to do with observation and metrical forms that seemed old enough to be sung by men halfasleep or riding upon a journey furthermore preraphaelitism affected him as some people are affected by a cat in the room and though he professed himself at our first meeting without political interests or convictions he soon grew into a violent unionist and imperialist i used to say when i spoke of his poems he is like a great actor with a bad part yet who would look at hamlet in the grave scene if salvini played the gravedigger and i might so have explained much that he said and did i meant that he was like a great actor of passioncharacteracting meant nothing to me for many yearsand an actor of passion will display some one quality of soul personified again and again just as a great poetical painter titian botticelli rossetti may depend for his greatness upon a type of beauty which presently we call by his name irving the last of the sort on the english stage and in modern england and france it is the rarest sort never moved me but in the expression of intellectual pride and though i saw salvini but once i am convinced that his genius was a kind of animal nobility henley half inarticulatei am very costive he would saybeset with personal quarrels built up an image of power and magnanimity till it became at moments when seen as it were by lightning his true self half his opinions were the contrivance of a subconsciousness that sought always to bring life to the dramatic crisis and expression to that point of artifice where the true self could find its tongue without opponents there had been no drama and in his youth ruskinism and preraphaelitism for he was of my fathers generation were the only possible opponents how could one resent his prejudice when that he himself might play a worthy part he must find beyond the common rout whom he derided and flouted daily opponents he could imagine moulded like himself once he said to me in the height of his imperial propaganda tell those young men in ireland that this great thing must go on they say ireland is not fit for selfgovernment but that is nonsense it is as fit as any other european country but we cannot grant it and then he spoke of his desire to found and edit a dublin newspaper it would have expounded the gaelic propaganda then beginning though dr hyde had as yet no league our old stories our modern literatureeverything that did not demand any shred or patch of government he dreamed of a tyranny but it was that of cosimo de medici     v   we gathered on sunday evenings in two rooms with folding doors between  hung i think with photographs from dutch masters and in one room there was always i think a table with cold meat i can recall but one elderly mandunn his name wasrather silent and full of good sense an old friend of henleys we were young men none as yet established in his own or in the worlds opinion and henley was our leader and our confidant one evening i found him alone amused and exasperated  he cried young a has just been round to ask my advice would i think it a wise thing if he bolted with mrs b have you quite determined to do it i asked him quite well i said in that case i refuse to give you any advice mrs b was a beautiful talented woman who as the welsh triad said of guinevere was much given to being carried off i think we listened to him and often obeyed him partly because he was quite plainly not upon the side of our parents we might have a different ground of quarrel but the result seemed more important than the ground and his confident manner and speech made us believe perhaps for the first time in victory and besides if he did denounce and in my case he certainly did what we held in secret reverence he never failed to associate it with things or persons that did not move us to reverence once i found him just returned from some art congress in liverpool or in manchester the salvation armyism of art he called it  gave a grotesque description of some city councillor he had found admiring turner henley who hated all that ruskin praised thereupon derided turner and finding the city councillor the next day on the other side of the gallery admiring some preraphaelite there derided that preraphaelite the third day henley discovered the poor man on a chair in the middle of the room staring disconsolately upon the floor he terrified us also and certainly i did not dare and i think none of us dared to speak our admiration for book or picture he condemned but he made us feel always our importance and no man among us could do good work or show the promise of it and lack his praise  i can remember meeting of a sunday night charles whibley kenneth grahame author of the golden age barry pain now a well known novelist r a m stevenson art critic and a famous talker george wyndham later on a cabinet minister and irish chief secretary and oscar wilde who was some eight years or ten older than the rest but faces and names are vague to me and while faces that i met but once may rise clearly before me a face met on many a sunday has perhaps vanished kipling came sometimes i think but i never met him and stepniak the nihilist whom i knew well elsewhere but not there said i cannot go more than once a year it is too exhausting henley got the best out of us all because he had made us accept him as our judge and we knew that his judgment could neither sleep nor be softened nor changed nor turned aside when i think of him the antithesis that is the foundation of human nature being ever in my sight i see his crippled legs as though he were some vulcan perpetually forging swords for other men to use and certainly i always thought of c a fine classical scholar a pale and seemingly gentle man as our chief swordsman and bravo when henley founded his weekly newspaper first the scots afterwards the national observer this young man wrote articles and reviews notorious for savage wit and years afterwards when the national observer was dead henley dying  our cavern of outlaws empty i met him in paris very sad and i think very poor nobody will employ me now he said your master is gone i answered and you are like the spear in an old irish story that had to be kept dipped in poppy juice that it might not go about killing people on its own account i wrote my first good lyrics and tolerable essays for the national obsever and as i always signed my work could go my own road in some measure henley often revised my lyrics crossing out a line or a stanza and writing in one of his own and i was comforted by my belief that he also rewrote kipling then in the first flood of popularity at first indeed i was ashamed of being rewritten and thought that others were not and only began investigation when the editorial characteristicsepigrams archaisms and allappeared in the article upon paris fashions and in that upon opium by an egyptian pasha i was not compelled to full conformity for verse is plainly stubborn and in prose that i might avoid unacceptable opinions i wrote nothing but ghost or fairy stories picked up from my mother or some pilot at rosses point and henley saw that i must needs mix a palette fitted to my subject matter but if he had changed every has into hath i would have let him for had not we sunned ourselves in his generosity my young men outdome and they write better than i he wrote in some letter praising charles whibleys work and to another friend with a copy of my man who dreamed of fairyland see what a fine thing has been written by one of my lads     vi   my first meeting with oscar wilde was an astonishment i never before heard a man talking with perfect sentences as if he had written them all over night with labour and yet all spontaneous there was present that night at henleys by right of propinquity or of accident a man full of the secret spite of dullness who interrupted from time to time and always to check or disorder thought and i noticed with what mastery he was foiled and thrown i noticed too that the impression of artificiality that i think all wildes listeners have recorded came from the perfect rounding of the sentences and from the deliberation that made it possible that very impression helped him as the effect of metre or of the antithetical prose of the seventeenth century which is itself a true metre helps a writer for he could pass without incongruity from some unforeseen swift stroke of wit to elaborate reverie i heard him say a few nights later give me the winters tale daffodils that come before the swallow dare but not king lear what is king lear but poor life staggering in the fog and the slow cadence modulated with so great precision sounded natural to my ears that first night he praised walter paters essays on the renaissance it is my golden book i never travel anywhere without it but it is the very flower of decadence the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was written but said the dull man would you not have given us time to read it oh no was the retort there would have been plenty of time afterwardsin either world i think he seemed to us baffled as we were by youth or by infirmity a triumphant figure and to some of us a figure from another age an audacious italian fifteenth century figure a few weeks before i had heard one of my fathers friends an official in a publishing firm that had employed both wilde and henley as editors blaming henley who was no use except under control and praising wilde so indolent but such a genius and now the firm became the topic of our talk how often do you go to the office said henley i used to go three times a week said wilde for an hour a day but i have since struck off one of the days my god said henley i went five times a week for five hours a day and when i wanted to strike off a day they had a special committee meeting furthermore was wildes answer i never answered their letters i have known men come to london full of bright prospects and seen them complete wrecks in a few months through a habit of answering letters he too knew how to keep our elders in their place and his method was plainly the more successful for henley had been dismissed no he is not an aesthete henley commented later being somewhat embarrassed by wildes preraphaelite entanglement one soon finds that he is a scholar and a gentleman and when i dined with wilde a few days afterwards he began at once i had to strain every nerve to equal that man at all and i was too loyal to speak my thought you  not he said all the brilliant things he like the rest of us had felt the strain of an intensity that seemed to hold life at the point of drama he had said on that first meeting the basis of literary friendship is mixing the poisoned bowl and for a few weeks henley and he became close friends till the astonishment of their meeting over diversity of character and ambition pushed them apart and with half the cavern helping henley began mixing the poisoned bowl for wilde yet henley never wholly lost that first admiration for after wildes downfall he said to me why did he do it i told my lads to attack him and yet we might have fought under his banner     vii   it became the custom both at henleys and at bedford park to say that r a m stevenson who frequented both circles was the better talker wilde had been trussed up like a turkey by undergraduates dragged up and down a hill his champagne emptied into the ice tub hooted in the streets of various towns and i think stoned and no newspaper named him but in scorn his manner had hardened to meet opposition and at times he allowed one to see an unpardonable insolence his charm was acquired and systematised a mask which he wore only when it pleased him while the charm of stevenson belonged to him like the colour of his hair if stevensons talk became monologue we did not know it because our one object was to show by our attention that he need never leave off if thought failed him we would not combat what he had said or start some new theme but would encourage him with a question and one felt that it had been always so from childhood up his mind was full of phantasy for phantasys sake and he gave as good entertainment in monologue as his cousin robert louis in poem or story he was always supposing suppose you had two millions what would you do with it and suppose you were in spain and in love how would you propose i recall him one afternoon at our house at bedford park surrounded by my brother and sisters and a little group of my fathers friends describing proposals in half a dozen countries there your father did it dressed in such and such a way with such and such words and there a friend must wait for the lady outside the chapel door sprinkle her with holy water and say my friend jones is dying for love of you but when it was over those quaint descriptions so full of laughter and sympathy faded or remained in the memory as something alien from ones own life like a dance i once saw in a great house where beautifully dressed children wound a long ribbon in and out as they danced i was not of stevensons party and mainly i think because he had written a book in praise of velasquez praise at that time universal wherever preraphaelitism was accurst and to my mind that had to pick its symbols where its ignorance permitted velasquez seemed the first bored celebrant of boredom i was convinced from some obscure meditation that stevensons conversational method had joined him to my elders and to the indifferent world as though it were right for old men and unambitious men and all women to be content with charm and humour it was the prerogative of youth to take sides and when wilde said mr bernard shaw has no enemies but is intensely disliked by all his friends i knew it to be a phrase i should never forget and felt revenged upon a notorious hater of romance whose generosity and courage i could not fathom     viii   i saw a good deal of wilde at that timewas it 1887 or 1888i have no way of fixing the date except that i had published my first book the wanderings of usheen and that wilde had not yet published his decay of lying he had before our first meeting reviewed my book and despite its vagueness of intention and the inexactness of its speech praised without qualification and what was worth more than any review had talked about it and now he asked me to eat my xmas dinner with him believing i imagine that i was alone in london  he had just renounced his velveteen and even those cuffs turned backward over the sleeves and had begun to dress very carefully in the fashion of the moment he lived in a little house at chelsea that the architect godwin had decorated with an elegance that owed something to whistler there was nothing mediaeval nor preraphaelite no cupboard door with figures upon flat gold no peacock blue no dark background i remember vaguely a white drawing room with whistler etchings let in to white panels and a dining room all white chairs walls mantlepiece carpet except for a diamondshaped piece of red cloth in the middle of the table under a terra cotta statuette and i think a red shaded lamp hanging from the ceiling to a little above the statuette it was perhaps too perfect in its unity his past of a few years before had gone too completely and i remember thinking that the perfect harmony of his life there with his beautiful wife and his two young children suggested some deliberate artistic composition  he commended  dispraised himself during dinner by attributing characteristics like his own to his country we irish are too poetical to be poets we are a nation of brilliant failures but we are the greatest talkers since the greeks when dinner was over he read me from the proofs of the decay of lying and when he came to the sentence schopenhauer has analysed the pessimism that characterises modern thought but hamlet invented it the world has become sad because a puppet was once melancholy i said why do you change sad to melancholy he replied that he wanted a full sound at the close of his sentence and i thought it no excuse and an example of the vague impressiveness that spoilt his writing for me only when he spoke or when his writing was the mirror of his speech or in some simple fairytale had he words exact enough to hold a subtle ear he alarmed me though not as henley did for i never left his house thinking myself fool or dunce he flattered the intellect of every man he liked he made me tell him long irish stories and compared my art of storytelling to homers and once when he had described himself as writing in the census paper age 19 profession genius infirmity talent the other guest a young journalist fresh from oxford or cambridge said what should i have written and was told that it should have been profession talent infirmity genius when however i called wearing shoes a little too yellowunblackened leather had just become fashionablei understood their extravagence when i saw his eyes fixed upon them an another day wilde asked me to tell his little boy a fairy story and i had but got as far as once upon a time there was a giant when the little boy screamed and ran out of the room wilde looked grave and i was plunged into the shame of clumsiness that afflicts the young when i asked for some literary gossip for some provincial newspaper that paid me a few shillings a month he explained very explicitly that writing literary gossip was no job for a gentleman though to be compared to homer passed the time pleasantly i had not been greatly perturbed had he stopped me with is it a long story as henley would certainly have done i was abashed before him as wit and man of the world alone i remember that he deprecated the very general belief in his success or his efficiency and i think with sincerity one form of success had gone he was no more the lion of the season and he had not discovered his gift for writing comedy yet i think i knew him at the happiest moment of his life no scandal had darkened his fame his fame as a talker was growing among his equals  he seemed to live in the enjoyment of his own spontaneity one day he began i have been inventing a christian heresy and he told a detailed story in the style of some early father of how christ recovered after the crucifixion and escaping from the tomb lived on for many years the one man upon earth who knew the falsehood of christianity once st paul visited his town and he alone in the carpenters quarter did not go to hear him preach the other carpenters noticed that henceforth for some unknown reason he kept his hands covered a few days afterwards i found wilde with smock frocks in various colours spread out upon the floor in front of him while a missionary explained that he did not object to the heathen going naked upon week days but insisted upon clothes in church he had brought the smock frocks in a cab that the only artcritic whose fame had reached central africa might select a colour so wilde sat there weighing all with a conscious ecclesiastic solemnity     viii   of late years i have often explained wilde to myself by his family history his father was a friend or acquaintance of my fathers father and among my family traditions there is an old dublin riddle why are sir william wildes nails so black answer because he has scratched himself and there is an old story still current in dublin of lady wilde saying to a servant why do you put the plates on the coalscuttle what are the chairs meant for they were famous people and there are many like stories and even a horrible folk story the invention of some connaught peasant that tells how sir william wilde took out the eyes of some men who had come to consult him as an oculist and laid them upon a plate intending to replace them in a moment and how the eyes were eaten by a cat as a certain friend of mine who has made a prolonged study of the nature of cats said when he first heard the tale catslove eyes the wilde family was clearly of the sort that fed the imagination of charles lever dirty untidy daring and what charles lever who loved more normal activities might not have valued so highly very imaginative and learned lady wilde who when i knew her received her friends with blinds drawn and shutters closed that none might see her withered face longed always perhaps though certainly amid much self mockery for some impossible splendour of character and circumstance she lived near her son in level chelsea but i have heard her say i want to live on some high place primrose hill or highgate because i was an eagle in my youth i think her son lived with no self mockery at all an imaginary life perpetually performed a play which was in all things the opposite of all that he had known in childhood and early youth never put off completely his wonder at opening his eyes every morning on his own beautiful house and in remembering that he had dined yesterday with a duchess and that he delighted in flaubert and pater read homer in the original and not as a schoolmaster reads him for the grammar i think too that because of all that halfcivilized blood in his veins he could not endure the sedentary toil of creative art and so remained a man of action exaggerating for the sake of immediate effect every trick learned from his masters turning their easel painting into painted scenes he was a parvenu but a parvenu whose whole bearing proved that if he did dedicate every story in the house of pomegranates to a lady of title it was but to show that he was jack and the social ladder his pantomime beanstalk did you ever hear him say marquess of dimmesdale a friend of his once asked me he does not say the duke of york with any pleasure  he told me once that he had been offered a safe seat in parliament and had he accepted he might have had a career like that of beaconsfield whose early style resembles his being meant for crowds for excitement for hurried decisions for immediate triumphs such men get their sincerity if at all from the contact of events the dinner table was wildes event and made him the greatest talker of his time and his plays and dialogues have what merit they possess from being now an imitation now a record of his talk even in those days i would often defend him by saying that his very admiration for his predecessors in poetry for browning for swinburne and rossetti in their first vogue while he was a very young man made any success seem impossible that could satisfy his immense ambition never but once before had the artist seemed so great never had the work of art seemed so difficult i would then compare him with benvenuto cellini who coming after michael angelo found nothing left to do so satisfactory as to turn bravo and assassinate the man who broke michael angelos nose     ix   i cannot remember who first brought me to the old stable beside kelmscott house william morris house at hammersmith  to the debates held there upon sunday evenings by the socialist league i was soon of the little group who had supper with morris afterwards i met at these suppers very constantly walter crane emery walker presently in association with cobden sanderson the printer of many fine books and less constantly bernard shaw and cockerell now of the museum of cambridge and perhaps but once or twice hyndman the socialist and the anarchist prince krapotkin there too one always met certain more or less educated workmen rough of speech and manner with a conviction to meet every turn i was told by one of them on a night when i had done perhaps more than my share of the talking that i had talked more nonsense in one evening than he had heard in the whole course of his past life i had merely preferred parnell then at the height of his career to michael davitt who had wrecked his irish influence by international politics we sat round a long unpolished and unpainted trestle table of new wood in a room where hung rossettis pomegranate a portrait of mrs morris and where one wall and part of the ceiling were covered by a great persian carpet morris had said somewhere or other that carpets were meant for people who took their shoes off when they entered a house and were most in place upon a tent floor i was a little disappointed in the house for morris was an old man content at last to gather beautiful things rather than to arrange a beautiful house i saw the drawingroom once or twice and there alone all my sense of decoration founded upon the background of rossettis pictures was satisfied by a big cupboard painted with a scene from chaucer by burne jones but even there were objects perhaps a chair or a little table that seemed accidental bought hurriedly perhaps and with little thought to make wife or daughter comfortable i had read as a boy in books belonging to my father the third volume of the earthly paradise and the defence of guinevere which pleased me less but had not opened either for a long time the man who never laughed again had seemed the most wonderful of tales till my father had accused me of preferring morris to keats got angry about it and put me altogether out of countenance he had spoiled my pleasure for now i questioned while i read and at last ceased to read nor had morris written as yet those prose romances that became after his death so great a joy that they were the only books i was ever to read slowly that i might not come too quickly to the end it was now morris himself that stirred my interest and i took to him first because of some little tricks of speech and body that reminded me of my old grandfather in sligo but soon discovered his spontaneity and joy and made him my chief of men today i do not set his poetry very high but for an odd altogether wonderful line or thought and yet if some angel offered me the choice i would choose to live his life poetry and all rather than my own or any other mans a reproduction of his portrait by watts hangs over my mantlepiece with henleys and those of other friends its grave wideopen eyes like the eyes of some dreaming beast remind me of the open eyes of titians ariosto while the broad vigorous body suggests a mind that has no need of the intellect to remain sane though it give itself to every phantasy the dreamer of the middle ages it is the fool of fairy  wide and wild as a hill the resolute european image that yet half remembers buddhas motionless meditation and has no trait in common with the wavering lean image of hungry speculation that cannot but fill the minds eye because of certain famous hamlets of our stage shakespeare himself foreshadowed a symbolic change that shows a change in the whole temperament of the world for though he called his hamlet fat and scant of breath he thrust between his fingers agile rapier and dagger  the dream world of morris was as much the antithesis of daily life as with other men of genius but he was never conscious of the antithesis and so knew nothing of intellectual suffering his intellect unexhausted by speculation or casuistry was wholly at the service of hand and eye and whatever he pleased he did with an unheard of ease and simplicity and if style and vocabulary were at times monotonous he could not have made them otherwise without ceasing to be himself instead of the language of chaucer and shakespeare its warp fresh from field and market if the woof were learned his age offered him a speech exhausted from abstraction that only returned to its full vitality when written learnedly and slowly the roots of his antithetical dream were visible enough a never idle man of great physical strength and extremely irascibledid he not fling a badly baked plum pudding through the window upon xmas daya man more joyous than any intellectual man of our world called himself the idle singer of an empty day created new forms of melancholy and faint persons like the knights  ladies of burne jones who are never no not once in forty volumes put out of temper a blunderer who had said to the only unconverted man at a socialist picnic in dublin to prove that equality came easy i was brought up a gentleman and now as you can see associate with all sorts and left wounds thereby that rankled after twenty years a man of whom i have heard it said he is always afraid that he is doing something wrong and generally is wrote long stories with apparently no other object than that his persons might show one another through situations of poignant difficulty the most exquisite tact  he did not project like henley or like wilde an image of himself because having all his imagination set on making and doing he had little selfknowledge he imagined instead new conditions of making and doing and in the teeth of those scientific generalisations that cowed my boyhood i can see some like imagining in every great change believing that the first flying fish leaped not because it sought adaptation to the air but out of horror of the sea     x   soon after i began to attend the lectures a french class was started in the old coachhouse for certain young socialists who planned a tour in france and i joined it and was for a time a model student constantly encouraged by the compliments of the old french mistress i told my father of the class and he asked me to get my sisters admitted i made difficulties and put off speaking of the matter for i knew that the new and admirable self i was making would turn under family eyes into plain rag doll how could i pretend to be industrious and even carry dramatization to the point of learning my lessons when my sisters were there and knew that i was nothing of the kind but i had no argument i could use and my sisters were admitted they said nothing unkind so far as i can remember but in a week or two i was my old procrastinating idle self and had soon left the class altogether my elder sister stayed on and became an embroideress under miss may morris and the hangings round morriss big bed at kelmscott house oxfordshire with their verses about lying happily in bed when all birds sing in the town of the tree were from her needle though not from her design she worked for the first few months at kelmscott house hammersmith and in my imagination i cannot always separate what i saw and heard from her report or indeed from the report of that tribe or guild who looked up to morris as to some worshipped mediaeval king he had no need for other people i doubt if their marriage or death made him sad or glad and yet no man i have known was so well loved you saw him producing everywhere organisation and beauty seeming almost in the same instant helpless and triumphant and people loved him as children are loved people much in his neighbourhood became gradually occupied with him or about his affairs and without any wish on his part as simple people become occupied with children i remember a man who was proud and pleased because he had distracted morris thoughts from an attack of gout by leading the conversation delicately to the hated name of milton he began at swinburne oh swinburne said morris is a rhetorician my masters have been keats and chaucer for they make pictures does not milton make pictures asked my informant no was the answer dante makes pictures but milton though he had a great earnest mind expressed himself as a rhetorician great earnest mind sounded strange to me and i doubt not that were his questioner not a simple man morris had been more violent another day the same man started by praising chaucer but the gout was worse and morris cursed chaucer for destroying the english language with foreign words  he had few detachable phrases and i can remember little of his speech which many thought the best of all good talk except that it matched his burly body and seemed within definite boundaries inexhaustible in fact and expression he alone of all the men i have known seemed guided by some beastlike instinct and never ate strange meat balzac balzac he said to me once oh that was the man the french bourgeoisie read so much a few years ago i can remember him at supper praising wine why do people say it is prosaic to be inspired by wine has it not been made by the sunlight and the sap and his dispraising houses decorated by himself do you suppose i like that kind of house i would like a house like a big barn where one ate in one corner cooked in another corner slept in the third corner  in the fourth received ones friends and his complaining of ruskins objection to the underground railway if you must have a railway the best thing you can do with it is to put it in a tube with a cork at each end i remember too that when i asked what led up to his movement he replied oh ruskin and carlyle but somebody should have been beside carlyle and punched his head every five minutes though i remember little i do not doubt that had i continued going there on sunday evenings i should have caught fire from his words and turned my hand to some mediaeval work or other just before i had ceased to go there i had sent my wanderings of usheen to his daughter hoping of course that it might meet his eyes  soon after sending it i came upon him by chance in holborn you write my sort of poetry he said and began to praise me and to promise to send his praise to the commonwealth the league organ and he would have said more of a certainty had he not caught sight of a new ornamental castiron lamppost and got very heated upon that subject  i did not read economics having turned socialist because of morriss lectures and pamphlets and i think it unlikely that morris himself could read economics that old dogma of mine seemed germane to the matter if the men and women imagined by the poets were the norm and if morris had in let us say news from nowhere then running through the commonwealth described such men and women living under their natural conditions or as they would desire to live then those conditions themselves must be the norm and could we but get rid of certain institutions the world would turn from eccentricity perhaps morris himself justified himself in his own heart by as simple an argument and was as the socialist d said to me one night walking home after some lecture an anarchist without knowing it certainly i and all about me including d himself were for chopping up the old king for medeas pot morris had told us to have nothing to do with the parliamentary socialists represented for men in general by the fabian society and hyndmans socialist democratic federation and for us in particular by d during the period of transition mistakes must be made and the discredit of these mistakes must be left to the bourgeoisie and besides when you begin to talk of this measure or that other you lose sight of the goal and see to reverse swinburnes description of tiresias light on the way but darkness on the goal by mistakes morris meant vexatious restrictions and compromisesif any man puts me into a labour squad i will lie on my back and kick that phrase very much expresses our idea of revolutionary tactics we all intended to lie upon our back and kick d pale and sedentary did not dislike labour squads and we all hated him with the left side of our heads while admiring him immensely with the right he alone was invited to entertain mrs morris having many tales of his irish uncles more especially of one particular uncle who had tried to commit suicide by shutting his head into a carpet bag at that time he was an obscure man known only for a witty speaker at street corners and in park demonstrations he had with an assumed truculence and fury cold logic an universal gentleness an unruffled courtesy and yet could never close a speech without being denounced by a journeyman hatter with an italian name  converted to socialism by d and to anarchism by himself with swinging arm and uplifted voice this man perhaps exaggerated our scruple about parliament i lack said d the bump of reverence whereon the wild man shouted you ave a ole there are moments when looking back i somewhat confuse my own figure with that of the hatter image of our hysteria for i too became violent with the violent solemnity of a religious devotee i can even remember sitting behind d and saying some rude thing or other over his shoulder i dont remember why i gave it up but i did quite suddenly and i think the push may have come from a young workman who was educating himself between morris and karl marx he had planned a history of the navy and when i had spoken of the battleship of nelsons day had said oh that was the decadence of the battleship but if his naval interests were mediaeval his ideas about religion were pure karl marx and we were soon in perpetual argument then gradually the attitude towards religion of almost everybody but morris who avoided the subject altogether got upon my nerves for i broke out after some lecture or other with all the arrogance of raging youth they attacked religion i said or some such words and yet there must be a change of heart and only religion could make it what was the use of talking about some near revolution putting all things right when the change must come if come it did with astronomical slowness like the cooling of the sun or it may have been like the drying of the moon morris rang his chairmans bell but i was too angry to listen and he had to ring it a second time before i sat down he said that night at supper of course i know there must be a change of heart but it will not come as slowly as all that i rang my bell because you were not being understood he did not show any vexation but i never returned after that night and yet i did not always believe what i had said and only gradually gave up thinking of and planning for some near sudden change for the better     xi   i spent my days at the british museum and must i think have been delicate for i remember often putting off hour after hour consulting some necessary book because i shrank from lifting the heavy volumes of the catalogue and yet to save money for my afternoon coffee and roll i often walked the whole way home to bedford park i was compiling for a series of shilling books an anthology of irish fairy stories and for an american publisher a two volume selection from the irish novelists that would be somewhat dearer i was not well paid for each book cost me more than three months reading and i was paid for the first some twelve pounds o mr e said publisher to editor you must never again pay so much and for the second twenty but i did not think myself badly paid for i had chosen the work for my own purposes  though i went to sligo every summer i was compelled to live out of ireland the greater part of every year and was but keeping my mind upon what i knew must be the subject matter of my poetry i believed that if morris had set his stories amid the scenery of his own wales for i knew him to be of welsh extraction and supposed wrongly that he had spent his childhood there that if shelley had nailed his prometheus or some equal symbol upon some welsh or scottish rock their art had entered more intimately more microscopically as it were into our thought and had given perhaps to modern poetry a breadth and stability like that of ancient poetry the statues of mausolus and artemisia at the british museum private half animal half divine figures all unlike the grecian athletes and egyptian kings in their near neighbourhood that stand in the middle of the crowds applause or sit above measuring it out unpersuadable justice became to me now or later images of an unpremeditated joyous energy that neither i nor any other man racked by doubt and enquiry can achieve and that yet if once achieved might seem to men and women of connemara or of galway their very soul in our study of that ruined tomb raised by a queen to her dead lover and finished by the unpaid labour of great sculptors after her death from grief or so runs the tale we cannot distinguish the handiworks of scopas and praxiteles and i wanted to create once more an art where the artists handiwork would hide as under those half anonymous chisels or as we find it in some old scots ballads or in some twelfth or thirteenth century arthurian romance that handiwork assured i had martyred no man for modelling his own image upon pallas athenas buckler for i took great pleasure in certain allusions to the singers life one finds in old romances and ballads and thought his presence there all the more poignant because we discover it half lost like portly chaucer riding behind his maunciple and his pardoner wolfram von eschenbach singing his german parsival broke off some description of a famished city to remember that in his own house at home the very mice lacked food and what old ballad singer was it who claimed to have fought by day in the very battle he sang by night so masterful indeed was that instinct that when the minstrel knew not who his poet was he must needs make up a man when any stranger asks who is the sweetest of singers answer with one voice a blind man he dwells upon rocky chios his songs shall be the most beautiful for ever elaborate modern psychology sounds egotistical i thought when it speaks in the first person but not those simple emotions which resemble the more the more powerful they are everybodys emotion and i was soon to write many poems where an always personal emotion was woven into a general pattern of myth and symbol when the fenian poet says that his heart has grown cold and callous for thy hapless fate dear ireland and sorrows of my own he but follows tradition and if he does not move us deeply it is because he has no sensuous musical vocabulary that comes at need without compelling him to sedentary toil and so driving him out from his fellows i thought to create that sensuous musical vocabulary and not for myself only but that i might leave it to later irish poets much as a mediaeval japanese painter left his style as an inheritance to his family and was careful to use a traditional manner and matter yet did something altogether different changed by that toil impelled by my share in cains curse by all that sterile modern complication by my originality as the newspapers call it morris set out to make a revolution that the persons of his well at the worlds end or his waters of the wondrous isles always to my mind in the likeness of artemisia and her man might walk his native scenery and i that my native scenery might find imaginary inhabitants half planned a new method and a new culture my mind began drifting vaguely towards that doctrine of the mask which has convinced me that every passionate man i have nothing to do with mechanist or philanthropist or man whose eyes have no preference is as it were linked with another age historical or imaginary where alone he finds images that rouse his energy napoleon was never of his own time as the naturalistic writers and painters bid all men be but had some roman emperors image in his head and some condottieres blood in his heart and when he crowned that head at rome with his own hands he had covered as may be seen from davids painting his hesitation with that emperors old suit     xii   i had various women friends on whom i would call towards five oclock mainly to discuss my thoughts that i could not bring to a man without meeting some competing thought but partly because their tea  toast saved my pennies for the bus ride home but with women apart from their intimate exchanges of thought i was timid and abashed i was sitting on a seat in front of the british museum feeding pigeons when a couple of girls sat near and began enticing my pigeons away laughing and whispering to one another and i looked straight in front of me very indignant and presently went into the museum without turning my head towards them since then i have often wondered if they were pretty or merely very young sometimes i told myself very adventurous love stories with myself for hero and at other times i planned out a life of lonely austerity and at other times mixed the ideals and planned a life of lonely austerity mitigated by periodical lapses  i had still the ambition formed in sligo in my teens of living in imitation of thoreau on innisfree a little island in lough gill and when walking through fleet street very homesick i heard a little tinkle of water and saw a fountain in a shop window which balanced a little ball upon its jet and began to remember lake water from the sudden remembrance came my poem innisfree my first lyric with anything in its rhythm of my own music i had begun to loosen rhythm as an escape from rhetoric and from that emotion of the crowd that rhetoric brings but i only understood vaguely and occasionally that i must for my special purpose use nothing but the common syntax a couple of years later i would not have written that first line with its conventional archaismarise and gonor the inversion in the last stanza passing another day by the new law courts a building that i admired because it was gothicit is not very good morris had said but it is better than any thing else they have got and so they hate iti grew suddenly oppressed by the great weight of stone and thought there are miles and miles of stone and brick all round me and presently added if john the baptist or his like were to come again and had his mind set upon it he could make all these people go out into some wilderness leaving their buildings empty and that thought which does not seem very valuable now so enlightened the day that it is still vivid in the memory i spent a few days at oxford copying out a seventeenth century translation of poggios liber facetiarum or the hypnerotomachia of poliphili for a publisher i forget which for i copied both and returned very pale to my troubled family i had lived upon bread and tea because i thought that if antiquity found locust and wild honey nutritive my soul was strong enough to need no better i was always planning some great gesture putting the whole world into one scale of the balance and my soul into the other and imagining that the whole world somehow kicked the beam more than thirty years have passed and i have seen no forcible young man of letters brave the metropolis without some like stimulant and all after two or three or twelve or fifteen years according to obstinacy have understood that we achieve if we do achieve in little diligent sedentary stitches as though we were making lace i had one unmeasured advantage from my stimulant i could ink my socks that they might not show through my shoes with a most haughty mind imagining myself and my torn tackle somewhere else in some far place under the canopy  i the city of kites and crows  in london i saw nothing good and constantly remembered that ruskin had said to some friend of my fathersas i go to my work at the british museum i see the faces of the people become daily more corrupt i convinced myself for a time that on the same journey i saw but what he saw certain old womens faces filled me with horror faces that are no longer there or if they are pass before me unnoticed the fat blotched faces rising above double chins of women who have drunk too much beer and eaten too much meat in dublin i had often seen old women walking with erect heads and gaunt bodies talking to themselves in loud voices mad with drink and poverty but they were different they belonged to romance da vinci has drawn women who looked so and so carried their bodies     xiii   i attempted to restore one old friend of my fathers to the practice of his youth but failed though he unlike my father had not changed his belief my father brought me to dine with jack nettleship at wigmore street once inventor of imaginative designs and now a painter of melodramatic lions at dinner i had talked a great dealtoo much i imagine for so young a man or may be for any manand on the way home my father who had been plainly anxious that i should make a good impression was very angry he said i had talked for effect and that talking for effect was precisely what one must never do he had always hated rhetoric and emphasis and had made me hate it and his anger plunged me into great dejection i called at nettleships studio the next day to apologise and nettleship opened the door himself and received me with enthusiasm he had explained to some woman guest that i would probably talk well being an irishman but the reality had surpassed etc etc i was not flattered though relieved at not having to apologise for i soon discovered that what he really admired was my volubility for he himself was very silent he seemed about sixty had a bald head a grey beard and a nose as one of my fathers friends used to say like an opera glass and sipped cocoa all the afternoon and evening from an enormous tea cup that must have been designed for him alone not caring how cold the cocoa grew years before he had been thrown from his horse while hunting and broken his arm and because it had been badly set suffered great pain for along time a little whiskey would always stop the pain and soon a little became a great deal and he found himself a drunkard but having signed his liberty away for certain months he was completely cured he had acquired however the need of some liquid which he could sip constantly i brought him an admiration settled in early boyhood for my father had always said george wilson was our born painter but nettleship our genius and even had he shown me nothing i could care for i had admired him still because my admiration was in my bones he showed me his early designs and they though often badly drawn fulfilled my hopes something of blake they certainly did show but had in place of blakes joyous intellectual energy a saturnian passion and melancholy god creating evil the death like head with a woman and a tiger coming from the forehead which rossettior was it browninghad described as the most sublime design of ancient or modern art had been lost but there was another version of the same thought and other designs never published or exhibited they rise before me even now in meditation especially a blind titanlike ghost floating with groping hands above the treetops i wrote a criticism and arranged for reproductions with the editor of an art magazine but after it was written and accepted the proprietor lifting what i considered an obsequious caw in the huxley tyndall carolus duran bastienlepage rookery insisted upon its rejection nettleship did not mind its rejection saying who cares for such things now not ten people but he did mind my refusal to show him what i had written though what i had written was all eulogy i dreaded his judgment for it was my first art criticism i hated his big lion pictures where he attempted an art too much concerned with the sense of touch with the softness or roughness the minutely observed irregularity of surfaces for his genius and i think he knew it rossetti used to call my pictures pot boilers he said but they are allall and he waved his arms to the canvases symbols when i wanted him to design gods and angels and lost spirits once more he always came back to the point nobody would be pleased everybody should have a raison detre was one of his phrases mrss articles are not good but they are her raison detre i had but little knowledge of art for there was little scholarship in the dublin art school so i overrated the quality of anything that could be connected with my general beliefs about the world if i had been able to give angelical or diabolical names to his lions i might have liked them also and i think that nettleship himself would have liked them better and liking them better have become a better painter we had the same kind of religious feeling but i could give a crude philosophical expression to mine while he could only express his in action or with brush and pencil he often told me of certain ascetic ambitions very much like my own for he had kept all the moral ambition of youth with a moral courage peculiar to himself as for instanceyeats the other night i was arrested by a policemanwas walking round regents park barefooted to keep the flesh undergood sort of thing to doi was carrying my boots in my hand and he thought i was a burglar and even when i explained and gave him half a crown he would not let me go till i had promised to put on my boots before i met the next policeman  he was very proud and shy and i could not imagine anybody asking him questions and so i was content to take these stories as they came confirmations of stories i had heard in boyhood one story in particular had stirred my imagination for ashamed all my boyhood of my lack of physical courage i admired what was beyond my imitation he thought that any weakness even a weakness of body had the character of sin and while at breakfast with his brother with whom he shared a room on the third floor of a corner house he said that his nerves were out of order presently he left the table and got out through the window and on to a stone ledge that ran along the wall under the windowsills he sidled along the ledge and turning the corner with it got in at a different window and returned to the table my nerves he said are better than i thought     xiv   nettleship said to me has edwin ellis ever said anything about the effect of drink upon my genius no i answered i ask he said because i have always thought that ellis has some strange medical insight though i had answered no ellis had only a few days before used these words nettleship drank his genius away ellis but lately returned from perugia where he had lived many years was another old friend of my fathers but some years younger than nettleship or my father nettleship had found his simplifying image but in his painting had turned away from it while ellis the son of alexander ellis a once famous man of science who was perhaps the last man in england to run the circle of the sciences without superficiality had never found that image at all he was a painter and poet but his painting which did not interest me showed no influence but that of leighton he had started perhaps a couple of years too late for preraphaelite influence for no great preraphaelite picture was painted after 1870 and left england too soon for that of the french painters he was however sometimes moving as a poet and still more often an astonishment i have known him cast something just said into a dozen lines of musical verse without apparently ceasing to talk but the work once done he could not or would not amend it and my father thought he lacked all ambition yet he had at times nobility of rhythman instinct for grandeurand after thirty years i still repeat to myself his address to mother earth    o mother of the hills forgive our towers   o mother of the clouds forgive our dreams  and there are certain whole poems that i read from time to time or try to make others read there is that poem where the manner is unworthy of the matter being loose and facile describing adam and eve fleeing from paradise adam asks eve what she carries so carefully and eve replies that it is a little of the apple core kept for their children there is that vision of christ the less a too hurriedly written ballad where the half of christ sacrificed to the divine half that fled to seek felicity wanders wailing through golgotha and there is the saint and the youth in which i can discover no fault at all he loved complexitiesseven silences like candles round her face is a line of hisand whether he wrote well or ill had always a manner which i would have known from that of any other poet he would say to me i am a mathematician with the mathematics left outhis father was a great mathematicianor a woman once said to me mr ellis why are your poems like sums and certainly he loved symbols and abstractions he said once when i had asked him not to mention something or other surely you have discovered by this time that i know of no means whereby i can mention a fact in conversation  he had a passion for blake picked up in preraphaelite studios and early in our acquaintance put into my hands a scrap of note paper on which he had written some years before an interpretation of the poem that begins    the fields from islington to marylebone   to primrose hill and st johns wood   were builded over with pillars of gold   and there jerusalems pillars stood  the four quarters of london represented blakes four great mythological personages the zoas and also the four elements these few sentences were the foundation of all study of the philosophy of william blake that requires an exact knowledge for its pursuit and that traces the connection between his system and that of swedenborg or of boehme i recognised certain attributions from what is sometimes called the christian cabala of which ellis had never heard and with this proof that his interpretation was more than phantasy he and i began our four years work upon the prophetic books of william blake we took it as almost a sign of blakes personal help when we discovered that the spring of 1889 when we first joined our knowledge was one hundred years from the publication of the book of thel the first published of the prophetic books as though it were firmly established that the dead delight in anniversaries after months of discussion and reading we made a concordance of all blakes mystical terms and there was much copying to be done in the museum  at red hill where the descendants of blakes friend and patron the landscape painter john linnell had many manuscripts  the linnellswere narrow in their religious ideas  doubtful of blakes orthodoxy whom they held however in great honour and i remember a timid old lady who had known blake when a child saying he had very wrong ideas he did not believe in the historical jesus one old man sat always beside us ostensibly to sharpen our pencils but perhaps really to see that we did not steal the manuscripts and they gave us very old port at lunch and i have upon my dining room walls their present of blakes dante engravings going thither and returning ellis would entertain me by philosophical discussion varied with improvised stories at first folk tales which he professed to have picked up in scotland and though i had read and collected many folk tales i did not see through the deceit i have a partial memory of two more elaborate tales one of an italian conspirator flying barefoot from i forget what adventure through i forget what italian city in the early morning fearing to be recognised by his bare feet he slipped past the sleepy porter at an hotel calling out number so and so as if he were some belated guest then passing from bedroom door to door he tried on the boots and just as he got a pair to fit a voice cried from the room who is that merely me sir he called back taking your boots the other was of a martyrs bible round which the cardinal virtues had taken personal formthis a fragment of blakes philosophy it was in the possession of an old clergyman when a certain jockey called upon him and the cardinal virtues confused between jockey and clergyman devoted themselves to the jockey as whenever he sinned a cardinal virtue interfered and turned him back to virtue he lived in great credit and made but for one sentence a very holy death as his wife and family knelt round in admiration and grief he suddenly said damn o my dear said his wife what a dreadful expression he answered i am going to heaven and straightway died it was a long tale for there were all the jockeys vain attempts to sin as well as all the adventures of the clergyman who became very sinful indeed but it ended happily for when the jockey died the cardinal virtues returned to the clergyman i think he would talk to any audience that offered one audience being the same as another in his eyes and it may have been for this reason that my father called him unambitious when he was a young man he had befriended a reformed thief and had asked the grateful thief to take him round the thieves quarters of london the thief however hurried him away from the worst saying another minute and they would have found you out if they were not the stupidest men in london they had done so already ellis had gone through a no doubt romantic and witty account of all the houses he had robbed and all the throats he had cut in one short life  his conversation would often pass out of my comprehension or indeed i think of any mans into a labyrinth of abstraction and subtilty and then suddenly return with some verbal conceit or turn of wit the mind is known to attain in certain conditions of trance a quickness so extraordinary that we are compelled at times to imagine a condition of unendurable intellectual intensity from which we are saved by the merciful stupidity of the body  i think that the mind of edwin ellis was constantly upon the edge of trance once we were discussing the symbolism of sex in the philosophy of blake and had been in disagreement all the afternoon i began talking with a new sense of conviction and after a moment ellis who was at his easel threw down his brush and said that he had just seen the same explanation in a series of symbolic visions in another moment he said i should have been off we went into the open air and walked up and down to get rid of that feeling but presently we came in again and i began again my explanation ellis lying upon the sofa i had been talking some time when mrs ellis came into the room and said why are you sitting in the dark ellis answered but we are not and then added in a voice of wonder i thought the lamp was lit and that i was sitting up and i find i am in the dark and lying down i had seen a flicker of light over the ceiling but had thought it a reflection from some light outside the house which may have been the case     xv   i had already met most of the poets of my generation i had said soon after the publication of the wanderings of usheen to the editor of a series of shilling reprints who had set me to compile tales of the irish fairies i am growing jealous of other poets and we will all grow jealous of each other unless we know each other and so feel a share in each others triumph he was a welshman lately a mining engineer ernest rhys a writer of welsh translations and original poems that have often moved me greatly though i can think of no one else who has read them he was seven or eight years older than myself and through his work as editor knew everybody who would compile a book for seven or eight pounds between us we founded the rhymers club which for some years was to meet every night in an upper room with a sanded floor in an ancient eating house in the strand called the cheshire cheese lionel johnson ernest dowson victor plarr ernest radford john davidson richard le gallienne t w rolleston selwyn image and two men of an older generation edwin ellis and john todhunter came constantly for a time arthur symons and herbert home less constantly while william watson joined but never came and francis thompson came once but never joined and sometimes if we met in a private house which we did occasionally oscar wilde came it had been useless to invite him to the cheshire cheese for he hated bohemia olive schreiner he said once to me is staying in the east end because that is the only place where people do not wear masks upon their faces but i have told her that i live in the west end because nothing in life interests me but the mask  we read our poems to one another and talked criticism and drank a little wine i sometimes say when i speak of the club we had such and such ideas such and such a quarrel with the great victorians we set before us such and such aims as though we had many philosophical ideas i say this because i am ashamed to admit that i had these ideas and that whenever i began to talk of them a gloomy silence fell upon the room a young irish poet who wrote excellently but had the worst manners was to say a few years later you do not talk like a poet you talk like a man of letters and if all the rhymers had not been polite if most of them had not been to oxford or cambridge they would have said the same thing i was full of thought often very abstract thought longing all the while to be full of images because i had gone to the art school instead of a university yet even if i had gone to a university and learned all the classical foundations of english literature and english culture all that great erudition which once accepted frees the mind from restlessness i should have had to give up my irish subject matter or attempt to found a new tradition lacking sufficient recognised precedent i must needs find out some reason for all i did i knew almost from the start that to overflow with reasons was to be not quite wellborn and when i could i hid them as men hide a disagreeable ancestry and that there was no help for it seeing that my country was not born at all i was of those doomed to imperfect achievement and under a curse as it were like some race of birds compelled to spend the time needed for the making of the nest in argument as to the convenience of moss and twig and lichen le gallienne and davidson and even symons were provincial at their setting out but their provincialism was curable mine incurable while the one conviction shared by all the younger men but principally by johnson and horne who imposed their personalities upon us was an opposition to all ideas all generalisations that can be explained and debated e fresh from paris would sometimes saywe are concerned with nothing but impressions but that itself was a generalisation and met but stony silence conversation constantly dwindled into do you like so and sos last book no i prefer the book before it and i think that but for its irish members who said whatever came into their heads the club would not have survived its first difficult months i knewnow ashamed that i thought like a man of letters now exasperated at their indifference to the fashion of their own river bedthat swinburne in one way browning in another and tennyson in a third had filled their work with what i called impurities curiosities about politics about science about history about religion and that we must create once more the pure work  our clothes were for the most part unadventurous like our conversation though i indeed wore a brown velveteen coat a loose tie and a very old inverness cape discarded by my father twenty years before and preserved by my sligoborn mother whose actions were unreasoning and habitual like the seasons but no other member of the club except le gallienne who wore a loose tie and symons who had an inverness cape that was quite new  almost fashionable would have shown himself for the world in any costume but that of an english gentleman one should be quite unnoticeable johnson explained to me those who conformed most carefully to the fashion in their clothes generally departed furthest from it in their handwriting which was small neat and studied one poetwhich i forgethaving founded his upon the handwriting of george herbert dowson and symons i was to know better in later years when symons became a very dear friend and i never got behind john davidsons scottish roughness and exasperation though i saw much of him but from the first i devoted myself to lionel johnson he and horne and image and one or two others shared a manservant and an old house in charlotte street fitzroy square typical figures of transition doing as an achievement of learning and of exquisite taste what their predecessors did in careless abundance all were preraphaelite and sometimes one might meet in the rooms of one or other a ragged figure as of some fallen dynasty simeon solomon the pre raphaelite painter once the friend of rossetti and of swinburne but fresh now from some low public house condemned to a long term of imprisonment for a criminal offence he had sunk into drunkenness and misery introduced one night however to some man who mistook him in the dim candle light for another solomon a successful academic painter and r a he started to his feet in a rage with sir do you dare to mistake me for that mountebank though not one had harkened to the feeblest caw or been spattered by the smallest dropping from any huxley tyndall carolus duran bastienlepage bundle of old twigs i began by suspecting them of lukewarmness and even backsliding and i owe it to that suspicion that i never became intimate with horne who lived to become the greatest english authority upon italian life in the fourteenth century and to write the one standard work on botticelli connoisseur in several arts he had designed a little church in the manner of inigo jones for a burial ground near the marble arch though i now think his little church a masterpiece its style was more than a century too late to hit my fancy at two or three and twenty and i accused him of leaning towards that eighteenth century    that taught a school   of dolts to smooth inlay and clip and fit   till like the certain wands of jacobs wit   their verses tallied  another fanaticism delayed my friendship with two men who are now my friends and in certain matters my chief instructors somebody probably lionel johnson brought me to the studio of charles ricketts and charles shannon certainly heirs of the great generation and the first thing i saw was a shannon picture of a lady and child arrayed in lace silk and satin suggesting that hated century my eyes were full of some more mythological mother and child and i would have none of it and i told shannon that he had not painted a mother and child but elegant people expecting visitors and i thought that a great reproach somebody writing in the germ had said that a picture of a pheasant and an apple was merely a picture of something to eat and i was so angry with the indifference to subject which was the commonplace of all art criticism since bastienlepage that i could at times see nothing else but subject i thought that though it might not matter to the man himself whether he loved a white woman or a black a female pickpocket or a regular communicant of the church of england if only he loved strongly it certainly did matter to his relations and even under some circumstances to his whole neighbourhood sometimes indeed like some father in moliere i ignored the lovers feelings altogether and even refused to admit that a trace of the devil perhaps a trace of colour may lend piquancy especially if the connection be not permanent  among these men of whom so many of the greatest talents were to live such passionate lives and die such tragic deaths one serene man t w rolleston seemed always out of place it was i brought him there intending to set him to some work in ireland later on i have known young dublin working men slip out of their workshop to see the second thomas davis passing by and even remember a conspiracy by some three or four to make him the leader of the irish race at home  abroad and all because he had regular features and when all is said alexander the great  alcibiades were personable men and the founder of the christian religion was the only man who was neither a little too tall nor a little too short but exactly six feet high we in ireland thought as do the plays and ballads not understanding that from the first moment wherein nature foresaw the birth of bastienlepage she has only granted great creative power to men whose faces are contorted with extravagance or curiosity or dulled with some protecting stupidity  i had now met all those who were to make the nineties of the last century tragic in the history of literature but as yet we were all seemingly equal whether in talent or in luck and scarce even personalities to one another i remember saying one night at the cheshire cheese when more poets than usual had come none of us can say who will succeed or even who has or has not talent the only thing certain about us is that we are too many     xvi   i have described what imagealways opposite to the natural self or the natural worldwilde henley morris copied or tried to copy but i have not said if i found an image for myself i know very little about myself and much less of that antiself probably the woman who cooks my dinner or the woman who sweeps out my study knows more than i it is perhaps because nature made me a gregarious man going hither and thither looking for conversation and ready to deny from fear or favour his dearest conviction that i love proud and lonely images when i was a child and went daily to the sextons daughter for writing lessons i found one poem in her school reader that delighted me beyond all others a fragment of some metrical translation from aristophanes wherein the birds sing scorn upon mankind in later years my mind gave itself to gregarious shelleys dream of a young man his hair blanched with sorrow studying philosophy in some lonely tower or of his old man master of all human knowledge hidden from human sight in some shellstrewn cavern on the mediterranean shore one passage above all ran perpetually in my ears    some feign that he is enoch others dream   he was preadamite and has survived   cycles of generation and of ruin   the sage in truth by dreadful abstinence   and conquering penance of the mutinous flesh   deep contemplation and unwearied study   in years outstretched beyond the date of man   may have attained to sovereignty and science   over those strong and secret things and thoughts   which others fear and know not    mahmud   i would talk   with this old jew    hassan   thy will is even now   made known to him where he dwells in a seacavern   mid the demonesi less accessible   than thou or god he who would question him   must sail alone at sunset where the stream   of ocean sleeps around those foamless isles   when the young moon is westering as now   and evening airs wander upon the wave   and when the pines of that beepasturing isle   green erebinthus quench the fiery shadow   of his gilt prow within the sapphire water   then must the lonely helmsman cry aloud   ahasuerus and the caverns round   will answer ahasuerus if his prayer   be granted a faint meteor will arise   lighting him over marmora and a wind   will rush out of the sighing pineforest   and with the wind a storm of harmony   unutterably sweet and pilot him   through the soft twilight to the bosphorus   thence at the hour and place and circumstance   fit for the matter of their conference   the jew appears few dare and few who dare   win the desired communion  already in dublin i had been attracted to the theosophists because they had affirmed the real existence of the jew or of his like and apart from whatever might have been imagined by huxley tyndall carolus duran and bastienlepage i saw nothing against his reality presently having heard that madame blavatsky had arrived from france or from india i thought it time to look the matter up certainly if wisdom existed anywhere in the world it must be in some such lonely mind admitting no duty to us communing with god only conceding nothing from fear or favour have not all peoples while bound together in a single mind and taste believed that such men existed and paid them that honour or paid it to their mere shadow which they have refused to philanthropists and to men of learning  i found madame blavatsky in a little house at norwood with but as she said three followers leftthe society of psychical research had just reported on her indian phenomenaand as one of the three followers sat in an outer room to keep out undesirable visitors i was kept a long time kicking my heels presently i was admitted and found an old woman in a plain loose dark dress a sort of old irish peasant woman with an air of humour and audacious power i was still kept waiting for she was deep in conversation with a woman visitor i strayed through folding doors into the next room and stood in sheer idleness of mind looking at a cuckoo clock it was certainly stopped for the weights were off and lying upon the ground and yet as i stood there the cuckoo came out and cuckooed at me i interrupted madame blavatsky to say your clock has hooted me it often hoots at a stranger she replied is there a spirit in it i said i do not know she said i should have to be alone to know what is in it i went back to the clock and began examining it and heard her say do not break my clock i wondered if there was some hidden mechanism and i should have been put out i suppose had i found any though henley had said to me of course she gets up fraudulent miracles but a person of genius has to do something sarah bernhardt sleeps in her coffin presently the visitor went away and madame blavatsky explained that she was a propagandist for womens rights who had called to find out why men were so bad what explanation did you give her i said that men were born bad but women made themselves so and then she explained that i had been kept waiting because she had mistaken me for some man whose name resembled mine and who wanted to persuade her of the flatness of the earth  when i next saw her she had moved into a house at holland park and some time must have passedprobably i had been in sligo where i returned constantly for long visitsfor she was surrounded by followers she sat nightly before a little table covered with green baize and on this green baize she scribbled constantly with a piece of white chalk she would scribble symbols sometimes humorously applied and sometimes unintelligible figures but the chalk was intended to mark down her score when she played patience one saw in the next room a large table where every night her followers and guests often a great number sat down to their vegetarian meal while she encouraged or mocked through the folding doors a great passionate nature a sort of female dr johnson impressive i think to every man or woman who had themselves any richness she seemed impatient of the formalism of the shrill abstract idealism of those about her and this impatience broke out inrailing  many nicknames o you are a flapdoodle but then you are a theosophist and a brother the most devout and learned of all her followers said to me hpb has just told me that there is another globe stuck on to this at the north pole so that the earth has really a shape something like a dumbbell i said for i knew that her imagination contained all the folklore of the world that must be some piece of eastern mythology o no it is not he said of that i am certain and there must be something in it or she would not have said it her mockery was not kept for her followers alone and her voice would become harsh and her mockery lose phantasy and humour when she spoke of what seemed to her scientific materialism once i saw this antagonism guided by some kind of telepathic divination take a form of brutal phantasy i brought a very able dublin woman to see her and this woman had a brother a physiologist whose reputation though known to specialists alone was european and because of this brother a family pride in everything scientific and modern the dublin woman scarcely opened her mouth the whole evening and her name was certainly unknown to madame blavatsky yet i saw at once in that wrinkled old face bent over the cards and the only time i ever saw it there a personal hostility the dislike of one woman for another madame blavatsky seemed to bundle herself up becoming all primeval peasant and began complaining of her ailments more especially of her bad leg but of late her masterher old jew her ahasuerus cured it or set it on the way to be cured i was sitting here in my chair she said when the master came in and brought something with him which he put over my knee something warm which enclosed my kneeit was a live dog which he had cut open i recognised a cure used sometimes in mediaeval medicine she had two masters and their portraits ideal indian heads painted by some most incompetent artist stood upon either side of the folding doors one night when talk was impersonal and general i sat gazing through the folding doors into the dimly lighted diningroom beyond i noticed a curious red light shining upon a picture and got up to see where the red light came from it was the picture of an indian and as i came near it slowly vanished when i returned to my seat madame blavatsky said what did you see a picture i said tell it to go away it is already gone so much the better she said i was afraid it was medium ship but it is only clairvoyance what is the difference if it had been medium ship it would have stayed in spite of you beware of medium ship it is a kind of madness i know for i have been through it  i found her almost always full of gaiety that unlike the occasional joking of those about her was illogical and incalculable and yet always kindly and tolerant i had called one evening to find her absent but expected every moment she had been somewhere at the seaside for her health and arrived with a little suite of followers she sat down at once in her big chair and began unfolding a brown paper parcel while all looked on full of curiosity it contained a large family bible this is a present for my maid she said what a bible and not even anointed said some shocked voice well my children was the answer what is the good of giving lemons to those who want oranges when i first began to frequent her house as i soon did very constantly i noticed a handsome clever woman of the world there who seemed certainly very much out of place penitent though she thought herself presently there was much scandal and gossip for the penitent was plainly entangled with two young men who were expected to grow into ascetic sages the scandal was so great that madame blavatsky had to call the penitent before her and to speak after this fashion we think that it is necessary to crush the animal nature you should live in chastity in act and thought initiation is granted only to those who are entirely chaste and so to run on for some time however after some minutes in that vehement style the penitent standing crushed and shamed before her she had wound up i cannot permit you more than one she was quite sincere but thought that nothing mattered but what happened in the mind and that if we could not master the mind our actions were of little importance one young man filled her with exasperation for she thought that his settled gloom came from his chastity i had known him in dublin where he had been accustomed to interrupt long periods of asceticism in which he would eat vegetables and drink water with brief outbreaks of what he considered the devil after an outbreak he would for a few hours dazzle the imagination of the members of the local theosophical society with poetical rhapsodies about harlots and street lamps and then sink into weeks of melancholy a fellow theosophist once found him hanging from the window pole but cut him down in the nick of time i said to the man who cut him down what did you say to one another he said we spent the night telling comic stories and laughing a great deal this man torn between sensuality and visionary ambition was now the most devout of all and told me that in the middle of the night he could often hear the ringing of the little astral bell whereby madame blavatskys master called her attention and that although it was a low silvery sound it made the whole house shake another night i found him waiting in the hall to show in those who had the right of entrance on some night when the discussion was private and as i passed he whispered into my ear madame blavatsky is perhaps not a real woman at all they say that her dead body was found many years ago upon some russian battlefield she had two dominant moods both of extreme activity but one calm and philosophic and this was the mood always on that night in the week when she answered questions upon her system and as i look back after thirty years i often ask myself was her speech automatic was she for one night in every week a trance medium or in some similar state in the other mood she was full of phantasy and inconsequent raillery that is the greek church a triangle like all true religion i recall her saying as she chalked out a triangle on the green baize and then as she made it disappear in meaningless scribbles it spread out and became a bramblebush like the church of rome then rubbing it all out except one straight line now they have lopped off the branches and turned it into a broomstick arid that is protestantism and so it was night after night always varied and unforseen i have observed a like sudden extreme change in others half whose thought was supernatural and laurence oliphant records some where or other like observations i can remember only once finding her in a mood of reverie something had happened to damp her spirits some attack upon her movement or upon herself she spoke of balzac whom she had seen but once of alfred de musset whom she had known well enough to dislike for his morbidity and of george sand whom she had known so well that they had dabbled in magic together of which neither knew anything at all in those days and she ran on as if there was nobody there to overhear her i used to wonder at and pity the people who sell their souls to the devil but now i only pity them they do it to have somebody on their sides and added to that after some words i have forgotten i write write write as the wandering jew walks walks walks besides the devotees who came to listen and to turn every doctrine into a new sanction for the puritanical convictions of their victorian childhood cranks came from half europe and from all america and they came that they might talk one american said to me she has become the most famous woman in the world by sitting in a big chair and permitting us to talk they talked and she played patience and totted up her score on the green baize and generally seemed to listen but sometimes she would listen no more there was a woman who talked perpetually of the divine spark within her until madame blavatsky stopped her withyes my dear you have a divine spark within you and if you are not very careful you will hear it snore a certain salvation army captain probably pleased her for if vociferous and loud of voice he had much animation he had known hardship and spoke of his visions while starving in the streets and he was still perhaps a little light in the head i wondered what he could preach to ignorant men his head ablaze with wild mysticism till i met a man who had heard him talking near covent garden to some crowd in the street my friends he was saying you have the kingdom of heaven within you and it would take a pretty big pill to get that out     xvii   meanwhile i had not got any nearer to proving that ahasuerus dwells in a seacavern mid the demonesi but one conclusion i certainly did come to which i find written out in an old diary and dated 1887 madame blavatskys masters were trance personalities but by trance personalities i meant something almost as exciting as ahasuerus himself years before i had found on a table in the royal irish academy a pamphlet on japanese art and read there of an animal painter so remarkable that horses he had painted upon a temple wall had stepped down after and trampled the neighbouring fields of rice somebody had come to the temple in the early morning been startled by a shower of water drops looked up and seen a painted horse still wet from the dewcovered fields but now trembling into stillness i thought that her masters were imaginary forms created by suggestion but whether that suggestion came from madame blavatskys own mind or from some mind perhaps at a great distance i did not know and i believed that these forms could pass from madame blavatskys mind to the minds of others and even acquire external reality and that it was even possible that they talked and wrote they were born in the imagination where blake had declared that all men live after death and where every man is king or priest in his own house certainly the house at holland park was a romantic place where one heard of constant apparitions and exchanged speculations like those of the middle ages and i did not separate myself from it by my own will the secretary an intelligent and friendly man asked me to come and see him and when i did complained that i was causing discussion and disturbance a certain fanatical hungry face had been noticed red and tearful  it was quite plain that i was not in full agreement with their method or their philosophy i know he said that all these people become dogmatic and fanatical because they believe what they can never prove that their withdrawal from family life is to them a great misfortune but what are we to do we have been told that all spiritual influx into the society will come to an end in 1897 for exactly one hundred years before that date our fundamental ideas must be spread through the world i knew the doctrine and it had made me wonder why that old woman or rather the trance personalities who directed her and were her genius insisted upon it for influx of some kind there must always be did they dread heresy after the death of madame blavatsky or had they no purpose but the greatest possible immediate effort     xviii   at the british museum readingroom i often saw a man of thirtysix or thirtyseven in a brown velveteen coat with a gaunt resolute face and an athletic body who seemed before i heard his name or knew the nature of his studies a figure of romance presently i was introduced where or by what man or woman i do not remember he was macgregor mathers the author of the kabbalas unveiled  his studies were two onlymagic and the theory of war for he believed himself a born commander and all but equal in wisdom and in power to that old jew he had copied many manuscripts on magic ceremonial and doctrine in the british museum and was to copy many more in continental libraries and it was through him mainly that i began certain studies and experiences that were to convince me that images well up before the minds eye from a deeper source than conscious or subconscious memory i believe that his mind in those early days did not belie his face and body though in later years it became unhinged for he kept a proud head amid great poverty one that boxed with him nightly has told me that for many weeks he could knock him down though macgregor was the stronger man and only knew long after that during those weeks macgregor starved with him i met an old whitehaired oxfordshire clergyman the most panicstricken person i have ever known though macgregors introduction had been he unites us to the great adepts of antiquity this old man took me aside that he might sayi hope you never invoke spiritsthat is a very dangerous thing to do i am told that even the planetary spirits turn upon us in the end i said have you ever seen an apparition o yes once he said i have my alchemical laboratory in a cellar under my house where the bishop cannot see it one day i was walking up  down there when i heard another footstep walking up and down beside me i turned and saw a girl i had been in love with when i was a young man but she died long ago she wanted me to kiss her oh no i would not do that why not i said oh she might have got power over me has your alchemical research had any success i said yes i once made the elixir of life a french alchemist said it had the right smell and the right colour the alchemist may have been elephas levi who visited england in the sixties  would have said anything but the first effect of the elixir is that your nails fall out and your hair falls off i was afraid that i might have made a mistake and that nothing else might happen so i put it away on a shelf i meant to drink it when i was an old man but when i got it down the other day it had all dried up     xix   i generalized a great deal and was ashamed of it i thought that it was my business in life to bean artist and a poet and that there could be no business comparable to that i refused to read books and even to meet people who excited me to generalization but all to no purpose i said my prayers much as in childhood though without the old regularity of hour and place and i began to pray that my imagination might somehow be rescued from abstraction and become as preoccupied with life as had been the imagination of chaucer for ten or twelve years more i suffered continual remorse and only became content when my abstractions had composed themselves into picture and dramatization my very remorse helped to spoil my early poetry giving it an element of sentimentality through my refusal to permit it any share of an intellect which i considered impure even in practical life i only very gradually began to use generalizations that have since become the foundation of all i have done or shall do in ireland for all i know all men may have been as timid for i am persuaded that our intellects at twenty contain all the truths we shall ever find but as yet we do not know truths that belong to us from opinions caught up in casual irritation or momentary phantasy as life goes on we discover that certain thoughts sustain us in defeat or give us victory whether over ourselves or others  it is these thoughts tested by passion that we call convictions among subjective men in all those that is who must spin a web out of their own bowels the victory is an intellectual daily recreation of all that exterior fate snatches away and so that fates antithesis while what i have called the mask is an emotional antithesis to all that comes out of their internal nature we begin to live when we have conceived life as a tragedy     xx   a conviction that the world was now but a bundle of fragments possessed me without ceasing i had tried this conviction on the rhymers thereby plunging into greater silence an already too silent evening johnson i was accustomed to say you are the only man i know whose silence has beak  claw i had lectured on it to some london irish society and i was to lecture upon it later on in dublin but i never found but one interested man an official of the primrose league who was also an active member of the fenian brotherhood i am an extreme conservative apart from ireland i have heard him explain and i have no doubt that personal experience made him share the sight of any eye that saw the world in fragments i had been put into a rage by the followers of huxley tyndall carolus duran and bastienlepage who not only asserted the unimportance of subject whether in art or literature but the independence of the arts from one another upon the other hand i delighted in every age where poet and artist confined themselves gladly to some inherited subject matter known to the whole people for i thought that in man and race alike there is something called unity of being using that term as dante used it when he compared beauty in the convito to a perfectly proportioned human body my father from whom i had learned the term preferred a comparison to a musical instrument so strong that if we touch a string all the strings murmur faintly there is not more desire he had said in lust than in true love but in true love desire awakens pity hope affection admiration and given appropriate circumstance every emotion possible to man when i began however to apply this thought to the state and to argue for a lawmade balance among trades and occupations my father displayed at once the violent freetrader and propagandist of liberty i thought that the enemy of this unity was abstraction meaning by abstraction not the distinction but the isolation of occupation or class or faculty    call down the hawk from the air   let him be hooded or caged   till the yellow eye has grown mild   for larder and spit are bare   the old cook enraged   the scullion gone wild  i knew no mediaeval cathedral and westminster being a part of abhorred london did not interest me but i thought constantly of homer and dante and the tombs of mausolus and artemisa the great figures of king and queen and the lesser figures of greek and amazon centaur and greek i thought that all art should be a centaur finding in the popular lore its back and its strong legs i got great pleasure too from remembering that homer was sung and from that tale of dante hearing a common man sing some stanza from the divine comedy and from don quixotes meeting with some common man that sang ariosto morris had never seemed to care for any poet later than chaucer and though i preferred shakespeare to chaucer i begrudged my own preference had not europe shared one mind and heart until both mind and heart began to break into fragments a little before shakespeares birth music and verse began to fall apart when chaucer robbed verse of its speed that he might give it greater meditation though for another generation or so minstrels were to sing his long elaborated troilus and cressida painting parted from religion in the later renaissance that it might study effects of tangibility undisturbed while that it might characterise where it had once personified it renounced in our own age all that inherited subject matter which we have named poetry presently i was indeed to number character itself among the abstractions encouraged by congreves saying that passions are too powerful in the fair sex to let humour or as we say character have its course nor have we fared better under the common daylight for pure reason has notoriously made but light of practical reason and has been made but light of in its turn from that morning when descartes discovered that he could think better in his bed than out of it nor needed i original thought to discover being so late of the school of morris that machinery had not separated from handicraft wholly for the worlds good nor to notice that the distinction of classes had become their isolation if the london merchants of our day competed together in writing lyrics they would not like the tudor merchants dance in the open street before the house of the victor nor do the great ladies of london finish their balls on the pavement before their doors as did the great venetian ladies even in the eighteenth century conscious of an all enfolding sympathy doubtless because fragments broke into even smaller fragments we saw one another in a light of bitter comedy and in the arts where now one technical element reigned and now another generation hated generation and accomplished beauty was snatched away when it had most engaged our affections one thing i did not foresee not having the courage of my own thoughtthe growing murderousness of the world    turning and turning in the widening gyre   the falcon cannot hear the falconer   things fall apart the centre cannot hold   mere anarchy is loosed upon the world   the blooddimmed tide is loosed and everywhere   the ceremony of innocence is drowned   the best lack all conviction while the worst   are full of passionate intensity     xxi   the huxley tyndall carolus duran bastienlepage coven asserted that an artist or a poet must paint or write in the style of his own day and this with the fairy queen and lyrical ballads and blakes early poems in its ears and plain to the eyes in book or gallery those great masterpieces of later egypt founded upon that work of the ancient kingdom already further in time from later egypt than later egypt is from us i knew that i could choose my style where i pleased that no man can deny to the human mind any power that power once achieved and yet i did not wish to recover the first simplicity if i must be but a shepherd building his hut among the ruins of some fallen city i might take porphyry or shaped marble if it lay ready to my hand instead of the baked clay of the first builders if chaucers personages had disengaged themselves from chaucers crowd forgotten their common goal and shrine and after sundry magnifications become each in his turn the centre of some elizabethan play and a few years later split into their elements and so given birth to romantic poetry i need not reverse the cinematograph i could take those separated elements all that abstract love and melancholy and give them a symbolical or mythological coherence not chaucers roughtongued riders but some procession of the gods a pilgrimage no more but perhaps a shrine might i not with health and good luck to aid me create some new prometheus unbound patrick or columbcille oisin or fion in prometheuss stead and instead of caucasus croaghpatrick or ben bulben have not all races had their first unity from a polytheism that marries them to rock and hill we had in ireland imaginative stories which the uneducated classes knew and even sang and might we not make those stories current among the educated classes rediscovering for the works sake what i have called the applied arts of literature the association of literature that is with music speech and dance and at last it might be so deepen the political passion of the nation that all artist and poet craftsman and day labourer would accept a common design perhaps even these images once created and associated with river and mountain might move of themselves and with some powerful even turbulent life like those painted horses that trampled the rice fields of japan     xxii   i used to tell the few friends to whom i could speak these secret thoughts that i would make the attempt in ireland but fail for our civilisation its elements multiplying by divisions like certain low forms of life was all powerful but in reality i had the wildest hopes today i add to that first conviction to that first desire for unity this other conviction long a mere opinion vaguely or intermittently apprehended nations races and individual men are unified by an image or bundle of related images symbolical or evocative of the state of mind which is of all states of mind not impossible the most difficult to that man race or nation because only the greatest obstacle that can be contemplated without despair rouses the will to full intensity a powerful class by terror rhetoric and organised sentimentality may drive their people to war but the day draws near when they cannot keep them there and how shall they face the pure nations of the east when the day comes to do it with but equal arms i had seen ireland in my own time turn from the bragging rhetoric and gregarious humour of oconnells generation and school and offer herself to the solitary and proud parnell as to her antiself buskin following hard on sock and i had begun to hope or to halfhope that we might be the first in europe to seek unity as deliberately as it had been sought by theologian poet sculptor architect from the eleventh to the thirteenth century doubtless we must seek it differently no longer considering it convenient to epitomise all human knowledge but find it we well might could we first find philosophy and a little passion     xxiii   it was the death of parnell that convinced me that the moment had come for work in ireland for i knew that for a time the imagination of young men would turn from politics there was a little irish patriotic society of young people clerks shopboys shopgirls and the like called the southwark irish literary society it had ceased to meet because each member of the committee had lectured so many times that the girls got the giggles whenever he stood up i invited the committee to my fathers house at bedford park and there proposed a new organisation after a few months spent in founding with the help of t w rolleston who came to that first meeting and had a knowledge of committee work i lacked the irish literary society which soon included every london irish author and journalist i went to dublin and founded there a similar society  w b yeats    here ends four years written by   william butler yeats four hundred   copies of
