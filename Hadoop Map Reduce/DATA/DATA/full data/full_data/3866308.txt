3866308	the sleeping cara farce by william d howells   i   scene one side of a sleepingcar on the boston and albany road  the curtains are drawn before most of the berths from the hooks and rods hang hats bonnets bags bandboxes umbrellas and other travelling gear on the floor are boots of both sexes set out for the porter to black  the porter is making up the beds in the upper and lower berths adjoining the seats on which a young mother slender and pretty with a baby asleep on the seat beside her and a stout old lady sit confronting each othermrs agnes roberts and her aunt mary  mrs roberts  do you always take down your back hair aunty  aunt mary  no never child at least not since i had such a fright about it once coming on from new york  its all well enough to take down your back hair if it is yours but if it isnt your heads the best place for it  now as i buy mine of madame pierrot  mrs roberts  dont you wish she wouldnt advertise it as human hair  it sounds so pokerishlike human flesh you know  aunt mary  why she couldnt call it inhuman hair my dear  mrs roberts thoughtfully  nojust hair  aunt mary  then people might think it was for mattresses  but as i was saying i took it off that night and tucked it safely away as i supposed in my pocket and i slept sweetly till about midnight when i happened to open my eyes and saw something long and black crawl off my bed and slip under the berth  such a shriek as i gave my dear  a snake a snake oh a snake and everybody began talking at once and some of the gentlemen swearing and the porter came running with the poker to kill it and all the while it was that ridiculous switch of mine that had worked out of my pocket  and glad enough i was to grab it up before anybody saw it and say i must have been dreaming  mrs roberts  why aunty how funny  how could you suppose a serpent could get on board a sleepingcar of all places in the world  aunt mary  that was the perfect absurdity of it  the porter  berths ready now ladies  mrs roberts to the porter who walks away to the end of the car and sits down near the door  oh thank you  aunty do you feel nervous the least bit  aunt mary  nervous  no  why  mrs roberts  well i dont know  i suppose ive been worked up a little about meeting willis and wondering how hell look and all  we cant know each other of course  it doesnt stand to reason that if hes been out there for twelve years ever since i was a child though weve corresponded regularlyat least i havethat he could recognize me not at the first glance you know  hell have a full beard and then ive got married and heres the baby  oh no hell never guess who it is in the world  photographs really amount to nothing in such a case i wish we were at home and it was all over  i wish he had written some particulars instead of telegraphing from ogden be with you on the 7 am wednesday  aunt mary  californians always telegraph my dear they never think of writing  it isnt expensive enough and it doesnt make your blood run cold enough to get a letter and so they send you one of those miserable yellow despatches whenever they canthose printed in a long string if possible so that youll be sure to die before you get to the end of it  i suppose your brother has fallen into all those ways and says reckon and ornary and which the same just like one of mr bret hartes characters  mrs roberts  but it isnt exactly our not knowing each other aunty thats worrying me thats something that could be got over in time  what is simply driving me distracted is willis and edward meeting there when im away from home  oh how could i be away and why couldnt willis have given us fair warning  i would have hurried from the ends of the earth to meet him  i dont believe poor edward ever saw a californian and hes so quiet and preoccupied im sure hed never get on with willis  and if willis is the least loud he wouldnt like edward  not that i suppose he is loud but i dont believe he knows anything about literary men  but you can see aunty cant you how very anxious i must be  dont you see that i ought to have been there when willis and edward met so as totowell to break them to each other dont you know  aunt mary  oh you neednt be troubled about that agnes  i dare say theyve got on perfectly well together  very likely theyre sitting down to the unwholesomest hot supper this instant that the ingenuity of man could invent  mrs roberts  oh do you think they are aunty  oh if i could only believe they were sitting down to a hot supper together now i should be so happy  theyd be sure to get on if they were  theres nothing like eating to make men friendly with each other  dont you know at receptions how they never have anything to say to each other till the escalloped oysters and the chicken salad appear and then how sweet they are as soon as theyve helped the ladies to ice  oh thank you thank you aunty for thinking of the hot supper  its such a relief to my mind  you can understand cant you aunty dear how anxious i must have been to have my only brother and my onlymy husbandget on nicely together  my life would be a wreck simply a wreck if they didnt  and willis and i not having seen each other since i was a child makes it all the worse  i do hope theyre sitting down to a hot supper  an angry voice from the next berth but one  i wish people in sleeping cars  a voice from the berth beyond that  youre mistaken in your premises sir  this is a wakingcar  ladies go on and oblige an eager listener  sensation and smothered laughter from the other berths  mrs roberts after a space of terrified silence in a loud whisper to her aunt  what horrid things  but now we really must go to bed  it was too bad to keep talking  id no idea my voice was getting so loud which berth will you have aunty  id better take the upper one because  aunt mary whispering  no no i must take that so that you can be with the baby below  mrs roberts  oh how good you are aunt mary  its too bad it is really  i cant let you  aunt mary  well then you must thats all  you know how that child tosses and kicks about in the night  you never can tell where his heads going to be in the morning but youll probably find it at the foot of the bed  i couldnt sleep an instant my dear if i thought that boy was in the upper berth for id be sure of his tumbling out over you  here let me lay him down  she lays the baby in the lower berth  there  now get in agnesdo and leave me to my struggle with the attraction of gravitation  mrs roberts  oh poor aunty how will you ever manage it  i must help you up  aunt mary  no my dear dont be foolish  but you may go and call the porter if you like  i dare say hes used to it  mrs roberts goes and speak timidly to the porter who fails at first to understand then smiles broadly accepts a quarter with a duck of his head and comes forward to aunt marys side  mrs roberts  had he better give you his hand to rest your foot in while you spring up as if you were mounting horseback  aunt mary with disdain  spring  my dear i havent sprung for a quarter of a century  i shall require every fibre in the mans body  his hand indeed  you get in first agnes  mrs roberts  i will aunty dear but  aunt mary sternly  agnes do as i say  mrs roberts crouches down on the lower berth  i dont choose that any member of my family shall witness my contortions  dont you look  mrs roberts  no no aunty  aunt mary  now porter are you strong  porter  i used to be porter at a saratoga hotel and carried up de ladies trunks dere  aunt mary  then youll do i think  now then your knee now your back  there  and very handsomely done  thanks  mrs roberts  are you really in aunt mary  aunt mary dryly  yes  goodnight  mrs roberts  goodnight aunty  after a pause of some minutes aunty  aunt mary  well what  mrs roberts  do you think its perfectly safe  she rises in her berth and looks up over the edge of the upper  aunt mary  i suppose so  its a wellmanaged road  theyve got the air brake ive heard and the miller platform and all those horrid things what makes you introduce such unpleasant subjects  mrs roberts  oh i dont mean accidents  but you know when you turn it does creak so awfully  i shouldnt mind myself but the baby  aunt mary  why child do you think im going to break through  i couldnt  im one of the lightest sleepers in the world  mrs roberts  yes i know youre a light sleeper butbut it doesnt seem quite the same thing somehow  aunt mary  but it is its quite the same thing and you can be perfectly easy in your mind my dear  i should be quite as loth to break through as you would to have me  goodnight  mrs roberts  yes goodnight aunty  aunt mary  well  mrs roberts  you ought to just see him how hes lying  hes a perfect log  couldnt you just bend over and peep down at him a moment  aunt mary  bend over  it would be the death of me  goodnight  mrs roberts  goodnight  did you put the glass into my bag or yours  i feel so very thirsty and i want to go and get some water  im sure i dont know why i should be thirsty  are you aunt mary  ah here it is dont disturb yourself aunty ive found it  it was in my bag just where id put it myself  but all this trouble about willis has made me so fidgety that i dont know where anything is  and now i dont know how to manage about the baby while i go after the water  hes sleeping soundly enough now but if he should happen to get into one of his rolling moods he might tumble out on to the floor  never mind aunty ive thought of something  ill just barricade him with these bags and shawls  now old fellow roll as much as you like  if you should happen to hear him stir aunty wont youaunty  oh dear shes asleep already and what shall i do  while mrs roberts continues talking various notes of protest profane and otherwise make themselves heard from different berths  i know  ill make a bold dash for the water and be back in an instant baby  now dont you move you little rogue she runs to the watertank at the end of the car and then back to her berth  now baby heres mamma again  are you all right mammas own  a shaggy head and bearded face are thrust from the curtains of the next berth  the stranger  look here maam  i dont want to be disagreeable about this thing and i hope you wont take any offence but the fact is im half dead for want of sleep and if youll only keep quiet now a little while ill promise not to speak above my breath if ever i find you on a sleepingcar after youve come straight through from san francisco day and night and not been able to get more than about a quarter of your usual allowance of resti will indeed  mrs roberts  im very sorry that ive disturbed you and ill try to be more quiet  i didnt suppose i was speaking so loud but the cars keep up such a rattling that you never can tell how loud you are speaking did i understand you to say that you were from california  the californian  yes maam  mrs roberts  san francisco  the californian  yes maam  mrs roberts  thanks  its a terribly long journey isnt it  i know quite how to feel for you  ive a brother myself coming on  in fact we expected him before this  she scans his face as sharply as the lamp light will allow and continues after a brief hesitation  its always such a silly question to ask a person and i suppose san francisco is a large place with a great many people always coming and going so that it would be only one chance in a thousand if you did  the californian patiently  did what maam  mrs roberts  oh i was just wondering if it was possiblebut of course it isnt and its very flat to askthat youd ever happened to meet my brother there  his name is willis campbell  the californian with more interest  campbell  campbell  yes i know a man of that name  but i disremember his first name  little low fellowpretty chunky  mrs roberts  i dont know  do you mean short and stout  the californian  yes maam  mrs roberts  im sure i cant tell  its a great many years since he went out there and ive never seen him in all that time  i thought if you did happen to know himhes a lawyer  the californian  its quite likely i know him and in the morning maam  mrs roberts  oh excuse me  im very sorry to have kept you so long awake with my silly questions  the man in the upper berth  dont apologize madam  im not a californian myself but im an orphan and away from home and i thank you on behalf of all our fellowpassengers for the mental refreshment that your conversation has afforded us  i could lie here and listen to it all night but there are invalids in some of these berths and perhaps on their account it will be as well to defer everything till the morning as our friend suggests  allow me to wish you pleasant dreams madam  the californian while mrs roberts shrinks back under the curtain of her berth in dismay and stammers some inaudible excuse slowly emerges full length from his berth  the californian  dont you mind me maam ive got everything but my boots and coat on  now then standing beside the berth and looking in upon the man in the upper tier you do you know that this is a lady youre talking to  the upper berth  by your voice and your shaggy personal appearance i shouldnt have taken you for a ladyno sir  but the light is very imperfect you may be a bearded lady  the californian  you never mind about my looks  the question is do you want your head rapped up against the side of this car  the upper berth  with all the frankness of your own pacific slope no  mrs roberts hastily reappearing  oh no no dont hurt him  hes not to blame  i was wrong to keep on talking  oh please dont hurt him  the californian to the upper berth  you hear  well now dont you speak another word to that lady tonight  just go on maam and free your mind on any little matter you like  i dont want any sleep  how long has your brother been in california  mrs roberts  oh dont lets talk about it now i dont want to talk about it  i thoughti thoughtgoodnight  oh dear  i didnt suppose i was making so much trouble  i didnt mean to disturb anybody  i  mrs roberts gives way to the excess of her confusion and mortification in a little sob and then hides her grief behind the curtains of her berth  the californian slowly emerges again from his couch and stands beside it looking in upon the man in the berth above  the californian  for half a cent i would rap your head up against that wall  making the lady cry and getting me so mad i cant sleep  now see here you just apologize  you beg that ladys pardon or ill have you out of there before you know yourself  cries of good thats right and make him show himself hail mrs robertss champion and heads more or less dishevelled are thrust from every berth  mrs roberts remains invisible and silent and the loud and somewhat complicated respiration of her aunt makes itself heard in the general hush of expectancy  a remark to the effect that the old lady seems to enjoy her rest achieves a facile applause  the californian again addresses the culprit  come now what do you say  ill give you just onehalf a minute  mrs roberts from her shelter  oh please please dont make him say anything  it was very trying in me to keep him awake and i know he didnt mean any offence  oh do let him be  the californian  you hear that  you stay quiet the rest of the time and if that lady choses to keep us all awake the whole night dont you say a word or ill settle with you in the morning  loud and continued applause amidst which the californian turns from the man in the berth before him and restores order by marching along the aisle of the car in his stocking feet  the heads vanish behind the curtains  as the laughter subsides he returns to his berth and after a stare up and down the tranquillized car he is about to retire  a voice  oh dont just bow  speak  a fresh burst of laughter greets this sally  the californian erects himself again with an air of baited wrath and then suddenly breaks into a helpless laugh  the californian  gentlemen youre too many for me  he gets into his berth and after cries of good for california youre all right william nye and youre several ahead yet the occupants of the different berths gradually relapse into silence and at last as the car lunges onward through the darkness nothing is heard but the rhythmical clank of the machinery with now and then a burst of audible slumber from mrs robertss aunt mary     ii   at worcester where the train has made the usual stop the porter with his lantern on his arm enters the car preceding a gentleman somewhat anxiously smiling his nervous speech contrasts painfully with the businesslike impassiveness of the porter who refuses with an air of incredulity to enter into the confidences which the gentleman seems reluctant to bestow  mr edward roberts  this is the governor marcy isnt it  the porter  yes sah  mr roberts  came on from albany and not from new york  the porter  yes sah it did  mr roberts  ah it must be all right  i  the porter  was your wife expecting you to come on board here  mr roberts  well no not exactly  she was expecting me to meet her at boston  but istruggling to give the situation dignity but failing and throwing himself with selfconvicted silliness upon the porters mercy  the fact is i thought i would surprise her by joining her here  the porter refusing to have any mercy  oh  how did you expect to find her  mr roberts  wellwelli dont know  i didnt consider  he looks down the aisle in despair at the closedrawn curtains of the berths and up at the dangling hats and bags and bonnets and down at the chaos of boots of both sexes on the floor  i dont know how i expected to find her  mr robertss countenance falls and he visibly sinks so low in his own esteem and an imaginary public opinion that the porter begins to have a little compassion  the porter  deys so many ladies on board i couldnt find her  mr roberts  oh no no of course not  i didnt expect that  the porter  dont like to go routing em all up you know  i wouldnt be allowed to  mr roberts  i dont ask it that would be preposterous  the porter  what sort of looking lady was she  mr roberts  well i dont know really  not very tall rather slight blue eyes  ii dont know what youd call her nose  andstop  oh yes she had a child with her a little boy  yes  the porter thoughtfully looking down the aisle  dey was three ladies had children  i didnt notice whether dey was boys or girls or what dey was  didnt have anybody with her  mr roberts  no no  only the child  the porter  well i dont know what you are going to do sah  it wont be a great while now till morning you know  here comes the conductor maybe hell know what to do  mr roberts makes some futile inarticulate attempts to prevent the porter from laying the case before the conductor and then stands guiltily smiling overwhelmed with the hopeless absurdity of his position  the conductor entering the car and stopping before the porter and looking at mr roberts  gentleman want a berth  the porter grinning  well no sah  hes lookin for his wife  the conductor with suspicion  is she aboard this car  mr roberts striving to propitiate the conductor by a dastardly amiability  oh yes yes  theres no mistake about the carthe governor marcy  she telegraphed the name just before you left albany so that i could find her at boston in the morning  ah  the conductor  at boston  sternly  then what are you trying to find her at worcester in the middle of the night for  mr roberts  whyithat is  the porter taking compassion on mr robertss inability to continue says he wanted to surprise her  mr roberts  hayes exactly  a little caprice you know  the conductor  well that may all be so  mr roberts continues to smile in agonized helplessness against the conductors injurious tone which becomes more and more offensively patronizing  but i cant do anything for you  here are all these people asleep in their berths and i cant go round waking them up because you want to surprise your wife  mr roberts  no no of course not  i never thought  the conductor  my advice to you is to have a berth made up and go to bed till we get to boston and surprise your wife by telling her what you tried to do  mr roberts unable to resent the patronage of this suggestion  well i dont know but i will  the conductor going out  the porter will make up the berth for you  mr roberts to the porter who is about to pull down the upper berth over a vacant seat  ah  erii dont think ill trouble you to make it up its so near morning now  just bring me a pillow and ill try to get a nap without lying down  he takes the vacant seat  the porter  all right sah  he goes to the end of the car and returns with a pillow  mr roberts  ahporter  the porter  yes sah  mr roberts  of course you didnt notice but you dont think you did notice who was in that berth yonder  he indicates a certain berth  the porter  dats a genleman in dat berth i think sah  mr roberts astutely  theres a bonnet hanging from the hook at the top  im not sure but it looks like my wifes bonnet  the porter evidently shaken by this reasoning but recovering his firmness  yes sah  but you cant depend upon de ladies to hang deir bonnets on de right hook  jes likely as not dat ladys took de hook at de foot of her berth instead o de head  sometimes dey takes both  mr roberts  ah  after a pause  porter  the porter  yes sah  mr roberts  you wouldnt feel justified in looking  the porter  i couldnt sah i couldnt indeed  mr roberts reaching his left hand toward the porters and pressing a half dollar into his instantly responsive palm  but theres nothing to prevent my looking if i feel perfectly sure of the bonnet  the porter  nno sah  mr roberts  all right  the porter retires to the end of the car and resumes the work of polishing the passengers boots  after an interval of quiet mr roberts rises and looking about him with what he feels to be melodramatic stealth approaches the suspected berth  he unloops the curtain with a trembling hand and peers ineffectually in he advances his head further and further into the darkened recess and then suddenly dodges back again with the californian hanging to his neckcloth with one hand  the californian savagely  what do you want  mr roberts struggling and breathless  iii want my wife  the californian  want your wife  have i got your wife  mr roberts  noahthat isah excuse mei thought you were my wife  the californian getting out of the berth but at the same time keeping hold of mr roberts  thought i was your wife  do i look like your wife  you cant play that on me old man  porter conductor  mr roberts agonized  oh i beseech you my dear sir dontdont  i can explain iti can indeed  i know it has an ugly look but if you will allow me two wordsonly two words  mrs roberts suddenly parting the curtain of her berth and springing out into the aisle with her hair wildly dishevelled  edward  mr roberts  oh agnes explain to this gentleman  imploringly  dont you know me  a voice  make him show you the strawberry mark on his left arm  mrs roberts  edward  edward  the californian mechanically looses his grip and they fly into each others embrace  where did you come from  a voice  centre door left hand one back  the conductor returning with his lantern  hallo  whats the matter here  a voice  train robbers  throw up your hands  tell the expressmessenger to bring his safe  the passengers emerge from their berths in various deshabille and bewilderment  the conductor to mr roberts  have you been making all this row waking up my passengers  the californian  no sir he hasnt  ive been making this row  this gentleman was peaceably looking for his wife and i misunderstood him you want to say anything to me  the conductor silently taking the californians measure with his eye as he stands six fret in his stockings  if i did id get the biggest brakeman i could find to do it for me  ive got nothing to say except that i think youd better all go back to bed again  he goes out and the passengers disappear one by one leaving the robertses and the californian alone  the californian to mr roberts  stranger im sorry i got you into this scrape  mr roberts  oh dont speak of it my dear sir  im sure we owe you all sorts of apologies which i shall be most happy to offer you at my house in boston with every needful explanation  he takes out his card and gives it to the californian who looks at it and then looks at mr roberts curiously  theres my address and im sure we shall both be glad to have you call  mrs roberts  oh yes indeed  the californian parts the curtains of his berth to reenter it  goodnight sir and i assure you we shall do nothing more to disturb youshall we edward  mr roberts  no  and now dear i think youd better go back to your berth  mrs roberts  i couldnt sleep and i shall not go back  is this your place  i will just rest my head on your shoulder and we must both be perfectly quiet  youve no idea what a nuisance i have been making of myself  the whole car was perfectly furious at me one time i kept talking so loud  i dont know how i came to do it but i suppose it was thinking about you and willis meeting without knowing each other made me nervous and i couldnt be still  i woke everybody up with my talking and some of them were quite outrageous in their remarks but i didnt blame them the least bit for i should have been just as bad  that california gentleman was perfectly splendid though  i can tell you he made them stop  we struck up quite a friendship  i told him i had a brother coming on from california and hes going to try to think whether he knows willis  groans and inarticulate protests make themselves heard from different berths  i declare ive got to talking again  there now i shall stop and they wont hear another squeak from me the rest of the night  she lifts her head from her husbands shoulder   i wonder if baby will roll out  he does kick so  and i just sprang up and left him when i heard your voice without putting anything to keep him in  i must go and have a look at him or i never can settle down no no dont you go edward youll be prying into all the wrong berths in the car you poor thing  you stay here and ill be back in half a second  i wonder which is my berth  ah thats it i know the one now she makes a sudden dash at a berth and pulling open the curtains is confronted by the bearded visage of the californian  ah  ow ow edward  ah  ii beg your pardon sir excuse me i didnt know it was you  i came for my baby  the californian solemnly  i havent got any baby maam  mrs roberts  nonoi thought you were my baby  the californian  perhaps i am maam ive lost so much sleep i could cry anyway  do i look like your baby  mrs roberts  no no you dont  in distress that overcomes her mortification  oh where is my baby  i left him all uncovered and hell take his death of cold even if he doesnt roll out  oh edward edward help me to find baby  mr roberts bustling aimlessly about  yes yes certainly my dear but dont be alarmed we shall find him  the californian getting out in his stocking feet  we shall find him maam if we have to search every berth in this car  dont you take on that babys going to be found if hes aboard the train now you bet  he looks about and then tears open the curtains of a berth at random  that your baby maam  mrs roberts flying upon the infant thus exposed  oh baby baby baby  i thought i had lost you  um um um  she clasps him in her arms and covers his face and neck with kisses  the californian as he gets back into his berth sotto voce  i wish i had been her baby  mrs roberts returning with her husband to his seat and bringing the baby with her  there  did you ever see such a sleeper edward  in her ecstasy she abandons all control of her voice and joyfully exclaims  he has slept all through this excitement without a wink  a solemn voice from one of the berths  i envy him  a laugh follows in which all the passengers join  mrs roberts in a hoarse whisper breaking a little with laughter  oh my goodness there i went again  but how funny  i assure you edward that if their remarks had not been about me i could have really quite enjoyed some of them  i wish there had been somebody here to take them down  and i hope i shall see some of the speakers in the morning beforeedward ive got an idea  mr roberts endeavoring to teach his wife by example to lower her voice which has risen again  whatwhat is it my dear  mrs roberts  why dont you see  how perfectly ridiculous it was of me not to think of it before though i did think of it once and hadnt the courage to insist upon it  but of course it is and it accounts for his being so polite and kind to me through all and its the only thing that can  yes yes it must be  mr roberts mystified  what  mrs roberts  willis  mr roberts  who  mrs roberts  this californian  mr roberts  oh  mrs roberts  no stranger could have been so patient andandattentive and i know that he recognized me from the first and hes just kept it up for a joke so as to surprise us and have a good laugh at us when we get to boston  of course its willis  mr roberts doubtfully  do you think so my dear  mrs roberts  i know it  didnt you notice how he looked at your card  and i want you to go at once and speak to him and turn the tables on him  mr roberts  iid rather not my dear  mrs roberts  why edward what can you mean  mr roberts  hes very violent  suppose it shouldnt be willis  mrs roberts  nonsense  it is willis  come lets both go and just tax him with it  he cant deny it after all hes done for me  she pulls her reluctant husband toward the californians berth and they each draw a curtain  willis  the californian with plaintive endurance  well maam  mrs roberts triumphantly  there  i knew it was you all along  how could you play such a joke on me  the californian  i didnt know thered been any joke but i suppose there must have been if you say so  who am i now maamyour husband or your baby or your husbands wife or  mrs roberts  how funny you are  you know youre willis campbell my only brother  now dont try to keep it up any longer willis  voices from various berths  give us a rest willis  jokes too thin willis  youre played out willis  own up old fellowown up  the californian issuing from his berth and walking up and down the aisle as before till quiet is restored  i havent got any sister and my name aint willis and it aint campbell  im very sorry because id like to oblige you any way i could  mrs roberts in deep mortification  its i who ought to apologize and i do most humbly  i dont know what to say but when i got to thinking about it and how kind you had been to me and how sweet you had been under all myinterruptions i felt perfectly sure that you couldnt be a mere stranger and then the idea struck me that you must be my brother in disguise and i was so certain of it that i couldnt help just letting you know that wed found you out and  mr roberts offering a belated and feeble moral support  yes  mrs roberts promptly turning upon him  and you ought to have kept me from making such a simpleton of myself edward  the californian soothingly  well maam that aint always so easy  a man may mean well and yet not be able to carry out his intentions  but its all right  and i reckon wed better try to quiet down again and get what rest we can  mrs roberts  why yes certainly and i will tryoh i will try not to disturb you again  and if theres anything we can do in reparation after we reach boston we shall be so glad to do it  they bow themselves away and return to their seat while the californian reenters his berth     iii   the train stops at framingham and the porter comes in with a passenger whom he shows to the seat opposite mr and mrs roberts  the porter  you can sit here sah  well be in in about an hour now hang up your bag for you sah  the passenger  no leave it on the seat here  the porter goes out and the robertses maintain a dejected silence  the bottom of the bag thrown carelessly on the seat is toward the robertses who regard it listlessly  mrs roberts suddenly clutching her husbands arm and hissing in his ear  see  she points to the white lettering on the bag where the name willis campbell san francisco is distinctly legible  but it cant be it must be some other campbell  i cant risk it  mr roberts  but theres the name  it would be very strange if there were two people from san francisco of exactly the same name  i will speak  mrs roberts as wildly as one can in whisper  no no i cant let you weve made ourselves the laughingstock of the whole car already with our mistakes and i cant go on  i would rather perish than ask him  you dont suppose it could be  no it couldnt  there may be twenty willis campbells in san francisco and there probably are  do you think he looks like me  he has a straight nose but you cant tell anything about the lower part of his face the beard covers it so and i cant make out the color of his eyes by this light  but of course its all nonsense  still if it should be  it would be very stupid of us to ride all the way from framingham to boston with that name staring one in the eyes  i wish he would turn it away  if it really turned out to be willis he would think we were awfully stiff and cold  but i cant help it i cant go attacking every stranger i see and accusing him of being my brother  no no i cant and i wont and thats all about it  she leans forward and addresses the stranger with sudden sweetness  excuse me sir but i am very much interested by the name on your bag  not that i think you are even acquainted with him and there are probably a great many of them there but your coming from the same city and all does seem a little queer and i hope you wont think me intrusive in speaking to you because if you should happen by the thousandth of a chance to be the right one i should be so happy  campbell  the right what madam  mrs roberts  the right willis campbell  campbell  i hope im not the wrong one though after a weeks pull on the railroad its pretty hard for a man to tell which willis campbell he is  may i ask if your

beard and mustaches and hes very lanky and stoops over a good deal but hes just as lovely as he can be and live and hes been as kind and patient as twenty jobs  campbell  speaks in a sort of soft slow grind  mrs roberts  yes  campbell  gentle and deferential to ladies  mrs roberts  as pie  campbell  its tom goodall  ill have him out of there in half a second  i want you to take him home with you agnes  hes the best fellow in the world  which is his berth  mrs roberts  dont ask me willis  but if youd go for baby youll be sure to find him  mr roberts timidly indicating a berth  i think thats the one  campbell plunging at it and pulling the curtains open  you old tom goodall  the californian appearing  i aint any tom goodall  my names abram sawyer  campbell falling back  well sir youre right  im awfully sorry to disturb you but from my sisters description here i felt certain you must be my old friend tom goodall  the californian  i aint surprised at it  im only surprised i aint tom goodall  ive been a baby twice and ive been a mans wife once and once ive been a longlost brother  campbell laughing  oh theyve found him  im the longlost brother  the californian sleepily  has she

dont  youd better make a night of it now  its almost morning anyway  we want you to go home with us and mrs roberts will give you a bed at her house and let you sleep a week  the californian  well i reckon youre right stranger  i seem to be in the hands of providence tonight anyhow  he pulls on his boots and coat and takes his seat beside campbell  i reckon there aint any use in fighting against providence  mrs roberts briskly as if she had often tried it and failed  oh not the least in the world  im sure it was all intended and if you had turned out to be willis at last i should be certain of it  what surprises me is that you shouldnt turn out to be anybody after all  the californian  yes it is kind of curious  but i couldnt help it  i did my best  mrs roberts  oh dont speak of it  we are the ones who ought to apologize  but if you only had been somebody it would have been such a good joke  we could always have had such a laugh over it dont you see  the californian  yes maam it would have been funny  but i hope youve enjoyed it as it is  mrs roberts  oh very much thanks to you  only i cant seem to get reconciled to your not being anybody after all  you must at least be some one weve heard about dont you think  its so strange that you and willis never even met  dont you think you have some acquaintances in common  campbell  look here agnes do you always shout at the top of your voice in this way when you converse in a sleepingcar  mrs roberts  was i talking loud again  well you cant help it if you want to make people hear you  campbell  but there must be a lot of them who dont want to hear you  i wonder that the passengers who are not bloodrelations dont throw things at youboots and handbags and language  mrs roberts  why thats what theyve been doinglanguage at leastand im only surprised theyre not doing it now  the californian rising  theyd better not maam  he patrols the car from end to end and quells some rising murmurs halting at the rebellious berths as he passes  mrs roberts enraptured by his companionship  oh he must be some connection  she glances through the window  i do believe that was newton or newtonville or west newton or newton centre  i must run and wake up baby and get him dressed  i shant want to wait an instant after we get in  why were slowing up  why i do believe were there edward were there  only fancy being there already  mr roberts  yes my dear  only were not quite there yet  hadnt we better call your aunt mary  mrs roberts  id forgotten her  campbell  is aunt mary with you  mrs roberts  to be sure she is  didnt i tell you  she came on expressly to meet you  campbell starting up impetuously  which berth is she in  mrs roberts  right over baby  campbell  and which berth is baby in  mrs roberts distractedly  why thats just what i cant tell  it was bad enough when they were all filled up but now since the people have begun to come out of them and some of them are made into seats i cant tell  the californian  ill look for you maam  i should like to wake up all the wrong passengers on this car  id take a pleasure in it  if you could make sure of any berth that aint the one ill begin on that  mrs roberts  i cant even be sure of the wrong one  no no you mustntthe californian moves away and pauses in front of one of the berths looking back inquiringly at mrs roberts  oh dont ask me i cant tell  to campbell

along with you  what do you want  the californian  aunt mary  aunt mary  go away  aunt mary indeed  mrs roberts running toward her followed by campbell and mr roberts why aunt mary it is you  and

let them wait till im dressed and then ill talk to them  send for the porter  she withdraws her head behind the curtain and then thrusts it out again and who pray may this be  she indicates the californian  mrs roberts  oh a friend of ours from california whos been so kind to us all night and whos going home with us  aunt mary  another ridiculous surprise i suppose  but he shall not surprise
