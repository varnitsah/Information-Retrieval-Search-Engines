33487203	frontispiece photograph of j m barrie       the novels tales and sketches of j m barrie   better dead    transcribers note  this volume from which this ebook was created contained originally the two books auld licht idylls and better dead  the introduction below discusses both books     published in new york by  charles scribners sons  1896     authors edition  copyright 1896 by charles scribners sons     to  frederick greenwood     introduction  this is the only american edition of my books produced with my sanction and i have special reasons for thanking messrs scribner for its publication they let it be seen by this edition what are my books for i know not how many volumes purporting to be by me are in circulation in america which are no books of mine  i have seen several of these bearing such titles as two of them an auld licht manse a tillyloss scandal and some of them announce themselves as authors editions or published by arrangement with the author  they consist of scraps collected and published without my knowledge and i entirely disown them  i have written no books save those that appear in this edition  i am asked to write a few lines on the front page of each of these volumes to say something as i take it about how they came into being  well they were written mainly to please one woman who is now dead but as i am writing a little book about my mother i shall say no more of her here  many of the chapters in auld licht idylls first appeared in a different form in the st jamess gazette and there is little doubt that they would never have appeared anywhere but for the encouragement given to me by the editor of that paper  it was pressure from him that induced me to write a second idyll and a third after i thought the first completed the picture he set me thinking seriously of these people and though he knew nothing of them himself may be said to have led me back to them  it seems odd and yet i am not the first nor the fiftieth who has left thrums at sunrise to seek the lifework that was all the time awaiting him at home  and we seldom sally forth a second time  i had always meant to be a novelist but london i thought was the quarry  for long i had an uneasy feeling that no one save the editor read my contributions for i was leading a lonely life in london and not another editor could i find in the land willing to print the scotch dialect  the magazines scotch and english would have nothing to say to mei think i tried them all with the courting of tnowheads bell but it never found shelter until it got within bookcovers  in time however i found another paper the british weekly with an editor as bold as my first or shall we say he suffered from the same infirmity  he revived my drooping hopes and i was again able to turn to the only kind of literary work i now seemed to have much interest in  he let me sign my articles which was a big step for me and led to my having requests for work from elsewhere but always the invitations said not scotchthe public will not read dialect  by this time i had put together from these two sources and from my drawerful of rejected stories this book of auld licht idylls and in its collected form it again went the rounds  i offered it to certain firms as a gift but they would not have it even at that  and then on a day came actually an offer for it from messrs hodder and stoughton for this and for many another kindness i had the editor of the british weekly to thank  thus the book was published at last and as for messrs hodder and stoughton i simply dare not say what a generous firm i found them lest it send too many aspirants to their doors but indeed i have had the pleasantest relations with all my publishers  better dead is by my wish no longer on sale in great britain and i should have preferred not to see it here for it is in no way worthy of the beautiful clothes messrs scribner have given it  weighted with an edinburgh eleven it would rest very comfortably in the mill dam but the publishers have reasons for its inclusion among them i suspect is a wellgrounded fear that if i once began to hack and hew i should not stop until i had reduced the edition to two volumes  this juvenile effort is a field of prickles into which none may be advised to penetratei made the attempt lately in cold blood and came back shuddering but i had read enough to have the profoundest reason for declining to tell what the book is about  and yet i have a sentimental interest in better dead for it was my firstpublished when i had small hope of getting any one to accept the scotchand there was a week when i loved to carry it in my pocket and did not think it dead weight  once i almost saw it find a purchaser  she was a pretty girl and it lay on a bookstall and she read some pages and smiled and then retired and came back and began another chapter  several times she did this and i stood in the background trembling with hope and fear at last she went away without the book but i am still of opinion that had it been just a little bit better she would have bought it     contents       i  engaged    ii  the s d w s p   iii  the great social question    iv

andrew riach went to london his intention was to become private secretary to a member of the cabinet  if time permitted he proposed writing for the press  it might be better if you and clarrie understood each other the minister said  it was their last night together  they faced each other in the manseparlour at wheens whose low peeled ceiling had threatened mr eassie at his desk every time he looked up with his pen in his mouth until his wife died when he ceased to notice things  the one picture on the walls an engraving of a boy in velveteen astride a tree entitled boyhood of bunyan had started life with him  the horsehair chairs were not torn and you did not require to know the sofa before you sat down on it that day thirty years before when a chubby minister and his lady walked to the manse between two cartloads of furniture trying not to look elated  clarrie rose to go when she heard her name  the lovelight was in her eyes but andrew did not open the door for her for he was a scotch graduate  besides she might one day be his wife  the ministers toddyladle clinked against his tumbler but andrew did not speak  clarrie was the girl he generally adored  as for clarrie he said at last she puts me in an awkward position how do i know that i love her  you have known each other a long time said the minister  his guest was cleaning his pipe with a hairpin that his quick eye had detected on the carpet  and she is devoted to you continued mr eassie  the young man nodded  what i fear he said is that we have known each other too long perhaps my feeling for clarrie is only brotherly  hers for you andrew is more than sisterly  admitted  but consider mr eassie she has only seen the world in soir√©es  every girl has her daydreams and clarrie has perhaps made a dream of me  she is impulsive given to idealisation and hopelessly illogical  the minister moved uneasily in his chair  i have reasoned out her present relation to me the young man went on and the more you reduce it to the usual formulae the more illogical it becomes  clarrie could possibly describe me but define menever  what is our prospect of happiness in these circumstances  but love began mr eassie  love exclaimed andrew  is there such a thing  reduce it to syllogistic form and how does it look in barbara  for the moment there was almost some expression in his face and he suffered from a determination of words to the mouth  love and logic mr eassie interposed are hardly kindred studies  is love a study at all asked andrew bitterly  it is but the trail of idleness  but all idleness is folly therefore love is folly  mr eassie was not so keen a logician as his guest but he had age for a major premiss  he was easygoing rather than a coward a preacher who in the pulpit looked difficulties genially in the face and passed them by  riach had a very long neck  he was twentyfive years of age fair and somewhat heavily built with a face as inexpressive as bookcovers  a native of wheens and an orphan he had been brought up by his uncle who was a weaver and read herodotus in the original  the uncle starved himself to buy books and talk about them until one day he got a good meal and died of it  then andrew apprenticed himself to a tailor  when his time was out he walked fifty miles to aberdeen university and got a bursary  he had been there a month when his professor said goodnaturedly  dont you think mr riach you would get on better if you took your hands out of your pockets  no sir i dont think so replied andrew in all honesty  when told that he must apologise he did not see it but was willing to argue the matter out  next year he matriculated at edinburgh sharing one room with two others studying through the night and getting their bed when they rose  he was a failure in the classics because they left you where you were but in his third year he woke the logic classroom and frightened the professor of moral philosophy  he was nearly rusticated for praying at a debating society for a divinity professor who was in the chair  o lord he cried fervently open his eyes guide his tottering footsteps and lead him from the paths of folly into those that are lovely and of good report for lo his days are numbered and the sickle has been sharpened and the corn is not yet ripe for the cutting  when andrew graduated he was known as student of mark  he returned to wheens before setting out for london with the consciousness of his worth  yet he was only born to follow and his chance of making a noise in the world rested on his meeting a stronger than himself  during his summer vacations he had weaved sufficient money to keep himself during the winter on porridge and potatoes  clarrie was beautiful and all that  well say no more about it then the minister said after a pause  the matter replied andrew cannot be dismissed in that way reasonable or not i do undoubtedly experience sensations similar to clarries  but in my love i notice a distinct ebb and flow  there are times when i dont care a hang for her  andrew  i beg your pardon  still it is you who have insisted on discussing this question in the particular instance  love in the abstract is of much greater moment  i have sometimes thought andrew mr eassie said that you are lacking in the imaginative faculty  in other words love is a mere fancy  grant that and see to what it leads  by imagining that i have clarrie with me i am as well off as if i really had  why then should i go to needless expense and take her from you  the whitehaired minister rose for the ten oclock bell was ringing and it was time for family worship  my boy he said if there must be a sacrifice let the old man make it  i too have imagination  for the moment there was a majesty about him that was foreign to his usual bearing  andrew was touched and gripped his hand  rather he cried let the girl we both love remain with you  she will be here waiting for meshould i return  more likely said the minister she will be at the bank  the banker was unmarried and had once in february and again in june seen clarrie home from the dorcas society  the town talked about it strictly speaking gentlemen should not attend these meetings but in wheens there was not much difference between the men and the women  that night as clarrie bade andrew farewell at the garden gate he took her head in his hands and asked what this talk about the banker meant  it was no ignoble curiosity that prompted him  he would rather have got engaged to her there and then than have left without feeling sure of her  his sweetheart looked her reply straight his eyes  andrew was all she said  it was sufficient  he knew that he did not require to press his point  lovers watches stand still  at last andrew stooped and kissed her upturned face  if a herring and a half he said anxiously cost three halfpence how many will you get for elevenpence  clarrie was mute  andrew shuddered he felt that he was making a mistake  why do i kiss you he cried  what good does it do either of us  he looked fiercely at his companion and her eyes filled with tears  where even is the pleasure in it he added brutally  the only objectionable thing about clarrie was her long hair  she wore a black frock and looked very breakable  nothing irritates a man so much  andrew gathered her passionately in his arms while a pained puzzled expression struggled to reach his face  then he replaced her roughly on the ground and left her  it was impossible to say whether they were engaged     chapter ii  andrew reached kings cross on the following wednesday morning  it was the first time he had set foot in england and he naturally thought of bannockburn  he left his box in the cloakroom and finding his way into bloomsbury took a bedroom at the top of a house in bernard street  then he returned for his box carried it on his back to his lodgings and went out to buy a straw hat  it had not struck him to be lonely  he bought two pork pies in an eatinghouse in grays inn road and set out for harley street looking at london on the way  mr gladstone was at home but all his private secretaryships were already filled  andrew was not greatly disappointed though he was too polite to say so  in politics he was a graniteheaded radical and on several questions such as the church and free education the two men were hopelessly at variance  mr chamberlain was the man with whom on the whole he believed it would be best to work  but mr chamberlain could not even see him  looking back to this time it is impossible not to speculate upon how things might have turned out had the radical party taken andrew to them in his day of devotion to their cause  this is the saddest spectacle in life a brave young mans first meeting with the world  how rapidly the milk turns to gall  for the cruellest of his acts the vivisectionist has not even the excuse that science benefits  here was a young scotchman able pure of noble ambition and a first medallist in metaphysics  genius was written on his brow  he may have written it himself but it was there  he offered to take a pound a week less than any other secretary in london  not a cabinet minister would have him  lord randolph churchill would not speak to him  he had fiftyeight testimonials with him  they would neither read nor listen to them  he could not fasten a quarrel on london for it never recognised his existence  what a commentary on our vaunted political life  andrew tried the press  he sent one of the finest things that was ever written on the ontology of being to paper after paper and it was never used  he threatened the times with legal proceedings if it did not return the manuscript  the standard sent him somebody elses manuscript and seemed to think it would do as well  in a fortnight his enthusiasm had been bled to death  his testimonials were his comfort and his curse  he would have committed suicide without them but they kept him out of situations  he had the fiftyeight by heart and went over them to himself all day he fell asleep with them and they were there when he woke  the moment he found himself in a great mans presence he began  from the rev peter mackay d d author of the disruption divines minister of free st kings dundeei have much pleasure in stating that i have known mr andrew gordon cummings riach for many years and have been led to form a high opinion of his ability  in the summer of 18 mr riach had entire charge of a class in my sabbath school when i had ample opportunity of testing his efficiency unwearying patience exceptional power of illustration and high christian character and so on  or he might begin at the beginning  testimonials in favour of andrew g c riach ma edin applicant for the post of private secretary to any one of her majestys cabinet ministers 6 candlish street wheens n bi andrew g c riach beg to offer myself as a candidate for the post of private secretary and submit the following testimonials in my favour for your consideration i am twentyfive years of age a master of arts of the university of edinburgh and a member of the free church of scotland  at the university i succeeded in carrying a bursary of 14l 10s per annum tenable for four years  i was first medallist in the class of logic and metaphysics thirteenth prizeman in mathematics and had a certificate of merit in the class of natural philosophy as will be seen from my testimonials  however he seldom got as far as this  it was when alone that these testimonials were his truest solace  had you met him in the strand conning them over you might have taken him for an actor  he had a yearning to stop strangers in the streets and try a testimonials effect on them  every young man is not equally unfortunate  riachs appearance was against him  there was a suggestion of latent strength about him that made strangers uncomfortable  even the friends who thought they understood him liked him to go away  lord rosebery made several jokes to him and andrew only looked at him in response  the general feeling was that he was sneering at you somewhere in his inside  let us do no one an injustice  as it turned out the cabinet and press were but being used in this case as the means to an end  a grand work lay ready for andrews hand when he was fit to perform it but he had to learn naked truth first  it was ordained that they should teach it him  providence sometimes makes use of strange instruments  riach had two pounds with him when he came to london and in a month they had almost gone  now and again he made an odd five shillings  do you know how men in his position live in london  he could not afford the profession of not having any  at one time he was a phrasemonger for politicians especially for the irish members who were the only ones that paid  some of his phrases have become parliamentary  thus buckshot was his  mend themend them grand old man and legislation by picnic may all be traced to the struggling young man from wheens1  he supplied the material for obituary notices  when the newspaper placards announced the serious illness of a distinguished man he made up characteristic anecdotes about his childhood his reputation at school his first love and sent them as the reminiscences of a friend to the great london dailies  these were the only things of his they used  as often as not the invalid got better and then andrew went without a dinner  once he offered his services to a conservative statesman at another time he shot himself in the coat in northumberland street strand to oblige an evening paper five shillings  he fainted in the pit of a theatre to the bribe of an emotional tragedian a guinea  he assaulted a young lady and her aunt with a view to robbery in a quiet thoroughfare by arrangement with a young gentleman who rescued them and made him run ten shillings  it got into the papers that he had fled from the wax policeman at tussauds halfacrown  more than once he sold his body in advance to the doctors and was never able to buy it out2  it would be a labour thankless as impossible to recover now all the devices by which andrew disgraced his manhood during these weeks rather than die  as well count the drinks an actor has in a day  it is not our part to climb down into the depths after him  he reappeared eventually or this record would never have been written  during this period of gloom clarrie wrote him frequently long and tender epistles  more strictly the minister wrote them for he had the gift of beautiful sentiment in letters which had been denied to her  she copied them however and signed them and they were a great consolation  the love of a good girl is a priceless possession or rather in this case of a good minister  so long as you do not know which it does not make much difference  at times andrews reason may have been unhinged less on account of his reverses than because no one spoke to him  there were days and nights when he rushed all over london  in the principal streets the stolidfaced scotchman in a straw hat became a familiar figure  strange fancies held him  he stood for an hour at a time looking at his face in a shopwindow  the bootblacks pointed at him and he disappeared down passages  he shook his fist at the busconductors who would not leave him alone  in the yellow night policemen drew back scared as he hurried past them on his way to nowhere  in the daytime oxford street was his favourite thoroughfare  he was very irritable at this time and could not leave his fellow wayfarers alone  more than once he poked his walkingstick through the eyeglass of a brave young gentleman  he would turn swiftly round to catch people looking at him  when a small boy came in his way he took him by the neck and planted him on the curbstone  if a man approached simpering andrew stopped and gazed at him  the smile went from the strangers face he blushed or looked fierce  when he turned round andrew still had his eye on him  sometimes he came bouncing back  what are you so confoundedly happy about andrew asked  when he found a crowd gazing in at a while you wait shopwindow or entranced over the paving of a street  splendid isnt it he said to the person nearest him  he dropped a penny which he could ill spare into the hat of an exquisite who annoyed him by his way of lifting it to a lady  when he saw a man crossing the street too daintily he ran after him and hit him over the legs  even on his worst days his reasoning powers never left him  once a mother let her child slip from her arms to the pavement  she gave a shriek  my good woman said andrew testily what difference can one infant in the world more or less make  we come now to an eccentricity engendered of loneliness that altered the whole course of his life  want had battered down his door  truth had been evolved from despair  he was at last to have a flash into salvation  to give an object to his walks abroad he would fasten upon a wayfarer and follow him till he ran him to his destination  chance led to his selecting one quarry rather than another  he would dog a mans footsteps struck by the glossiness of his boots or to discover what he was in such a hurry about or merely because he had a good back to follow  probably he seldom knew what attracted him and sometimes when he realised the pursuit he gave it up  on these occasions there was one person only who really interested him this was a man somewhat over middle age of singularly noble and distinguished bearing  his brow was furrowed with lines but they spoke of cares of the past  benevolence had settled on his face  it was as if after a weary struggle the sun had broken through the heavy clouds  he was attired in the ordinary dress of an english gentleman but once when he raised his head to see if it rained andrew noticed that he only wore a woollen shirt without a necktie  as a rule his welltrimmed venerable beard hid this from view  he seemed a man of unostentatious means  andrew lost him in drury lane and found him again in piccadilly  he was generally alone never twice with the same person  his business was scattered or it was his pleasure that kept him busy  he struck the observer as always being on the outlook for someone who did not come  why attempt to account for the nameless fascination he exercised over the young scotchman  we speak lightly of mesmeric influence but after all there is only one mesmerist for youtha good woman or a good man  depend upon it that is why so many mesmerists have mistaken their vocation  andrew took to prowling about the streets looking for this man like a dog that has lost its master  the day came when they met  andrew was returning from the crystal palace which he had been viewing from the outside  he had walked both ways  just as he rounded the upper end of chancery lane a man walking rapidly struck against him whirled him aside and hurried on  the day was done but as yet the lamps only dimmed the streets  andrew had been dreaming and the jerk woke him to the roar of london  it was as if he had taken his fingers from his ears  he staggered dazed against a bushorse but the next moment he was in pursuit of the stranger  it was but a continuation of his dream he felt that something was about to happen  he had never seen this man disturbed before  chancery lane swarmed with lawyers but if they had not made way andrew would have walked over them  he clove his way between those walking abreast and struck down an arm extended to point out the law courts  when he neared the stranger he slightly slackened his pace but it was a stampede even then  suddenly the pursued came to a dead stop and gazed for twenty minutes in at a pastrycooks window  andrew waited for him  then they started off again much more leisurely  they turned chancery lane almost together  all this time andrew had failed to catch sight of the others face  he stopped twice in the strand for a few minutes  at charing cross he seemed for a moment at a loss  then he sprang across the street and went back the way he came  it was now for the first time that a strange notion illumined andrews brain  it bewildered him and left him in darkness the next moment but his blood was running hot now and his eyes were glassy  they turned down arundel street  it was getting dark  there were not a dozen people in the narrow thoroughfare  his former thought leapt back into andrews mindnot a fancy now but a fact  the stranger was following someone too  for what purpose  his own  andrew did not put the question to himself  there were not twenty yards between the three of them  what riach saw in front was a short stout man proceeding cheerfully down the street  he delayed in a doorway to light a cigar and the stranger stopped as if turned to stone  andrew stopped too  they were like the wheels of a watch  the first wheel moved on and set the others going again  for a hundred yards or more they walked in procession in a westerly direction without meeting a human being  at last the first of the trio half turned on his heel and leant over the embankment  riach drew back into the shade just before the stranger took a lightning glance behind him  the young man saw his face now  it was never fuller of noble purpose yet why did andrew cry out  the next moment the stranger had darted forward slipped his arms round the little mans legs and toppled him into the river  there was a splash but no shriek  andrew bounded forward but the stranger held him by one hand  his clear blue eyes looked down a little wistfully upon the young scotchman who never felt the fascination of a mastermind more than at that moment  as if feeling his power the elder man relaxed his hold and pointed to the spot where his victim had disappeared  he was a good man he said more to himself than to andrew and the world has lost a great philanthropist but he is better as he is  then he lifted a pavingstone and peered long and earnestly into the waters  the short stout man however did not rise again    1 some time afterwards lord rosebery convulsed an audience by a story about a friend of his who complained that you get no forrarder on claret  andrew was that friend  2 he had fine ideas but no money to work them out  one was to start a serious spectator on the lines of the present one but not so flippant and frivolous     chapter iii  lost in reverie the stranger stood motionless on the embankment  the racket of the city was behind him  at his feet lay a drowned world its lights choking in the thames  it was london as it will be on the last day  with an effort he roused himself and took andrews arm  the body will soon be recovered he said in a voice of great dejection and people will talk  let us go  they retraced their steps up arundel street  now said andrews companion tell me who you are  andrew would have preferred to hear who the stranger was  in the circumstances he felt that he had almost a right to know  but this was not a man to brook interference  if you will answer me one question the young scotchman said humbly i shall tell you everything  his reveries had made andrew quickwitted and he had the judicial mind which prevents ones judging another rashly  besides his hankering after this man had already suggested an exculpation for him  you are a radical he asked eagerly  the strangers brows contracted  young man he said though all the radicals and liberals and conservatives who ever addressed the house of commons were in  i would not stoop to pick them up though i could gather them by the gross  he said this without an irish accent and andrew felt that he had better begin his story at once  he told everything  as his tale neared its conclusion his companion scanned him narrowly  if the strangers magnanimous countenance did not beam down in sympathy upon the speaker it was because surprise and gratification filled it  only once an ugly look came into his eyes  that was when andrew had reached the middle of his second testimonial  the young man saw the look and at the same time felt the hold on his arm become a grip  his heart came into his mouth  he gulped it down and with what was perhaps a judicious sacrifice jumped the remainder of his testimonials  when the stranger heard how he had been tracked through the streets he put his head to the side to think  it was a remarkable compliment to his abstraction that andrew paused involuntarily in his story and waited  he felt that his future was in the balance  those sons of peers may faintly realise his position whose parents have hesitated whether to make statesmen or cattledealers of them  i dont mind telling you the stranger said at last that your case has been under consideration  when we left the embankment my intention was to dispose of you in a doorway  but your story moves me strangely could i be certain that you felt the sacredness of human lifeas i fear no boy can feel iti should be tempted to ask you instead to become one of us  there was something in this remark about the sacredness of human life that was not what andrew expected and his answer died unspoken  youth continued the stranger is enthusiasm but not enthusiasm in a straight line  we are impotent in directing it like a boy with a toy engine  how carefully the child sets it off how soon it goes off the rails  so youth is wrecked  the slightest obstacle sends it off at a tangent  the vital force expended in a wrong direction does evil instead of good  you know the story of atalanta  it has always been misread  she was the type not of woman but of youth and hippomenes personated age  he was the slower runner but he won the race and yet how beautiful even where it run to riot must enthusiasm be in such a cause as ours  if atalanta had been scotch said andrew she would not have lost that race for a pound of apples  the stranger regarded him longingly like a father only prevented by state reasons from embracing his son  he murmured something that andrew hardly caught  it sounded like  atalanta would have been better dead  your nationality is in your favour he said and you have served your apprenticeship to our calling  you have been tending towards us ever since you came to london  you are an apple ripe for plucking and if you are not plucked now you will fall  i would fain take you by the hand and yet  and yet  and yet i hesitate  you seem a youth of the fairest promise but how often have i let these impulses deceive me  you talk of logic but is it more than talk  man they say is a reasonable being  they are wrong  he is only a being capable of reason  try me said andrew  the stranger resumed in a lower key  you do not understand what you ask as yet he said still less what we would ask in return of you  i have seen something today said andrew  but you are mistaken in its application  you think i followed the man lately deceased as pertinaciously as you followed me  you are wrong when you met me in chancery lane i was in pursuit of a gentleman to whose case i have devoted myself for several days  it has interested me much  there is no reason why i should conceal his name  it is one honoured in this country sir wilfrid lawson  he looked in on his man of business which delayed me at the shopwindow of which you have spoken  i waited for him and i thought i had him this time  but you see i lost him in the strand after all  but the other then andrew asked who was he  oh i picked him up at charing cross  he was better dead  i think said andrew hopefully that my estimate of the sacredness of human life is sufficiently high for your purpose  if that is the only point  ah they all say that until they join  i remember an excellent young man who came among us for a time  he seemed discreet beyond his years and we expected great things of him  but it was the old story  for young men the cause is as demoralizing as boarding schools are for girls  what did he do  it went to his head  he took a bedroom in pall mall and sat at the window with an electric rifle picking them off on the doorsteps of the clubs  it was a noble idea but of course it imperilled the very existence of the society  he was a curate  what became of him asked andrew  he is better dead said the stranger softly  and the society you speak of what is it  the s d w s p  the s d w s p  yes the society for doing without some people  they were in holborn but turned up southampton row for quiet  you have told me said the stranger now speaking rapidly that at times you have felt tempted to take your life that life for which you will one day have to account  suicide is the cowards refuge  you are miserable  when a young man knows that he is happy  misery is but preparing for an old age of delightful reminiscence  you say that london has no work for you that the functions to which you looked forward are everywhere discharged by another  that need not drive you to despair  if it proves that someone should die does it necessarily follow that the someone is you  but is not the others life as sacred as mine  that is his concern  then you would have me  certainly not  you are a boxer without employment whom i am showing what to hit  in such a case as yours the society would be represented by a third party whose decision would be final  as an interested person you would have to stand aside  i dont understand  the arbitrator would settle if you should go  andrew looked blank  go he repeated  it is a euphemism for die said his companion a little impatiently this is a trivial matter and hardly worth going into at any length it shows our process however and the process reveals the true character of the organization  as i have already mentioned the society takes for its first principle the sanctity of human life everyone who has mixed much among his fellowcreatures must be aware that this is adulterated so to speak by numbers of spurious existences  many of these are a nuisance to themselves  others may at an earlier period have been lives of great promise and fulfilment  in the case of the latter how sad to think that they should be dragged out into worthlessness or dishonour all for want of a friendly hand to snap them short  in the lower form of life the process of preying upon animals whose work is accomplishedthat is of weedinggoes on continually  man must of course be more cautious  the grand function of the society is to find out the persons who have a claim on it and in the interests of humanity to lay their condition before them  after that it is in the majority of cases for themselves to decide whether they will go or stay on  but said andrew had the gentleman in the thames consented to go  no that was a case where assistance had to be given  he had been sounded though  and do you find asked andrew that many of them areagreeable  i admit said the stranger that so far that has been our chief difficulty  even the men we looked upon as certainties have fallen short of our expectations  there is mallock now who said that life was not worth living  i called on him only last week fully expecting him to meet me halfway  and he didnt  mallock was a great disappointment said the stranger with genuine pain in his voice  he liked mallock  however he added brightening his case comes up for hearing at the next meeting  if i have twothirds of the vote we proceed with it  but how do the authorities take it asked andrew  pooh said the stranger  andrew however could not think so  it is against the law you know he said  the law winks at it the stranger said  law has its feelings as well as we  we have two london magistrates and a minister on the executive and the lord chief justice is an honorary member  andrew raised his eyes  this of course is private continued the stranger  these men join on the understanding that if anything comes out they deny all connection with us  but they have the thing at heart  i have here a very kind letter from gladstone  he felt in his pockets  i seem to have left it at home  however its purport was that he hoped we would not admit lord salisbury an honorary member  why not  well the society has power to take from its numbers so far as ordinary members are concerned but it is considered discourteous to reduce the honorary list  then why have honorary members asked andrew in a burst of enthusiasm  it is a necessary precaution  they subscribe largely too  indeed the association is now established on a sound commercial basis  we are paying six per cent  none of these american preachers who come over to this country are honorary members asked andrew anxiously  no one of them made overtures to us but we would not listen to him why  oh nothing said andrew  to do the honorary list justice said his companion it gave us one fine fellow in our honorary president  he is dead now  andrew looked up  no we had nothing to do with it  it was thomas carlyle  andrew raised his hat  though he was over eighty years of age continued the stranger carlyle would hardly rest content with merely giving us his countenance  he wanted to be a working member  it was he who mentioned froudes name to us  for honorary membership  not at all  froude would hardly have completed the reminiscences had it not been that we could never make up our minds between him and freeman  youth is subject to sudden fits of despondency  its hopes go up and down like a bucket in a drawwell  theyll never let me join cried andrew sorrowfully  his companion pressed his hand  three black balls exclude he said but you have the president on your side  with my introduction you will be admitted a probationer and after that everything depends on yourself  i thought you must be the president from the first said andrew reverently  he had not felt so humble since the first day he went to the university and walked past and repast it frightened to go in  how long he asked does the period of probation last  three months  then you send in a thesis and if it is considered satisfactory you become a member  and if it isnt  the president did not say  a thesis he said is generally a paper with a statement of the line of action you propose to adopt subject to the societys approval each member has his specialtyas law art divinity literature and the like  does the probationer devote himself exclusively during these three months to his thesis  on the contrary he never has so much liberty as at this period  he is expected to be practising  practising  well experimenting getting his hand in so to speak  the member acts under instructions only but the probationer just does what he thinks best  there is a man on my stair said andrew after a moments consideration who asks his friends in every friday night and recites to them with his door open  i think i should like to begin with him  as a society we do not recognise these private cases  the public gain is so infinitesimal  we had one probationer who constructed a very ingenious waterbutt for boys  another had a scheme for clearing the streets of the people who get in the way  he got into trouble about some perambulators  let me see your hands  they stopped at a lamppost  they are large which is an advantage said the president fingering andrews palms but are they supple  andrew had thought very little about it and he did not quite comprehend  the hands explained the president are perhaps the best natural weapon but of course there are different ways of doing it  the young scotchmans brain however could not keep pace with his companions words and the president looked about him for an illustration  they stopped at gower street station and glanced at the people coming out  none of them was of much importance but the president left them alone  andrew saw what he meant now and could not but admire his forbearance  they turned away but just as they emerged into the blaze of tottenham court road they ran into two men warmly shaking hands with each other before they parted  one of them wore an eyeglass  chamberlain exclaimed the president rushing after him  did you recognise the other said andrew panting at his heels  no who was it  stead of the pall mall gazette  great god cried the president two at a time  he turned and ran back  then he stopped irresolutely  he could not follow the one for thought of the other     chapter iv  the london cabmans occupation consists in dodging thoroughfares under repair  numbers of dingy streets have been flung about to help him  there is one of these in bloomsbury which was originally discovered by a student while looking for the british museum  it runs a hundred yards in a straight line then stops like a stranger who has lost his way and hurries by another route out of the neighbourhood  the houses are dull except one just where it doubles which is gloomy  this house is divided into sets of chambers and has a new frontage but it no longer lets well  a few years ago there were two funerals from it within a fortnight and soon afterward another of the tenants was found at the foot of the stair with his neck broken  these fatalities gave the house a bad name as such things do in london  it was here that andrews patron the president lived  to the outcast from work to get an object in life is to be born again andrew bustled to the presidents chambers on the saturday night following the events already described with his chest well set  his springy step echoed of wages in the hearts of the unemployed envious eyes following his swaggering staff could not see that but a few days before he had been as the thirteenth person at a dinnerparty  such a change does society bring about when it empties a chair for the superfluous man  it may be wondered that he felt so sure of himself for the night had still to decide his claims  andrew however had thought it all out in his solitary lodgings and had put fear from him  he felt his failings and allowed for every one of them but he knew his merits too and his testimonials were in his pocket  strength of purpose was his weak point and though the good of humanity was his loadstar it did not make him quite forget self  it may not be possible to serve both god and mammon but since adam the world has been at it  we ought to know by this time  the society for doing without was as immoral as it certainly was illegal  the presidents motives were not more disinterested than his actions were defensible  he even deserved punishment  all these things may be  the great social question is not to be solved in a day  it never will be solved if those who take it by the beard are not given an unbiassed hearing  those were the young scotchmans views when the president opened the door to him and what he saw and heard that night strengthened them  it was characteristic of andrews host that at such a time he could put himself in the young mans place  he took his hand and looked him in the face more like a physician than a mere acquaintance  then he drew him aside into an empty room  let me be the first to congratulate you he said you are admitted  andrew took a long breath and the president considerately turned away his head until the young probationer had regained his composure  then he proceeded  the society only asks from its probationers the faith which it has in them  they take no oath  we speak in deeds  the brotherhood do not recognise the possibility of treachery but they are prepared to cope with it if it comes  better far andrew riach to be in your grave dead and rotten and forgotten than a traitor to the cause  the presidents voice trembled with solemnity  he stretched forth his hands slowly repeating the words dead and rotten and forgotten until his wandering eyes came to rest on the young mans neck  andrew drew back a step and bowed silently as he had seen many a father do at a christening in the kirk at wheens  you will shortly continued the president with a return to his ordinary manner hear an address on female suffrage from one of the noblest women in the land  it will be your part to listen  tonight you will both hear and see strange things  say nothing  evince no surprise  some members are irritable  come  once more he took andrew by the hand and led him into the meetingroom and still his eyes were fixed on the probationers neck there seemed to be something about it that he liked  it was not then with the committee all around him but long afterwards at wheens that andrew was struck by the bareness of the chambers  without the presidents presence they had no character  the trifles were absent that are to a room what expression is to the face  the tenant might have been a medical student who knew that it was not worth while to unpack his boxes  the only ornament on the walls was an elaborate sketch by a member showing the arrangement of the cellars beneath the premises of the young mens christian association  there were a dozen men in the room including the president of the birmingham branch association and two members who had just returned from a visit to edinburgh  these latter had already submitted their report  the president introduced andrew to the committee but not the committee to him  several of them he recognized from the portraits in the shop windows  they stood or sat in groups looking over a probationers thesis  it consisted of diagrams of machinery  andrew did not see the sketches though they were handed round separately for inspection but he listened eagerly to the presidents explanations  the first said the president is a beautiful little instrument worked by steam  having placed his head on the velvet cushion d the subject can confidently await results  no 2 is the same model on a larger scale  as yet 3 can be of little use to us  it includes a room 13 feet by 11  x is the windows and other apertures and these being closed up and the subjects admitted all that remains to be done is to lock the door from the outside and turn on the gas  e f and k are couches and l is a square inch of glass through which results may be noted  the speciality of 4 which is called the water cure is that it is only workable on water  it is generally admitted that release by drowning is the pleasantest of all deaths and indeed 4 speaking roughly is a boat with a hole in the bottom  it is so simple that a child could work it  c is the plug  no 5 is an intricate instrument  the advantage claimed for it is that it enables a large number of persons to leave together  while the thesis was under discussion the attendance was increased by a few members specially interested in the question of female suffrage andrew observed that several of these wrote something on a piece of paper which lay on the table with a pencil beside it before taking their seats  he stretched himself in the direction of this paper but subsided as he caught the eyes of two of the company riveted on his neck  from that time until he left the rooms one member or other was staring at his neck  andrew looked anxiously in the glass over the mantelpiece but could see nothing wrong  the paper on the table merely contained such jottings as these  robert buchanan has written another play  schnadh√∂rst is in town  ashmead bartlett walks in temple gardens 3 to 4  clement scott   query is there a dark passage near hyndmans socialists house  talmage  address midland hotel  andrew lang   andrew was a good deal interested in womans suffrage and the debate on this question in the students society at edinburgh when he spoke for an hour and five minutes is still remembered by the janitor who had to keep the door until the meeting closed  debating societies like the company of reporters engender a familiarity of reference to eminent persons and andrew had in his time struck down the champions of womans rights as a boy plays with his ninepins  to be brought face to face with a lady whose name is a household word wheresoever a few scotchmen can meet and resolve themselves into an argument was another matter  it was with no ordinary mingling of respect with curiosity that he stood up with the others to greet mrs fawcett as the president led her into the room  the young mans face as he looked upon her for the first time was the best book this remarkable woman ever wrote  the proceedings were necessarily quiet and the president had introduced their guest to the meeting without andrews hearing a word  he was far away in a snowswept university quadrangle on a windy night when mrs fawcett rose to her feet  some one flung open the window for the place was close and immediately the skirl of a bagpiper broke the silence  it might have been the devil that rushed into the room  still andrew dreamed on  the guest paused  the members looked at each other and the president nodded to one of them  he left the room and about two minutes afterwards the music suddenly ceased  andrew woke with a start in time to see him return write two words in the members book and resume his seat  mrs fawcett then began  i have before me she said turning over the leaves of a bulky manuscript a great deal of matter bearing on the question of womans rights which at such a meeting as this may be considered read  it is mainly historical and while i am prepared to meet with hostile criticism from the society i assume that the progress our agitation has made with its disappointments its trials and its triumphs has been followed more or less carefully by you all  nor shall i after the manner of speakers on such an occasion pay you the doubtful compliment of fulsomely extolling your aims before your face  i come at once to the question of womans rights in so far as the society can affect them and i ask of you a consideration of my case with as little prejudice as men can be expected to approach it  in the constitution of the society as it has been explained to me i notice chiefly two things which would have filled me with indignation twenty years ago but only remind me how far we are from the goal of our ambition now  the first is a sin of omission the second one of commission and the latter is the more to be deprecated in that you made it with your eyes open after full discussion while the other came about as a matter of course  i believe i am right in saying that the membership of this society is exclusively male and also that no absolute veto has been placed on female candidature  as a matter of fact it never struck the founders that such a veto in black and white was necessary  when they drew up the rules of membership the other sex never fell like a black shadow on the paper it was forgotten  we owe our eligibility to many other offices generally disputed at law to the same accident  in short the unwritten law of the argumentum ad crinolinam puts us to the side  having paid the society the compliment of believing that however much it differed from her views it would not dismiss them with a laugh mrs fawcett turned to the question of womans alleged physical limitations  she said much on this point that andrew saw could not be easily refuted but interesting though she made it we need not follow her over beaten ground  so far the members had given her the courteous nonattention which thoughtful introductory remarks can always claim  it was when she reached her second head that they fastened upon her words  then andrew had seen no sharper audience since he was one of a scotch congregation on the scent of a heretic  at a full meeting of committee said mrs fawcett with a ring of bitterness in her voice you passed a law that women should not enjoy the advantages of the association  be they ever so eminent their sex deprives them of your care  you take up the case of a petty maker of books because his tealeaf solutions weary you and you put a stop to him with an enthusiasm worthy of a nobler object  but the woman is left to decay  this society at its noblest was instituted for taking strong means to prevent mens slipping down the ladder it has been such a toil to them to mount but the women who have climbed as high as they can fall from rung to rung  there are female nuisances as well as male i presume no one here will gainsay me that  but you do not know them officially  the politicians who joke about three acres and a cow the writers who are comic about mothersinlaw the very bootblacks have your solicitude but you ignore their complements in the softer sex  yet you call yourselves a society for suppressing excrescences  your president tells me you are at present inquiring for the address of the man who signs himself paterfamilias in the times but the letters from a british matron are of no account  i do not need to be told how dr smith the fashionable physician was precipitated down that area the other day but what i do ask is why should he be taken and all the lady doctors left  their degrees are as good as his  you are too manly you say to arrest their course  is injustice manliness  we have another name for it  we say you want the pluck  i suppose every one of you has been reading a very able address recently delivered at the meeting of the social science congress  i refer to my friend mrs kendals paper on the moral aspect of the drama in this country  it is a powerful indictment of the rank and file other professional brothers and sisters and nowhere sadder more impressive or more unanswerable than where she speaks of the involuntary fall of the actor into social snobbishness and professional claptrap  i do not know how the paper affected you  but since reading it i have asked in despair how can this gifted lady continue to pick her way between the snares with which the stage is beset  is it possible that the time may come when she will advertise by photographs and beg from reporters the pars she now so scathingly criticises  nay when i look upon the drop scene at the st jamess theatre i ask myself if the deterioration has not already set in  gentlemen is this a matter of indifference to you  but why do i ask has not mrs lynn linton another article in the new nineteenth century that makes her worthy your attention  they are women and the sex is outside your sphere  it was nearly twelve oclock when mrs fawcett finished her address and the society had adopted the good old rule of getting to bed betimes  thus it was afterwards that andrew learned how long and carefully the society had already considered the advisability of giving women equal rights with men  as he was leaving the chambers the president slipped something into his hand  he held it there until he reached his room  on the way a man struck against him scanned him piercingly and then shuffled off  he was muffled up but andrew wondered if he had not seen him at the meeting  the young scotchman had an uneasy feeling that his footsteps were dodged  as soon as he reached home he unfolded the scrap of paper that had been pushed into his hand  it merely contained these words  cover up your neck     chapter v  on the following tuesday andrew met the president by appointment at the marble arch  until he had received his final instructions he was pledged not to begin and he had passed these two intervening days staring at his empty fireplace  they shook hands silently and passed into the park  the president was always thoughtful in a crowd  in such a gathering as this said andrew pointing an imaginary pistol at a lecturer on socialism you could hardly go wrong to let fly  you must not speak like that the president said gently or we shall soon lose you  your remark however opens the way for what i have to say  you have never expressed any curiosity as to your possible fate i hope this is not because you underestimate the risks  if the authorities saw you letting fly as you term it promiscuously or even at a given object they would treat you as no better than a malefactor  i thought that all out yesterday said andrew and i am amazed at the societys success in escaping detection  i feared this said the president  you are mistaken  we dont always escape detection  sometimes we are caught  caught  yes and hanged  but if that is so why does it not get into the papers  the papers are full of it  andrew looked incredulous  in the present state of the law said the president motive in a murder goes for nothing  however iniquitous this may beand i do not attempt to defend itwe accept it as a fact  your motives may have been unexceptionable but they hang you all the same  thus our members when apprehended preserve silence on this point or say that they are fenians  this is to save the society  the man who got fifteen years the other day for being found near st stephens with six infernal machines in his pockets was really one of us  he was taking them to be repaired  and the other who got ten years the week before  he was from america but it was for one of our affairs that he was sentenced  he was quite innocent  you see the dynamiters vulgarly so called are playing into our hands  suspicion naturally falls on them he was our fifth  i had no idea of this murmured andrew  you see what a bad name does said the president  let this be a warning to you andrew  but is this quite fair  as for that they like itthe leading spirits i mean  it gives them a reputation  besides they hurt as well as help us  it was after their appearance that the authorities were taught to be distrustful you have little idea of the precautions taken nowadays  there is sir william harcourt for instance who is attended by policemen everywhere  i used to go home from the house behind him nightly but i could never get him alone  i have walked in the very shadow of that man but always in a company  you were never arrested yourself asked andrew  i was once but we substituted a probationer  then did hewas he  yes poor fellow  is that often done  sometimes  you perhaps remember the man who went over the embankment the night we met  well if i had been charged with that you would have had to be hanged  andrew took a seat to collect his thoughts  was that why you seemed to take to me so much he asked wistfully  it was only one reason said the president soothingly  i liked you from the first  but i dont see said andrew why i should have suffered for your action  for the moment his veneration for this remarkable man hung in the balance  it would have been for the societys sake said the president simply probationers are hardly missed  his face wore a pained look but there was no reproach in his voice  andrew was touched  he looked the apology which as a scotchman he could not go the length of uttering  before i leave you today said the president turning to a pleasanter subject i shall give you some money  we do not you understand pay our probationers a fixed salary  it is more is it not said andrew in nature of a scholarship  yes a scholarshipfor the endowment of research  you see we do not tie you down to any particular line of study  still i shall be happy to hear of any programme you may have drawn up  andrew hesitated  he did not know that to the president he was an open book  i dare say i can read your thoughts said his companion  there is an eminent person whom you would like to make your first  andrew admitted that this was so  i do not ask any confidences of you continued the president nor shall i discourage ambition  but i hope andrew you have only in view the greatest good of the greatest number  at such a time it is well for the probationer to ask himself two questions is it not selfglorification that prompts me to pick this man out from among so many and am i actuated by any personal animosity  if you cannot answer both these questions in the negative it is time to ask a third should i go on with this undertaking  in this case said andrew i do not think it is selfglory and i am sure it is not spite  he is a man i have a very high opinion of  a politician  remember that we are above party considerations  he is a politician said andrew reluctantly but it is his politics i admire  and you are sure his time has come  then how do you propose to set about it  i thought of calling at his house and putting it to him  the presidents countenance fell  well well he said that may answer  but there is no harm in bearing in mind that persuasion is not necessarily a passive force without going the length of removing him yourself you know you could put temptation in his way  if i know my man said andrew that will not be required  the president had drunk lifes disappointments to the dregs but it was not in his heart to damp the youths enthusiasm  experience he knew to be a commodity for which we pay a fancy price  after that said andrew i thought of henry irving  we dont kill actors his companion said  it was andrews countenances turn to fall now  we dont have time for it the president explained  when the society was instituted we took a few of them but merely to get our hands in  we didnt want to bungle good cases you see and it did not matter so much for them  how did you do it  we waited at the stagedoor and went off with the first person who came out male or female  but i understood you did not take up women  nor do we  theatrical people constitute a sex by themselveslike curates  then cant i even do the man who stands at the theatre doors all shirtfront and diamonds  the president shivered  if you happen to be passing at any rate he said  and surely some of the playwrights would be better dead  they must see that themselves  they have had their chance said the president  despite his nationality andrew had not heard the story so the president told it him  many years ago when the drama was in its infancy some young men from stratfordonavon and elsewhere resolved to build a theatre in london  the times however were moral and no one would imperil his soul so far as to give them a site  one night they met in despair when suddenly the room was illumined by lightning and they saw the devil in the midst of them  he has always been a large proprietor in london and he had come to strike a bargain with them  they could have as many sites as they chose on one condition  every year they must send him a dramatist  you see he was willing to take his chance of the players  the compact was made and up to the present time it has been religiously kept  but this year as the day drew near found the managers very uneasy  they did what they could  they forwarded the best man they had  what happened asked andrew breathlessly  the devil sent him back said the president     chapter vi  it was one sunday forenoon on such a sunny day as slovenly men seize upon to wash their feet and have it over that andrew set out to call on mr labouchere  the leaves in the squares were green and the twittering of the birds among the boughs was almost gay enough to charm him out of the severity of countenance which a scotchman wears on a sunday with his blacks  andrew could not help regarding the motherofpearl sky as a favourable omen  several times he caught himself becoming lighthearted  he got the great radical on the doorstep just setting out for church  the two men had not met before but andrew was a disciple in the school in which the other taught  between man and man formal introductions are humbug  andrew explained in a few words the nature of his visit and received a cordial welcome  but i could call again he said observing the hymnbook in the others hand  nonsense said mr labouchere heartily it must be business before pleasure  mind the step  so saying he led his visitor into a cheerful snuggery at the back of the house  it was furnished with a careful contempt for taste and the first thing that caught andrews eye was a pot of apple jam on a side table  i have no gum mr labouchere explained hastily  a handsomely framed picture representing truth lying drowned at the bottom of a well stood on the mantelpiece indeed there were many things in the room that on another occasion andrew would have been interested to hear the history of  he could not but know however that at present he was to some extent an intruder and until he had fully explained his somewhat delicate business he would not feel at ease  though argumentative andrew was essentially a shy proud man  it was very like mr labouchere to leave him to tell his story in his own way only now and then at the outset interjecting a humorous remark which we here omit  i hope said andrew earnestly that you will not think it fulsome on my part to say how much i like you  in your public utterances you have let it be known what value you set on pretty phrases but i speak the blunt truth as you have taught it  i am only a young man perhaps awkward and unpolished  here andrew paused but as mr labouchere did not say anything he resumed  that as it may be i should like you to know that your political speeches have become part of my life  when i was a student it seemed to me that the radicalism of so called advanced thinkers was a halfhearted sham i had no interest in politics at all until i read your attackone of themon the house of lords  that day marked an epoch in my life  i used to read the university library copy of truth from cover to cover  sometimes i carried it into the classroom  that was not allowed  i took it up my waistcoat  in those days i said that if i wrote a book i would dedicate it to you without permission and london when i came to it was to me the town where you lived  there was a great deal of truth in this indeed mr laboucheres singlehearted enthusiasmbe his politics right or wrongis well calculated to fascinate young men  if it was slightly overcharged the temptation was great  andrew was keenly desirous of carrying his point and he wanted his host to see that he was only thinking of his good  well but what is it you would have me do asked mr labouchere who often had claimants on his bounty and his autographs  i want you said andrew eagerly to die  the two men looked hard at each other  there was not even a clock in the room to break the silence  at last the statesman spoke  why he asked  his visitor sank back in his chair relieved  he had put all his hopes in the others commonsense  it had never failed mr labouchere and now it promised not to fail andrew  i am anxious to explain that the young man said glibly  if you can look at yourself with the same eyes with which you see other people it wont take long  make a lookingglass of me and it is done  you have now reached a high position in the worlds of politics and literature to which you have cut your way unaided  you are a great satirist combining instruction with amusement a sort of comic carlyle  you hate shams so much that if man had been constructed for it i dare say you would kick at yourself  you have your enemies but the very persons who blunt their weapons on you do you the honour of sharpening them on truth  in short you have reached the summit of your fame and you are too keen a man of the world not to know that fame is a touchandgo thing  andrew paused  go on said mr labouchere  well you have now got fame honour everything for which it is legitimate in man to strive  so far back as i can remember you have had the world laughing with you  but you know what human nature is  there comes a morning to all wits when their public wakes to find them bores  the fault may not be the wits but what of that  the result is the same  wits are like theatres they may have a glorious youth and prime but their old age is dismal  to the outsider like myself signs are not wantingto continue the figure of speechthat you have put on your last successful piece  can you say candidly that your last christmas number was more than a reflection of its predecessors or that your remarks this year on the derby day took as they did the year before  surely the most incisive of our satirists will not let himself degenerate into an illustration of mr herbert spencers theory that man repeats himself like history  mr labouchere sir to those of us who have grown up in your inspiration it would indeed be pitiful if this were so  andrews host turned nervously in his chair  probably he wished that he had gone to church now  you need not be alarmed he said with a forced smile  you will die cried andrew before they send you to the house of lords  in which case the gain would be all to those left behind  no said andrew who now felt that he had as good as gained the day there could not be a greater mistake  suppose it happened tonight or even put it off to the end of the week see what would follow  the ground you have lost so far is infinitesimal  it would be forgotten in the general regret  think of the newspaper placards next morning some of them perhaps edged with black the leaders in every london paper and in all the prominent provincial ones the six columns obituary in the times the paragraphs in the world the motion by mr gladstone or mr healy for the adjournment of the house the magazine articles the promised memoirs the publication of posthumous papers the resolution in the northampton town council the statue in hyde park  with such a recompense where would be the sacrifice  mr labouchere rose and paced the room in great mental agitation  now look at the other side of the picture said andrew rising and following him truth reduced to threepence and then to a penny yourself confused with tracy turnerelli or martin tupper your friends running when you looked like jesting the house emptying the reporters shutting their notebooks as you rose to speak the great name of labouchere become a synonym for bore  they presented a strange picture in that room its owners face now a greyish white his supplicant shaking with a passion that came out in perspiration  with trembling hand mr labouchere flung open the window  the room was stifling  there was a smell of newmown hay in the air a gentle breeze tipped the welltrimmed hedge with life and the walks crackled in the heat  but a stones throw distant the sun was bathing in the dimpled thames  there was a cawing of rooks among the tall trees and a churchbell tinkled in the ivy far away across the river  mr labouchere was far away too  he was a roundcheeked boy again smothering his kitten in his pinafore prattling of red riding hood by his schoolmistresss knee and guddling in the brook for minnows  and nowand now  it was a beautiful world and ah life is sweet  he pressed his fingers to his forehead  leave me he said hoarsely  andrew put his hand upon the shoulder of the man he loved so well  be brave he said do it in whatever way you prefer  a moments suffering and all will be over  he spoke gently  there is always something infinitely pathetic in the sight of a strong man in pain  mr labouchere turned upon him  go he cried or i will call the servants  you forget said andrew that i am your guest  but his host only pointed to the door  andrew felt a great sinking at his heart  they prate who say it is success that tries a man  he flung himself at mr laboucheres feet  think of the public funeral he cried  his host seized the bellrope and pulled it violently  if you will do it said andrew solemnly i promise to lay flowers on your grave every day till i die  john said mr labouchere show this gentleman out  andrew rose  you refuse he asked  i do  you wont think it over  if i call again say on thursday  john said mr labouchere  andrew took up his hat  his host thought he had gone  but in the hall his reflection in a lookingglass reminded the visitor of something he put his head in at the doorway again  would you mind telling me he said whether you see anything peculiar about my neck  it seems a good neck to twist mr labouchere answered a little savagely  andrew then withdrew     chapter vii  this unexpected rebuff from mr labouchere rankled for many days in andrews mind  had he been proposing for the great statesmans hand he could not have felt it more  perhaps he did not make sufficient allowance for mr labouchere it is always so easy to advise  but to rage at a man or woman is the proof that we can adore them it is only his loved ones who infuriate a scotchman  there were moments when andrew said to himself that he had nothing more to live for  then he would upbraid himself for having gone about it too hurriedly and in bitter selfcontempt strike his hand on the railings as he rushed by  work is the sovereign remedy for this unhealthy state of mind and fortunately andrew had a great deal to do  gradually the wound healed and he began to take an interest in lord randolph churchill  every day the flying scotchman shoots its refuse of clever young men upon london who are too ambitious to do anything  andrew was not one of these  seeking to carry off one of the greatest prizes in his profession he had aimed too high for a beginner  when he realised this he apprenticed himself so to speak to the president determined to acquire a practical knowledge of his art in all its branches  though a very young man he had still much to learn it was only in his leisure moments that he gave way to dreams over a magnum opus  but when he did set about it which must be before his period of probation closed he had made up his mind to be thorough  the months thus passed quietly but not unprofitably in assisting the president acquainting himself with the favourite resorts of interesting persons and composing his thesis  at intervals the monotony was relieved by more strictly society work on these occasions he played a part not dissimilar to that of a junior counsel  the president found him invaluable in his raid on the gentlemen with umbrellas who read newspapers in the streets  it was andrewthough he never got the credit of itwho put his senior in possession of the necessary particulars about the comic writers whose subject is teetotalism and spinsters  he was unwearying indeed in his efforts with regard to the comic journals generally and the first man of any note that he disposed of was punchs favourite artist on scotch matters  this was in an alley off fleet street  andrew took a new interest in the house of lords and had a magnificent scheme for ending it in half an hour  as the members could never be got together in any number this fell through  lord brabourne will remember the young man in a straw hat with his neck covered up who attended the house so regularly when it was announced that he was to speak  that was andrew  it was he who excitedly asked the black rod to point out lord sherbrooke when it was intimated that this peer was preparing a volume of poems for the press  in a months time andrew knew the likeliest places to meet these and other noble lords alone  the publishing offices of england the only conservative newspaper had a fascination for him  he got to know mr ashmead bartletts hours of calling until the sight of him on the pavement was accepted as a token that the proprietor was inside  they generally reached the house of commons about the same time  here andrews interest was discriminated among quite a number of members  mr bradlaugh mr sexton and mr marjoribanks the respected member for berwickshire were perhaps his favourites but the one he dwelt with most pride on was lord randolph churchill  one night he gloated so long over sir george trevelyan leaning over westminster bridge that in the end he missed him  when andrew made up his mind to have a man he got to like him  this was his danger  with press tickets which he got very cheap he often looked in at the theatres to acquaint himself with the faces and figures of the constant frequenters  he drew capital pencil sketches of the leading critics in his notebook  the gentleman next him that night at manteaux noirs would not have laughed so heartily if he had known why andrew listened for his address to the cabman  the young scotchman resented peoples merriment over nothing sometimes he took the underground railway just to catch clerks at titbits  one afternoon he saw some way in front of him in piccadilly a man with a young head on old shoulders  andrew recognized him by the swing of his stick he could have identified his plaid among a hundred thousand morning coats  it was john stuart blackie his favourite professor  since the young man graduated his old preceptor had resigned his chair and was now devoting his time to writing sonnets to himself in the scotch newspapers  andrew could not bear to think of it and quickened his pace to catch him up  but blackie was in great form humming scots wha hae  with head thrown back staff revolving and chest inflated he sang himself into a martial ecstasy and drumming cheerily on the doors with his fist strutted along like a band of bagpipers with a clan behind him until he had played himself out of andrews sight  far be it from our intention to maintain that andrew was invariably successful  that is not given to any man  sometimes his hands slipped  had he learned the piano in his younger days this might not have happened  but if he had been a pianist the president would probably have wiped him outand very rightly  there can be no doubt about male pianists  nor was the fault always andrews  when the society was founded many farseeing men had got wind of it and had themselves elected honorary members before the committee realised what they were after  this was a sore subject with the president he shunned discussing it and thus andrew had frequently to discontinue cases after he was well on with them  in this way much time was lost  andrew was privately thanked by the committee for one suggestion which for all he knows may yet be carried out  the president had a wide interest in the press and on one occasion he remarked to andrew  think of the snobs and the prigs who would be saved if the saturday review and the spectator could be induced to cease publication  andrew thought it out and then produced his scheme  the battle of the clans on the north inch of perth had always seemed to him a masterstroke of diplomacy  why he said to the president not set the saturdays staff against the spectators  if about equally matched they might exterminate each other  so his days of probation passed and the time drew nigh for andrew to show what stuff was in him     chapter viii  andrew had set apart july 31 for killing lord randolph churchill  as his term of probation was up in the second week of august this would leave him nearly a fortnight to finish his thesis in  on the 30th he bought a knife in holborn suitable for his purpose  it had been his original intention to use an electric rifle but those he was shown were too cumbrous for use in the streets  the eminent statesman was residing at this time at the grand hotel and andrew thought to get him somewhere between trafalgar square and the house  taking up his position in a window of morleys hotel at an early hour he set himself to watch the windows opposite  the plan of the grand was well known to him for he had frequently made use of it as overlooking the national liberal club whose membership he had already slightly reduced  turning his eyes to the private sittingrooms he soon discovered lord randolph busily writing in one of them  andrew had lunch at morleys so that he might be prepared for any emergency  lord randolph wrote on doggedly through the forenoon and andrew hoped he would finish what he was at in case this might be his last chance  it rained all through the afternoon  the thick drizzle seemed to double the width of the street and even to andrews strained eyes the shadow in the room opposite was obscured  his eyes wandered from the window to the hotel entrance and as cab after cab rattled from it he became uneasy  in ordinary circumstances he could have picked his man out anywhere but in rain all men look alike  he could have dashed across the street and rushed from room to room of the grand hotel  his selfrestraint was rewarded  late in the afternoon lord randolph came to the window  the flashing waterproofs and scurrying umbrellas were a surprise to him and he knitted his brows in annoyance  byandby his face was convulsed with laughter  he drew a chair to the window and stood on it that he might have a better view of the pavement beneath  for some twenty minutes he remained there smacking his thighs his shoulders heaving with glee  andrew could not see what it was but he formulated a theory  heavy blobs of rain that had gathered on the windowsill slowly released their hold from time to time and fell with a plump on the hats of passersby  lord randolph was watching them  just as they were letting go he shook the window to make the wayfarers look up  they got the raindrops full in the face and then he screamed  about six oclock andrew paid his bill hurriedly and ran downstairs lord randolph had come to the window in his greatcoat  his follower waited for him outside  it was possible that he would take a hansom and drive straight to the house but andrew had reasons for thinking this unlikely  the rain had somewhat abated  lord randolph came out put up his umbrella and glancing at the sky for a moment set off briskly up st martins lane  andrew knew that he would not linger here for they had done st martins lane already  lord randolphs movements these last days had excited the scotchmans curiosity  he had been doing the london streets systematically during his unoccupied afternoons  but it was difficult to discover what he was after  it was the tobacconists shops that attracted him  he did not enter only stood at the windows counting something  he jotted down the result on a piece of paper and then sped on to the next shop  in this way with andrew at his heels he had done the whole of the w c district st jamess oxford street piccadilly bond street and the burlington arcade  on this occasion he took the small thoroughfares lying between upper regent street and tottenham court road  beginning in great titchfield street he went from tobacconists to tobacconists sometimes smiling to himself at other times frowning  andrew scrutinised the windows as he left them but could make nothing of it  not for the first time he felt that there could be no murder tonight unless he saw the paper first  lord randolph devoted an hour to this work  then he hailed a cab  andrew expected this  but the statesman still held the paper loosely in his hand  it was a temptation  andrew bounded forward as if to open the cab door pounced upon the paper and disappeared with it up an alley  after five minutes dread lest he might be pursued he struck a match and read  great titchfield

in a burst of passion branscombe still leadingconfound her  andrew saw that lord randolph had been calculating fame from vesta boxes  for a moment this discovery sent andrews mind wandering  miss branscombes photographs obstructed the traffic  should not this be put a stop to  ah but she was a woman  this recalled him to himself  lord randolph had departed probably for st stephens  andrew jumped into a hansom  he felt like an exotic in a glass frame  the house he said  what a pity his mother could not have seen him then  perhaps andrew was prejudiced  undoubtedly he was in a mood to be easily pleased  in his opinion at any rate  lord randolphs speech that night on the irish question was the best he ever delivered  it came on late in the evening and he stuck to his text like a clergyman  he quoted from hansard to prove that mr gladstone did not know what he was talking about he blazed out against the parnellites till they were called to order  the ironical members who cried hear hear regretted it  he had never been wittier never more convincing never so magnificently vituperative  andrew was lifted out of himself  he jumped in ecstasy to his feet it was he who led the applause  he felt that this was a worthy close to a brilliant career  we oldsters looking on more coolly could have seen where the speech was lacking so far as andrew was concerned  it is well known that when a great man of whom there will be biographers is to die a violent death his last utterances are strangely significant as if he foresaw his end  there was nothing of this in lord randolphs speech  the house was thinning when the noble lord rose to go  andrew joined him at the gate  the scotchmans nervous elation had all gone  a momentary thrill passed through his veins as he remembered that in all probability they would never be together again  after that he was quite calm  the night was black  the rain had ceased but for an occasional drop shaken out of a shivering star  but for a few cabs rolling off with politicians whitehall was deserted  the very taxcollectors seemed to have got to bed  lord randolph shook hands with two or three other members homeward bound walked a short distance with one of them and then set off towards his hotel alone  his pace was leisurely as that of a man in profound thought  there was no time to be lost but andrew dallied  once he crept up and could have done it  he thought he would give him another minute  there was a footstep behind and he fell back  it was sir william harcourt  lord randolph heard him and seeing who it was increased his pace  the illustrious liberal slackened at the same moment  andrew bit his lip and hurried on  some time was lost in getting round sir william  he was advancing in strides now  lord randolph saw that he was pursued  when andrew began to run he ran too  there were not ten yards between them at whitehall place  a large man turning the corner of great scotland yard fell against andrew  he was wheeled aside but mr chaplin had saved a colleagues life  with a cry andrew bounded on his knife glistening  trafalgar square was a black mass  lord randolph took northumberland avenue in four steps andrew almost on the top of him  as he burst through the door of the grand hotel his pursuer made one tremendous leap and his knife catching lord randolph in the heel carried away his shoe  andrews face had struck the steps  he heard the word fenian  there was a rushing to and fro of lights  springing to his feet he thrust the shoe into his pocket and went home     chapter ix  tie this muffler round your neck  it was the president who spoke  andrew held his thesis in his hand  but the rooms are so close he said  that has nothing to do with it said the president  the blood rushed to his head and then left him pale  but why asked andrew  for gods sake do as i bid you said his companion pulling himself by a great effort to the other side of the room  you have done it he asked carefully avoiding andrews face  yes but  then we can go in to the others  remember what i told you about omitting the first seven pages  the society wont stand introductory remarks in a thesis  the committee were assembled in the next room  when the young scotchman entered with the president they looked him full in the neck  he is suffering from cold the president said  no one replied but angry eyes were turned on the speaker  he somewhat nervously placed his young friend in a bad light with a table between him and his hearers  then andrew began  the society for doing without he read has been tried and found wanting  it has now been in existence for some years and its members have worked zealously though unostentatiously  i am far from saying a word against them  they are patriots as true as ever petitioned against the channel tunnel  no compliments whispered the president warningly  andrew hastily turned a page and continued  but what have they done  removed an individual here and there  that is the extent of it  you have been pursuing a halfhearted policy  you might go on for centuries at this rate before you made any perceptible difference in the streets  have you ever seen a farmer thinning turnips  gentlemen there is an example for you  my proposal is that everybody should have to die on reaching the age of fortyfive years  it has been the wish of this society to avoid the prejudices engendered of party strife  but though you are a social rather than a political organisation you cannot escape politics  you do not call yourselves radicals but you work for radicalism  what is radicalism it is a desire to get a chance  this is an aspiration inherent in the human breast  it is felt most keenly by the poor  make the poor rich and the hovels the misery the immorality and the crime of the east end disappear  it is infamous say the socialists that this is not done at once  yes but how is it to be done  not as they hold by making the classes and the masses change places  not on the lines on which the society has hitherto worked there is only one way and i make it my text tonight  fortunately it presents no considerable difficulties  it is well known in medicine that the simplestin other words the most naturalremedies may be the most efficacious  so it is in the social life  what shall we do society asks with our boys  i reply  kill off the parents  there can be little doubt that fortyfive years is long enough for a man to live  parents must see that  youth is the time to have your fling  let us see how this plan would revolutionise the world  it would make statesmen hurry up  at present they are nearly fifty before you hear of them  how can we expect the country to be properly governed by men in their dotage  again take the world of letters  why does the literary aspirant have such a struggle  simply because the profession is overstocked with seniors  i would like to know what tennysons age is and ruskins and brownings  every one of them is over seventy and all writing away yet as lively as you like  it is a crying scandal  things are the same in medicine art divinity lawin short in every profession and in every trade  young ladies cry out that this is not a marrying age  how can it be a marrying age with greyheaded parents everywhere  give young men their chance and they will marry younger than ever if only to see their children grown up before they die  a word in conclusion  looking around me i cannot but see that most if not all of my hearers have passed what should plainly be the allotted span of life to man  you would have to go  but gentlemen you would do so feeling that you were setting a noble example  younger andmay i saymore energetic men would fill your places and carry on your work  you would hardly be missed  andrew rolled up his thesis blandly and strode into the next room to await the committees decision  it cannot be said that he felt the slightest uneasiness  the president followed shutting the door behind him  you have just two minutes he said  andrew could not understand it  his hat was crushed on to his head his coat flung at him he was pushed out at a window squeezed through a grating and tumbled into a passage  what is the matter he asked as the president dragged him down a back street  the president pointed to the window they had just left  half a dozen infuriated men were climbing from it in pursuit  their faces drunk with rage awoke andrew to a sense of his danger  they were drawing lots for you when i left the room said the president  but what have i done gasped andrew  they didnt like your thesis  at least they make that their excuse  excuse  yes it was really your neck that did it  by this time they were in a cab rattling into grays inn road  they are a poor lot said andrew fiercely if they couldnt keep their heads over my neck  they are only human retorted the president  for heavens sake pull up the collar of your coat  his fingers were itching but andrew did not notice it  where are we going he asked  to kings cross  the midnight express leaves in twenty minutes  it is your last chance  andrew was in a daze  when the president had taken his ticket for glasgow he was still groping  the railway officials probably thought him on his honeymoon  they sauntered along the platform beyond the lights  andrew who was very hot unloosened his greatcoat  in a moment a great change came over his companion  all the humanity went from his face his whole figure shook and it was only by a tremendous effort that he chained his hands to his side  your neck he cried cover it up  andrew did not understand  he looked about him for the committee  there are none of them here he said feebly  the president had tried to warn him  now he gave way  the devil that was in him leapt at andrews throat  the young scotchman was knocked into a goods waggon with the president twisted round him  at that moment there was heard the whistle of the scotch express  your blood be on your own head cried the president yielding completely to temptation  his fingers met round the young mans neck  my god he murmured in a delirious ecstasy what a neck what a neck  just then his foot slipped  he fell  andrew jumped up and kicked him as hard as he could three times  then he leapt to the platform and flinging himself into the moving train fell exhausted on the seat  andrew never thought so much of the president again  you cannot respect a man and kick him     chapter x  the first thing andrew did on reaching wheens was to write to his london landlady to send on his box with clothes by goods train also his tobacco pouch which he had left on the mantelpiece and two pencils which she would find in the teacaddy  then he went around to the manse  the minister had great news for him  the master of the wheens grammar school had died  andrew had only to send in his testimonials and the post was his  the salary was 200 pounds per annum with an assistant and the privilege of calling himself rector  this settled andrew asked for clarrie  he was humbler now than he had been and in our disappointments we turn to woman for solace  clarrie had been working socks for him and would have had them finished by this time had she known how to turn the heel  it is his sweetheart a man should be particular about  once he settles down it does not much matter whom he marries  all this and much more the good old minister pointed out to andrew then he left clarrie and her lover together  the winsome girl held one of the socks on her kneewho will chide herand a tear glistened in her eye  andrew was a good deal affected  clarrie he said softly will you be my wife  she clung to him in reply  he kissed her fondly  clarrie beloved he said nervously after a long pause how much are seven and thirteen  twentythree said clarrie putting up her mouth to his  andrew laughed a sad vacant laugh  he felt that he would never understand a woman  but his fingers wandered through her tobaccocoloured hair  he had a strange notion  put your arms round my neck he whispered  thus the old old story was told once more  a month afterwards the president of the society for doing without received by post a box of bridecake adorned with the silver gilt which is also largely used for coffins                                        more than two years have passed since andrews marriage and already the minister has two sweet grandchildren in whom he renews his youth  except during schoolhours their parents married life is one long honeymoon  clarrie has put lord randolph churchills shoe into a glass case on the piano and as is only natural andrew is now a staunch conservative  domesticated and repentant he has renounced the devil and all her works  sometimes when thinking of the past the babble of his lovely babies jars upon him and still halfdreaming he brings their heads close together  at such a time all the anxious mother has to say is  andrew  then with a start he lays them gently in a heap on the floor and striding the room soon regains his composure  for andrew has told clarrie all the indiscretions of his life in london and she has forgiven everything  ah what will not a wife forgive
