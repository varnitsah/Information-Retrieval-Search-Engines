70953088	the jolly corner by henry james   chapter i   every one asks me what i think of everything said spencer brydon and i make answer as i canbegging or dodging the question putting them off with any nonsense  it wouldnt matter to any of them really he went on for even were it possible to meet in that standanddeliver way so silly a demand on so big a subject my thoughts would still be almost altogether about something that concerns only myself  he was talking to miss staverton with whom for a couple of months now he had availed himself of every possible occasion to talk this disposition and this resource this comfort and support as the situation in fact presented itself having promptly enough taken the first place in the considerable array of rather unattenuated surprises attending his so strangely belated return to america  everything was somehow a surprise and that might be natural when one had so long and so consistently neglected everything taken pains to give surprises so much margin for play  he had given them more than thirty yearsthirtythree to be exact and they now seemed to him to have organised their performance quite on the scale of that licence  he had been twentythree on leaving new yorkhe was fiftysix today unless indeed he were to reckon as he had sometimes since his repatriation found himself feeling in which case he would have lived longer than is often allotted to man  it would have taken a century he repeatedly said to himself and said also to alice staverton it would have taken a longer absence and a more averted mind than those even of which he had been guilty to pile up the differences the newnesses the queernesses above all the bignesses for the better or the worse that at present assaulted his vision wherever he looked  the great fact all the while however had been the incalculability since he had supposed himself from decade to decade to be allowing and in the most liberal and intelligent manner for brilliancy of change he actually saw that he had allowed for nothing he missed what he would have been sure of finding he found what he would never have imagined proportions and values were upsidedown the ugly things he had expected the ugly things of his faraway youth when he had too promptly waked up to a sense of the uglythese uncanny phenomena placed him rather as it happened under the charm whereas the swagger things the modern the monstrous the famous things those he had more particularly like thousands of ingenuous enquirers every year come over to see were exactly his sources of dismay  they were as so many set traps for displeasure above all for reaction of which his restless tread was constantly pressing the spring  it was interesting doubtless the whole show but it would have been too disconcerting hadnt a certain finer truth saved the situation  he had distinctly not in this steadier light come over all for the monstrosities he had come not only in the last analysis but quite on the face of the act under an impulse with which they had nothing to do  he had comeputting the thing pompouslyto look at his property which he had thus for a third of a century not been within four thousand miles of or expressing it less sordidly he had yielded to the humour of seeing again his house on the jolly corner as he usually and quite fondly described itthe one in which he had first seen the light in which various members of his family had lived and had died in which the holidays of his overschooled boyhood had been passed and the few social flowers of his chilled adolescence gathered and which alienated then for so long a period had through the successive deaths of his two brothers and the termination of old arrangements come wholly into his hands  he was the owner of another not quite so goodthe jolly corner having been from far back superlatively extended and consecrated and the value of the pair represented his main capital with an income consisting in these later years of their respective rents which thanks precisely to their original excellent type had never been depressingly low  he could live in europe as he had been in the habit of living on the product of these flourishing new york leases and all the better since that of the second structure the mere number in its long row having within a twelvemonth fallen in renovation at a high advance had proved beautifully possible  these were items of property indeed but he had found himself since his arrival distinguishing more than ever between them  the house within the street two bristling blocks westward was already in course of reconstruction as a tall mass of flats he had acceded some time before to overtures for this conversionin which now that it was going forward it had been not the least of his astonishments to find himself able on the spot and though without a previous ounce of such experience to participate with a certain intelligence almost with a certain authority  he had lived his life with his back so turned to such concerns and his face addressed to those of so different an order that he scarce knew what to make of this lively stir in a compartment of his mind never yet penetrated of a capacity for business and a sense for construction  these virtues so common all round him now had been dormant in his own organismwhere it might be said of them perhaps that they had slept the sleep of the just  at present in the splendid autumn weatherthe autumn at least was a pure boon in the terrible placehe loafed about his work undeterred secretly agitated not in the least minding that the whole proposition as they said was vulgar and sordid and ready to climb ladders to walk the plank to handle materials and look wise about them to ask questions in fine and challenge explanations and really go into figures  it amused it verily quite charmed him and by the same stroke it amused and even more alice staverton though perhaps charming her perceptibly less  she wasnt however going to be betteroff for it as he wasand so astonishingly much nothing was now likely he knew ever to make her betteroff than she found herself in the afternoon of life as the delicately frugal possessor and tenant of the small house in irving place to which she had subtly managed to cling through her almost unbroken new york career  if he knew the way to it now better than to any other address among the dreadful multiplied numberings which seemed to him to reduce the whole place to some vast ledgerpage overgrown fantastic of ruled and crisscrossed lines and figuresif he had formed for his consolation that habit it was really not a little because of the charm of his having encountered and recognised in the vast wilderness of the wholesale breaking through the mere gross generalisation of wealth and force and success a small still scene where items and shades all delicate things kept the sharpness of the notes of a high voice perfectly trained and where economy hung about like the scent of a garden  his old friend lived with one maid and herself dusted her relics and trimmed her lamps and polished her silver she stood oft in the awful modern crush when she could but she sallied forth and did battle when the challenge was really to spirit the spirit she after all confessed to proudly and a little shyly as to that of the better time that of their common their quite faraway and antediluvian social period and order  she made use of the streetcars when need be the terrible things that people scrambled for as the panicstricken at sea scramble for the boats she affronted inscrutably under stress all the public concussions and ordeals and yet with that slim mystifying grace of her appearance which defied you to say if she were a fair young woman who looked older through trouble or a fine smooth older one who looked young through successful indifference with her precious reference above all to memories and histories into which he could enter she was as exquisite for him as some pale pressed flower a rarity to begin with and failing other sweetnesses she was a sufficient reward of his effort  they had communities of knowledge their knowledge this discriminating possessive was always on her lips of presences of the other age presences all overlaid in his case by the experience of a man and the freedom of a wanderer overlaid by pleasure by infidelity by passages of life that were strange and dim to her just by europe in short but still unobscured still exposed and cherished under that pious visitation of the spirit from which she had never been diverted  she had come with him one day to see how his apartmenthouse was rising he had helped her over gaps and explained to her plans and while they were there had happened to have before her a brief but lively discussion with the man in charge the representative of the building firm that had undertaken his work  he had found himself quite standing up to this personage over a failure on the latters part to observe some detail of one of their noted conditions and had so lucidly argued his case that besides ever so prettily flushing at the time for sympathy in his triumph she had afterwards said to him though to a slightly greater effect of irony that he had clearly for too many years neglected a real gift  if he had but stayed at home he would have anticipated the inventor of the skyscraper  if he had but stayed at home he would have discovered his genius in time really to start some new variety of awful architectural hare and run it till it burrowed in a gold mine  he was to remember these words while the weeks elapsed for the small silver ring they had sounded over the queerest and deepest of his own lately most disguised and most muffled vibrations  it had begun to be present to him after the first fortnight it had broken out with the oddest abruptness this particular wanton wonderment it met him thereand this was the image under which he himself judged the matter or at least not a little thrilled and flushed with itvery much as he might have been met by some strange figure some unexpected occupant at a turn of one of the dim passages of an empty house  the quaint analogy quite hauntingly remained with him when he didnt indeed rather improve it by a still intenser form that of his opening a door behind which he would have made sure of finding nothing a door into a room shuttered and void and yet so coming with a great suppressed start on some quite erect confronting presence something planted in the middle of the place and facing him through the dusk  after that visit to the house in construction he walked with his companion to see the other and always so much the better one which in the eastward direction formed one of the cornersthe jolly one precisely of the street now so generally dishonoured and disfigured in its westward reaches and of the comparatively conservative avenue  the avenue still had pretensions as miss staverton said to decency the old people had mostly gone the old names were unknown and here and there an old association seemed to stray all vaguely like some very aged person out too late whom you might meet and feel the impulse to watch or follow in kindness for safe restoration to shelter  they went in together our friends he admitted himself with his key as he kept no one there he explained preferring for his reasons to leave the place empty under a simple arrangement with a good woman living in the neighbourhood and who came for a daily hour to open windows and dust and sweep  spencer brydon had his reasons and was growingly aware of them they seemed to him better each time he was there though he didnt name them all to his companion any more than he told her as yet how often how quite absurdly often he himself came  he only let her see for the present while they walked through the great blank rooms that absolute vacancy reigned and that from top to bottom there was nothing but mrs muldoons broomstick in a corner to tempt the burglar  mrs muldoon was then on the premises and she loquaciously attended the visitors preceding them from room to room and pushing back shutters and throwing up sashesall to show them as she remarked how little there was to see  there was little indeed to see in the great gaunt shell where the main dispositions and the general apportionment of space the style of an age of ampler allowances had nevertheless for its master their honest pleading message affecting him as some good old servants some lifelong retainers appeal for a character or even for a retiring pension yet it was also a remark of mrs muldoons that glad as she was to oblige him by her noonday round there was a request she greatly hoped he would never make of her  if he should wish her for any reason to come in after dark she would just tell him if he plased that he must ask it of somebody else  the fact that there was nothing to see didnt militate for the worthy woman against what one might see and she put it frankly to miss staverton that no lady could be expected to like could she craping up to thim top storeys in the ayvil hours  the gas and the electric light were off the house and she fairly evoked a gruesome vision of her march through the great grey roomsso many of them as there were toowith her glimmering taper  miss staverton met her honest glare with a smile and the profession that she herself certainly would recoil from such an adventure  spencer brydon meanwhile held his peacefor the moment the question of the evil hours in his old home had already become too grave for him  he had begun some time since to crape and he knew just why a packet of candles addressed to that pursuit had been stowed by his own hand three weeks before at the back of a drawer of the fine old sideboard that occupied as a fixture the deep recess in the dining room  just now he laughed at his companionsquickly however changing the subject for the reason that in the first place his laugh struck him even at that moment as starting the odd echo the conscious human resonance he scarce knew how to qualify it that sounds made while he was there alone sent back to his ear or his fancy and that in the second he imagined alice staverton for the instant on the point of asking him with a divination if he ever so prowled  there were divinations he was unprepared for and he had at all events averted enquiry by the time mrs muldoon had left them passing on to other parts  there was happily enough to say on so consecrated a spot that could be said freely and fairly so that a whole train of declarations was precipitated by his friends having herself broken out after a yearning look round but i hope you dont mean they want you to pull this to pieces  his answer came promptly with his reawakened wrath it was of course exactly what they wanted and what they were at him for daily with the iteration of people who couldnt for their life understand a mans liability to decent feelings  he had found the place just as it stood and beyond what he could express an interest and a joy there were values other than the beastly rentvalues and in short in short  but it was thus miss staverton took him up  in short youre to make so good a thing of your skyscraper that living in luxury on those illgotten gains you can afford for a while to be sentimental here  her smile had for him with the words the particular mild irony with which he found half her talk suffused an irony without bitterness and that came exactly from her having so much imaginationnot like the cheap sarcasms with which one heard most people about the world of society bid for the reputation of cleverness from nobodys really having any  it was agreeable to him at this very moment to be sure that when he had answered after a brief demur well yes so precisely you may put it her imagination would still do him justice  he explained that even if never a dollar were to come to him from the other house he would nevertheless cherish this one and he dwelt further while they lingered and wandered on the fact of the stupefaction he was already exciting the positive mystification he felt himself create  he spoke of the value of all he read into it into the mere sight of the walls mere shapes of the rooms mere sound of the floors mere feel in his hand of the old silverplated knobs of the several mahogany doors which suggested the pressure of the palms of the dead the seventy years of the past in fine that these things represented the annals of nearly three generations counting his grandfathers the one that had ended there and the impalpable ashes of his longextinct youth afloat in the very air like microscopic motes  she listened to everything she was a woman who answered intimately but who utterly didnt chatter  she scattered abroad therefore no cloud of words she could assent she could agree above all she could encourage without doing that  only at the last she went a little further than he had done himself  and then how do you know  you may still after all want to live here  it rather indeed pulled him up for it wasnt what he had been thinking at least in her sense of the words you mean i may decide to stay on for the sake of it  well with such a home  but quite beautifully she had too much tact to dot so monstrous an i and it was precisely an illustration of the way she didnt rattle  how could any oneof any witinsist on any one elses wanting to live in new york  oh he said i might have lived here since i had my opportunity early in life i might have put in here all these years  then everything would have been different enoughand i dare say funny enough  but thats another matter  and then the beauty of iti mean of my perversity of my refusal to agree to a dealis just in the total absence of a reason  dont you see that if i had a reason about the matter at all it would have to be the other way and would then be inevitably a reason of dollars  there are no reasons here but of dollars  let us therefore have none whatevernot the ghost of one  they were back in the hall then for departure but from where they stood the vista was large through an open door into the great square main saloon with its almost antique felicity of brave spaces between windows her eyes came back from that reach and met his own a moment  are you very sure the ghost of one doesnt much rather serve  he had a positive sense of turning pale  but it was as near as they were then to come  for he made answer he believed between a glare and a grin oh ghostsof course the place must swarm with them  i should be ashamed of it if it didnt  poor mrs muldoons right and its why i havent asked her to do more than look in  miss stavertons gaze again lost itself and things she didnt utter it was clear came and went in her mind  she might even for the minute off there in the fine room have imagined some element dimly gathering simplified like the deathmask of a handsome face it perhaps produced for her just then an effect akin to the stir of an expression in the set commemorative plaster  yet whatever her impression may have been she produced instead a vague platitude  well if it were only furnished and lived in  she appeared to imply that in case of its being still furnished he might have been a little less opposed to the idea of a return  but she passed straight into the vestibule as if to leave her words behind her and the next moment he had opened the housedoor and was standing with her on the steps  he closed the door and while he repocketed his key looking up and down they took in the comparatively harsh actuality of the avenue which reminded him of the assault of the outer light of the desert on the traveller emerging from an egyptian tomb  but he risked before they stepped into the street his gathered answer to her speech  for me it is lived in  for me it is furnished  at which it was easy for her to sigh ah yes all vaguely and discreetly since his parents and his favourite sister to say nothing of other kin in numbers had run their course and met their end there  that represented within the walls ineffaceable life  it was a few days after this that during an hour passed with her again he had expressed his impatience of the too flattering curiosityamong the people he metabout his appreciation of new york  he had arrived at none at all that was socially producible and as for that matter of his thinking thinking the better or the worse of anything there he was wholly taken up with one subject of thought  it was mere vain egoism and it was moreover if she liked a morbid obsession  he found all things come back to the question of what he personally might have been how he might have led his life and turned out if he had not so at the outset given it up  and confessing for the first time to the intensity within him of this absurd speculationwhich but proved also no doubt the habit of too selfishly thinkinghe affirmed the impotence there of any other source of interest any other native appeal  what would it have made of me what would it have made of me  i keep for ever wondering all idiotically as if i could possibly know  i see what it has made of dozens of others those i meet and it positively aches within me to the point of exasperation that it would have made something of me as well  only i cant make out what and the worry of it the small rage of curiosity never to be satisfied brings back what i remember to have felt once or twice after judging best for reasons to burn some important letter unopened  ive been sorry ive hated itive never known what was in the letter  you may of course say its a trifle  i dont say its a trifle miss staverton gravely interrupted  she was seated by her fire and before her on his feet and restless he turned to and fro between this intensity of his idea and a fitful and unseeing inspection through his single eyeglass of the dear little old objects on her chimneypiece  her interruption made him for an instant look at her harder  i shouldnt care if you did he laughed however and its only a figure at any rate for the way i now feel  not to have followed my perverse young courseand almost in the teeth of my fathers curse as i may say not to have kept it up so over there from that day to this without a doubt or a pang not above all to have liked it to have loved it so much loved it no doubt with such an abysmal conceit of my own preference some variation from that i say must have produced some different effect for my life and for my form  i should have stuck hereif it had been possible and i was too young at twentythree to judge pour deux sous whether it were possible  if i had waited i might have seen it was and then i might have been by staying here something nearer to one of these types who have been hammered so hard and made so keen by their conditions  it isnt that i admire them so muchthe question of any charm in them or of any charm beyond that of the rank moneypassion exerted by their conditions for them has nothing to do with the matter its only a question of what fantastic yet perfectly possible development of my own nature i maynt have missed  it comes over me that i had then a strange alter ego deep down somewhere within me as the fullblown flower is in the small tight bud and that i just took the course i just transferred him to the climate that blighted him for once and for ever  and you wonder about the flower miss staverton said  so do i if you want to know and so ive been wondering these several weeks  i believe in the flower she continued i feel it would have been quite splendid quite huge and monstrous  monstrous above all her visitor echoed and i imagine by the same stroke quite hideous and offensive  you dont believe that she returned if you did you wouldnt wonder youd know and that would be enough for you  what you feeland what i feel for youis that youd have had power  youd have liked me that way he asked  she barely hung fire  how should i not have liked you  i see  youd have liked me have preferred me a billionaire  how should i not have liked you she simply again asked  he stood before her stillher question kept him motionless  he took it in so much there was of it and indeed his not otherwise meeting it testified to that  i know at least what i am he simply went on the other side of the medals clear enough  ive not been edifyingi believe im thought in a hundred quarters to have been barely decent ive followed strange paths and worshipped strange gods it must have come to you again and againin fact youve admitted to me as muchthat i was leading at any time these thirty years a selfish frivolous scandalous life  and you see what it has made of me  she just waited smiling at him  you see what it has made of me  oh youre a person whom nothing can have altered  you were born to be what you are anywhere anyway youve the perfection nothing else could have blighted  and dont you see how without my exile i shouldnt have been waiting till now  but he pulled up for the strange pang  the great thing to see she presently said seems to me to be that it has spoiled nothing  it hasnt spoiled your being here at last  it hasnt spoiled this  it hasnt spoiled your speaking  she also however faltered  he wondered at everything her controlled emotion might mean  do you believe thentoo dreadfullythat i am as good as i might ever have been  oh no  far from it  with which she got up from her chair and was nearer to him  but i dont care she smiled  you mean im good enough  she considered a little  will you believe it if i say so  i mean will you let that settle your question for you  and then as if making out in his face that he drew back from this that he had some idea which however absurd he couldnt yet bargain away oh you dont care eitherbut very differently you dont care for anything but yourself  spencer brydon recognised itit was in fact what he had absolutely professed  yet he importantly qualified  he isnt myself  hes the just so totally other person  but i do want to see him he added  and i can  and i shall  their eyes met for a minute while he guessed from something in hers that she divined his strange sense  but neither of them otherwise expressed it and her apparent understanding with no protesting shock no easy derision touched him more deeply than anything yet constituting for his stifled perversity on the spot an element that was like breatheable air  what she said however was unexpected  well ive seen him  you  ive seen him in a dream  oh a dream  it let him down  but twice over she continued  i saw him as i see you now  youve dreamed the same dream  twice over she repeated  the very same  this did somehow a little speak to him as it also gratified him  you dream about me at that rate  ah about him she smiled  his eyes again sounded her  then you know all about him  and as she said nothing more whats the wretch like  she hesitated and it was as if he were pressing her so hard that resisting for reasons of her own she had to turn away  ill tell you some other time     chapter ii   it was after this that there was most of a virtue for him most of a cultivated charm most of a preposterous secret thrill in the particular form of surrender to his obsession and of address to what he more and more believed to be his privilege  it was what in these weeks he was living forsince he really felt life to begin but after mrs muldoon had retired from the scene and visiting the ample house from attic to cellar making sure he was alone he knew himself in safe possession and as he tacitly expressed it let himself go  he sometimes came twice in the twentyfour hours the moments he liked best were those of gathering dusk of the short autumn twilight this was the time of which again and again he found himself hoping most  then he could as seemed to him most intimately wander and wait linger and listen feel his fine attention never in his life before so fine on the pulse of the great vague place he preferred the lampless hour and only wished he might have prolonged each day the deep crepuscular spell  laterrarely much before midnight but then for a considerable vigilhe watched with his glimmering light moving slowly holding it high playing it far rejoicing above all as much as he might in open vistas reaches of communication between rooms and by passages the long straight chance or show as he would have called it for the revelation he pretended to invite  it was a practice he found he could perfectly work without exciting remark no one was in the least the wiser for it even alice staverton who was moreover a well of discretion didnt quite fully imagine  he let himself in and let himself out with the assurance of calm proprietorship and accident so far favoured him that if a fat avenue officer had happened on occasion to see him entering at eleventhirty he had never yet to the best of his belief been noticed as emerging at two  he walked there on the crisp november nights arrived regularly at the evenings end it was as easy to do this after dining out as to take his way to a club or to his hotel  when he left his club if he hadnt been dining out it was ostensibly to go to his hotel and when he left his hotel if he had spent a part of the evening there it was ostensibly to go to his club  everything was easy in fine everything conspired and promoted there was truly even in the strain of his experience something that glossed over something that salved and simplified all the rest of consciousness  he circulated talked renewed loosely and pleasantly old relationsmet indeed so far as he could new expectations and seemed to make out on the whole that in spite of the career of such different contacts which he had spoken of to miss staverton as ministering so little for those who might have watched it to edification he was positively rather liked than not  he was a dim secondary social successand all with people who had truly not an idea of him  it was all mere surface sound this murmur of their welcome this popping of their corksjust as his gestures of response were the extravagant shadows emphatic in proportion as they meant little of some game of ombres chinoises  he projected himself all day in thought straight over the bristling line of hard unconscious heads and into the other the real the waiting life the life that as soon as he had heard behind him the click of his great housedoor began for him on the jolly corner as beguilingly as the slow opening bars of some rich music follows the tap of the conductors wand  he always caught the first effect of the steel point of his stick on the old marble of the hall pavement large blackandwhite squares that he remembered as the admiration of his childhood and that had then made in him as he now saw for the growth of an early conception of style  this effect was the dim reverberating tinkle as of some faroff bell hung who should say wherein the depths of the house of the past of that mystical other world that might have flourished for him had he not for weal or woe abandoned it  on this impression he did ever the same thing he put his stick noiselessly away in a cornerfeeling the place once more in the likeness of some great glass bowl all precious concave crystal set delicately humming by the play of a moist finger round its edge  the concave crystal held as it were this mystical other world and the indescribably fine murmur of its rim was the sigh there the scarce audible pathetic wail to his strained ear of all the old baffled forsworn possibilities  what he did therefore by this appeal of his hushed presence was to wake them into such measure of ghostly life as they might still enjoy  they were shy all but unappeasably shy but they werent really sinister at least they werent as he had hitherto felt thembefore they had taken the form he so yearned to make them take the form he at moments saw himself in the light of fairly hunting on tiptoe the points of his evening shoes from room to room and from storey to storey  that was the essence of his visionwhich was all rank folly if one would while he was out of the house and otherwise occupied but which took on the last verisimilitude as soon as he was placed and posted  he knew what he meant and what he wanted it was as clear as the figure on a cheque presented in demand for cash  his alter ego walkedthat was the note of his image of him while his image of his motive for his own odd pastime was the desire to waylay him and meet him  he roamed slowly warily but all restlessly he himself didmrs muldoon had been right absolutely with her figure of their craping and the presence he watched for would roam restlessly too  but it would be as cautious and as shifty the conviction of its probable in fact its already quite sensible quite audible evasion of pursuit grew for him from night to night laying on him finally a rigour to which nothing in his life had been comparable  it had been the theory of many superficiallyjudging persons he knew that he was wasting that life in a surrender to sensations but he had tasted of no pleasure so fine as his actual tension had been introduced to no sport that demanded at once the patience and the nerve of this stalking of a creature more subtle yet at bay perhaps more formidable than any beast of the forest  the terms the comparisons the very practices of the chase positively came again into play there were even moments when passages of his occasional experience as a sportsman stirred memories from his younger time of moor and mountain and desert revived for himand to the increase of his keennessby the tremendous force of analogy  he found himself at momentsonce he had placed his single light on some mantelshelf or in some recessstepping back into shelter or shade effacing himself behind a door or in an embrasure as he had sought of old the vantage of rock and tree he found himself holding his breath and living in the joy of the instant the supreme suspense created by big game alone  he wasnt afraid though putting himself the question as he believed gentlemen on bengal tigershoots or in close quarters with the great bear of the rockies had been known to confess to having put it and this indeedsince here at least he might be frankbecause of the impression so intimate and so strange that he himself produced as yet a dread produced certainly a strain beyond the liveliest he was likely to feel  they fell for him into categories they fairly became familiar the signs for his own perception of the alarm his presence and his vigilance created though leaving him always to remark portentously on his probably having formed a relation his probably enjoying a consciousness unique in the experience of man  people enough first and last had been in terror of apparitions but who had ever before so turned the tables and become himself in the apparitional world an incalculable terror  he might have found this sublime had he quite dared to think of it but he didnt too much insist truly on that side of his privilege  with habit and repetition he gained to an extraordinary degree the power to penetrate the dusk of distances and the darkness of corners to resolve back into their innocence the treacheries of uncertain light the evillooking forms taken in the gloom by mere shadows by accidents of the air by shifting effects of perspective putting down his dim luminary he could still wander on without it pass into other rooms and only knowing it was there behind him in case of need see his way about visually project for his purpose a comparative clearness  it made him feel this acquired faculty like some monstrous stealthy cat he wondered if he would have glared at these moments with large shining yellow eyes and what it mightnt verily be for the poor hardpressed alter ego to be confronted with such a type  he liked however the open shutters he opened everywhere those mrs muldoon had closed closing them as carefully afterwards so that she shouldnt notice he likedoh this he did like and above all in the upper roomsthe sense of the hard silver of the autumn stars through the windowpanes and scarcely less the flare of the streetlamps below the white electric lustre which it would have taken curtains to keep out this was human actual social this was of the world he had lived in and he was more at his ease certainly for the countenance coldly general and impersonal that all the while and in spite of his detachment it seemed to give him  he had support of course mostly in the rooms at the wide front and the prolonged side it failed him considerably in the central shades and the parts at the back  but if he sometimes on his rounds was glad of his optical reach so none the less often the rear of the house affected him as the very jungle of his prey  the place was there more subdivided a large extension in particular where small rooms for servants had been multiplied abounded in nooks and corners in closets and passages in the ramifications especially of an ample back staircase over which he leaned many a time to look far downnot deterred from his gravity even while aware that he might for a spectator have figured some solemn simpleton playing at hideandseek  outside in fact he might himself make that ironic rapprochement but within the walls and in spite of the clear windows his consistency was proof against the cynical light of new york  it had belonged to that idea of the exasperated consciousness of his victim to become a real test for him since he had quite put it to himself from the first that oh distinctly he could cultivate his whole perception  he had felt it as above all open to cultivationwhich indeed was but another name for his manner of spending his time  he was bringing it on bringing it to perfection by practice in consequence of which it had grown so fine that he was now aware of impressions attestations of his general postulate that couldnt have broken upon him at once  this was the case more specifically with a phenomenon at last quite frequent for him in the upper rooms the recognitionabsolutely unmistakeable and by a turn dating from a particular hour his resumption of his campaign after a diplomatic drop a calculated absence of three nightsof his being definitely followed tracked at a distance carefully taken and to the express end that he should the less confidently less arrogantly appear to himself merely to pursue  it worried it finally quite broke him up for it proved of all the conceivable impressions the one least suited to his book  he was kept in sight while remaining himselfas regards the essence of his positionsightless and his only recourse then was in abrupt turns rapid recoveries of ground  he wheeled about retracing his steps as if he might so catch in his face at least the stirred air of some other quick revolution  it was indeed true that his fully dislocalised thought of these manoeuvres recalled to him pantaloon at the christmas farce buffeted and tricked from behind by ubiquitous harlequin but it left intact the influence of the conditions themselves each time he was re exposed to them so that in fact this association had he suffered it to become constant would on a certain side have but ministered to his intenser gravity  he had made as i have said to create on the premises the baseless sense of a reprieve his three absences and the result of the third was to confirm the aftereffect of the second  on his return that nightthe night succeeding his last intermissionhe stood in the hall and looked up the staircase with a certainty more intimate than any he had yet known  hes there at the top and waitingnot as in general falling back for disappearance  hes holding his ground and its the first timewhich is a proof isnt it that something has happened for him  so brydon argued with his hand on the banister and his foot on the lowest stair in which position he felt as never before the air chilled by his logic  he himself turned cold in it for he seemed of a sudden to know what now was involved  harder pressedyes he takes it in with its thus making clear to him that ive come as they say to stay  he finally doesnt like and cant bear it in the sense i mean that his wrath his menaced interest now balances with his dread  ive hunted him till he has turned that up there is what has happenedhes the fanged or the antlered animal brought at last to bay  there came to him as i saybut determined by an influence beyond my notationthe acuteness of this certainty under which however the next moment he had broken into a sweat that he would as little have consented to attribute to fear as he would have dared immediately to act upon it for enterprise  it marked none the less a prodigious thrill a thrill that represented sudden dismay no doubt but also represented and with the selfsame throb the strangest the most joyous possibly the next minute almost the proudest duplication of consciousness  he has been dodging retreating hiding but now worked up to anger hell fightthis intense impression made a single mouthful as it were of terror and applause  but what was wondrous was that the applause for the felt fact was so eager since if it was his other self he was running to earth this ineffable identity was thus in the last resort not unworthy of him  it bristled theresomewhere near at hand however unseen stillas the hunted thing even as the trodden worm of the adage must at last bristle and brydon at this instant tasted probably of a sensation more complex than had ever before found itself consistent with sanity  it was as if it would have shamed him that a character so associated with his own should triumphantly succeed in just skulking should to the end not risk the open so that the drop of this danger was on the spot a great lift of the whole situation  yet with another rare shift of the same subtlety he was already trying to measure by how much more he himself might now be in peril of fear so rejoicing that he could in another form actively inspire that fear and simultaneously quaking for the form in which he might passively know it  the apprehension of knowing it must after a little have grown in him and the strangest moment of his adventure perhaps the most memorable or really most interesting afterwards of his crisis was the lapse of certain instants of concentrated conscious combat the sense of a need to hold on to something even after the manner of a man slipping and slipping on some awful incline the vivid impulse above all to move to act to charge somehow and upon somethingto show himself in a word that he wasnt afraid  the state of holding on was thus the state to which he was momentarily reduced if there had been anything in the great vacancy to seize he would presently have been aware of having clutched it as he might under a shock at home have clutched the nearest chairback  he had been surprised at any rateof this he was awareinto something unprecedented since his original appropriation of the place he had closed his eyes held them tight for a long minute as with that instinct of dismay and that terror of vision  when he opened them the room the other contiguous rooms extraordinarily seemed lighterso light almost that at first he took the change for day  he stood firm however that might be just where he had paused his resistance had helped himit was as if there were something he had tided over  he knew after a little what this wasit had been in the imminent danger of flight  he had stiffened his will against going without this he would have made for the stairs and it seemed to him that still with his eyes closed he would have descended them would have known how straight and swiftly to the bottom  well as he had held out here he wasstill at the top among the more intricate upper rooms and with the gauntlet of the others of all the rest of the house still to run when it should be his time to go  he would go at his timeonly at his time didnt he go every night very much at the same hour  he took out his watchthere was light for that it was scarcely a quarter past one and he had never withdrawn so soon he reached his lodgings for the most part at twowith his walk of a quarter of an hour  he would wait for the last quarterhe wouldnt stir till then and he kept his watch there with his eyes on it reflecting while he held it that this deliberate wait a wait with an effort which he recognised would serve perfectly for the attestation he desired to make  it would prove his courageunless indeed the latter might most be proved by his budging at last from his place  what he mainly felt now was that since he hadnt originally scuttled he had his dignitieswhich had never in his life seemed so manyall to preserve and to carry aloft this was before him in truth as a physical image an image almost worthy of an age of greater romance  that remark indeed glimmered for him only to glow the next instant with a finer light since what age of romance after all could have matched either the state of his mind or objectively as they said the wonder of his situation  the only difference would have been that brandishing his dignities over his head as in a parchment scroll he might thenthat is in the heroic timehave proceeded downstairs with a drawn sword in his other grasp  at present really the light he had set down on the mantel of the next room would have to figure his sword which utensil in the course of a minute he had taken the requisite number of steps to possess himself of the door between the rooms was open and from the second another door opened to a third  these rooms as he remembered gave all three upon a common corridor as well but there was a fourth beyond them without issue save through the preceding  to have moved to have heard his step again was appreciably a help though even in recognising this he lingered once more a little by the chimneypiece on which his light had rested  when he next moved just hesitating where to turn he found himself considering a circumstance that after his first and comparatively vague apprehension of it produced in him the start that often attends some pang of recollection the violent shock of having ceased happily to forget  he had come into sight of the door in which the brief chain of communication ended and which he now surveyed from the nearer threshold the one not directly facing it  placed at some distance to the left of this point it would have admitted him to the last room of the four the room without other approach or egress had it not to his intimate conviction been closed since his former visitation the matter probably of a quarter of an hour before  he stared with all his eyes at the wonder of the fact arrested again where he stood and again holding his breath while he sounded his sense  surely it had been subsequently closedthat is it had been on his previous passage indubitably open  he took it full in the face that something had happened betweenthat he couldnt have noticed before by which he meant on his original tour of all the rooms that evening that such a barrier had exceptionally presented itself  he had indeed since that moment undergone an agitation so extraordinary that it might have muddled for him any earlier view and he tried to convince himself that he might perhaps then have gone into the room and inadvertently automatically on coming out have drawn the door after him  the difficulty was that this exactly was what he never did it was against his whole policy as he might have said the essence of which was to keep vistas clear  he had them from the first as he was well aware quite on the brain the strange apparition at the far end of one of them of his baffled prey which had become by so sharp an irony so little the term now to apply was the form of success his imagination had most cherished projecting into it always a refinement of beauty  he had known fifty times the start of perception that had afterwards dropped had fifty times gasped to himself  there under some fond brief hallucination  the house as the case stood admirably lent itself he might wonder at the taste the native architecture of the particular time which could rejoice so in the multiplication of doorsthe opposite extreme to the modern the actual almost complete proscription of them but it had fairly contributed to provoke this obsession of the presence encountered telescopically as he might say focused and studied in diminishing perspective and as by a rest for the elbow  it was with these considerations that his present attention was chargedthey perfectly availed to make what he saw portentous  he couldnt by any lapse have blocked that aperture and if he hadnt if it was unthinkable why what else was clear but that there had been another agent  another agenthe had been catching as he felt a moment back the very breath of him but when had he been so close as in this simple this logical this completely personal act  it was so logical that is that one might have taken it for personal yet for what did brydon take it he asked himself while softly panting he felt his eyes almost leave their sockets  ah this time at last they were the two the opposed projections of him in presence and this time as much as one would the question of danger loomed  with it rose as not before the question of couragefor what he knew the blank face of the door to say to him was show us how much you have  it stared it glared back at him with that challenge it put to him the two alternatives should he just push it open or not  oh to have this consciousness was to thinkand to think brydon knew as he stood there was with the lapsing moments not to have acted  not to have actedthat was the misery and the pangwas even still not to act was in fact all to feel the thing in another in a new and terrible way  how long did he pause and how long did he debate  there was presently nothing to measure it for his vibration had already changedas just by the effect of its intensity  shut up there at bay defiant and with the prodigy of the thing palpably proveably done thus giving notice like some stark signboardunder that accession of accent the situation itself had turned and brydon at last remarkably made up his mind on what it had turned to  it had turned altogether to a different admonition to a supreme hint for him of the value of discretion  this slowly dawned no doubtfor it could take its time so perfectly on his threshold had he been stayed so little as yet had he either advanced or retreated  it was the strangest of all things that now when by his taking ten steps and applying his hand to a latch or even his shoulder and his knee if necessary to a panel all the hunger of his prime need might have been met his high curiosity crowned his unrest assuagedit was amazing but it was also exquisite and rare that insistence should have at a touch quite dropped from him  discretionhe jumped at that and yet not verily at such a pitch because it saved his nerves or his skin but because much more valuably it saved the situation  when i say he jumped at it i feel the consonance of this term with the fact thatat the end indeed of i know not how longhe did move again he crossed straight to the door  he wouldnt touch itit seemed now that he might if he would he would only just wait there a little to show to prove that he wouldnt  he had thus another station close to the thin partition by which revelation was denied him but with his eyes bent and his hands held off in a mere intensity of stillness  he listened as if there had been something to hear but this attitude while it lasted was his own communication  if you wont thengood i spare you and i give up  you affect me as by the appeal positively for pity you convince me that for reasons rigid and sublimewhat do i knowwe both of us should have suffered  i respect them then and though moved and privileged as i believe it has never been given to man i retire i renouncenever on my honour to try again  so rest for everand let me  that for brydon was the deep sense of this last demonstrationsolemn measured directed as he felt it to be  he brought it to a close he turned away and now verily he knew how deeply he had been stirred  he retraced his steps taking up his candle burnt he observed wellnigh to the socket and marking again lighten it as he would the distinctness of his footfall after which in a moment he knew himself at the other side of the house  he did here what he had not yet done at these hourshe opened half a casement one of those in the front and let in the air of the night a thing he would have taken at any time previous for a sharp rupture of his spell  his spell was broken now and it didnt matterbroken by his concession and his surrender which made it idle henceforth that he should ever come back  the empty streetits other life so marked even by great lamplit vacancywas within call within touch he stayed there as to be in it again high above it though he was still perched he watched as for some comforting common fact some vulgar human note the passage of a scavenger or a thief some nightbird however base  he would have blessed that sign of life he would have welcomed positively the slow approach of his friend the policeman whom he had hitherto only sought to avoid and was not sure that if the patrol had come into sight he mightnt have felt the impulse to get into relation with it to hail it on some pretext from his fourth floor  the pretext that wouldnt have been too silly or too compromising the explanation that would have saved his dignity and kept his name in such a case out of the papers was not definite to him he was so occupied with the thought of recording his discretionas an effect of the vow he had just uttered to his intimate adversarythat the importance of this loomed large and something had overtaken all ironically his sense of proportion  if there had been a ladder applied to the front of the house even one of the vertiginous perpendiculars employed by painters and roofers and sometimes left standing overnight he would have managed somehow astride of the windowsill to compass by outstretched leg and arm that mode of descent  if there had been some such uncanny thing as he had found in his room at hotels a workable fireescape in the form of notched cable or a canvas shoot he would have availed himself of it as a proofwell of his present delicacy  he nursed that sentiment as the question stood a little in vain and evenat the end of he scarce knew once more how longfound it as by the action on his mind of the failure of response of the outer world sinking back to vague anguish  it seemed to him he had waited an age for some stir of the great grim hush the life of the town was itself under a spellso unnaturally up and down the whole prospect of known and rather ugly objects the blankness and the silence lasted  had they ever he asked himself the hardfaced houses which had begun to look livid in the dim dawn had they ever spoken so little to any need of his spirit  great builded voids great crowded stillnesses put on often in the heart of cities for the small hours a sort of sinister mask and it was of this large collective negation that brydon presently became consciousall the more that the break of day was almost incredibly now at hand proving to him what a night he had made of it  he looked again at his watch saw what had become of his timevalues he had taken hours for minutesnot as in other tense situations minutes for hours and the strange air of the streets was but the weak the sullen flush of a dawn in which everything was still locked up  his choked appeal from his own open window had been the sole note of life and he could but break off at last as for a worse despair  yet while so deeply demoralised he was capable again of an impulse denotingat least by his present measureextraordinary resolution of retracing his steps to the spot where he had turned cold with the extinction of his last pulse of doubt as to there being in the place another presence than his own  this required an effort strong enough to sicken him but he had his reason which overmastered for the moment everything else  there was the whole of the rest of the house to traverse and how should he screw himself to that if the door he had seen closed were at present open  he could hold to the idea that the closing had practically been for him an act of mercy a chance offered him to descend depart get off the ground and never again profane it  this conception held together it worked but what it meant for him depended now clearly on the amount of forbearance his recent action or rather his recent inaction had engendered  the image of the presence whatever it was waiting there for him to gothis image had not yet been so concrete for his nerves as when he stopped short of the point at which certainty would have come to him  for with all his resolution or more exactly with all his dread he did stop shorthe hung back from really seeing  the risk was too great and his fear too definite it took at this moment an awful specific form  he knewyes as he had never known anythingthat should he see the door open it would all too abjectly be the end of him  it would mean that the agent of his shamefor his shame was the deep abjectionwas once more at large and in general possession and what glared him thus in the face was the act that this would determine for him  it would send him straight about to the window he had left open and by that window be long ladder and dangling rope as absent as they would he saw himself uncontrollably insanely fatally take his way to the street  the hideous chance of this he at least could avert but he could only avert it by recoiling in time from assurance  he had the whole house to deal with this fact was still there only he now knew that uncertainty alone could start him  he stole back from where he had checked himselfmerely to do so was suddenly like safetyand making blindly for the greater staircase left gaping rooms and sounding passages behind  here was the top of the stairs with a fine large dim descent and three spacious landings to mark off  his instinct was all for mildness but his feet were harsh on the floors and strangely when he had in a couple of minutes become aware of this it counted somehow for help  he couldnt have spoken the tone of his voice would have scared him and the common conceit or resource of whistling in the dark whether literally or figuratively have appeared basely vulgar yet he liked none the less to hear himself go and when he had reached his first landingtaking it all with no rush but quite steadilythat stage of success drew from him a gasp of relief  the house withal seemed immense the scale of space again inordinate the open rooms to no one of which his eyes deflected gloomed in their shuttered state like mouths of caverns only the high skylight that formed the crown of the deep well created for him a medium in which he could advance but which might have been for queerness of colour some watery underworld  he tried to think of something noble as that his property was really grand a splendid possession but this nobleness took the form too of the clear delight with which he was finally to sacrifice it  they might come in now the builders the destroyersthey might come as soon as they would  at the end of two flights he had dropped to another zone and from the middle of the third with only one more left he recognised the influence of the lower windows of halfdrawn blinds of the occasional gleam of streetlamps of the glazed spaces of the vestibule  this was the bottom of the sea which showed an illumination of its own and which he even saw pavedwhen at a given moment he drew up to sink a long look over the banisterswith the marble squares of his childhood  by that time indubitably he felt as he might have said in a commoner cause better it had allowed him to stop and draw breath and the case increased with the sight of the old blackandwhite slabs  but what he most felt was that now surely with the element of impunity pulling him as by hard firm hands the case was settled for what he might have seen above had he dared that last look  the closed door blessedly remote now was still closedand he had only in short to reach that of the house  he came down further he crossed the passage forming the access to the last flight and if here again he stopped an instant it was almost for the sharpness of the thrill of assured escape  it made him shut his eyeswhich opened again to the straight slope of the remainder of the stairs  here was impunity still but impunity almost excessive inasmuch as the sidelights and the high fantracery of the entrance were glimmering straight into the hall an appearance produced he the next instant saw by the fact that the vestibule gaped wide that the hinged halves of the inner door had been thrown far back  out of that again the question sprang at him making his eyes as he felt halfstart from his head as they had done at the top of the house before the sign of the other door  if he had left that one open hadnt he left this one closed and wasnt he now in most immediate presence of some inconceivable occult activity  it was as sharp the question as a knife in his side but the answer hung fire still and seemed to lose itself in the vague darkness to which the thin admitted dawn glimmering archwise over the whole outer door made a semicircular margin a cold silvery nimbus that seemed to play a little as he lookedto shift and expand and contract  it was as if there had been something within it protected by indistinctness and corresponding in extent with the opaque surface behind the painted panels of the last barrier to his escape of which the key was in his pocket  the indistinctness mocked him even while he stared affected him as somehow shrouding or challenging certitude so that after faltering an instant on his step he let himself go with the sense that here was at last something to meet to touch to take to knowsomething all unnatural and dreadful but to advance upon which was the condition for him either of liberation or of supreme defeat  the penumbra dense and dark was the virtual screen of a figure which stood in it as still as some image erect in a niche or as some blackvizored sentinel guarding a treasure  brydon was to know afterwards was to recall and make out the particular thing he had believed during the rest of his descent  he saw in its great grey glimmering margin the central vagueness diminish and he felt it to be taking the very form toward which for so many days the passion of his curiosity had yearned  it gloomed it loomed it was something it was somebody the prodigy of a personal presence  rigid and conscious spectral yet human a man of his own substance and stature waited there to measure himself with his power to dismay  this only could it bethis only till he recognised with his advance that what made the face dim was the pair of raised hands that covered it and in which so far from being offered in defiance it was buried as for dark deprecation  so brydon before him took him in with every fact of him now in the higher light hard and acutehis planted stillness his vivid truth his grizzled bent head and white masking hands his queer actuality of eveningdress of dangling double eyeglass of gleaming silk lappet and white linen of pearl button and gold watchguard and polished shoe  no portrait by a great modern master could have presented him with more intensity thrust him out of his frame with more art as if there had been treatment of the consummate sort in his every shade and salience  the revulsion for our friend had become before he knew it immensethis drop in the act of apprehension to the sense of his adversarys inscrutable manoeuvre  that meaning at least while he gaped it offered him for he could but gape at his other self in this other anguish gape as a proof that he standing there for the achieved the enjoyed the triumphant life couldnt be faced in his triumph  wasnt the proof in the splendid covering hands strong and completely spreadso spread and so intentional that in spite of a special verity that surpassed every other the fact that one of these hands had lost two fingers which were reduced to stumps as if accidentally shot away the face was effectually guarded and saved  saved though would it bebrydon breathed his wonder till the very impunity of his attitude and the very insistence of his eyes produced as he felt a sudden stir which showed the next instant as a deeper portent while the head raised itself the betrayal of a braver purpose  the hands as he looked began to move to open then as if deciding in a flash dropped from the face and left it uncovered and presented  horror with the sight had leaped into brydons throat gasping there in a sound he couldnt utter for the bared identity was too hideous as his and his glare was the passion of his protest  the face that face spencer brydonshe searched it still but looking away from it in dismay and denial falling straight from his height of sublimity  it was unknown inconceivable awful disconnected from any possibilityhe had been sold he inwardly moaned stalking such game as this the presence before him was a presence the horror within him a horror but the waste of his nights had been only grotesque and the success of his adventure an irony  such an identity fitted his at no point made its alternative monstrous  a thousand times yes as it came upon him nearer now the face was the face of a stranger  it came upon him nearer now quite as one of those expanding fantastic images projected by the magic lantern of childhood for the stranger whoever he might be evil odious blatant vulgar had advanced as for aggression and he knew himself give ground then harder pressed still sick with the force of his shock and falling back as under the hot breath and the roused passion of a life larger than his own a rage of personality before which his own collapsed he felt the whole vision turn to darkness and his very feet give way  his head went round he was going he had gone     chapter iii   what had next brought him back clearlythough after how longwas mrs muldoons voice coming to him from quite near from so near that he seemed presently to see her as kneeling on the ground before him while he lay looking up at her himself not wholly on the ground but halfraised and upheldconscious yes of tenderness of support and more particularly of a head pillowed in extraordinary softness and faintly refreshing fragrance  he considered he wondered his wit but half at his service then another face intervened bending more directly over him and he finally knew that alice staverton had made her lap an ample and perfect cushion to him and that she had to this end seated herself on the lowest degree of the staircase the rest of his long person remaining stretched on his old blackandwhite slabs  they were cold these marble squares of his youth but he somehow was not in this rich return of consciousnessthe most wonderful hour little by little that he had ever known leaving him as it did so gratefully so abysmally passive and yet as with a treasure of intelligence waiting all round him for quiet appropriation dissolved he might call it in the air of the place and producing the golden glow of a late autumn afternoon  he had come back yescome back from further away than any man but himself had ever travelled but it was strange how with this sense what he had come back to seemed really the great thing and as if his prodigious journey had been all for the sake of it  slowly but surely his consciousness grew his vision of his state thus completing itself he had been miraculously carried backlifted and carefully borne as from where he had been picked up the uttermost end of an interminable grey passage even with this he was suffered to rest and what had now brought him to knowledge was the break in the long mild motion  it had brought him to knowledge to knowledgeyes this was the beauty of his state which came to resemble more and more that of a man who has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance and then after dreaming it away after profaning it with matters strange to it has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie and watch it grow  this was the drift of his patiencethat he had only to let it shine on him  he must moreover with intermissions still have been lifted and borne since why and how else should he have known himself later on with the afternoon glow intenser no longer at the foot of his stairssituated as these now seemed at that dark other end of his tunnelbut on a deep windowbench of his high saloon over which had been spread couchfashion a mantle of soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth  mrs muldoons face had gone but the other the second he had recognised hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped and pillowed  he took it all in and the more he took it the more it seemed to suffice he was as much at peace as if he had had food and drink  it was the two women who had found him on mrs muldoons having plied at her usual hour her latchkeyand on her having above all arrived while miss staverton still lingered near the house  she had been turning away all anxiety from worrying the vain bellhandleher calculation having been of the hour of the good womans visit but the latter blessedly had come up while she was still there and they had entered together  he had then lain beyond the vestibule very much as he was lying nowquite that is as he appeared to have fallen but all so wondrously without bruise or gash only in a depth of stupor  what he most took in however at present with the steadier clearance was that alice staverton had for a long unspeakable moment not doubted he was dead  it must have been that i was  he made it out as she held him  yesi can only have died  you brought me literally to life  only he wondered his eyes rising to her only in the name of all the benedictions how  it took her but an instant to bend her face and kiss him and something in the manner of it and in the way her hands clasped and locked his head while he felt the cool charity and virtue of her lips something in all this beatitude somehow answered everything  and now i keep you she said  oh keep me keep me he pleaded while her face still hung over him in response to which it dropped again and stayed close clingingly close  it was the seal of their situationof which he tasted the impress for a long blissful moment in silence  but he came back  yet how did you know  i was uneasy  you were to have come you rememberand you had sent no word  yes i rememberi was to have gone to you at one today  it caught on to their old life and relationwhich were so near and so far  i was still out there in my strange darknesswhere was it what was it  i must have stayed there so long  he could but wonder at the depth and the duration of his swoon  since last night she asked with a shade of fear for her possible indiscretion  since this morningit must have been the cold dim dawn of today where have i been he vaguely wailed where have i been  he felt her hold him close and it was as if this helped him now to make in all security his mild moan  what a long dark day  all in her tenderness she had waited a moment  in the cold dim dawn she quavered  but he had already gone on piecing together the parts of the whole prodigy  as i didnt turn up you came straight  she barely cast about  i went first to your hotelwhere they told me of your absence  you had dined out last evening and hadnt been back since  but they appeared to know you had been at your club  so you had the idea of this  of what she asked in a moment  wellof what has happened  i believed at least youd have been here  ive known all along she said that youve been coming  known it  well ive believed it  i said nothing to you after that talk we had a month agobut i felt sure  i knew you would she declared  that id persist you mean  that youd see him  ah but i didnt cried brydon with his long wail  theres somebodyan awful beast whom i brought too horribly to bay  but its not me  at this she bent over him again and her eyes were in his eyes  noits not you  and it was as if while her face hovered he might have made out in it hadnt it been so near some particular meaning blurred by a smile  no thank heaven she repeated its not you  of course it wasnt to have been  ah but it was he gently insisted  and he stared before him now as he had been staring for so many weeks  i was to have known myself  you couldnt she returned consolingly  and then reverting and as if to account further for what she had herself done but it wasnt only that that you hadnt been at home she went on  i waited till the hour at which we had found mrs muldoon that day of my going with you and she arrived as ive told you while failing to bring any one to the door i lingered in my despair on the steps  after a little if she hadnt come by such a mercy i should have found means to hunt her up but it wasnt said alice staverton as if once more with her fine intentionsit wasnt only that  his eyes as he lay turned back to her  what more then  she met it the wonder she had stirred  in the cold dim dawn you say well in the cold dim dawn of this morning i too saw you  saw me  saw him said alice staverton  it must have been at the same moment  he lay an instant taking it inas if he wished to be quite reasonable at the same moment  yesin my dream again the same one ive named to you  he came back to me  then i knew it for a sign  he had come to you  at this brydon raised himself he had to see her better  she helped him when she understood his movement and he sat up steadying himself beside her there on the windowbench and with his right hand grasping her left he didnt come to me  you came to yourself she beautifully smiled  ah ive come to myself nowthanks to you dearest  but this brute with his awful facethis brutes a black stranger  hes none of me even as i might have been brydon sturdily declared  but she kept the clearness that was like the breath of infallibility isnt the whole point that youd have been different  he almost scowled for it  as different as that  her look again was more beautiful to him than the things of this world havent you exactly wanted to know how different  so this morning she said you appeared to me  like him  a black stranger  then how did you know it was i  because as i told you weeks ago my mind my imagination has worked so over what you might what you mightnt have beento show you you see how ive thought of you  in the midst of that you came to methat my wonder might be answered  so i knew she went on and believed that since the question held you too so fast as you told me that day you too would see for yourself  and when this morning i again saw i knew it would be because you hadand also then from the first moment because you somehow wanted me  he seemed to tell me of that  so why she strangely smiled shouldnt i like him  it brought spencer brydon to his feet  you like that horror  i could have liked him  and to me she said he was no horror  i had accepted him  accepted brydon oddly sounded  before for the interest of his differenceyes  and as i didnt disown him as i knew himwhich you at last confronted with him in his difference so cruelly didnt my dearwell he must have been you see less dreadful to me  and it may have pleased him that i pitied him  she was beside him on her feet but still holding his handstill with her arm supporting him  but though it all brought for him thus a dim light you pitied him he grudgingly resentfully asked  he has been unhappy he has been ravaged she said  and havent i been unhappy  am not iyouve only to look at meravaged  ah i dont say i like him better she granted after a thought  but hes grim hes wornand things have happened to him  he doesnt make shift for sight with your charming monocle  noit struck brydon i couldnt have sported mine downtown  theyd have guyed me there  his great convex pincenezi saw it i recognised the kindis for his poor ruined sight  and his poor right hand  ah brydon wincedwhether for his proved identity or for his lost fingers  then he has a million a year he lucidly added  but he hasnt you  and he isntno he isntyou she murmured as he drew her to his breast
