49889102	odd craft  by ww jacobs    admiral peters  mr george burton naval pensioner sat at the door of his lodgings gazing in placid content at the sea  it was early summer and the air was heavy with the scent of flowers mr burtons pipe was cold and empty and his pouch upstairs  he shook his head gently as he realised this and yielding to the drowsy quiet of his surroundings laid aside the useless pipe and fell into a doze  illustration sat at the door of his lodgings gazing in placid content at the sea  he was awakened half an hour later by the sound of footsteps  a tall strongly built man was approaching from the direction of the town and mr burton as he gazed at him sleepily began to wonder where he had seen him before  even when the stranger stopped and stood smiling down at him his memory proved unequal to the occasion and he sat staring at the handsome shaven face with its little fringe of grey whisker waiting for enlightenment  george my buck said the stranger giving him a hearty slap on the shoulder how goes it  d bless my eyes i mean said mr burton correcting himself if it aint joe stiles  i didnt know you without your beard  thats me said the other  its quite by accident i heard where you were living george i offered to go and sling my hammock with old dingle for a week or two and he told me  nice quiet little place seacombe ah you were lucky to get your pension george  i deserved it said mr burton sharply as he fancied he detected something ambiguous in his friends remark  of course you did said mr stiles so did i but i didnt get it well its a poor heart that never rejoices  what about that drink you were speaking of george  i hardly ever touch anything now replied his friend  i was thinking about myself said mr stiles  i cant bear the stuff but the doctor says i must have it  you know what doctors are george  mr burton did not deign to reply but led the way indoors  very comfortable quarters george remarked mr stiles gazing round the room approvingly shipshape and tidy  im glad i met old dingle why i might never ha seen you again and us such pals too  his host grunted and from the back of a small cupboard produced a bottle of whisky and a glass and set them on the table  after a momentary hesitation he found another glass  our noble selves said mr stiles with a tinge of reproach in his tones and may we never forget old friendships  mr burton drank the toast  i hardly know what its like now joe he said slowly  you wouldnt believe how soon you can lose the taste for it  mr stiles said he would take his word for it  youve got some nice little publichouses about here too he remarked  theres one i passed called the cock and flowerpot nice cosy little place it would be to spend the evening in  i never go there said mr burton hastily  ia friend o mine here doesnt approve o publicouses  whats the matter with him  inquired his friend anxiously  itsits a er said mr burton in some confusion  mr stiles threw himself back in his chair and eyed him with amazement then recovering his presence of mind he reached out his hand for the bottle  well drink her health he said in a deep voice  whats her name  mrs dutton was the reply  mr stiles with one hand on his heart toasted her feelingly then filling up again he drank to the happy couple  shes very strict about drink said mr burton eyeing these proceedings with some severity  anydibs  inquired mr stiles slapping a pocket which failed to ring in response  shes comfortable replied the other awkwardly  got a little stationers shop in the town steady oldfashioned business  shes chapel and very strict  just what you want remarked mr stiles placing his glass on the table  what dye say to a stroll  mr burton assented and having replaced the black bottle in the cupboard led the way along the cliffs toward the town some halfmile distant mr stiles beguiling the way by narrating his adventures since they had last met  a certain swagger and richness of deportment were explained by his statement that he had been on the stage  only walking on he said with a shake of his head  the only speaking part i ever had was a cough  you ought to ha heard that cough george  mr burton politely voiced his regrets and watched him anxiously  mr stiles shaking his head over a somewhat unsuccessful career was making a beeline for the cock and flowerpot  just for a small soda he explained and once inside changed his mind and had whisky instead  mr burton sacrificing principle to friendship had one with him  the bar more than fulfilled mr stiless ideas as to its cosiness and within the space of ten minutes he was on excellent terms with the regular clients  into the little oldworld bar with its loudticking clock its windsorchairs and its cracked jug full of roses he brought a breath of the bustle of the great city and tales of the great cities beyond the seas  refreshment was forced upon him and mr burton pleased at his friends success shared mildly in his reception  it was nine oclock before they departed and then they only left to please the landlord  nice lot o chaps said mr stiles as he stumbled out into the sweet cool air  catch holdo myarm george  brace meup a bit  mr burton complied and his friend reassured as to his footing burst into song  in a stentorian voice he sang the latest song from comic opera and then with an adjuration to mr burton to see what he was about and not to let him trip he began in a lumbering fashion to dance  mr burton still propping him up trod a measure with fewer steps and cast uneasy glances up the lonely road  on their left the sea broke quietly on the beach below on their right were one or two scattered cottages at the doors of which an occasional figure appeared to gaze in mute astonishment at the proceedings  dance george said mr stiles who found his friend rather an encumbrance  hsh  stop cried the frantic mr burton as he caught sight of a womans figure bidding farewell in a lighted doorway  mr stiles replied with a stentorian roar and mr burton clinging despairingly to his jigging friend lest a worse thing should happen cast an imploring glance at mrs dutton as they danced by  the evening was still light enough for him to see her face and he piloted the corybantic mr stiles the rest of the way home in a mood which accorded but ill with his steps  his manner at breakfast next morning was so offensive that mr stiles who had risen fresh as a daisy and been out to inhale the air on the cliffs was somewhat offended  you go down and see her he said anxiously  dont lose a moment and explain to her that it was the seaair acting on an old sunstroke  she aint a fool said mr burton gloomily  he finished his breakfast in silence and leaving the repentant mr stiles sitting in the doorway with a pipe went down to the widows to make the best explanation he could think of on the way  mrs duttons freshcoloured face changed as he entered the shop and her still good eyes regarded him with scornful interrogation  isaw you last night began mr burton timidly  i saw you too said mrs dutton  i couldnt believe my eyesight at first  it was an old shipmate of mine said mr burton  he hadnt seen me for years and i suppose the sight of me upset im  i dare say replied the widow that and the cock and flowerpot too i heard about it  he would go said the unfortunate  you neednt have gone was the reply  i ad to said mr burton with a gulp hehes an old officer o mine and it wouldnt ha been discipline for me to refuse  officer  repeated mrs dutton  my old admiral said mr burton with a gulp that nearly choked him youve heard me speak of admiral peters  admiral  gasped the astonished widow  what acarrying on like that  hes a reglar old seadog said mr burton  hes staying with me but of course e dont want it known who he is  i couldnt refuse to ave a drink with im  i was under orders so to speak  no i suppose not said mrs dutton softening  fancy him staying with you  he just run down for the night but i expect hell be going ome in an hour or two said mr burton who saw an excellent reason now for hastening his guests departure  mrs duttons face fell  dear me she murmured i should have liked to have seen him you have told me so much about him  if he doesnt go quite so soon and you would like to bring him here when you come tonight im sure i should be very pleased  ill mention it to im said mr burton marvelling at the change in her manner  didnt you say once that he was uncle to lord buckfast inquired mrs dutton casually  yes said mr burton with unnecessary doggedness i did  the idea of an admiral staying with you said mrs dutton  reglar old seadog said mr burton again and besides he dont want it known  its a secret between us three mrs dutton  to be sure said the widow  you can tell the admiral that i shall not mention it to a soul she added mincingly  mr burton thanked her and withdrew lest mr stiles should follow him up before apprised of his sudden promotion  he found that gentleman however still sitting at the front door smoking serenely  ill stay with you for a week or two said mr stiles briskly as soon as the other had told his story  itll do you a world o good to be seen on friendly terms with an admiral and ill put in a good word for you  mr burton shook his head  no she might find out he said slowly i think that the best thing is for you to go home after dinner joe and just give er a look in on the way praps  you could say a lot o things about me in arf an hour  no george said mr stiles beaming on him kindly when i put my hand to the plough i dont draw back  its a good speaking part too an admirals  i wonder whether i might use old peterss language  certainly not said mr burton in alarm  you dont know how particular she is  mr stiles sighed and said that he would do the best he could without it  he spent most of the day on the beach smoking and when evening came shaved himself with extreme care and brushed his serge suit with great perseverance in preparation for his visit  mr burton performed the ceremony of introduction with some awkwardness mr stiles was affecting a stateliness of manner which was not without distinction and mrs dutton in a black silk dress and the cameo brooch which had belonged to her mother was no less important  mr burton had an odd feeling of inferiority  illustration mr stiles was affecting a stateliness of manner which was not without distinction  its a very small place to ask you to admiral peters said the widow offering him a chair  its comfortable maam said mr stiles looking round approvingly ah you should see some of the palaces ive been in abroad all show and no comfort  not a decent chair in the place  and as for the antimacassars  are you making a long stay admiral peters  inquired the delighted widow  it depends was the reply  my intention was just to pay a flying visit to my honest old friend burton herebest man in my squadronbut he is so hospitable hes been pressing me to stay for a few weeks  but the admiral says he must get back tomorrow morning interposed mr burton firmly  unless i have a letter at breakfasttime burton said mr stiles serenely  mr burton favoured him with a mutinous scowl  oh i do hope you will said mrs dutton  i have a feeling that i shall said mr stiles crossing glances with his friend  the only thing is my people they want me to join them at lord tuftons place  mrs dutton trembled with delight at being in the company of a man with such friends  what a change shorelife must be to you after the perils of the sea she murmured  ah said mr stiles  true  true  the dreadful fighting said mrs dutton closing her eyes and shuddering  you get used to it said the hero simply  hottest time i had i think was at the bombardment of alexandria  i stood alone  all the men who hadnt been shot down had fled and the shells were bursting round me likelike fireworks  the widow clasped her hands and shuddered again  i was standing just behind im waiting any orders he might give said mr burton  were you said mr stiles sharplywere you  i dont remember it burton  why said mr burton with a faint laugh i was just behind you sir if you remember sir i said to you that it was pretty hot work  mr stiles affected to consider  no burton he said blufflyno so far as my memory goes i was the only man there  a bit of a shell knocked my cap off sir persisted mr burton making laudable efforts to keep his temper  thatll do my man said the other sharply not another word  you forget yourself  he turned to the widow and began to chat about his people again to divert her attention from mr burton who seemed likely to cause unpleasantness by either bursting a bloodvessel or falling into a fit  my people have heard of burton he said with a slight glance to see how that injured gentleman was progressing  he has often shared my dangers  we have been in many tight places together  do you remember those two nights when we were hidden in the chimney at the palace of the sultan of zanzibar burton  i should think i do said mr burton recovering somewhat  stuck so tight we could hardly breathe continued the other  i shall never forget it as long as i live said mr burton who thought that the other was trying to make amends for his recent indiscretion  oh do tell me about it admiral peters cried mrs dutton  surely burton has told you that  said mr stiles  never breathed a word of it said the widow gazing somewhat reproachfully at the discomfited mr burton  well tell it now burton said mr stiles  you tell it better than i do sir said the other  no no said mr stiles whose powers of invention were not always to be relied upon  you tell it its your story  the widow looked from one to the other  its your story sir said mr burton  no i wont tell it said mr stiles  it wouldnt be fair to you burton  id forgotten that when i spoke  of course you were young at the time still  i done nothing that im ashamed of sir said mr burton trembling with passion  i think its very hard if im not to hear it said mrs dutton with her most fascinating air  mr stiles gave her a significant glance and screwing up his lips nodded in the direction of mr burton  at any rate you were in the chimney with me sir said that unfortunate  ah said the other severely  but what was i there for my man  mr burton could not tell him he could only stare at him in a frenzy of passion and dismay  what were you there for admiral peters  inquired mrs dutton  i was there maam said the unspeakable mr stiles slowlyi was there to save the life of burton  i never deserted my mennever whatever scrapes they got into i always did my best to get them out news was brought to me that burton was suffocating in the chimney of the sultans favourite wife and i  sultans favourite wife  gasped mrs dutton staring hard at mr burton who had collapsed in his chair and was regarding the ingenious mr stiles with openmouthed stupefaction  good gracious  ii never heard of such a thing  i am surprised  so am i said mr burton thickly  ii  how did you escape admiral peters  inquired the widow turning from the flighty burton in indignation  mr stiles shook his head  to tell you that would be to bring the french consul into it he said gently  i oughtnt to have mentioned the subject at all  burton had the good sense not to  the widow murmured acquiescence and stole a look at the prosaic figure of the latter gentleman which was full of scornful curiosity  with some diffidence she invited the admiral to stay to supper and was obviously delighted when he accepted  in the character of admiral mr stiles enjoyed himself amazingly his one regret being that no discriminating theatrical manager was present to witness his performance  his dignity increased as the evening wore on and from goodnatured patronage of the unfortunate burton he progressed gradually until he was shouting at him  once when he had occasion to ask mr burton if he intended to contradict him his appearance was so terrible that his hostess turned pale and trembled with excitement  mr burton adopted the air for his own use as soon as they were clear of mrs duttons doorstep and in good round terms demanded of mr stiles what he meant by it  it was a difficult part to play george responded his friend  we ought to have rehearsed it a bit  i did the best i could  best you could  stormed mr burton  telling lies and ordering me about  i had to play the part without any preparation george said the other firmly  you got yourself into the difficulty by saying that i was the admiral in the first place  ill do better next time we go  mr burton with a nasty scowl said that there was not going to be any next time but mr stiles smiled as one having superior information deaf first to hints and then to requests to seek his pleasure elsewhere he stayed on and mr burton was soon brought to realise the difficulties which beset the path of the untruthful  the very next visit introduced a fresh complication it being evident to the most indifferent spectator that mr stiles and the widow were getting on very friendly terms  glances of unmistakable tenderness passed between them and on the occasion of the third visit mr burton sat an amazed and scandalised spectator of a flirtation of the most pronounced description  a despairing attempt on his part to lead the conversation into safer and to his mind more becoming channels only increased his discomfiture  neither of them took any notice of it and a minute later mr stiles called the widow a saucy little baggage and said that she reminded him of the duchess of marford  illustration mr stiles called the widow a saucy little baggage  i used to think she was the most charming woman in england he said meaningly  mrs dutton simpered and looked down mr stiles moved his chair a little closer to her and then glanced thoughtfully at his friend  burton he said  sir snapped the other  run back and fetch my pipe for me said mr stiles  i left it on the mantelpiece  mr burton hesitated and the widow happening to look away shook his fist at his superior officer  look sharp said mr stiles in a peremptory voice  im very sorry sir said mr burton whose wits were being sharpened by misfortune but i broke it  broke it  repeated the other  yes sir said mr burton  i knocked it on the floor and trod on it by accident smashed it to powder  mr stiles rated him roundly for his carelessness and asked him whether he knew that it was a present from the italian ambassador  burton was always a clumsy man he said turning to the widow  he had the name for it when he was on the destruction with me bungling burton they called him  he divided the rest of the evening between flirting and recounting various anecdotes of mr burton none of which were at all flattering either to his intelligence or to his sobriety and the victim after one or two futile attempts at contradiction sat in helpless wrath as he saw the infatuation of the widow  they were barely clear of the house before his pentup emotions fell in an avalanche of words on the faithless mr stiles  i cant help being goodlooking said the latter with a smirk  your good looks wouldnt hurt anybody said mr burton in a grating voice its the admiral business that fetches her  its turned er head  mr stiles smiled  shell say snap to my snip any time he remarked  and remember george therell always be a knife and fork laid for you when you like to come  i dessay retorted mr burton with a dreadful sneer  only as it happens im going to tell er the truth about you first thing tomorrow morning  if i cant have er you shant  thatll spoil your chance too said mr stiles  shed never forgive you for fooling her like that  it seems a pity neither of us should get her  youre a sarpent exclaimed mr burton savagelya sarpent that ive warmed in my bosom and  theres no call to be indelicate george said mr stiles reprovingly as he paused at the door of the house  lets sit down and talk it over quietly  mr burton followed him into the room and taking a chair waited  its evident shes struck with me said mr stiles slowly its also evident that if you tell her the truth it might spoil my chances  i dont say it would but it might  that being so im agreeable to going back without seeing her again by the sixforty train tomorrow morning if its made worth my while  made worth your while  repeated the other  certainly said the unblushing mr stiles  shes not a badlooking womanfor her ageand its a snug little business  mr burton suppressing his choler affected to ponder  if arf a sovereign he said at last  half a fiddlestick said the other impatiently  i want ten pounds youve just drawn your pension and besides youve been a saving man all your life  ten pounds gasped the other  dye think ive got a goldmine in the back garden  mr stiles leaned back in his chair and crossed his feet  i dont go for a penny less he said firmly  ten pounds and my ticket back  if you call me any more o those names ill make it twelve  and what am i to explain to mrs dutton  demanded mr burton after a quarter of an hours altercation  anything you like said his generous friend  tell her im engaged to my cousin and our marriage keeps being put off and off on account of my eccentric behaviour  and you can say that that was caused by a splinter of a shell striking my head  tell any lies you like i shall never turn up again to contradict them  if she tries to find out things about the admiral remind her that she promised to keep his visit here secret  for over an hour mr burton sat weighing the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal and thenmr stiles refusing to seal the bargain withoutshook hands upon it and went off to bed in a state of mind hovering between homicide and lunacy  he was up in good time next morning and returning the shortest possible answers to the remarks of mr stiles who was in excellent feather went with him to the railway station to be certain of his departure  it was a delightful morning cool and bright and despite his misfortunes  mr burtons spirits began to rise as he thought of his approaching deliverance  gloom again overtook him at the bookingoffice where the unconscionable mr stiles insisted firmly upon a firstclass ticket  who ever heard of an admiral riding third  he demanded indignantly  but they dont know youre an admiral urged mr burton trying to humour him  no but i feel like one said mr stiles slapping his pocket  ive always felt curious to see what it feels like travelling firstclass besides you can tell mrs dutton  i could tell er that in any case returned mr burton  mr stiles looked shocked and time pressing mr burton breathing so hard that it impeded his utterance purchased a firstclass ticket and conducted him to the carriage  mr stiles took a seat by the window and lolling back put his foot up on the cushions opposite  a large bell rang and the carriagedoors were slammed  goodbye george said the traveller putting his head to the window ive enjoyed my visit very much  good riddance said mr burton savagely   illustration good riddance said mr burton savagely  mr stiles shook his head  im letting you off easy he said slowly if it hadnt ha been for one little thing id have had the widow myself  what little thing  demanded the other as the train began to glide slowly out  my wife said mr stiles as a huge smile spread slowly over his face goodbye george and dont forget to give my love when you go round
