90447507	away in the wilderness by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the hunter  on a beautiful summer evening not many years ago a man was seen to ascend the side of a little mound or hillock on the top of which he lingered to gaze upon the wild scenery that lay stretched out before him  the man wore the leathern coat and leggings of a north american hunter or trapper or backwoodsman and well did he deserve all these titles for jasper derry was known to his friends as the best hunter the most successful trapper and the boldest man in the backwoods  jasper was big and strong as well as bold but he was not a bully  men of true courage are in general peacefully disposed  jasper could fight like a lion when there was occasion to do so but he was gentle and grave and quiet by nature  he was also extremely goodhumoured had a low soft voice and both in mind and body seemed to delight in a state of repose  we have said that his coat was made of leather the moccasins or indian shoes on his feet were made of the same material  when jasper first put them on they were soft like a glove of chamois leather and bright yellow but hard service had turned them into a dirty brown which looked more business like  the sun had burned his face and hands to as deep a brown as his coat  on his head he wore a little round cap which he had made with his own hands after having caught the black fox that supplied the fur in one of his own traps  a coloured worsted belt bound his coat round his waist and beneath the coat he wore a scarlet flannel shirt  a long knife and a small hatchet were stuck in the belt at his back and in front hung a small cloth bag which was so thickly ornamented with beads of many colours that little of the cloth could be seen  this last was a firebagso called because it contained the flint steel and tinder required for making a fire  it also contained jaspers pipe and tobaccofor he smoked as a matter of course  men smoke everywheremores the pityand jasper followed the example of those around him  smoking was almost his only fault  he was a tremendous smoker  often when out of tobacco he had smoked tea frequently he had tried bark and dried leaves and once when hard pressed he had smoked oakum  he would rather have gone without his supper than without his pipe  a powderhorn and shot pouch were slung over his shoulders by two cross belts and he carried a long singlebarrelled gun  i have been thus particular in describing jasper derry because he is our hero and he is worth describing being a fine hearty handsome fellow who cared as little for a wild indian or a grizzly bear as he did for a butterfly and who was one of the best of companions as he was one of the best of hunters in the wilderness  having gained the top of the hillock jasper placed the butt of his long gun on the ground and crossing his hands over the muzzle stood there for some time so motionless that he might have been mistaken for a statue  a magnificent country was spread out before him  just in front lay a clear lake of about a mile in extent and the evening was so still that every tree stone and bush on its margin was reflected as in a mirror  here hundreds of wild ducks and wild geese were feeding among the sedges of the bays or flying to and fro mingling their cries with those of thousands of plover and other kinds of waterfowl that inhabited the place  at the lower end of this lake a small rivulet was seen to issue forth and wind its way through woods and plains like a silver thread until it was lost to view in the far distance  on the right and left and behind the earth was covered with the dense foliage of the wild woods  the hillock on which the western hunter stood lay in the very heart of that great uncultivated wilderness which forms part of the british possessions in north america  this region lies to the north of the canadas is nearly as large as all europe and goes by the name of the hudsons bay territory or ruperts land  it had taken jasper many long weeks of hard travel by land and water in canoes and on foot to get there and several weeks of toil still lay before him ere he could attain the object for which his journey had been undertaken  wicked people say that woman is at the bottom of all mischief  did it never occur to these same wicked individuals that woman is just as much at the bottom of all good  whether for good or for evil woman was at the bottom of jasper perrys heart and affairs  the cause of his journey was love the aim and end of it was marriage  did true love ever run smooth  no never says the proverb  we shall see    chapter two  the three friends  when the hunter had stood for full five minutes gazing at the beautiful scenery by which he was surrounded it suddenly occurred to him that a pipe would render him much more capable of enjoying it so he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree leaned his gun on it pulled the firebag from his belt and began to fill his pipe which was one of the kind used by the savages of the country with a stone head and a wooden stem it was soon lighted and jasper was thinking how much more clear and beautiful a landscape looked through tobacco smoke when a hand was laid lightly on his shoulder  looking quickly round he beheld a tall darkfaced indian standing by his side  jasper betrayed neither alarm nor surprise for the youth was his own comrade who had merely come to tell him that the canoe in which they had been travelling together and which had been slightly damaged was repaired and ready for service  why arrowhead you steal on me with the soft tread of a fox  my ears are not dull yet i did not hear your approach lad  a smile lighted up the countenance of the young indian for a moment as he listened to a compliment which gratified him much but the grave expression which was natural to him instantly returned as he said arrowhead has hunted in the rocky mountains where the men are treacherous he has learned to tread lightly there  no doubt ye had need to be always on the look out where there are such varmints but hereaway arrowhead there are no foes to fear and therefore no need to take yer friends by surprise  but yere proud o your gifts lad an i suppose its natural to like to show them off is the canoe ready  the indian replied by a nod  thats well lad it will be sundown in another hour an i would like to camp on the point of pines tonight so come along  hist exclaimed the indian pointing to a flock of geese which came into view at that moment  ah you come of a masterful race said jasper shaking his head gravely youre never content when yeve got enough but must always be killing gods creatures right and left for pure sport  havent we got one grey goose already for supper an thats enough for two men surely of course i make no account o the artist poor cratur for he eats next to nothin  howsever as your appetite may be sharper set than usual ive no objection to bring down another for ye  so saying the hunter and the indian crouched behind a bush and the former while he cocked his gun and examined the priming gave utterance to a series of cries so loud and discordant that any one who was ignorant of a hunters ways must have thought he was anxious to drive all the living creatures within six miles of him away in terror  jasper had no such wish however  he was merely imitating the cry of the wild geese  the birds which were at first so faroff that a rifleball could not have reached them no sooner heard the cry of their friends as they doubtless thought it than they turned out of their course and came gradually towards the bush where the two men lay hidden  the hunter did not cease to cry until the birds were within gunshot then he fixed his eye on one of the flock that seemed plump and fat the long barrel of the gun was quickly raised the geese discovered their mistake and the whole flock were thrown into wild confusion as they attempted to sheer off but it was too late  smoke and fire burst from the bush and an enormous grey goose fell with a heavy crash to the ground  what have you shot what have you shot cried a shrill and somewhat weak voice in the distance  in another moment the owner of the voice appeared running eagerly towards the two men  use your eyes john heywood an ye wont need to ask said jasper with a quiet smile as he carefully reloaded his gun  ah  i seea grey swanno surely it cannot be a goose said heywood turning the bird over and regarding it with astonishment why this is the biggest one i ever did see  whats yon in the water  deer i do believe cried jasper quickly drawing the small shot from his gun and putting in a ball instead come lads we shall have venison for supper tonight  that beast cant reach tother side so soon as we can  jasper leaped quickly down the hill and dashed through the bushes towards the spot where their canoe lay  he was closely followed by his companions and in less than two minutes they were darting across the lake in their little indian canoe which was made of birchbark and was so light that one man could carry it easily  while they are thus engaged i will introduce the reader to john heywood this individual was a youth of nineteen or twenty years of age who was by profession a painter of landscapes and animals  he was tall and slender in person with straight black hair a pale haggardlooking face an excitable nervous manner and an enthusiastic temperament being adventurous in his disposition he had left his fathers home in canada and entreated his friend jasper derry to take him along with him into the wilderness  at first jasper was very unwilling to agree to this request because the young artist was utterly ignorant of everything connected with a life in the woods and he could neither use a paddle nor a gun  but heywoods father had done him some service at a time when he was ill and in difficulties so as the youth was very anxious to go he resolved to repay this good turn of the father by doing a kindness to the son  heywood turned out but a poor backwoodsman but he proved to be a pleasant amusing companion and as jasper and the indian were quite sufficient for the management of the light canoe and the good gun of the former was more than sufficient to feed the party it mattered nothing to jasper that heywood spent most of his time seated in the middle of the canoe sketching the scenery as they went along  still less did it matter that heywood missed everything he fired at whether it was close at hand or far away  at first jasper was disposed to look upon his young companion as a poor useless creature and the indian regarded him with undisguised contempt but after they had been some time in his company the opinions of these two men of the woods changed for they found that the artist was wise and well informed on many subjects of which they were extremely ignorant and they beheld with deep admiration the beautiful and lifelike drawings and paintings which he produced in rapid succession  such was the romantic youth who had for the sake of seeing and painting the wilderness joined himself to these rough sons of the forest and who now sat in the centre of the canoe swaying his arms about and shouting with excitement as they quickly drew near to the swimming herd of deer  keep yourself still said jasper looking over his shoulder yell upset the canoe if ye go on like that  give me the axe give me the axe ill kill him cried heywood  take your pencil and draw him observed the hunter with a quiet laugh  now arrowhead two good strokes of the paddle will dothere so  as he spoke the canoe glanced up alongside of an affrighted deer and in the twinkling of an eye jaspers long knife was in its heart and the water was dyed with blood  this happened quite near to the opposite shore of the lake so that in little more than half an hour after it was killed the animal was cut up and packed and the canoe was again speeding towards the upper end of the lake where the party arrived just as night began to fling its dark mantle over the wilderness    chapter three  the encampment  camping out in the woods at night is truly a delightful thing and the pleasantest part of it perhaps is the lighting of the fire  light is agreeable to human eyes and cheering to the human heart  solomon knew and felt that when he penned the words a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun  and the rising of the sun is scarcely more grateful to the feelings than the lighting of a fire on a dark night so our friends thought and felt when the fire blazed up but they were too busy and too hungry at the time to think about the state of their feelings  the indian was hungry  a good fire had to be made before the venison could be roasted so he gave his whole attention to the felling of dry trees and cutting them up into logs for the fire  jasper was also hungry and a slight shower had wetted all the moss and withered grass so he had enough to do to strike fire with flint and steel catch a spark on a little piece of tinder and then blow and coax the spark into a flame  the artist was indeed free to indulge in a little meditation but he had stumbled in the dark on landing and bruised his shins so he could only sit down on a rock and rub them and feel miserable  but the fire soon caught branches were heaped up great logs were piled on forked tongues of flame began to leap up and lick the branches of the overhanging trees  the green leaves looked rich and warm the thick stems looked red and hot the faces and clothes of the men seemed as if about to catch fire as they moved about the encampment preparing supper in short the whole scene was so extremely comfortable in reality as well as in appearance that heywood forgot his bruised shins and began to rub his hands with delight  in a very short time three juicy venisonsteaks were steaming before the three travellers and in a much shorter time they had disappeared altogether and were replaced by three new ones  the mode of cooking was very simple  each steak was fixed on a piece of stick and set up before the fire to roast  when one side was ready the artist who seemed to have very little patience began to cut off pieces and eat them while the other side was cooking  to say truth men out in those regions have usually such good appetites that they are not particular as to the cooking of their food  quantity not quality is what they desire  they generally feel very much like the russian of whom it is said that he would be content to eat sawdust if only he got plenty of it  the steaks were washed down with tea  there is no other drink in ruperts land  the hudsons bay company found that spirits were so hurtful to the indians that they refused to send them into the country and at the present day there is no strong drink to be had for love or money over the length and breadth of their territories except at those places where other furtraders oppose them and oblige them in selfdefence to sell firewater as the indians call it  tea is the greatthe onlydrink in ruperts land  yes laugh as ye will ye lovers of gin and beer and whisky one who has tried it and has seen it tried by hundreds of stout stalwart men tells you that the teetotaller is the best man for real hard work  the three travellers drank their tea and smacked their lips and grinned at each other with great satisfaction  they could not have done more if it had been the best of brandy and they the jolliest of topers  but the height of their enjoyment was not reached until the pipes were lighted  it was quite a sight to see them smoke  jasper lay with his huge frame extended in front of the blaze puffing clouds of smoke thick enough to have shamed a small cannon  arrowhead rested his back on the stump of a tree stretched his feet towards the fire and allowed the smoke to roll slowly through his nostrils as well as out at his mouth so that it kept curling quietly round his nose and up his cheeks and into his eyes and through his hair in a most delightful manner at least so it would seem for his reddishbrown face beamed with happy contentment  young heywood did not smoke but he drew forth his sketchbook and sketched his two companions and in the practice of his beloved art i have no doubt he was happier than either  i wonder how many tradingposts the hudsons bay company has got said heywood as he went on with his work  hundreds of em said jasper pressing the redhot tobacco into the bowl of his pipe with the end of his little finger as slowly and coolly as if his flesh were fireproof  i dont know exactly how many theyve got  i doubt if anybody does but they have them all over the country  youve seen a little of the country now heywood well what you have seen is very much like what you will see as long as you choose to travel hereaway  you come to a small clearing in the forest with five or six log houses in it a stockade round it and a flagstaff in the middle of it five ten or fifteen men and a gentleman in charge thats a hudsons bay companys tradingpost  all round it lie the wild woods  go through the woods for two or three hundred miles and youll come to another such post or fort as we sometimes call em  thats how it is all the country over  although there are many of them the country is so uncommon big that they may be said to be few and far between  some are bigger and some are less  theres scarcely a settlement in the country worthy o the name of a village except red river  ah  red river exclaimed heywood ive heard much of that settlementhold steadyim drawing your nose just nowhave you been there jasper  that have i lad and a fine place it is extendin fifty miles or more along the river with fine fields and handsome houses and churches and missionaries and schools and what not but the rest of ruperts land is just what you have seen no roads no houses no cultivated fieldsnothing but lakes and rivers and woods and plains without end and a few indians here and there with plenty of wild beasts everywhere  these tradingposts are scattered here and there from the atlantic to the pacific and from canada to the frozen sea standin solitarylike in the midst of the wilderness as if they had dropped down from the clouds by mistake and didnt know exactly what to do with themselves  how long have de company lived inquired arrowhead turning suddenly to jasper  the stout hunter felt a little put out  ahem  i dont exactly know but it must have been a long time no doubt  oh i can tell you that cried heywood  you said jasper in surprise  ay the company was started nearly two hundred years ago by prince rupert who was the first governor and thats the reason the country came to be called ruperts land  you know its common name is the hudsons bay territory because it surrounds hudsons bay  why where did you learn that said jasper i thought i knowed amost everything about the company but i must confess i never knew that about prince rupert before  i learned it from books said the artist  books exclaimed jasper i never learned nothin from booksmores the pity  i git along well enough in the trappin and shootin way without em but im sorry i never learned to read  ah  ive a great opinion of booksso i have  the worthy hunter shook his head solemnly as he said this in a low voice more to himself than to his companions and he continued to mutter and shake his head for some minutes while he knocked the ashes out of his pipe  having refilled and relighted it he drew his blanket over his shoulder laid his head upon a tuft of grass and continued to smoke until he fell asleep and allowed the pipe to fall from his lips  the indian followed his example with this difference that he laid aside his pipe and drew the blanket over his head and under his feet and wrapped it round him in such a way that he resembled a man sewed up in a sack  heywood was thus compelled to shut his sketchbook so he also wrapped himself in his blanket and was soon sound asleep  the campfire gradually sank low  once or twice the end of a log fell sending up a bright flame and a shower of sparks which for a few seconds lighted up the scene again and revealed the three slumbering figures  but at last the fire died out altogether and left the encampment in such thick darkness that the sharpest eye would have failed to detect the presence of man in that distant part of the lone wilderness    chapter four  mosquitoescampfire talk  there is a certain fly in the american forests which is worthy of notice because it exercises a great influence over the happiness of man in those regions  this fly is found in many other parts of the world but it swarms in immense numbers in america particularly in the swampy districts of that continent and in the hot months of summer  it is called a mosquitopronounced moskeetoand it is perhaps the most tormenting the most persevering savage vicious little monster on the face of the earth  other flies go to sleep at night the mosquito never does  darkness puts down other fliesit seems to encourage the mosquito  day and night it persecutes man and beast and the only time of the twentyfour hours in which it seems to rest is about noon when the heat puts it down for a little  but this period of rest strengthens it for a renewal of war during the remainder of the day and night  in form the mosquito very much resembles the gnat but is somewhat larger  this instrument of torture is his nose which is quite as long as his body and sharper than the finest needle  being unable to rest because of the mosquitoes heywood resolved to have a chat  come jasper said he looking up into his companions grave countenance although we have been many weeks on this journey now you have not yet told me what has brought you here or what the end of your trip is going to be  ive come here ahunting said jasper with the look and tone of a man who did not wish to be questioned  nay now i know that is not the reason said heywood smiling you could have hunted much nearer home if you had been so minded and to as good purpose  come jasper you know im your friend and that i wish you well  let me hear what has brought you so far into the wilderness mayhap i can give you some good advice if you do  well lad i dont mind if i do  though for the matter of good advice i dont feel much in need of any just at this time  jasper shook the ashes out of his pipe and refilled it as he spoke then he shook his head once or twice and smiled as if his thoughts amused him  having lighted the pipe he stretched himself out in a more comfortable way before the blaze and said  well lad ill tell ye what it isits the old story the love of woman has brought me here  and a very good old story it is returned heywood with a look of interest  a poor miserable set of creatures we should be without that same love of woman  come jasper im glad to hear youre such a sensible fellow  i know something about that subject myself  theres a pretty blueeyed girl with golden hair down away in canada that heywood stopped short in his speech and sighed  come it aint a hopeless case is it said jasper with a look of sympathy  i rather fear it is but i hope not  ah what should we do without hope in this world  thats true observed jasper with much gravity we could not get on at all without hope  but come jasper said the artist lets hear about your affair and ill tell you about mine some other time  well there is not much to tell but ill give ye all thats of it you must know then that about two years ago i was in the service of the hudsons bay company at one o their outposts in the mckenzies river district  we had little to eat there and little to do and i felt so lonesome never seein a human bein except the four or five men at the fort an a few indians that i made up my mind to quit  i had no reason to complain o the company dye see  they always treated me handsomely and it was no fault o theirs that the livin in that district was poor and the post lonesome  well on my way down to lake winnipeg i fell in with a brigade o boats goin to the saskatchewan district and we camped together that night  one o the guides of the saskatchewan brigade had his daughter with him  the guide was a frenchcanadian and his wife had been a scotch halfcaste so what the daughter was is more than i can tell but i know what she looked like  she just looked like an angel  it wasnt so much that she was pretty but she was so sweet and so quiet lookin and so innocent  well to cut the matter short i fell in love at once dye know what it is heywood to fall in love at first sight  oh dont i replied the artist with sudden energy  an dye know continued jasper what it is to be falleninlovewith at first sight  well no im not so sure about that replied heywood sadly  i do then said jasper for that sweet critter fell in love with me right offthough what she saw in me to love has puzzled me much howsoever she did and for that im thankful  her name is marie laroche  she and i opened our minds to each other that night and i took the guide her father into the woods and told him i wanted his daughter and he was agreeable but he would not hear of my takin her away then and there  he told me i must go down to canada and get settled and when i had a house to put his daughter in i was to come back into the wilderness here and be married to her and then take her homeso here i am on my way to claim my bride  but theres one thing that puzzles me sorely  what is that asked heywood  ive never heard from marie from that day to this said jasper  that is strange replied the other but perhaps she cannot write  thats true  now you speak of it i do believe she cant write a line but then she might have got some one to write for her  did you leave your address with her  how could i when i had no address to leave  but did you ever send it to her  no i never thought of that said jasper opening his eyes very wide come thats a comfortthats a good reason for never havin heard from her  thankee lad for putting me up to it  and now as we must be up and away in another hour ill finish my nap  so saying jasper put out his pipe and once more drew his blanket over him  heywood followed his example and while he lay there gazing up at the stars through the trees he heard the worthy hunter muttering to himself thats it that accounts for my not hearin from her  a sigh followed the words very soon a snore followed the sigh and ere many minutes had passed away the encampment was again buried in darkness and repose    chapter five  journeying in the wilderness  it seemed to heywood that he had not been asleep more than five minutes when he was aroused by jasper laying his heavy hand on his shoulder  on rubbing his eyes and gazing round him he found that the first streak of dawn was visible in the eastern sky that the canoe was already in the water and that his companions were ready to embark  it is usually found that men are not disposed to talk at that early hour  heywood merely remarked that it was a fine morning to which jasper replied by a nod of his head  nothing more was said  the artist rolled up his blanket in a piece of oiledcloth collected his drawing materials and put them into their bag got into his place in the centre of the canoe and immediately went to sleep while jasper and the indian taking their places in the bow and stern dipped the paddles into the water and shot away from the shore  they looked mysterious and ghostly in the dim morning light and the whole scene around them looked mysterious and ghostly too for the water in the lake seemed black and the shores and islands looked like dark shadows and a pale thin mist rolled slowly over the surface of the water and hung overhead  no sound was heard except the light plash of the paddles as the two backwoodsmen urged their little canoe swiftly along  by degrees the light of day increased and jasper awakened heywood in order that he might behold the beautiful scenery through which they passed  they were now approaching the upper end of the lake in which there were innumerable islands of every shape and sizesome of them not more than a few yards in length while some were two or three hundred yards across but all were clothed with the most beautiful green foliage and shrubbery  as the pale yellow of the eastern sky began to grow red ducks and gulls bestirred themselves  early risers among them first began to chirp and scream and whistle their morning songfor there are lazy ones among the birds just as there are among men  sometimes when the canoe rounded a point of rocks a flock of geese were found floating peacefully among the sedges sound asleep with their heads under their wings  these would leap into the air and fly off in great alarm with much difficulty and tremendous splutter reminding one of the proverb the more haste the less speed  at other times they would come upon a flock of ducks so suddenly that they had no time to take wing so they dived instead and thus got out of the way  then the yellow hue of sunrise came a good while before the sun himself rose  the last of the bright stars were put out by the flood of light and multitudes of little birds on shore began to chirp their morning song and who can say that this was not a hymn of praise to god when in the holy bible itself in the 150th psalm we find it written let everything that hath breath praise the lord  at last the sun burst forth in all his golden glory  water earth and sky glowed as if they had been set on fire  what a blessed influence the sun has upon this world  it resembles the countenance of a loving father beaming in upon his family driving away clouds and diffusing warmth and joy  the birds were now all astir together insomuch that the air seemed alive with them  there are small white gulls with red legs and red beaks in those large inland lakes just as there are on the ocean these began to utter their sweet wild cries so powerfully that they almost drowned the noise of all the rest  yet the united chorus of the whole was not harsh  it was softened and mellowed by distance and fell on the ears of the two hunters as pleasantly as the finest music does in the ears of men trained to sweet sounds from infancy  not until the sun had ascended a considerable way on its course through the sky did jasper think it necessary to lay down his paddle  by that time the upper end of the lake had been reached and the hunter had run the canoe close to a ledge of flat rock and jumped ashore saying that it was time for breakfast  i had almost got to believe i was in paradise said heywood as he stepped ashore  i often think theres a good deal of the garden of eden still left in this world replied jasper as he carried the kettle up to the level part of the rock and began to kindle a fire while the indian as usual hewed the wood  if we could only make use of gods gifts instead of abusin them i do believe we might be very happy all our days  see there jasper is one of the birds i want so much to get hold of i want to make a drawing of him  would you object to spend a shot on such game  heywood pointed as he spoke to a grey bird about the size of a blackbird which sat on a branch close above his head  this creature is called by the furtraders a whiskyjohn and it is one of the most impudent little birds in the world  wherever you go throughout the country there you find whiskyjohns ready to receive and welcome you as if they were the owners of the soil  they are perfectly fearless they will come and sit on a branch within a yard of your hand when you are eating and look at you in the most inquisitive manner  if they could speak they could not say more plainly what have you got theregive me some  if you leave the mouth of your provision sack open they are sure to jump into it  when you are done eating they will scarcely let you six yards away before they make a dash at the crumbs and if you throw sticks or stones at them they will hop out of the way but they will not take to flight  it would be a pity to waste powder on them critters said jasper but ill catch one for you  as he said this he took a few crumbs of broken meat from the bottom of the provision sack and spread them on his right hand then he lay down under a bush covered his face with a few leaves and thrust out his hand  heywood and the indian retired a few paces and stood still to await the result  in a few seconds a whiskyjohn came flying towards the open hand and alighted on a branch within a yard of it  here he shook his feathers and looked very bold but suspicious for a few minutes turning first one eye towards the hand and then the other  after a little he hopped on a branch still nearer and seeing no motion in the hand he at last hopped upon the palm and began to peck the crumbs  instantly the fingers closed and jasper caught him by the toes whereupon the whiskyjohn began to scream furiously with rage and terror  but i am bound to say there was more of rage than of terror in his cry  jasper handed the passionate bird over to the artist who tried to make a portrait of him but he screamed and pecked so fiercely that heywood was obliged to let him go after making a rough sketch  breakfast was a repetition of the supper of the night before it was soon disposed of and the three travellers again set forth  this time jasper sang one of the beautiful canoe songs peculiar to that country and heywood and arrowhead both of whom had good voices joined in the chorus  they soon passed from the lake into the river by which it was fed  at first the current of this river was sluggish but as they ascended it became stronger and was broken here and there by rapids  the severe toil of travelling in the backwoods now began  to paddle on a level lake all day is easy enough for when you get tired you can lay down the paddle and rest  but in the river this is impossible because of the current  the only way to get a rest is to push the bow of the canoe ashore  it was a fine sight to see the movements of jasper and the indian when they came to the first rapid  heywood knew that he could be of no use so like a wise man he sat still and looked on  the rapid was a very strong one but there were no falls in it only a furious gush of water over the broken bed of the river where many large rocks rose up and caught the current hurling the water back in white foam  any one who knew not what these hunters could do would have laughed if you had told him they were about to ascend that rapid in such an eggshell of a canoe  they began by creeping up inshore as far as they could  then they dashed boldly out into the stream and the current whirled them down with lightning speed but suddenly the canoe came to a halt in the very middle of the stream  every rock in a rapid has a long tail of still water below it the canoe had got into one of these tails or eddies and there it rested securely  a few yards higher up there was another rock nearer to the opposite bank and the eddy which tailed off from it came down a little lower than the rock behind which the canoe now lay  there was a furious gush of water between them and this eddy but the men knew what the canoe could bear and their nerves were strong and steady across they went like a shot  they were swept down to the extreme point of the eddy but a few powerful strokes of the paddle sent them into it and next moment they were floating behind the second rock a few yards higher up the stream  thus they darted from rock to rock gaining a few yards at each dart until at last they swept into the smooth water at the head of the rapid  many a time was this repeated that day for rapids were numerous their progress was therefore slow  sometimes they came to parts of the river where the stream was very strong and deep but not broken by rocks so that they had no eddies to dart into  in such places arrowhead and heywood walked along the bank and hauled the canoe up by means of a line while jasper remained in it to steer  this was hard work for the banks in places were very steep in some parts composed of soft mud into which the men sank nearly up to their knees and in other places covered so thickly with bushes that it was almost impossible to force a path through them  jasper and the indian took the steeringpaddle by turns and when heywood required a rest he got into his place in the middle of the canoe but they never halted for more than a few minutes at a time  all day they paddled and dragged the canoe slowly up against the strong current and when night closed in they found they had advanced only three miles on their journey  the last obstacle they came to that day was a roaring waterfall about thirty feet high  here it might have been thought was an effectual check to them at last  nothing without wings could have gone up that waterfall which filled the woods with the thunder of its roar but the canoe had no wings so what was to be done  to one ignorant of the customs of that country going on would have seemed impossible but nothing can stop the advance of a backwoods voyager  if his canoe wont carry him he carries his canoe  jasper and his friends did so on the present occasion  they had reached what is called a portage or carryingplace and there are hundreds of such places all over ruperts land  on arriving at the foot of the fall heywood set off at once to a spot from which he could obtain a good view of it and sat down to sketch while his companions unloaded the canoe and lifted it out of the water then jasper collected together as much of the baggage as he could carry and clambered up the bank with it until he reached the still water at the top of the fall  here he laid it down and returned for another load  meanwhile arrowhead lifted the canoe with great ease placed it on his shoulders and bore it to the same place  when all had been carried up the canoe was launched into the quiet water a few hundred yards above the fall the baggage was replaced in it and the travellers were ready to continue their voyage  this whole operation is called making a portage  it took about an hour to make this portage  portages vary in length and in numbers  in some rivers they are few and far between in others they are so numerous that eight or twelve may have to be made in a day  many of the portages are not more than an eighth of a mile in length and are crossed for the purpose of avoiding a waterfall  some are four or five miles in extent for many long reaches in the rivers are so broken by falls and rapids that the voyagers find it their best plan to take canoes and baggage on their backs and cut across country for several miles thus they avoid rough places altogether  jasper delayed starting for half an hour in order to give heywood time to finish his sketch of the fall  it began to grow dark when they again embarked so after paddling up stream until a convenient place was found they put ashore and encamped within sight of another waterfall the roar of which softened by distance fell upon their ears all that night like the sound of pleasant music    chapter six  the outpost  on the morning of the second day after the events which i have described in the last chapter our three travellers arrived at one of the solitary outposts belonging to the furtraders  it stood on the banks of the river and consisted of four small houses made of logs  it covered about an acre of ground and its only defence was a wall of wooden posts about two inches apart which completely surrounded the buildings  this fort is a namesake of mine said jasper when they first sighted it they call it jaspers house  i spent a day at it when i was hereaway two years ago  who is in charge of it asked heywood  a gentleman named grant i believe replied jasper  that white painted house in the middle of the square is his  the other house on the right painted yellow is where the men live  mr grant has only got six men poor fellow to keep him company he seldom sees a new face here from one end of the year to the other  but he makes a trip once a year to the head post of the district with his furs and thats a sort of break to him  are there no women at the place inquired the artist  only two replied jasper  at least there were two when i was here last they were the wives of two of the men indian women they were with few brains and little or nothin to say but they were useful critters for all that for they could make coats and trousers and moccasins and mittens and they were firstrate cooks besides bein handy at almost every kind o work  they could even use the gun  ive heard o them bringin down a wild goose on the wing when none o the men were at hand to let drive at the passing flock  i do believe thats mr grant himself standin at the gate o the fort  jasper was right  the master of jaspers house a big heartylooking man of about fiveandforty was standing at the gate of his lonely residence leaning against one of the doorposts with his hands in his breeches pockets and a short pipe in his mouth  his summer employments had come to an endno indians had been near the place for many weeks and he happened to have nothing at that time to do but eat smoke and sleep which three occupations he usually attended to with much earnestness  mr grant did not observe the canoe approaching from below for at that time his attention was attracted to something up the river  suddenly he started took his pipe from his lips and bending forward listened with deep earnest attention  a faint murmur came floating down on the breeze sending a thrill of pleasure to the heart of the solitary man as well it might for a new face was a rare sight at jaspers house  at last a loud shout rang through the forest and five indian canoes swept round a point of rocks and came suddenly into view the men tossing their paddles in the air and sending rainbows of spray over their heads as they made for the landingplace  these were three or four families of indians who had come from a long hunting expedition laden with rich furs  their canoes though small and light could hold a wonderful quantity in the foremost sat a young savage with a darkbrown face glittering black eyes and stiff black hair hanging straight down all round his head except in front where it was cut short off just above the eyes in order to let his face appear  that fellows canoe besides himself carried his three wiveshe was a good hunter and could afford to have three  had he been a bad hunter he would have had to content himself poor fellow with one  the canoe also contained six or seven heavy packs of furs a haunch of venison six pairs of rabbits several ducks and geese a lump of bears meat two little boys and a girl a large tent made of deerskins four or five tin kettles two or three dirtylooking dogs and a gun several hatchets and a few blankets two babies and a dead beaver  in short there was almost no end to what that bark canoe could hold yet that indian with the stiff black hair could lift it off the ground when empty lay it on his shoulders and carry it for miles through the forest  the other canoes were much the same as this one  in a few minutes they were at the bank close under the fort and about the same time jasper and his friends leaped ashore and were heartily welcomed by mr grant who was glad enough to see indians but was overjoyed to meet with white men  glad to see you jasper cried mr grant shaking the hunter by the hand right glad to see you  it does good to a man to see an old friend like you turn up so unexpectedly  happy also to meet with you mr heywood  its a pleasure i dont often have to meet with a white stranger in this wilderness  pray come with me to the house  the furtrader turned to the indians and saying a few words to them in their own language led the way to his residence  meanwhile the indians had tossed everything out of the canoes upon the bank and the spot which had been so quiet and solitary half an hour before became a scene of the utmost animation and confusion  while the women were employed in erecting the tents the men strode up to the hall of reception where mr grant supplied them with tobacco and food to their hearts content  these natives who owing to the reddish coppercolour of their skins are called redmenwere dressed chiefly in clothes made of deerskin cut much in the same fashion as the garments worn by jasper derry  the women wore short gowns also made of leather and leggings of the same material but it was noticeable that the women had leggings more ornamented with gay beads than those of the men and they wore gaudy kerchiefs round their necks  these women were poor looking creatures however  they had a subdued humble look like dogs that are used to being kicked very different from the bold free bearing of the men  the reason of this was that they were treated by the men more as beasts of burden than companions women among the north american indians have a hard time of it poor creatures  while their lords and masters are out at the chase or idly smoking round the fire the indian women are employed in cutting firewood and drawing water  of course they do all the cooking and as the eating always continues so the cooking never stops  when these more severe labours are over they employ their time in making and ornamenting coats leggings and moccasinsand very beautiful work they can turn out of their hands  on the voyage the women use the paddle as well as the men and in journeying through the woods they always carry or drag the heaviest loads  for all this they get few thanks and often when the husbands become jealous they get severely beaten and kicked  it is always thus among savages and it would seem that just in proportion as men rise from the savage to the civilised state they treat their women better  it is certain that when man embraces the blessed gospel of christ and learns to follow the law of love he places woman not only on a level with himself but even above himself and seeks her comfort and happiness before he seeks his own  few of the redmen of north america are yet christians therefore they have no gallantry about themno generous and chivalrous feelings towards the weaker sex  most of their women are downtrodden and degraded  the first night at jaspers house was spent in smoking and talking here our friend jasper derry got news of marie  to his immense delight he learned that she was well and living with her father at fort erie near the plains or prairies as they are called on the saskatchewan river  a long journey still lay before our bold hunter but that was nothing to him  he felt quite satisfied to hear that the girl of his heart was well and still unmarried  next day the serious business of trading commenced at the outpost  i should like to get that powder and ball before you begin to trade with the indians mr grant said jasper after breakfast was concluded im anxious to be off as soon as possible  no no jasper ill not give you a single charge of powder or an ounce of lead this day  you must spend another night with me my man i have not had half my talk out with you  you have no need to hurry for marie does not know you are coming so of course she cant be impatient  mr grant said this with a laugh for he knew the state of jaspers heart and understood why he was so anxious to hasten away  besides continued the furtrader mr heywood has not half finished the drawing of my fort which he began yesterday and i want him to make me a copy of it  i shall be delighted to do so said the artist who was busily engaged in arranging his brushes and colours  well well cried jasper  i suppose i must submit  i fancy you have no objection to stop here another day arrowhead  the indian nodded gravely as he squatted down on the floor and began to fill his pipe  thats settled then said jasper so ill go with you to the store if youll allow me  with all my heart replied the furtrader who forthwith led the way to the store followed by the indians with their packs of furs  now the store or shop at a hudsons bay tradingpost is a most interesting and curious place  to the indian especially it is a sort of enchanted chamber out of which can be obtained everything known under the sun  as there can be only one shop or store at a tradingpost it follows that that shop must contain a few articles out of almost every other style of shop in the world  accordingly you will find collected within the four walls of that little room knives and guns from sheffield cotton webs from manchester grindstones from newcastle tobacco from virginia and every sort of thing from i know not where all  you can buy a blanket or a file an axe or a pair of trousers a pound of sugar or a barrel of nails a roll of tobacco or a tin kettleeverything in short that a man can think of or desire and you can buy it too without money  indeed you must buy it without money for there is not such a thing as money in the land  the trade is carried on entirely by barter or exchange  the indian gives the trader his furs and the trader gives him his goods  in order to make the exchange fair and equitable however everything is rated by a certain standard of value which is called a madebeaver in one part of the country a castore in another  the first man that stepped forward to the counter was a chief  a big coarselooking disagreeable man but a firstrate hunter  he had two wives in consequence of his abilities and the favourite wife now stood at his elbow to prompt perhaps to caution him  he threw down a huge pack of furs which the trader opened and examined with care fixing the price of each skin and marking it down with a piece of chalk on the counter as he went along  there were two splendid black bearskins two or three dozen martens or sables five or six black foxes and a great many silver foxes besides cross and red ones  in addition to these he had a number of minks and beaverskins a few otters and sundry other furs besides a few buffalo and deerskins dressed and with the hair scraped off  these last skins are used for making winter coats and also moccasins for the feet  after all had been examined and valued the whole was summed up and a number of pieces of stick were handed to the chiefeach stick representing a castore so that he knew exactly how much he was worth and proceeded to choose accordingly  first he gazed earnestly at a huge thick blanket then he counted his sticks and considered  perhaps the memory of the cold blasts of winter crossed his mind for he quickly asked how many castores it was worth the trader told him  the proper number of pieces of stick were laid down and the blanket was handed over  next a gun attracted his eye the guns sent out for the indian trade are very cheap ones with blue barrels and red stocks  they shoot pretty well but are rather apt to burst  indeed this fate had befallen the chiefs last gun so he resolved to have another and bought it  then he looked earnestly for some time at a tin kettle  boiled meat was evidently in his mind but at this point his squaw plucked him by the sleeve  she whispered in his ear  a touch of generosity seemed to come over him for he pointed to a web of bright scarlet cloth  a yard of this was measured off and handed to his spouse whose happiness for the moment was completefor squaws in ruperts land like the fair sex in england are uncommonly fond of finery  as the chief proceeded he became more cautious and slow in his choice finery tempted him on the one hand necessaries pressed him on the other and at this point the trader stepped in to help him to decide he recommended warned and advised  twine was to be got for nets and fishinglines powder and shot axes for cutting his winter firewood cloth for his own and his wifes leggings knives tobacco needles and an endless variety of things which gradually lessened his little pile of sticks until at last he reached the sticking point when all his sticks were gone  now darkeye that was the chiefs name youve come to the end at last and a good thing you have made of it this year said mr grant in the indian language  have you got all you want  darkeye wants bullets said the chief  ah to be sure  you shall have a lot of these for nothing and some tobacco too said the trader handing the gifts to the indian  a look of satisfaction lighted up the chiefs countenance as he received the gifts and made way for another indian to open and display his pack of furs  but jasper was struck by a peculiar expression in the face of darkeye  observing that he took up one of the bullets and showed it to another savage our hunter edged near him to overhear the conversation  do you see that ball said the chief in a low tone  the indian to whom he spoke nodded  look here  darkeye put the bullet into his mouth as he spoke and bit it until his strong sharp teeth sank deep into the lead then holding it up he said in the same low voice you will know it again  once more the savage nodded and a malicious smile played on his face for a moment  just then mr grant called out come here jasper tell me what you think this otterskin is worth  jaspers curiosity had been aroused by the mysterious conduct of darkeye and he would have given a good deal to have heard a little more of his conversation but being thus called away he was obliged to leave his place and soon forgot the incident  during the whole of that day the trading of furs was carried on much as i have now described it  some of the indians had large packs and some had small but all of them had sufficient to purchase such things as were necessary for themselves and their families during the approaching winter and as each man received from mr grant a present of tobacco besides a few trinkets of small value they returned to the hall that night in high good humour  next day jasper and his friends bade the hospitable trader farewell and a few days after that the indians left him  they smoked a farewell pipe then struck their tents and placed them and their packs of goods in the canoes with their wives children and dogs  pushing out into the stream they commenced the return journey to their distant huntinggrounds  once more their shouts rang through the forest and rolled over the water and once more the paddles sent the sparkling drops into the air as they dashed ahead round the point of rocks above the fort and disappeared leaving the furtrader as they found him smoking his pipe with his hands in his pockets and leaning against the doorpost of his onceagain silent and solitary home    chapter seven  a savage family and a fight with a bear  about a week after our travellers left the outpost arrowhead had an adventure with a bear which had wellnigh cut short his journey through this world as well as his journey in the wilderness of ruperts land  it was in the evening of a beautiful day when it happened  the canoe had got among some bad rapids and as it advanced very slowly young heywood asked to be put on shore that he might walk up the banks of the river which were very beautiful and sketch  in half an hour he was far ahead of the canoe  suddenly on turning round a rocky point he found himself face to face with a small indian boy  it is probable that the little fellow had never seen a white man before and it is certain that heywood had never seen such a specimen of a brown boy  he was clothed in skin it is true but it was the skin in which he had been born for he had not a stitch of clothing on his fat little body  as the man and the boy stood staring at each other it would have been difficult to say which opened his eyes widest with amazement  at first heywood fancied the urchin was a wild beast of some sort on two legs but a second glance convinced him that he was a real boy  the next thought that occurred to the artist was that he would try to sketch him so he clapped his hand to his pocket pulled out his book and pencil and forthwith began to draw  this terrified the little fellow so much that he turned about and fled howling into the woods  heywood thought of giving chase but a noise attracted his attention at that moment and looking across the river he beheld the boys father in the same cool dress as his son  the man had been fishing but when he saw that strangers were passing he threw his blanket round him jumped into his canoe and crossed over to meet them  this turned out to be a miserably poor family of indians consisting of the father mother three girls and a boy and a few illlooking dogs they all lived together in a little tent or wigwam made partly of skins and partly of birchbark  this tent was shaped like a cone  the fire was kindled inside in the middle of the floor  a hole in the side served for a door and a hole in the top did duty for window and chimney  the family kettle hung above the fire and the family circle sat around it  a dirtier family and filthier tent one could not wish to see  the father was a poor weakly man and a bad hunter the squaw was thin wrinkled and very dirty and the children were all sicklylooking except the boy before mentioned who seemed to enjoy more than his fair share of health and rotundity  have ye got anything to eat inquired jasper when the canoe reached the place  they had not got much only a few fish and an owl  poor miserable critters said jasper throwing them a goose and a lump of venison see therethatll keep the wolf out o yer insides for some time  have ye got anything to smoke  no they had nothing to smoke but a few dried leaves  worse and worse cried jasper pulling a large plug of tobacco from the breast of his coat here thatll keep you puffin for a short bit anyhow  heywood although no smoker himself carried a small supply of tobacco just to give away to indians so he added two or three plugs to jaspers gift and arrowhead gave the father a few charges of powder and shot they then stepped into their canoe and pushed off with that feeling of light hearted happiness which always follows the doing of a kind action  theres bears up the river said the indian as they were leaving  have ye seen them inquired jasper  ay but could not shootno powder no ball  look out for them  that will i replied the hunter and in another moment the canoe was out among the rapids again advancing slowly up the river  in about an hour afterwards they came to a part of the river where the banks were high and steep  here jasper landed to look for the tracks of the bears  he soon found these and as they appeared to be fresh he prepared to follow them up  we may as well encamp here said he to arrowhead you can go and look for the bears  i will land the baggage and haul up the canoe and then take my gun and follow you  i see that our friend heywood is at work with his pencil already  this was true  the keen artist was so delighted with the scene before him that the moment the canoe touched the land he had jumped out and seating himself on the trunk of a fallen tree with book and pencil soon forgot everything that was going on around him  arrowhead shouldered his gun and went away up the river  jasper soon finished what he had to do and followed him leaving heywood seated on the fallen tree  now the position which heywood occupied was rather dangerous  the tree lay on the edge of an overhanging bank of clay about ten feet above the water which was deep and rapid at that place  at first the young man sat down on the treetrunk near its root but after a time finding the position not quite to his mind he changed it and went close to the edge of the bank  he was so much occupied with his drawing that he did not observe that the ground on which his feet rested actually overhung the stream  as his weight rested on the fallen tree however he remained there safe enough and busy for half an hour  at the end of that time he was disturbed by a noise in the bushes looking up he beheld a large brown bear coming straight towards him evidently the bear did not see him for it was coming slowly and lazily along with a quiet meditative expression on its face  the appearance of the animal was so sudden and unexpected that poor heywoods heart almost leaped into his mouth  his face grew deadly pale his long hair almost rose on his head with terror and he was utterly unable to move hand or foot  in another moment the bear was within three yards of him and being taken by surprise it immediately rose on its hind legs which is the custom of bears when about to make or receive an attack  it stared for a moment at the horrified artist  let not my reader think that heywoods feelings were due to cowardice the bravest of men have been panicstricken when taken by surprise  the young man had never seen a bear before except in a cage and the difference between a caged and a free bear is very great  besides when a roughlooking monster of this kind comes unexpectedly on a man who is unarmed and has no chance of escape and rises on its hind legs as if to let him have a full view of its enormous size its great strength and its ugly appearance he may well be excused for feeling a little uncomfortable and looking somewhat uneasy  when the bear rose as i have said heywoods courage returned  his first act was to fling his sketchbook in bruins face and then uttering a loud yell he sprang to his feet intending to run away  but the violence of his action broke off the earth under his feet  he dropt into the river like a lump of lead and was whirled away in a moment  what that bear thought when it saw the man vanish from the spot like a ghost of course i cannot tell  it certainly looked surprised and if it was a bear of ordinary sensibility it must undoubtedly have felt astonished  at any rate after standing there gazing for nearly a minute in mute amazement at the spot where heywood had disappeared it let itself down on its forelegs and turning round walked slowly back into the bushes  poor heywood could not swim so the river did what it pleased with him after sweeping him out into the middle of the stream and rolling him over five or six times and whirling him round in an eddy close to the land and dragging him out again into the main current and sending him struggling down a rapid it threw him at last like a bundle of old clothes on a shallow where he managed to get on his feet and staggered to the shore in a most melancholy plight  thereafter he returned to the encampment like a drowned rat with his long hair plastered to his thin face and his soaked garments clinging tightly to his slender body  had he been able to see himself at that moment he would have laughed but not being able to see himself and feeling very miserable he sighed and shuddered with cold and then set to work to kindle a fire and dry himself  meanwhile the bear continued its walk up the river  arrowhead after a time lost the track of the bear he was in search of and believing that it was too late to follow it up farther that night he turned about and began to retrace his steps  not long after that he and the bear met face to face  of course the indians gun was levelled in an instant but the meeting was so sudden that the aim was not so true as usual and although the ball mortally wounded the animal it did not kill him outright  there was no time to reload so arrowhead dropped his gun and ran  he doubled as he ran and made for the encampment but the bear ran faster it was soon at the indians heels  knowing that farther flight was useless arrowhead drew the hatchet that hung at his belt and turning round faced the infuriated animal which instantly rose on its hind legs and closed with him  the indian met it with a tremendous blow of his axe seized it by the throat with his left hand and endeavoured to repeat the blow  see frontispiece but brave and powerful though he was the indian was like a mere child in the paw of the bear  the axe descended with a crash on the monsters head and sank into its skull  but bears are notoriously hard to kill  this one scarcely seemed to feel the blow  next instant arrowhead was down and with its claws fixed in the mans back the bear held him down while it began to gnaw the fleshy part of his left shoulder  no cry escaped from the prostrate hunter  he determined to lie perfectly still as if he were dead that being his only chance of escape but the animal was furious and there is little doubt that the indians brave spirit would soon have fled had not god mercifully sent jasper derry to his relief  that stout hunter had been near at hand when the shot was fired  he at once ran in the direction whence the sound came and arrived on the scene of the struggle just as arrowhead fell  without a moments hesitation he dropt on one knee took a quick but careful aim and fired the ball entered the bears head just behind the ear and rolled it over dead  arrowheads first act on rising was to seize the hand of his deliverer and in a tone of deep feeling exclaimed my brother  ay said jasper with a quiet smile as he reloaded his gun this is not the first time that you and i have helped one another in the nick of time arrowhead we shall be brothers and good friends to boot i hope as long as we live  good said the indian a smile lighting up for one moment his usually grave features  but my brother is wounded let me see said jasper  it will soon be well said the indian carelessly as he took off his coat and sat down on the bank while the white hunter examined his wounds  this was all that was said on the subject by these two men  they were used to danger in every form and had often saved each other from sudden death  the indians wounds though painful were trifling  jasper dressed them in silence and then drawing his long hunting knife he skinned and cut up the bear while his companion lay down on the bank smoked his pipe and looked on  having cut off the best parts of the carcass for supper the hunters returned to the canoe carrying the skin along with them    chapter eight  running the fallswild scenes and men  next day the travellers reached one of those magnificent lakes of which there are so many in the wild woods of north america and which are so like to the great ocean itself that it is scarcely possible to believe them to be bodies of fresh water until they are tasted  the largest of these inland seas is the famous lake superior which is so enormous in size that ships can sail on its broad bosom for several days out of sight of land  it is upwards of three hundred miles long and about one hundred and fifty broad  a good idea of its size may be formed from the fact that it is large enough to contain the whole of scotland and deep enough to cover her highest hills  the lake on which the canoe was now launched although not so large as superior was nevertheless a respectable body of water on which the sun was shining as if on a shield of bright silver  there were numbers of small islets scattered over its surface some thickly wooded to the waters edge others little better than bare rocks  crossing this lake they came to the mouth of a pretty large stream and began to ascend it the first thing they saw on rounding a bend in the stream was an indian tent and in front of this tent was an indian baby hanging from the branch of a tree  let not the reader be horrified  the child was not hanging by the neck but by the handle of its cradle which its mother had placed there to keep her little one out of the way of the dogs  the indian cradle is a very simple contrivance  a young mother came out of the tent with her child just as the canoe arrived and began to pack it in its cradle jasper stopped for a few minutes to converse with one of the indians so that the artist had a good opportunity of witnessing the whole operation  the cradle was simply a piece of flat board with a bit of scarlet cloth fastened down each side of it  first of all the mother laid the poor infant which was quite naked sprawling on the ground  a dirtylooking dog took advantage of this to sneak forward and smell at it whereupon the mother seized a heavy piece of wood and hit the dog such a rap over the nose as sent it away howling  then she spread a thick layer of soft moss on the wooden board  above this she laid a very neat small blanket about two feet in length  upon this she placed the baby which objected at first to go to bed squalled a good deal and kicked a little  the mother therefore took it up turned it over gave it one or two hearty slaps and laid it down again  this seemed to quiet it for it afterwards lay straight out and perfectly still with its coalblack eyes staring out of its fat brown face as if it were astonished at receiving such rough treatment  the mother next spread a little moss over the child and above that she placed another small blanket which she folded and tucked in very comfortably keeping the little ones arms close to its sides and packing it all up from neck to heels so tightly that it looked more like the making up of a parcel than the wrapping up of a child  this done she drew the scarlet cloth over it from each side of the cradle and laced it down the front  when all was done the infant looked like an egyptian mummy nothing but the head being visible  the mother then leaned the cradle against the stem of a tree and immediately one of the dogs ran against it and knocked it over luckily there was a wooden bar attached to the cradle in front of the childs face which bar is placed there on purpose to guard against injury from such accidents so that the bar came first to the ground and thus prevented the flattening of the childs nose which to say truth was flat enough already  instead of scolding herself for her own carelessness the indian mother scolded the dog and then hung the child on the branch of a tree to keep it from further mischief  the next turn in the river revealed a large waterfall up which it was impossible to paddle so they prepared to make a portage  before arriving at the foot of it however jasper landed heywood to enable him to make a sketch and then the two men shoved off and proceeded to the foot of the fall  they were lying there in an eddy considering where was the best spot to land when a loud shout drew their attention towards the rushing water immediately after a boat was seen to hover for a moment on the brink of the waterfall  this fall although about ten or fifteen feet high had such a large body of water rushing over it that the river instead of falling straight down gushed over in a steep incline  down this incline the boat now darted with the speed of lightning  it was full of men two of whom stood erect the one in the bow the other in the stern to control the movements of the boat  for a few seconds there was deep silence  the men held their breath as the boat leaped along with the boiling flood  there was a curling white wave at the foot of the fall  the boat cut through this like a knife drenching her crew with spray  next moment she swept round into the eddy where the canoe was floating and the men gave vent to a loud cheer of satisfaction at having run the fall in safety  but this was not the end of that exciting scene  scarcely had they gained the land when another boat appeared on the crest of the fall again a shout was given and a dash made  for one moment there was a struggle with the raging flood and then a loud cheer as the second boat swept into the eddy in safety  then a third and a fourth boat went through the same operation and before the end of a quarter of an hour six boats ran the fall  the bay at the foot of it which had been so quiet and solitary when jasper and his friends arrived became the scene of the wildest confusion and noise as the men ran about with tremendous activity making preparations to spend the night there  some hauled might and main at the boats some carried up the provisions fryingpans and kettles others cut down dry trees with their axes and cut them up into logs from five to six feet long and as thick as a mans thigh  these were intended for six great fires each boats crew requiring a fire to themselves  while this was going on the principal guides and steersmen crowded round our three travellers and plied them with questions for it was so unusual to meet with strangers in that faroff wilderness that a chance meeting of this kind was regarded as quite an important event  youre bound for york fort no doubt said jasper addressing a tall handsome man of between forty and fifty who was the principal guide  ay thats the end of our journey  you see were taking our furs down to the coast  have you come from york fort friend  no ive come all the way from canada said jasper who thereupon gave them a short account of his voyage  well jasper youll spend the night with us wont you said the guide  that will i right gladly  come then i see the fires are beginning to burn  we may as well have a pipe and a chat while supper is getting ready  the night was now closing in and the scene in the forest when the campfires began to blaze was one of the most stirring and romantic sights that could be witnessed in that land  the men of the brigade were some of them frenchcanadians some natives of the orkney islands who had been hired and sent out there by the hudsons bay company others were halfbreeds and a few were pure indians  they were all dressed in what is called voyageur costumecoats or capotes of blue or grey cloth with hoods to come over their heads at night and fastened round their waists with scarlet worsted belts corduroy or grey trousers gartered outside at the knees moccasins and caps  but most of them threw off their coats and appeared in blue and red striped cotton shirts which were open at the throat exposing their broad sunburned hairy chests  there was variety too in the capssome had scotch bonnets others red nightcaps a few had tall hats ornamented with gold and silver cords and tassels and a good many wore no covering at all except their own thicklymatted hair  their faces were burned to every shade of red brown and black from constant exposure and they were strong as lions wild as zebras and frolicksome as kittens  it was no wonder then that heywood got into an extraordinary state of excitement and delight as he beheld these wild finelooking men smoking their pipes and cooking their suppers sitting lying and standing talking and singing and laughing with teeth glistening and eyes glittering in the red blaze of the fireseach of which fires was big enough to have roasted a whole ox  the young artist certainly made good use of his opportunity  he went about from fire to fire sketchbook in hand sketching all the bestlooking men in every possible attitude sometimes singly and sometimes in groups of five or six  he then went to the farthest end of the encampment and in the light of the last fire made a picture of all the rest  the kettles were soon steaming  these hung from tripods erected over the fires  their contents were flour and pemmican made into a thick soup called rubbiboo  as pemmican is a kind of food but little known in this country i may as well describe how it is made  in the first place it consists of buffalo meat  the great plains or prairies of america which are like huge downs or commons hundreds of miles in extent afford grass sufficient to support countless herds of deer wild horses and bisons the bisons are called by the people there buffaloes  the buffalo is somewhat like an enormous ox but its hindquarters are smaller and its forequarters much larger than those of the ox  its hair is long and shaggy particularly about the neck and shoulders where it becomes almost a mane  its horns are thick and short and its look is very ferocious but it is in reality a timid creature and will only turn to attack a man when it is hard pressed and cannot escape  its flesh is firstrate for food even better than beef and there is a large hump on its shoulder which is considered the best part of the animal  such is the bison or buffalo from which pemmican is made  when a man wishes to make a bag of pemmican he first of all kills the buffalonot an easy thing to do by any means for the buffalo runs well  having killed him he skins him and cuts up the meatalso a difficult thing to do especially if one is not used to that sort of work  then he cuts the meat into thin layers and hangs it up to dry dried meat will keep for a long time  it is packed up in bales and sent about that country to be used as food  the next thing to be done is to make a bag of the raw hide of the buffalo  this is done with a glovers needle the raw sinews of the animal being used instead of thread  the bag is usually about three feet long and eighteen inches broad and the hair is left on the outside of it  a huge pot is now put on the fire and the fat of the buffalo is melted down  then the dried meat is pounded between two stones until it is torn and broken up into shreds after which it is put into the bag the melted fat is poured over it and the whole is well mixed  the last operation is to sew up the mouth of the bag and leave it to cool after which the pemmican is ready for use  in this state a bag of pemmican will keep fresh and good for years when the search was going on in the polar regions for the lost ships of sir john franklin one of the parties hid some pemmican in the ground intending to return and take it up  they returned home however another way  five years later some travellers discovered this pemmican and it was found at that time to be fit for food  pemmican is extensively used throughout ruperts land especially during summer for at that season the brigades of boats start from hundreds of inland tradingposts to take the furs to the coast for shipment to england and pemmican is found to be not only the best of food for these hardworking men but exceedingly convenient to carry  supper finished the wildlooking fellows of this brigade took to their pipes and threw fresh logs on the fires which roared and crackled and shot up their forked tongues of flame as if they wished to devour the forest  then the song and the story went round and men told of terrible fights with the redmen of the prairies and desperate encounters with grizzly bears in the rocky mountains and narrow escapes among the rapids and falls until the night was half spent  then one by one each man wrapped himself in his blanket stretched himself on the ground with his feet towards the fire and his head pillowed on a coat or a heap of brushwood and went to sleep  ere long they were all down except one or two longwinded story tellers who went on muttering to their pipes after their comrades were asleep  even these became tired at last of the sound of their own voices and gradually every noise in the camp was hushed except the crackling of the fires as they sank by degrees and went out leaving the place in dead silence and total darkness  with the first peep of dawn the guide arose  in ten minutes after his first shout the whole camp was astir  the men yawned a good deal at first and grumbled a little and stretched themselves violently and yawned again  but soon they shook off laziness and sprang to their work  pots pans kettles and pemmican bags were tossed into the boats and in the course of halfanhour they were ready to continue the voyage  jasper stood beside the guide looking on at the busy scene  heard you any news from the saskatchewan of late said he  not much replied the guide theres little stirring there just now except among the indians who have been killing and scalping each other as usual  but by the way that reminds me there has been a sort of row between the indians and the companys people at fort erie  fort erie said jasper with a start  ay thats the name o the fort if i remember right returned the guide  it seems that one o the men there i think they call him larochebut what makes you start friend jasper  do you know anything of this man  yes hes a friend of mine  go on let me hear about it  well theres not much to tell resumed the guide  this laroche it would appear has got into hot water  he has a daughter a good lookin wench im told and better than that a wellbehaved one  one o the indians had been impertinent to the girl so old laroche who seems to be a fiery fellow up fist hit him on the nose and knocked the savage flat on his back  a tremendous howl was set up and knives and hatchets were flourished but mr pemberton who is in charge of fort erie ran in and pacified them  the indian that was floored vows hell have the hair of old laroches head  this taking the hair off peoples heads or scalping as it is called is a common practice among the north american indians  when a savage kills his enemy he runs his scalping knife round the dead mans head seizes the hair with his left hand and tears the scalp off  indeed this dreadful cruelty is sometimes practised before death has occurred  the scalp with its lock of hair is taken home by the victor and hung up in his tent as a trophy of war  the man who can show the greatest number of scalps is considered the greatest warrior  the dresses of indian warriors are usually fringed with human scalplocks  thats a bad business said jasper who was concerned to hear such news of his intended fatherinlaw  do ye know the name o this redskinned rascal  i heard it mentioned said the guide but i cant remember it at this moment  the boats are ready to start said one of the steersmen coming up just then  very good let the men embark  now jasper we must part  give us a shake o your hand  a pleasant trip to you  the same to you friend said jasper returning the guides squeeze  in another minute the boats were away  now friends we shall start said jasper breaking the deep silence which followed the departure of the brigade  good said arrowhead  im ready said heywood  the canoe was soon in the water and the men in their places but they started that morning without a song  arrowhead was never inclined to be noisy heywood was sleepy and jasper was rendered anxious by what he had heard of his friends at fort erie so they paddled away in silence    chapter nine  the fort and an unexpected meeting  we turn now to a very different scene  it is a small fort or tradingpost on the banks of a stream which flows through the prairie the fort is very much like the one which has been already described but somewhat stronger and there are four blockhouses or bastions one at each corner from which the muzzles of a few heavy guns may be seen protruding  the trees and bushes have been cleared away from around this fort and the strips of forestland which run along both sides of the river are not so thickly wooded as the country through which the reader has hitherto been travelling  in front of the fort rolls the river immediately behind it lies the boundless prairie which extends like a sea of grass with scarcely a tree or bush upon it as far as the eye can reach  this is fort erie  you might ride for many days over that prairie without seeing anything of the forest except a clump of trees and bushes here and there and now and then a little pond  the whole region is extremely beautiful one that ought to fill the hearts of men with admiration and love of the bountiful god who formed it  but men in those regions at the time i write of thought of little beauties of nature and cared nothing for the goodness of god  at least this may be truly said of the redskinned owners of the soil  it was otherwise with some of the white people who dwelt there  three weeks had passed away since the night spent by our friends with the brigade  it was now a beautiful evening a little after sunset the days work at the fort had been finished and the men were amusing themselves by racing their horses of which fine animals there were great numbers at fort erie  just a little after the sun had gone down three horsemen appeared on the distant prairie and came bounding at full gallop towards the fort they were our friends jasper heywood and arrowhead  these adventurous travellers had reached a fort farther down the river two days before and having been supplied with horses had pushed forward by way of the plains  on entering the belt of woods close to the fort the horsemen reined in and rode among the trees more cautiously  heres the end of our journey at last cried jasper on whose bronzed countenance there was a deep flush of excitement and a look of anxiety  just as he said this jaspers heart appeared to leap into his throat and almost choked him  pulling up suddenly he swallowed his heart with some difficulty and said  hold on lads  ill ride round to the fort by way of the river for reasons of my own  push on heywood with the indian and let mr pemberton know im coming  see i will give you the packet of letters we were asked to carry from the fort below  now make haste  heywood though a little surprised at this speech and at the manner of his friend took the packet in silence and rode swiftly away followed by the indian  when they were gone jasper dismounted tied his horse to a tree and walked quickly into the woods in another direction  now this mysterious proceeding is not difficult to explain  jasper had caught sight of a female figure walking under the trees at a considerable distance from the spot where he had pulled up  he knew that there were none but indian women at fort erie at that time and that therefore the only respectably dressed female at the place must needs be his own marie laroche  overjoyed at the opportunity thus unexpectedly afforded him of meeting her alone he hastened forward with a beating heart  marie was seated on the stump of a fallen tree when the hunter came up she was a fair beautiful woman of about fiveandtwenty with an air of modesty about her which attracted love yet repelled familiarity  many a goodlooking and welldoing young fellow had attempted to gain the heart of marie during the last two years but without successfor this good reason that her heart had been gained already  she was somewhat startled when a man appeared thus suddenly before her jasper stood in silence for a few moments with his arms crossed upon his breast and gazed earnestly into her face  as he did not speak she said  you appear to be a stranger here  have you arrived lately  jasper was for a moment astonished that she did not at once recognise him and yet he had no reason to be surprised  besides the alteration that two years sometimes makes in a man jasper had made a considerable alteration on himself  when marie last saw him he had been in the habit of practising the foolish and unnatural custom of shaving and he had carried it to such an extreme that he shaved off everything whiskers beard and moustache  but within a year he had been induced by a wise friend to change his opinion on this subject  that friend had suggested that as providence had caused hair to grow on his cheeks lips and chin it was intended to be worn and that he had no more right to shave his face than a chinaman had to shave his head  jasper had been so far convinced that he had suffered his whiskers to grow these were now large and bushy and had encroached so much on his chin as to have become almost a beard  besides this not having shaved any part of his face during the last three weeks there was little of it visible except his eyes forehead and cheekbones  all the rest was more or less covered with black hair  no wonder then that marie who believed him to be two thousand miles away at that moment did not recognise him in the increasing darkness of evening  the lover at once understood this and he resolved to play the part of a stranger  he happened to have the power of changing his voicea power possessed by many peopleand trusting to the increasing gloom to conceal him and to the fact that he was the last person in the world whom marie might expect to see there he addressed her as follows  i am indeed a stranger here at least i have not been at the post for a very long time  i have just reached the end of a long voyage  indeed said the girl interested by the strangers grave manner may i ask where you have come from  i have come all the way from canada young woman and i count myself lucky in meeting with such a pleasant face at the end of my journey  from canada exclaimed marie becoming still more interested in the stranger and blushing deeply as she askedyou have friends there no doubt  ay a few said jasper  and what has brought you such a long way into this wild wilderness asked marie sighing as she thought of the hundreds of miles that lay between fort erie and canada  i have come here to get me a wife replied jasper  that is strange said the girl smiling for there are few but indian women here  a stout hunter like you might find one nearer home i should think  here marie paused for she felt that on such a subject she ought not to converse with a stranger  yet she could not help adding but perhaps as you say you have been in this part of the world before you may have some one in your mind  i am engaged said jasper abruptly  on hearing this marie felt more at her ease and being of a very sympathetic nature she at once courted the confidence of the stranger  may i venture to ask her name said marie with an arch smile  i may not tell replied jasper i have a comrade who is entitled to know this secret before any one else  perhaps you may have heard of him for he was up in these parts two years agone  his name is jasper derry  the blood rushed to maries temples on hearing the name and she turned her face away to conceal her agitation while in a low voice she said  is jasper derry then your intimate friend  that is hea very intimate friend indeed  but you appear to know him  yes ii know himi have seen him  i hope he is well said marie and she listened with a beating heart for the answer though she still turned her face away  oh hes well enough said jasper sickness dont often trouble him  hes going to be married  had a bullet struck the girls heart she could not have turned more deadly pale than she did on hearing this  she half rose from the tree stump and would have fallen to the ground insensible had not jasper caught her in his arms  my own marie said he fervently forgive me dearest forgive my folly my wickedness in deceiving you in this fashion  oh what a fool i am he added as the poor girl still hung heavily in his graspspeak to me marie my own darling  whether it was the earnestness of his voice or the kiss which he printed on her forehead or the coolness of the evening air i know not but certain it is that marie recovered in the course of a few minutes and on being convinced that jasper really was her old lover she resigned herself wisely to her fate and held such an uncommonly long conversation with the bold hunter that the moon was up and the stars were out before they turned their steps towards the fort  why jasper derry cried mr pemberton as the hunter entered the hall of fort erie where have you been  ive been expecting you every moment for the last two hours  well you see mr pemberton i just went down the river a short bit to see an old friend and i was kep longer than i expected said jasper with a cool grave face as he grasped and shook the hand which was held out to him  ah  i see you hunters are more like brothers than friends  no doubt you went to smoke a pipe with hawkeye or to have a chat with the muskrat about old times said the furtrader mentioning the names of two indians who were celebrated as being the best hunters in the neighbourhood and who had been bosom friends of jasper when he resided there two years before  no ive not yet smoked a pipe with hawkeye neither have i seen muskrat but i certainly have had a pretty long chat with one o my old friends answered jasper while a quiet smile played on his face  well come along and have a pipe and a chat with me  i hope you count me one of your friends too said mr pemberton conducting jasper into an inner room where he found heywood and arrowhead seated at a table doing justice to a splendid supper of buffalotongues venisonsteaks and marrowbones  here are your comrades you see hard at work  its lucky you came tonight jasper for i intend to be off tomorrow morning by break of day on a buffalohunt  if you had been a few hours later of arriving i should have missed you  come will you eat or smoke  ill eat first if you have no objection said jasper and smoke afterwards  very good  sit down then and get to work  meanwhile ill go and look after the horses that we intend to take with us tomorrow  of course youll accompany us jasper  ill be very glad and so will arrowhead there  theres nothing he likes so much as a chase after a buffalo unless it may be the eating of him  but as for my friend and comrade mr heywood he must speak for himself  i will be delighted to go answered the artist nothing will give me more pleasure but i fear my steed is too much exhausted to  oh make your mind easy on that score said the furtrader interrupting him  i have plenty of capital horses and can mount the whole of you so thats settled  and now friends do justice to your supper i shall be back before you have done  so saying mr pemberton left the room and our three friends being unusually hungry fell vigorously to work on the good cheer of fort erie    chapter ten  buffalohunting on the prairies  next day most of the men of fort erie headed by mr pemberton rode away into the prairies on a buffalohunt  jasper would willingly have remained with marie at the fort but having promised to go he would not now draw back  the band of horsemen rode for three hours at a quick pace over the grassy plains without seeing anything  jasper kept close beside his friend old laroche while heywood rode and conversed chiefly with mr pemberton  there were about twenty men altogether armed with guns and mounted on their best buffalorunners as they styled the horses which were trained to hunt the buffalo  many of these steeds had been wild horses caught by the indians brokenin and sold by them to the furtraders  i have seldom ridden so long without meeting buffaloes observed mr pemberton as the party galloped to the top of a ridge of land from which they could see the plains far and wide around them  there they are at last said heywood eagerly pointing to a certain spot on the faroff horizon where living creatures of some sort were seen moving  that must be a band o redskins said jasper who trotted up at this moment with the rest of the party  they are sauteaux this word is pronounced sotoes in the plural sotoe in the singular observed arrowhead quietly  you must have good eyes friend said pemberton applying a small pockettelescope to his eye they are indeed sauteaux i see by their dress and they have observed us for they are coming straight this way like the wind  will they come as enemies or friends inquired heywood  as friends i have no doubt replied the furtrader  come lads we will ride forward to meet them  in a short time the two parties of horsemen met  they approached almost at full speed as if each meant to ride the other down and did not rein up until they were so close that it seemed impossible to avoid a shock  have you seen the buffaloes lately inquired pemberton after the first salutation had passed  yes there are large bands not an hours ride from this  some of our young warriors have remained to hunt  we are going to the fort to trade  good you will find tobacco enough there to keep you smoking till i return with fresh meat said pemberton in the native tongue which he could speak like an indian  ill not be long away  farewell  no more words were wasted  the traders galloped away over the prairie and the indians of whom there were about fifteen dashed off in the direction of the fort  these indians were a very different set of men from those whom i have already introduced to the reader in a former chapter  there are many tribes of indians in the wilderness of ruperts land and some of the tribes are at constant war with each other  but in order to avoid confusing the reader it may be as well to divide the indian race into two great classesnamely those who inhabit the woods and those who roam over the plains or prairies  as a general rule the thick wood indians are a more peaceful set of men than the prairie indians  they are few in number and live in a land full of game where there is far more than enough of room for all of them  their mode of travelling in canoes and on foot is slow so that the different tribes do not often meet and they have no occasion to quarrel  they are for the most part a quiet and harmless race of savages and being very dependent on the furtraders for the necessaries of life they are on their good behaviour and seldom do much mischief  it is very different with the plain indians  these savages have numbers of fine horses and live in a splendid open country which is wellstocked with deer and buffaloes besides other game  they are bold riders and scour over the country in all directions consequently the different tribes often come across each other when out hunting quarrels and fights are the results so that these savages are naturally a fierce and warlike race  they are independent too for although they get their guns and ammunition and other necessaries from the traders they can manage to live without these things if need be  they can clothe themselves in the skins of wild animals and when they lose their guns or wet their powder they can kill game easily with their own bows and arrows  it was a band of these fellows that now went galloping towards fort erie with the long manes and tails of the halfwild horses and the scalplocks on their dresses and their own long black hair streaming in the wind  pemberton and his party soon came up with the young indians who had remained to chase the buffaloes  he found them sheltered behind a little mound making preparations for an immediate attack on the animals which however were not yet visible to the men from the fort  i do believe theyve seen buffaloes on the other side of that mound said pemberton as he rode forward  he was right  the indians of whom there were six well mounted and armed with strong short bows pointed to the mound and said that on the other side of it there were hundreds of buffaloes  as the animals were so numerous no objection was made to the furtraders joining in the hunt so in another moment the united party leaped from their horses and prepared for action  some wiped out and carefully loaded their guns others examined the priming of their pieces and chipped the edges off the flints to make sure of their not missing fire  all looked to the girths of their saddles and a few threw off their coats and rolled their shirtsleeves up to their shoulders as if they were going to undertake hard and bloody work  mr pemberton took in hand to look after our friend heywood the rest were well qualified to look after themselves  in five minutes they were all remounted and rode quietly to the brow of the mound  here an interesting sight presented itself  the whole plain was covered with the huge unwieldy forms of the buffaloes  they were scattered about singly and in groups grazing or playing or lying down and in one or two places some of the bulls were engaged in single combat pawing the earth goring each other and bellowing furiously  after one look the hunters dashed down the hill and were in the midst of the astonished animals almost before they could raise their heads to look at them  now commenced a scene which it is not easy to describe correctly  each man had selected his own group of animals so that the whole party was scattered in a moment  follow me cried pemberton to heywood observe what i do and then go try it yourself  the furtrader galloped at full speed towards a group of buffaloes which stood right before him about two hundred yards off  he carried a singlebarrelled gun with a flint lock in his right hand and a bullet in his mouth ready to reload  the buffaloes gazed at him for one moment in stupid surprise and then with a toss of their heads and a whisk of their tails they turned and fled  at first they ran with a slow awkward gait like pigs and to one who did not know their powers it would seem that the fastrunning horses of the two men would quickly overtake them  but as they warmed to the work their speed increased and it required the horses to get up their best paces to overtake them  after a furious gallop pembertons horse ran close up alongside of a finelooking buffalo cowso close that he could almost touch the side of the animal with the point of his gun  dropping the rein he pointed the gun without putting it to his shoulder and fired  the ball passed through the animals heart and it dropt like a stone  at the same moment pemberton flung his cap on the ground beside it so that he might afterwards claim it as his own  the welltrained horse did not shy at the shot neither did it check its pace for a moment but ran straight on and soon placed its master alongside of another buffalo cow  in the meantime pemberton loaded like lightning  he let the reins hang loose knowing that the horse understood his work and seizing the powderhorn at his side with his right hand drew the wooden stopper with his teeth and poured a charge of powder into his leftguessing the quantity of course  pouring this into the gun he put the muzzle to his mouth and spat the ball into it struck the butt on the pommel of the saddle to send it down as well as to drive the powder into the pan and taking his chance of the gun priming itself he aimed as before and pulled the trigger  the explosion followed and a second buffalo lay dead upon the plain with a glove beside it to show to whom it belonged  scenes similar to this were being enacted all over the plain with this difference that the bad or impatient men sometimes fired too soon and missed their mark or by only wounding the animals infuriated them and caused them to run faster  one or two illtrained horses shied when the guns were fired and left their riders sprawling on the ground  others stumbled into badgerholes and rolled over  the indians did their work well  they were used to it and did not bend their bows until their horses almost brushed the reeking sides of the huge brutes  then they drew to the arrow heads and leaning forward buried the shafts up to the feathers  the arrow is said to be even more deadly than the bullet  already the plain was strewn with dead or dying buffaloes and the ground seemed to tremble with the thunder of the tread of the affrighted animals  jasper had dropt three and arrowhead had slain two yet the pace did not slackenstill the work of death went on  having seen pemberton shoot another animal heywood became fired with a desire to try his own hand so he edged away from his companion  seeing a very large monstrouslooking buffalo flying away by itself at no great distance he turned his horse towards it grasped his gun shook the reins and gave chase  now poor heywood did not know that the animal he had made up his mind to kill was a tough old bull neither did he know that a bull is bad to eat and dangerous to follow and worse than all he did not know that when a bull holds his tail stiff and straight up in the air it is a sign that he is in a tremendous rage and that the wisest thing a man can do is to let him alone  heywood in fact knew nothing so he rushed blindly on his fate  at first the bull did not raise his tail but as the rider drew near he turned his enormous shaggy head a little to one side and looked at him out of the corner of his wicked little eye  when heywood came within a few yards and in attempting to take aim fired off his gun by accident straight into the face of the sun the tail went up and the bull began to growl  the ferocious aspect of the creature alarmed the artist but he had made up his mind to kill it so he attempted to reload as pemberton had done  he succeeded and as he was about to turn his attention again to the bull he observed one of the men belonging to the fort making towards him  this man saw and knew the artists danger and meant to warn him but his horse unfortunately put one of its feet into a hole and sent him flying head over heels through the air  heywood was now so close to the bull that he had to prepare for another shot  the horse he rode was a thoroughly good buffalorunner  it knew the dangerous character of the bull if its rider did not and kept its eye watchfully upon it  at last the bull lost patience and suddenly wheeling round dashed at the horse but the trained animal sprang nimbly to one side and got out of the way  heywood was all but thrown he clutched the mane however and held on  the bull then continued its flight  determined not to be caught in this way again the artist seized the reins and ran the horse close alongside of the buffalo whose tail was now as stiff as a poker  once more the bull turned suddenly round heywood pulled the reins violently thus confusing his steed which ran straight against the buffalos big hairy forehead  it was stopped as violently as if it had run against the side of a house  but poor heywood was not stopped  he left the saddle like a rocket flew right over the bulls back came down on his face ploughed up the land with his noseand learned a lesson from experience  fortunately the spot on which he fell happened to be one of those soft muddy places in which the buffaloes are fond of rolling their huge bodies in the heat of summer so that with the exception of a bruised and dirty face and badly soiled clothes the bold artist was none the worse for his adventure    chapter eleven  wintersleeping in the snowa night alarm  summer passed away autumn passed away and winter came  so did christmas and so did jaspers marriageday  now the reader must understand that there is a wonderful difference between the winter in that part of the north american wilderness called ruperts land and winter in our own happy island  winter out there is from six to eight months long  the snow varies from three to four feet deep and in many places it drifts to fifteen or twenty feet deep  the ice on the lakes and rivers is sometimes above six feet thick and the salt sea itself in hudsons bay is frozen over to a great extent  nothing like a thaw takes place for many months at a time and the frost is so intense that it is a matter of difficulty to prevent onesself from being frostbitten  the whole country during these long winter months appears white desolate and silent  yet a good many of the birds and animals keep moving about though most of them do so at night and do not often meet the eye of man  the bear goes to sleep all winter in a hole but the wolf and the fox prowl about the woods at night  ducks geese and plover no longer enliven the marshes with their wild cries but white grouse or ptarmigan fly about in immense flocks and arctic hares make many tracks in the deep snow still these are quiet creatures and they scarcely break the deep dead silence of the forests in winter  at this period the indian and the furtrader wrap themselves in warm dresses of deerskin lined with the thickest flannel and spend their short days in trapping and shooting  at night the indian piles logs on his fire to keep out the frost and adds to the warmth of his skintent by heaping snow up the outside of it all round  the furtrader puts double windowframes and double panes of glass in his windows puts on double doors and heats his rooms with castiron stoves  but do what he will the furtrader cannot keep out the cold altogether he may heat the stove redhot if he will yet the water in the basins and jugs in the corner of his room will be frozen and his breath settles on the windowpanes and freezes there so thickly that it actually dims the light of the sun  this crust on the windows inside is sometimes an inch thick  thermometers in england are usually filled with quicksilver  in ruperts land quicksilver would be frozen half the winter so spirit of wine is used instead because that liquid will not freeze with any ordinary degree of cold  here the thermometer sometimes falls as low as zero  out there it does not rise so high as zero during the greater part of the winter and it is often as low as twenty thirty and even fifty degrees below zero  if the wind should blow when the cold is intense no man dare face it he would be certain to be frostbitten  the parts of the body that are most easily frozen are the ears the chin the cheekbones the nose the heels fingers and toes  the freezing of any part begins with a pricking sensation  when this occurs at the point of your nose it is time to give earnest attention to that feature else you run the risk of having it shortened  the best way to recover it is to rub it well and to keep carefully away from the fire  the likest thing to a frostbite is a burn  in fact the two things are almost the same  in both cases the skin or flesh is destroyed and becomes a sore  in the one case it is destroyed by fire in the other by frost but in both it is painful and dangerous according to the depth of the frostbite or the burn  many a poor fellow loses joints of his toes and fingerssome have even lost their hands and feet by frost many have lost their lives  but the most common loss is the loss of the skin of the point of the nose cheekbones and china loss which is indeed painful but can be replaced by nature in the course of time  of course curious appearances are produced by such intense cold  on going out into the open air the breath settles on the breast whiskers and eyebrows in the shape of hoarfrost and men who go out in the morning for a ramble with black or brown locks return at night with what appears to be grey hairsometimes with icicles hanging about their faces  horses and cattle there are seldom without icicles hanging from their lips and noses in winter  poor mr pemberton was much troubled in this way  he was a fat and heavy man and apt to perspire freely  when he went out to shoot in winter the moisture trickled down his face and turned his whiskers into two little blocks of ice and he used to be often seen after a hard days walk sitting for a long time beside the stove holding his cheeks to the fire and gently coaxing the icy blocks to let go their hold  but for all this the long winter of those regions is a bright enjoyable season  the cold is not felt so much as one would expect because it is not damp and the weather is usually bright and sunny  from what i have said the reader will understand that summer in those regions is short and very hot the winter long and very cold  both seasons have their own peculiar enjoyments and to healthy men both are extremely agreeable  i have said that jaspers marriageday had arrived  new years day was fixed for his union with the fair and gentle marie  as is usual at this festive season of the year it was arranged that a ball should be given at the fort in the large hall to all the people that chanced to be there at the time  old laroche had been sent to a small hut a long days march from the fort where he was wont to spend his time in trapping foxes  he was there alone so three days before new years day jasper set out with arrowhead to visit the old man and bear him company on his march back to the fort  there are no roads in that country  travellers have to plod through the wilderness as they best can  it may not have occurred to my reader that it would be a difficult thing to walk for a day through snow so deep that at every step the traveller would sink the whole length of his leg  the truth is that travelling in ruperts land in winter would be impossible but for a machine which enables men to walk on the surface of the snow without sinking more than a few inches  this machine is the snowshoe  snowshoes vary in size and form in different parts of the country but they are all used for the same purpose  some are long and narrow others are nearly round  they vary in size from three to six feet in length and from eight to twenty inches in breadth  they are extremely lightmade of a framework of hard wood and covered with a network of deerskin which while it prevents the wearer from sinking more than a few inches allows any snow that may chance to fall on the top of the shoe to pass through the netting  the value of this clumsy looking machine may be imagined when i say that men with them will easily walk twenty thirty and even forty miles across a country over which they could not walk three miles without such helps  it was a bright calm frosty morning when jasper and his friend set out on their short journey  the sun shone brilliantly and the hoarfrost sparkled on the trees and bushes causing them to appear as if they had been covered with millions of diamonds  the breath of the two men came from their mouths like clouds of steam  arrowhead wore the round snowshoes which go by the name of bears pawshe preferred these to any others  jasper wore the snowshoes peculiar to the chipewyan indians  they were nearly as long as himself and turned up at the point  both men were dressed alike in the yellow leathern costume of winter  the only difference being that jasper wore a fur cap while arrowhead sported a cloth headpiece that covered his neck and shoulders and was ornamented with a pair of horns  all day the two men plodded steadily over the country  sometimes they were toiling through deep snow in wooded places sinking six or eight inches in spite of their snowshoes  at other times they were passing swiftly over the surface of the open plains where the snow was beaten so hard by exposure to the sun and wind that the shoes only just broke the crust and left their outlines behind  then they reached a bend of the river where they had again to plod heavily through the woods on its banks until they came out upon its frozen surface  here the snow was so hard that they took off their snowshoes and ran briskly along without them for a long space  thus they travelled all day without one halt and made such good use of their time that they arrived at the loghut of old laroche early in the evening  well met soninlaw that is to be cried the stout old man heartily as the two hunters made their appearance before the low doorway of his hut which was surrounded by trees and almost buried in snow  if you had been half an hour later i would have met you in the woods  how so fatherinlaw that is to be said jasper were ye goin out to your traps so late as this  nay man but i was startin for the fort  its a long way as you know and my old limbs are not just so supple as yours  i thought i would travel tonight and sleep in the woods so as to be there in good time tomorrow  but come in come in and rest you  i warrant me youll not feel inclined for more walkin tonight  now my name is not jasper derry if i enter your hut this night said the hunter stoutly  if i could not turn round and walk straight back to the fort this night i would not be worthy of your daughter old man so come along with you  what say you arrowhead shall we go straight back  good answered the indian  well well cried laroche laughing lead the way and i will follow in your footsteps  it becomes young men to beat the track and old ones to take it easy  the three men turned their faces towards fort erie and were soon far away from the loghut  they walked steadily and silently along without once halting until the night became so dark that it was difficult to avoid stumps and bushes  then they prepared to encamp in the snow  now it may seem to many people a very disagreeable idea that of sleeping out in snow but one who has tried it can assure them that it is not so bad as it seems  no doubt when jasper halted in the cold dark woods and said i think this will be a pretty good place to sleep any one unacquainted with the customs of that country would have thought the man was jesting or mad for besides being very dismal in consequence of its being pitch dark it was excessively cold and snow was falling steadily and softly on the ground  but jasper knew what he was about and so did the others  without saying a word the three men flung down their bundles of provisions and each set to work to make the encampment  of course they had to work in darkness so thick that even the white snow could scarcely be seen  first of all they selected a tree the branches of which were so thick and spreading as to form a good shelter from the falling snow  here jasper and laroche used their snowshoes as shovels while arrowhead plied his axe and soon cut enough of firewood for the night  he also cut a large bundle of small branches for bedding  a space of about twelve feet long by six broad was cleared at the foot of the tree in half an hour  but the snow was so deep that they had to dig down four feet before they reached the turf  as the snow taken out of the hole was thrown up all round it the walls rose to nearly seven feet  arrowhead next lighted a roaring fire at one end of this cleared space the others strewed the branches over the space in front of it and spread their blankets on the top after which the kettle was put on to boil buffalo steaks were stuck up before the fire to roast and the men then lay down to rest and smoke while supper was preparing  the intense cold prevented the fire from melting the snowy walls of this encampment which shone and sparkled in the red blaze like pink marble studded all over with diamonds while the spreading branches formed a ruddylooking ceiling  when they had finished supper the heat of the fire and the heat of their food made the travellers feel quite warm and comfortable in spite of john frost and when they at last wrapped their blankets round them and laid their heads together on the branches they fell into a sleep more sound and refreshing than they would have enjoyed had they gone to rest in a warm house upon the best bed in england  but when the fire went out about the middle of the night the cold became so intense that they were awakened by it so jasper rose and blew up the fire and the other two sat up and filled their pipes while their teeth chattered in their heads  soon the blaze and the smoke warmed them and again they lay down to sleep comfortably till morning  before daybreak however arrowheadwho never slept so soundly but that he could be wakened by the slightest unusual noiseslowly raised his head and touched jasper on the shoulder  the hunter was too welltrained to the dangers of the wilderness to start up or speak  he uttered no word but took up his gun softly and looked in the direction in which the indians eyes gazed  a small red spot in the ashes served to reveal a pair of glaring eyeballs among the bushes  a wolf whispered jasper cocking his gun  no a man said arrowhead  at the sound of the click of the lock the object in the bushes moved jasper leaped up in an instant pointed his gun and shouted sternly  stand fast and speak or i fire  at the same moment arrowhead kicked the logs of the fire and a bright flame leapt up showing that the owner of the pair of eyes was an indian  seeing that he was discovered and that if he turned to run he would certainly be shot the savage came forward sulkily and sat down beside the fire  jasper asked him why he came there in that stealthy manner like a sly fox  the indian said he was merely travelling by night and had come on the camp unexpectedly  not knowing who was there he had come forward with caution  jasper was not satisfied with this reply  he did not like the look of the man and he felt sure that he had seen him somewhere before but his face was disfigured with war paint and he could not feel certain on that point until he remembered the scene in the trading store at jaspers house  whatdarkeye cried he can it be you  darkeye shouted laroche suddenly rising from his reclining position and staring the indian in the face with a dark scowl  why jasper this is the villain who insulted my daughter and to whom i taught the lesson that an old man could knock him down  the surprise and indignation of jasper on hearing this was great but remembering that the savage had already been punished for his offence and that it would be mean to take advantage of him when there were three to one he merely said  well well i wont bear a grudge against a man who is coward enough to insult a woman  i would kick you out o the camp darkeye but as you might use your gun when you got into the bushes i wont give you that chance  at the same time we cant afford to lose the rest of our nap for you so arrowhead will keep you safe here and watch you while laroche and i sleep  we will let you go at daybreak  saying this jasper lay down beside his fatherinlaw and they were both asleep in a few minutes leaving the two indians to sit and scowl at each other beside the fire    chapter twelve  the wedding an arrival a feast and a ball  new years day came at last and on the morning of that day jasper derry and marie laroche were made man and wife  they were married by the reverend mr wilson a wesleyan missionary who had come to fort erie a few days before on a visit to the tribes of indians in that neighbourhood  the north american indian has no religion worthy of the name but he has a conscience like other men which tells him that it is wrong to murder and to steal  yet although he knows this he seldom hesitates to do both when he is tempted thereto  mr wilson was one of those earnest missionaries who go to that wilderness and face its dangers as well as its hardships and sufferings for the sake of teaching the savage that the mere knowledge of right and wrong is not enoughthat the love of god wrought in the heart of man by the holy spirit alone can enable him to resist evil and do goodthat belief in the lord jesus christ alone can save the soul  there are several missionaries of this stampmen who love the name of jesusin that region and there are a number of stations where the good seed of gods word is being planted in the wilderness  but i have not space and this is not the place to enlarge on the great and interesting subject of missionary work in ruperts land  i must return to my narrative  it was as i have said new years day when jasper and marie were married  and a remarkably bright beautiful morning it was  the snow appeared whiter than usual and the countless gems of hoarfrost that hung on shrub and tree seemed to sparkle more than usual even the sun appeared to shine more brightly than ever it did beforeat least it seemed so in the eyes of jasper and marie  everything seems to smile on us today marie said jasper as they stood with some of their friends at the gate of the fort just after the ceremony was concluded  i trust that god may smile on you and bless your union my friends said mr wilson coming forward with a small bible in his hand  here is a copy of gods word jasper which i wish you to accept of and keep as a remembrance of me and of this day  ill keep it sir and i thank you heartily said jasper taking the book and returning the grasp of the missionarys hand  and my chief object in giving it to you jasper is that you and marie may read it often and find joy and peace to your souls  as the missionary said this a faint sound like the tinkling of distant bells was heard in the frosty air  looks of surprise and excitement showed that this was an unwonted sound and so it was for only once or twice during the long winter did a visitor gladden fort erie with his presence  these sweet sounds were the tinkling of sleighbells and they told that a stranger was approachingthat letters perhaps and news from fardistant homes might be near at band  only twice in the year did the europeans at that lonely outpost receive letters from home  little wonder that they longed for them and that they went almost wild with joy when they came  soon the sleigh appeared in sight coming up the river at full speed and a loud hurrah from the men at the gate told the visitor that he was a welcome guest  it was a dogsleigha sort of conveyance much used by the furtraders in winter travelling  in form it was as like as possible to a tin slipper bath  it might also be compared to a shoe if the reader will try to conceive of a shoe large enough to hold a man sitting with his legs out before him that will give him a good idea of the shape of a dog cariole  there is sometimes an ornamental curve in front  it is made of two thin hardwood planks curled up in front with a light framework of wood covered over with deer or buffalo skin and painted in a very gay manner  four dogs are usually harnessed to it and these are quite sufficient to drag a man on a journey of many days over every sort of country where there is no road whatever  dogs are much used for hauling little sledges in that country in winter  the traveller sits wrapped up so completely in furs that nothing but his head is visible  he is attended by a driver on snowshoes who is armed with a large whip  no reins are used  if the snow is hard as is usually the case on the surface of a lake or river the driver walks behind and holds on to a tailline to prevent the dogs from running away  if the travellers way lies through the woods the snow is so soft and deep that the poor dogs are neither willing nor able to run away  it is as much as they can do to walk so the driver goes before them in this case and beats down the snow with his snowshoesbeats the track as it is called  the harness of the dogs is usually very gay and covered with little bells which give forth a cheerful tinkling sound  its young cameron cried mr pemberton hastening forward to welcome the newcomer  cameron was the gentleman in charge of the nearest outposttwo hundred and fifty miles down the river  welcome cameron my boy welcome to fort erie  you are the pleasantest sight we have seen here for many a day said pemberton shaking the young man heartily by the hand as soon as he had jumped out of his sleigh  come pemberton you forget miss marie laroche when you talk of my being the pleasantest sight said cameron laughing  ah true  pardon me marie  excuse me gentlemen interrupted jasper with much gravity i know of no such person as miss marie laroche  how what do you mean said cameron with a puzzled look  jasper is right explained pemberton marie was miss laroche yesterday she is mrs derry today  then i salute you mrs derry and congratulate you both cried the young man kissing the brides fair cheek and i rejoice to find that i am still in time to dance at your wedding  ay said pemberton as they moved up to the hall that reminds me to ask you why you are so late  i expected you before christmas day  i had intended to be here by that day replied cameron but one of my men cut his foot badly with an axe and i could not leave him then my dogs broke down on the journey and that detained me still longer  but you will forgive my being so late i think when i tell you that i have got a packet of letters with me  letters shouted every one  ay letters and newspapers from england  a loud cheer greeted this announcement  the packet was hauled out of the sleigh hurried up to the fort torn open with eager haste and the furtraders of fort erie were soon devouring the contents like hungry men  and they were hungry menthey were starving  those who see their kindred and friends daily or hear from them weekly cannot understand the feelings of men who hear from them only twice in the year  great improvements have taken place in this matter of late years still many of the hudson bay companys outposts are so distant from the civilised world that they cannot get news from home oftener than twice a year  it was a sight to study and moralise overthe countenances of these banished men  the trembling anxiety lest there should be bad news the gleam of joy and the deep thank god on reading all well  then the smiles the sighs the laughs the exclamations of surprise perhaps the tears that would spring to their eyes as they read the brief but to them thrilling private history of the past half year  there was no bad news in that packet and a feeling of deep joy was poured into the hearts of the people of the fort by these good news from a far country  even the halfbreeds and indians who could not share the feeling felt the sweet influence of the general happiness that was diffused among the furtraders on that bright new years day in the wilderness  what a dinner they had that day to be sure  what juicy roasts of buffalo beef what enormous steaks of the same what a magnificent venison pasty and what glorious marrowbonesnot to mention tongues and hearts and grouse and other things  but the great feature of the feast was the plumpudding  it was like a huge cannonball with the measles  there was wine too on this occasion  not much it is true but more than enough for it had been saved up all the year expressly for the christmas and new years festivities  thus they were enabled to drink to absent friends and bring up all the old toasts and songs that used to be so familiar long ago in the old country  but these sturdy traders needed no stimulants  there were one or two who even scorned the wine and stuck to water and to their credit be it said that they toasted and sang with the best of them  at night there was a ball and the ball beat the dinner out of sight few indeed were the women but numerous were the men  indian women are not famous for grace or cleanliness poor things  but they enjoyed the ball and they did their best to dance  such dancing  they seemed to have no joints  they stood up stiff as lampposts and went with an upanddown motion from side to side  but the men did the thing bravely especially the indians  the only dances attempted were scotch reels and the indians tried to copy the furtraders but on finding this somewhat difficult they introduced some surprising steps of their own which threw the others entirely into the shade  there was unfortunately no fiddler but there was a fiddleone made of pine wood by an indian with strings of deerskin sinew  some of the boldest of the party scraped time without regard to tune and our friend heywood beat the kettledrum  the tones of the fiddle at last became so horrible that it was banished altogether and they danced that night to the kettledrum  of course the fair bride was the queen of that ball  her countenance was the light of it and her modest womanly manner had a softening influence on the rough men who surrounded her  when the ball was over a curious thing occurred in the hall in which it had taken place  the room was heated by a stove and as a stove dries the air of a room too much it was customary to keep a pan of water on the stove to moisten it a little  this moisture was increased that night by the steam of the supper and by the wild dancing so that when all was over the walls and ceiling were covered with drops of water during the night this all froze in the form of small beautifullyshaped crystals and in the morning they found themselves in a crystal palace of natures own formation which beat all the crystal palaces that ever were heard ofat least in originality if not in splendour  thus happily ended the marriageday of honest jasper derry and sweet marie laroche and thus pleasantly began the new year of 18  but as surely as darkness follows light and night follows day so surely does sorrow tread on the heels of joy in the history of man  god has so ordained it and he is wise who counts upon experiencing both    chapter thirteen  the conclusion  a week after the events narrated in the last chapter jasper derry was sitting beside the stove in the hall at fort erie smoking his pipe and conversing with his fatherinlaw about his intention of going to lake winnipeg with the brigade in spring and proceeding thence to canada in a bark canoe  of course said he i will take marie with me and if youll take my advice father youll come too  no my son not yet a while said old laroche shaking his head i have a year yet to serve the company before my engagement is out  after that i may come if im spared but you know that the indians are not safe just now and some of them i fear bear me a grudge for theyre a revengeful set  thats true father but supposin that all goes well with you will ye come an live with marie and me  we shall see lad we shall see replied laroche with a pleased smile for the old guide evidently enjoyed the prospect of spending the evening of life in the land of his fathers and under the rooftree of his son and daughter  at that moment the report of a gun was heard outside the house  one of the windowpanes was smashed and at the same instant laroche fell heavily forward on the floor  jasper sprang up and endeavoured to raise him but found that he was insensible  he laid him carefully on his back and hastily opened the breast of his coat  a few drops of blood showed where he had been wounded  meanwhile several of the men who had been attracted by the gunshot so close to the house burst into the room  stand back stand back give him air cried jasper stay o god help us the old man is shot clean through the heart  for one moment jasper looked up with a bewildered glance in the faces of the men then uttering a wild cry of mingled rage and agony he sprang up dashed them aside and catching up his gun and snowshoes rushed out of the house  he soon found a fresh track in the snow and the length of the stride coupled with the manner in which the snow was cast aside and the smaller bushes were broken and trodden down told him that the fugitive had made it  in a moment he was following the track with the utmost speed of which he was capable  he never once halted or faltered or turned aside all that day  his iron frame seemed to be incapable of fatigue  he went with his body bent forward his brows lowering and his lips firmly compressed but he was not successful  the murderer had got a sufficiently long start of him to render what sailors call a stern chase a long one  still jasper never thought of giving up the pursuit until he came suddenly on an open space where the snow had been recently trodden down by a herd of buffaloes and by a band of indians who were in chase of them  here he lost the track and although he searched long and carefully he could not find it  late that night the baffled hunter returned to the fort  you have failedi see by your look said mr pemberton as jasper entered  ay i have failed returned the other gloomily  he must have gone with the band of indians among whose tracks i lost his footsteps  have you any idea who can have done this horrible deed said pemberton  it was darkeye said jasper in a stern voice  some of the indians who chanced to be in the hall were startled and rose on hearing this  be not alarmed friends said the furtrader  you are the guests of christian men  we will not punish you for the deeds of another man of your tribe  how does the white man know that this was done by darkeye asked a chief haughtily  i know it said jasper angrily i feel sure of it but i cannot prove itof course  does arrowhead agree with me  he does replied the indian and there may be proof  does jasper remember the trading store and the bitten bullet  a gleam of intelligence shot across the countenance of the white hunter as his comrade said this  true arrowhead true  he turned as he spoke to the body of his late fatherinlaw and examined the wound  the ball after passing through the heart had lodged in the back just under the skin  see said he to the indians i will cut out this ball but before doing so i will tell how i think it is marked  he then related the incident in the trading store with which the reader is already acquainted and afterwards extracted the ball which although much flattened and knocked out of shape showed clearly the deep marks made by the indians teeth  thus the act which had been done slyly but boastfully before the eyes of a comrade probably as wicked as himself became the means whereby darkeyes guilt was clearly proved  at once a party of his own tribe were directed by their chief to go out in pursuit of the murderer  it were vain for me to endeavour to describe the anguish of poor marie on being deprived of a kind and loving father in so awful and sudden a manner  i will drop a veil over her grief which was too deep and sacred to be intermeddled with  on the day following the murder a band of indians arrived at fort erie with buffalo skins for sale  to the amazement of every one darkeye himself was among them  the wily savageknowing that his attempting to quit that part of the country as a fugitive would be certain to fix suspicion on him as the murdererresolved to face the furtraders as if he were ignorant of the deed which had been done  by the very boldness of this step he hoped to disarm suspicion but he forgot the bitten ball  it was therefore a look of genuine surprise that rose to darkeyes visage when the moment he entered the fort mr pemberton seized him by the right arm and led him into the hall  at first he attempted to seize the handle of his knife but a glance at the numbers of the white men and the indifference of his own friends showed him that his best chance lay in cunning  the indians who had arrived with him were soon informed by the others of the cause of this and all of them crowded into the hall to watch the proceedings  the body of poor laroche was laid on a table and darkeye was led up to it  the cunning indian put on a pretended look of surprise on beholding it and then the usual expression of stolid gravity settled on his face as he turned to mr pemberton for information  your hand did this said the furtrader  is darkeye a dog that he should slay an old man said the savage  no youre not a dog cried jasper fiercely you are worsea cowardly murderer  stand back jasper said mr pemberton laying his hand on the shoulder of the excited hunter and thrusting him firmly away  this is a serious charge  the indian shall not be hastily condemned  he shall have fair play and justice  good cried several of the indians on hearing this  meanwhile the principal chief of the tribe took up his stand close beside the prisoner  darkeye said mr pemberton while he looked steadfastly into the eyes of the indian who returned the look as steadilydarkeye do you remember a conversation you had many weeks ago in the trading store at jaspers house  the countenance of the indian was instantly troubled and he said with some hesitation darkeye has had many conversations in that store is he a medicineman a conjurer that he should know what you mean  i will only put one other question said the furtrader  do you know this bullet with the marks of teeth in it  darkeyes visage fell at once  he became deadly pale and his limbs trembled  he was about to speak when the chief who had hitherto stood in silence at his side suddenly whirled his tomahawk in the air and bringing it down on the murderers skull cleft him to the chin  a fierce yell followed this act and several scalping knives reached the dead mans heart before his body fell to the ground  the scene that followed was terrible  the savages were roused to a state of frenzy and for a moment the white men feared an attack but the anger of the indians was altogether directed against their dead comrade who had been disliked by his people while his poor victim laroche had been a universal favourite  seizing the body of darkeye they carried it down to the banks of the river hooting and yelling as they went hacked and cut it nearly to pieces and then kindling a large fire they threw the mangled corpse into it and burned it to ashes  it was long before the shadow of this dark cloud passed away from fort erie and it was longer still before poor marie recovered her wonted cheerfulness  but the presence of mr wilson did much to comfort her gradually time softened the pang and healed the wound  and now little remains to be told  winter passed away and spring came and when the rivers and lakes were sufficiently free from ice the brigade of boats left fort erie laden with furs for the seacoast  on arriving at lake winnipeg jasper obtained a small canoe and placing his wife and heywood in the middle of it he and arrowhead took the paddles seated themselves in the bow and stern and guided their frail bark through many hundreds of miles of wildernessover many a rough portage across many a beautiful lake and up many a roaring torrent until finally they arrived in canada  here jasper settled  his farm prosperedhis family increased  sturdy boys in course of time ploughed the land and blooming daughters tended the dairy  yet jasper derry did not cease to toil  he was one of those men who feel that they were made to work and that much happiness flows from working  he often used to say that if it was gods will he would like to die in harness  jaspers only weakness was the pipe  it stuck to him and he stuck to it to the last  marie in course of time came to tolerate it and regularly filled it for him every night  evening was the time when the inmates of erie cottage as their residence was named enjoyed themselves most for it was then that the stalwart sons and the blooming daughters circled round the great fire of wood that roared on winter nights up the chimney and it was then that jasper received his pipe from his still goodlooking though rather stout marie and began to spin yarns about his young days  at this time too it was that the door would frequently open and a rugged old indian would stalk in like a mahogany ghost and squat down in front of the fire  he was often followed by a tall thin old gentleman who was extremely excitable but goodhumoured  jasper greeted these two remarkable looking men by the names of arrowhead and heywood  and glad were the young people when they saw their wrinkled faces for then they knew from experience their old father would become more lively than usual and would go on for hours talking of all the wonders and dangers that he had seen and encountered long long ago when he and his two friends were away in the wilderness  the end
