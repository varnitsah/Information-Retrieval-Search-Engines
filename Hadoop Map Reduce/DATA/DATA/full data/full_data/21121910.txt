21121910	a double barrelled detective story  by mark twain     part i       we ought never to do wrong when people are looking     i  the first scene is in the country in virginia the time 1880 there has been a wedding between a handsome young man of slender means and a rich young girla case of love at first sight and a precipitate marriage a marriage bitterly opposed by the girls widowed father  jacob fuller the bridegroom is twentysix years old is of an old but unconsidered family which had by compulsion emigrated from sedgemoor and for king jamess purses profit so everybody saidsome maliciously the rest merely because they believed it the bride is nineteen and beautiful she is intense highstrung romantic immeasurably proud of her cavalier blood and passionate in her love for her young husband for its sake she braved her fathers displeasure endured his reproaches listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions and went from his house without his blessing proud and happy in the proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had made its home in her heart  the morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her her husband put aside her proffered caresses and said  sit down i have something to say to you i loved you that was before i asked your father to give you to me his refusal is not my grievancei could have endured that but the things he said of me to youthat is a different matter thereyou neednt speak i know quite well what they were i got them from authentic sources among other things he said that my character was written in my face that i was treacherous a dissembler a coward and a brute without sense of pity or compassion the sedgemoor trademark he called itand whitesleeve badge any other man in my place would have gone to his house and shot him down like a dog i wanted to do it and was minded to do it but a better thought came to me to put him to shame to break his heart to kill him by inches how to do it through my treatment of you his idol i would marry you and thenhave patience you will see  from that moment onward for three months the young wife suffered all the humiliations all the insults all the miseries that the diligent and inventive mind of the husband could contrive save physical injuries only her strong pride stood by her and she kept the secret of her troubles now and then the husband said why dont you go to your father and tell him then he invented new tortures applied them and asked again she always answered he shall never know by my mouth and taunted him with his origin said she was the lawful slave of a scion of slaves and must obey and wouldup to that point but no further he could kill her if he liked but he could not break her it was not in the sedgemoor breed to do it at the end of the three months he said with a dark significance in his manner i have tried all things but oneand waited for her reply try that she said and curled her lip in mockery  that night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes then said to her  get up and dress  she obeyedas always without a word he led her half a mile from the house and proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public road and succeeded she screaming and struggling he gagged her then struck her across the face with his cowhide and set his bloodhounds on her they tore the clothes off her and she was naked he called the dogs off and said  you will be foundby the passing public they will be dropping along about three hours from now and will spread the newsdo you hear goodby you have seen the last of me  he went away then she moaned to herself  i shall bear a childto him god grant it may be a boy  the farmers released her byandbyand spread the news which was natural they raised the country with lynching intentions but the bird had flown the young wife shut herself up in her fathers house he shut himself up with her and thenceforth would see no one his pride was broken and his heart so he wasted away day by day and even his daughter rejoiced when death relieved him  then she sold the estate and disappeared     ii  in 1886 a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded new england village with no company but a little boy about five years old she did her own work she discouraged acquaintanceships and had none the butcher the baker and the others that served her could tell the villagers nothing about her further than that her name was stillman and that she called the child archy whence she came they had not been able to find out but they said she talked like a southerner the child had no playmates and no comrade and no teacher but the mother she taught him diligently and intelligently and was satisfied with the resultseven a little proud of them one day archy said  mamma am i different from other children  well i suppose not why  there was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had been by and i said yes and she said how long since i saw him and i said i hadnt seen him at all and she said how did i know hed been by then and i said because i smelt his track on the sidewalk and she said i was a dum fool and made a mouth at me what did she do that for  the young woman turned white and said to herself its a birthmark the gift of the bloodhound is in him she snatched the boy to her breast and hugged him passionately saying god has appointed the way her eyes were burning with a fierce light and her breath came short and quick with excitement she said to herself the puzzle is solved now many a time it has been a mystery to me the impossible things the child has done in the dark but it is all clear to me now  she set him in his small chair and said  wait a little till i come dear then we will talk about the matter  she went up to her room and took from her dressingtable several small articles and put them out of sight a nailfile on the floor under the bed a pair of nailscissors under the bureau a small ivory paperknife under the wardrobe then she returned and said  there i have left some things which i ought to have brought down she named them and said run up and bring them dear  the child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the things  did you have any difficulty dear  no mamma i only went where you went  during his absence she had stepped to the bookcase taken several books from the bottom shelf opened each passed her hand over a page noting its number in her memory then restored them to their places now she said  i have been doing something while you have been gone archy do you think you can find out what it was  the boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been touched and opened them at the pages which had been stroked  the mother took him in her lap and said  i will answer your question now dear i have found out that in one way you are quite different from other people you can see in the dark you can smell what other people cannot you have the talents of a bloodhound they are good and valuable things to have but you must keep the matter a secret if people found it out they would speak of you as an odd child a strange child and children would be disagreeable to you and give you nicknames in this world one must be like everybody else if he doesnt want to provoke scorn or envy or jealousy it is a great and fine distinction which has been born to you and i am glad but you will keep it a secret for mammas sake wont you  the child promised without understanding  all the rest of the day the mothers brain was busy with excited thinkings with plans projects schemes each and all of them uncanny grim and dark yet they lit up her face lit it with a fell light of their own lit it with vague fires of hell she was in a fever of unrest she could not sit stand read sew there was no relief for her but in movement she tested her boys gift in twenty ways and kept saying to herself all the time with her mind in the past he broke my fathers heart and night and day all these years i have tried and all in vain to think out a way to break his i have found it nowi have found it now  when night fell the demon of unrest still possessed her she went on with her tests with a candle she traversed the house from garret to cellar hiding pins needles thimbles spools under pillows under carpets in cracks in the walls under the coal in the bin then sent the little fellow in the dark to find them which he did and was happy and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses  from this time forward life took on a new complexion for her she said the future is securei can wait and enjoy the waiting the most of her lost interests revived she took up music again and languages drawing painting and the other longdiscarded delights of her maidenhood she was happy once more and felt again the zest of life as the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy and was contented with it not altogether but nearly that the soft side of his heart was larger than the other side of it it was his only defect in her eyes but she considered that his love for her and worship of her made up for it he was a good haterthat was well but it was a question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a quality as those of his friendshipsand that was not so well   the years drifted on archy was become a handsome shapely athletic youth courteous dignified companionable pleasant in his ways and looking perhaps a trifle older than he was which was sixteen one evening his mother said she had something of grave importance to say to him adding that he was old enough to hear it now and old enough and possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern plan which she had been for years contriving and maturing then she told him her bitter story in all its naked atrociousness for a while the boy was paralyzed then he said  i understand we are southerners and by our custom and nature there is but one atonement i will search him out and kill him  kill him no death is release emancipation death is a favor do i owe him favors you must not hurt a hair of his head  the boy was lost in thought awhile then he said  you are all the world to me and your desire is my law and my pleasure tell me what to do and i will do it  the mothers eyes beamed with satisfaction and she said  you will go and find him i have known his hidingplace for eleven years it cost me five years and more of inquiry and much money to locate it he is a quartzminer in colorado and welltodo he lives in denver his name is jacob fuller thereit is the first time i have spoken it since that unforgettable night think that name could have been yours if i had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner one you will drive him from that place you will hunt him down and drive him again and yet again and again and again persistently relentlessly poisoning his life filling it with mysterious terrors loading it with weariness and misery making him wish for death and that he had a suicides courage you will make of him another wandering jew he shall know no rest any more no peace of mind no placid sleep you shall shadow him cling to him persecute him till you break his heart as he broke my fathers and mine  i will obey mother  i believe it my child the preparations are all made everything is ready here is a letter of credit spend freely there is no lack of money at times you may need disguises i have provided them also some other conveniences she took from the drawer of the typewritertable several squares of paper they all bore these typewritten words                             10000 reward  it is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an eastern state is sojourning here in 1880 in the night he tied his young wife to a tree by the public road cut her across the face with a cowhide and made his dogs tear her clothes from her leaving her naked he left her there and fled the country a bloodrelative of hers has searched for him for seventeen years address  postoffice the above reward will be paid in cash to the person who will furnish the seeker in a personal interview the criminals address  when you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent you will go in the night and placard one of these upon the building he occupies and another one upon the postoffice or in some other prominent place it will be the talk of the region at first you must give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at something approaching their value we will ruin him byandby but gradually we must not impoverish him at once for that could bring him to despair and injure his health possibly kill him  she took three or four more typewritten forms from the drawerduplicatesand read one        18      to jacob fuller  you have days in which to settle your affairs you will not be disturbed during that limit which will expire at  m on the of you must then move on if you are still in the place after the named hour i will placard you on all the dead walls detailing your crime once more and adding the date also the scene of it with all names concerned including your own have no fear of bodily injuryit will in no circumstances ever be inflicted upon you you brought misery upon an old man and ruined his life and broke his heart what he suffered you are to suffer  you will add no signature he must receive this before he learns of the rewardplacardbefore he rises in the morninglest he lose his head and fly the place penniless  i shall not forget  you will need to use these forms only in the beginningonce may be enough afterward when you are ready for him to vanish out of a place see that he gets a copy of this form which merely says                move on  you have  days  he will obey that is sure     iii  extracts from letters to the mother  denver april 3 1897 i have now been living several days in the same hotel with jacob fuller i have his scent i could track him through ten divisions of infantry and find him i have often been near him and heard him talk he owns a good mine and has a fair income from it but he is not rich he learned mining in a good wayby working at it for wages he is a cheerful creature and his fortythree years sit lightly upon him he could pass for a younger mansay thirtysix or thirtyseven he has never married againpasses himself off for a widower he stands well is liked is popular and has many friends even i feel a drawing toward himthe paternal blood in me making its claim how blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of naturethe most of them in fact my task is become hard nowyou realize it you comprehend and make allowancesand the fire of it has cooled more than i like to confess to myself but i will carry it out even with the pleasure paled the duty remains and i will not spare him  and for my help a sharp resentment rises in me when i reflect that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it the lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character and in the change he is happy he the guilty party is absolved from all suffering you the innocent are borne down with it but be comfortedhe shall harvest his share   silver gulch may 19 i placarded form no 1 at midnight of april 3 an hour later i slipped form no 2 under his chamber door notifying him to leave denver at or before 1150 the night of the 14th  some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards then hunted the town over and found the other one and stole that in this manner he accomplished what the profession call a scoopthat is he got a valuable item and saw to it that no other paper got it and so his paperthe principal one in the townhad it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning followed by a vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to our reward on the papers account the journals out here know how to do the noble thingwhen theres business in it  at breakfast i occupied my usual seatselected because it afforded a view of papa fullers face and was near enough for me to hear the talk that went on at his table seventyfive or a hundred people were in the room and all discussing that item and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence from the townwith a rail or a bullet or something  when fuller came in he had the notice to leavefolded upin one hand and the newspaper in the other and it gave me more than half a pang to see him his cheerfulness was all gone and he looked old and pinched and ashy and thenonly think of the things he had to listen to mamma he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and phrasebooks of satans own authorized editions down below and more than that he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them his applause tasted bitter in his mouth though he could not disguise that from me and it was observable that his appetite was gone he only nibbled he couldnt eat finally a man said  it is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel i hope so  ah dear it was pitiful the way fuller winced and glanced around scared he couldnt endure any more and got up and left  during several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in mexico and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could and give the property his personal attention he played his cards well said he would take 40000a quarter in cash the rest in safe notes but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase he would diminish his terms for cash in full he sold out for 30000 and then what do you think he did he asked for greenbacks and took them saying the man in mexico was a newenglander with a head full of crotchets and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts people thought it queer since a draft on new york could produce greenbacks quite conveniently there was talk of this odd thing but only for a day that is as long as any topic lasts in denver  i was watching all the time as soon as the sale was completed and the money paidwhich was on the 11thi began to stick to fullers track without dropping it for a moment that nightno 12th for it was a little past midnighti tracked him to his room which was four doors from mine in the same hall then i went back and put on my muddy daylaborer disguise darkened my complexion and sat down in my room in the gloom with a gripsack handy with a change in it and my door ajar for i suspected that the bird would take wing now in half an hour an old woman passed by carrying a grip i caught the familiar whiff and followed with my grip for it was fuller he left the hotel by a side entrance and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness and got into a twohorse hack which of course was waiting for him by appointment i took a seat uninvited on the trunk platform behind and we drove briskly off we drove ten miles and the hack stopped at a way station and was discharged fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under the awning as far as he could get from the light i went inside and watched the ticketoffice fuller bought no ticket i bought none presently the train came along and he boarded a car i entered the same car at the other end and came down the aisle and took the seat behind him when he paid the conductor and named his objective point i dropped back several seats while the conductor was changing a bill and when he came to me i paid to the same placeabout a hundred miles westward  from that time for a week on end he led me a dance he travelled here and there and yonderalways on a general westward trendbut he was not a woman after the first day he was a laborer like myself and wore bushy false whiskers his outfit was perfect and he could do the character without thinking about it for he had served the trade for wages his nearest friend could not have recognized him at last he located himself here the obscurest little mountain camp in montana he has a shanty and goes out prospecting daily is gone all day and avoids society i am living at a miners boardinghouse and it is an awful place the bunks the food the dirteverything  we have been here four weeks and in that time i have seen him but once but every night i go over his track and post myself as soon as he engaged a shanty here i went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that denver hotel to keep my baggage till i should send for it i need nothing here but a change of army shirts and i brought that with me   silver gulch june 12  the denver episode has never found its way here i think i know the most of the men in camp and they have never referred to it at least in my hearing fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions he has located a claim two miles away in an outoftheway place in the mountains it promises very well and he is working it diligently ah but the change in him he never smiles and he keeps quite to himself consorting with no onehe who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago i have seen him passing along several times recentlydrooping forlorn the spring gone from his step a pathetic figure he calls himself david wilson  i can trust him to remain here until we disturb him since you insist i will banish him again but i do not see how he can be unhappier than he already is i will go hack to denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort and edible food and endurable beds and bodily decency then i will fetch my things and notify poor papa wilson to move on   denver june 19  they miss him here they all hope he is prospering in mexico and they do not say it just with their mouths but out of their hearts you know you can always tell i am loitering here overlong i confess it but if you were in my place you would have charity for me yes i know what you will say and you are right if i were in your place and carried your scalding memories in my heart  i will take the night train back tomorrow   denver june 20  god forgive us mother we are hunting the wrong man i have not slept any all night i am now awaiting at dawn for the morning trainand how the minutes drag how they drag  this jacob fuller is a cousin of the guilty one how stupid we have been not to reflect that the guilty one would never again wear his own name after that fiendish deed the denver fuller is four years younger than the other one he came here a young widower in 79 aged twentyonea year before you were married and the documents to prove it are innumerable last night i talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his arrival i said nothing but a few days from now i will land him in this town again with the loss upon his mine made good and there will be a banquet and a torchlight procession and there will not be any expense on anybody but me do you call this gush i am only a boy as you well know it is my privilege byandby i shall not be a boy any more   silver gulch july 3  mother he is gone gone and left no trace the scent was cold when i came today i am out of bed for the first time since i wish i were not a boy then i could stand shocks better they all think he went west i start tonight in a wagontwo or three hours of that then i get a train i dont know where im going but i must go to try to keep still would be torture  of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise this means that i may have to search the whole globe to find him indeed it is what i expect do you see mother it is i that am the wandering jew the irony of it we arranged that for another  think of the difficulties and there would be none if i only could advertise for him but if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him i have not been able to think it out and i have tried till my brains are addled if the gentleman who lately bought a mine in mexico and sold one in denver will send his address to to whom mother it will be explained to him that it was all a mistake his forgiveness will be asked and full reparation made for a loss which he sustained in a certain matter do you see he would think it a trap well any one would if i should say it is now known that he was not the man wanted but another mana man who once bore the same name but discarded it for good reasonswould that answer but the denver people would wake up then and say oho and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks and say why did he run away if he wasnt the right manit is too thin if i failed to find him he would be ruined therethere where there is no taint upon him now you have a better head than mine help me  i have one clue and only one i know his handwriting if he puts his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much it will be valuable to me if i ever run across it   san francisco june 28 1898  you already know how well i have searched the states from colorado to the pacific and how nearly i came to getting him once well i have had another close miss it was here yesterday i struck his trail hot on the street and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel that was a costly mistake a dog would have gone the other way but i am only part dog and can get very humanly stupid when excited he had been stopping in that house ten days i almost know now that he stops long nowhere the past six or eight months but is restless and has to keep moving i understand that feeling and i know what it is to feel it he still uses the name he had registered when i came so near catching him nine months agojames walker doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from silver gulch an unpretending man and has small taste for fancy names i recognized the hand easily through its slight disguise a square man and not good at shams and pretenses  they said he was just gone on a journey left no address didnt say where he was going looked frightened when asked to leave his address had no baggage but a cheap valise carried it off on foota stingy old person and not much loss to the house old i suppose he is now i hardly heard i was there but a moment i rushed along his trail and it led me to a wharf mother the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon i should have saved half an hour if i had gone in the right direction at first i could have taken a fast tug and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel she is bound for melbourne   hope canyon california october 3 1900  you have a right to complain a letter a year is a paucity i freely acknowledge it but how can one write when there is nothing to write about but failures no one can keep it up it breaks the heart  i told youit seems ages ago nowhow i missed him at melbourne and then chased him all over australasia for months on end  well then after that i followed him to india almost saw him in bombay traced him all aroundto baroda rawalpindi lucknow lahore cawnpore allahabad calcutta madrasoh everywhere week after week month after month through the dust and swelteralways approximately on his track sometimes close upon him yet never catching him and down to ceylon and then tonever mind byandby i will write it all out  i chased him home to california and down to mexico and back again to california since then i have been hunting him about the state from the first of last january down to a month ago i feel almost sure he is not far from hope canyon i traced him to a point thirty miles from here but there i lost the trail some one gave him a lift in a wagon i suppose  i am taking a rest nowmodified by searchings for the lost trail i was tired to death mother and lowspirited and sometimes coming uncomfortably near to losing hope but the miners in this little camp are good fellows and i am used to their sort this long time back and their breezy ways freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles i have been here a month i am cabining with a young fellow named sammy hillyer about twentyfive the only son of his motherlike meand loves her dearly and writes to her every weekpart of which is like me he is a timid body and in the matter of intellectwell he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire but no matter he is well liked he is good and fine and it is meat and bread and rest and luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again i wish james walker could have it he had friends he liked company that brings up that picture of him the time that i saw him last the pathos of it it comes before me often and often at that very time poor thing i was girding up my conscience to make him move on again  hillyers heart is better than mine better than anybodys in the community i suppose for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the campflint bucknerand the only man flint ever talks with or allows to talk with him he says he knows flints history and that it is trouble that has made him what he is and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can now none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like flint buckner from all i hear about him outside i think that this one detail will give you a better idea of sammys character than any laboredout description i could furnish you of him in one of our talks he said something about like this flint is a kinsman of mine and he pours out all his troubles to meempties his breast from time to time or i reckon it would burst there couldnt be any unhappier man archy stillman his life had been made up of misery of mindhe isnt near as old as he looks he has lost the feel of reposefulness and peaceoh years and years ago he doesnt know what good luck isnever has had any often says he wishes he was in the other hell he is so tired of this one     iv        no real gentleman will tell the naked truth      in the presence of ladies  it was a crisp and spicy morning in early october the lilacs and laburnums lit with the gloryfires of autumn hung burning and flashing in the upper air a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless wild things that have their homes in the treetops and would visit together the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of the woodland the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing everywhere brooded stillness serenity and the peace of god  october is the time1900 hope canyon is the place a silvermining camp away down in the esmeralda region it is a secluded spot high and remote recent as to discovery thought by its occupants to be rich in metala year or twos prospecting will decide that matter one way or the other for inhabitants the camp has about two hundred miners one white woman and child several chinese washermen five squaws and a dozen vagrant buck indians in rabbitskin robes battered plug hats and tincan necklaces there are no mills as yet there is no church no newspaper the camp has existed but two years it has made no big strike the world is ignorant of its name and place  on both sides of the canyon the mountains rise walllike three thousand feet and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom gets a kiss from the sun only once a day when he sails over at noon the village is a couple of miles long the cabins stand well apart from each other the tavern is the only frame housethe only house one might say it occupies a central position and is the evening resort of the population they drink there and play sevenup and dominoes also billiards for there is a table crossed all over with torn places repaired with courtplaster there are some cues but no leathers some chipped balls which clatter when they run and do not slow up gradually but stop suddenly and sit down there is part of a cube of chalk with a projecting jag of flint in it and the man who can score six on a single break can set up the drinks at the bars expense  flint buckners cabin was the last one of the village going south his silverclaim was at the other end of the village northward and a little beyond the last hut in that direction he was a sour creature unsociable and had no companionships people who had tried to get acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him his history was not known some believed that sammy hillyer knew it others said no if asked hillyer said no he was not acquainted with it flint had a meek english youth of sixteen or seventeen with him whom he treated roughly both in public and in private and of course this lad was applied to for information but with no success fetlock jonesthe name of the youthsaid that flint picked him up on a prospecting tramp and as he had neither home nor friends in america he had found it wise to stay and take buckners hard usage for the sake of the salary which was bacon and beans further than this he could offer no testimony  fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now and under his meek exterior he was slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and humiliations which his master had put upon him for the meek suffer bitterly from these hurts more bitterly perhaps than do the manlier sort who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the limit of endurance has been reached goodhearted people wanted to help fetlock out of his trouble and tried to get him to leave buckner but the boy showed fright at the thought and said he dasnt pat riley urged him and said  you leave the damned hunks and come with me dont you be afraid ill take care of him  the boy thanked him with tears in his eyes but shuddered and said he dasnt risk it he said flint would catch him alone some time in the night and thenoh it makes me sick mr riley to think of it  others said run away from him well stake you skip out for the coast some night but all these suggestions failed he said flint would hunt him down and fetch him back just for meanness  the people could not understand this the boys miseries went steadily on week after week it is quite likely that the people would have understood if they had known how he was employing his spare time he slept in an outcabin near flints and there nights he nursed his bruises and his humiliations and studied and studied over a single problemhow he could murder flint buckner and not be found out it was the only joy he had in life these hours were the only ones in the twentyfour which he looked forward to with eagerness and spent in happiness  he thought of poison nothat would not serve the inquest would reveal where it was procured and who had procured it he thought of a shot in the back in a lonely place when flint would be homewardbound at midnighthis unvarying hour for the trip nosomebody might be near and catch him he thought of stabbing him in his sleep nohe might strike an inefficient blow and flint would seize him he examined a hundred different waysnone of them would answer for in even the very obscurest and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a risk a chance a possibility that he might be found out he would have none of that  but he was patient endlessly patient there was no hurry he said to himself he would never leave flint till he left him a corpse there was no hurryhe would find the way it was somewhere and he would endure shame and pain and misery until he found it yes somewhere there was a way which would leave not a trace not even the faintest clue to the murdererthere was no hurryhe would find that way and thenoh then it would just be good to be alive meantime he would diligently keep up his reputation for meekness and also as always theretofore he would allow no one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about his oppressor  two days before the beforementioned october morning flint had bought some things and he and fetlock had brought them home to flints cabin a fresh box of candles which they put in the corner a tin can of blastingpowder which they placed upon the candlebox a keg of blastingpowder which they placed under flints bunk a huge coil of fuse which they hung on a peg fetlock reasoned that flints mining operations had outgrown the pick and that blasting was about to begin now he had seen blasting done and he had a notion of the process but he had never helped in it his conjecture was rightblastingtime had come in the morning the pair carried fuse drills and the powdercan to the shaft it was now eight feet deep and to get into it and out of it a short ladder was used they descended and by command fetlock held the drillwithout any instructions as to the right way to hold itand flint proceeded to strike the sledge came down the drill sprang out of fetlocks hand almost as a matter of course  you mangy son of a nigger is that any way to hold a drill pick it up stand it up therehold fast dyou ill teach you  at the end of an hour the drilling was finished  now then charge it  the boy started to pour in the powder  idiot  a heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out  get up you cant lie snivelling there now then stick in the fuse first now put in the powder hold on hold on are you going to fill the hole all up of all the sapheaded milksops iput in some dirt put in some gravel tamp it down hold on hold on oh great scott get out of the way he snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend then he fired the fuse climbed out of the shaft and ran fifty yards away fetlock following they stood waiting a few minutes then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion after a little there was a shower of descending stones then all was serene again  i wish to god youd been in it remarked the master  they went down the shaft cleaned it out drilled another hole and put in another charge  look here how much fuse are you proposing to waste dont you know how to time a fuse  no sir  you dont well if you dont beat anything i ever saw  he climbed out of the shaft and spoke down  well idiot are you going to be all day cut the fuse and light it  the trembling creature began  if you please sir i  you talk back to me cut it and light it  the boy cut and lit  gerreat scott a oneminute fuse i wish you were in  in his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran the boy was aghast  oh my god help help oh save me he implored oh what can i do what can i do  he backed against the wall as tightly as he could the sputtering fuse frightened the voice out of him his breath stood still he stood gazing and impotent in two seconds three seconds four he would be flying toward the sky torn to fragments then he had an inspiration he sprang at the fuse severed the inch of it that was left above ground and was saved  he sank down limp and half lifeless with fright his strength all gone but he muttered with a deep joy  he has learnt me i knew there was a way if i would wait  after a matter of five minutes buckner stole to the shaft looking worried and uneasy and peered down into it he took in the situation he saw what had happened he lowered the ladder and the boy dragged himself weakly up it he was very white his appearance added something to buckners uncomfortable state and he said with a show of regret and sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice  it was an accident you know dont say anything about it to anybody i was excited and didnt notice what i was doing youre not looking well youve worked enough for today go down to my cabin and eat what you want and rest its just an accident you know on account of my being excited  it scared me said the lad as he started away but i learnt something so i dont mind it  damned easy to please muttered buckner following him with his eye i wonder if hell tell mightnt he i wish it had killed him  the boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting he employed it in work eager and feverish and happy work a thick growth of chaparral extended down the mountainside clear to flints cabin the most of fetlocks labor was done in the dark intricacies of that stubborn growth the rest of it was done in his own shanty at last all was complete and he said  if hes got any suspicions that im going to tell on him he wont keep them long tomorrow he will see that i am the same milksop as i always wasall day and the next and the day after tomorrow night there ll be an end of him nobody will ever guess who finished him up nor how it was done he dropped me the idea his own self and thats odd     v  the next day came and went  it is now almost midnight and in five minutes the new morning will begin the scene is in the tavern billiardroom rough men in rough clothing slouchhats breeches stuffed into boottops some with vests none with coats are grouped about the boileriron stove which has ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth the billiardballs are clacking there is no other soundthat is within the wind is fitfully moaning without the men look bored also expectant a hulking broadshouldered miner of middle age with grizzled whiskers and an unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face rises slips a coil of fuse upon his arm gathers up some other personal properties and departs without word or greeting to anybody it is flint buckner as the door closes behind him a buzz of talk breaks out  the regularest man that ever was said jake parker the blacksmith you can tell when its twelve just by him leaving without looking at your waterbury  and its the only virtue hes got as fur as i know said peter hawes miner  hes just a blight on this society said wellsfargos man ferguson if i was running this shop id make him say something some time or other or vamos the ranch this with a suggestive glance at the barkeeper who did not choose to see it since the man under discussion was a good customer and went home pretty well set up every night with refreshments furnished from the bar  say said ham sandwich miner does any of you boys ever recollect of him asking you to take a drink  him flint buckner oh laura  this sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one form of words or another from the crowd after a brief silence pat riley miner said  hes the 15puzzle that cuss and his boys another one i cant make them out  nor anybody else said ham sandwich and if they are 15puzzles how are you going to rank up that other one when it comes to a 1 rightdown solid mysteriousness he lays over both of them easydont he  you bet  everybody said it every man but one he was the newcomerpeterson he ordered the drinks all round and asked who no 3 might be all answered at once archy stillman  is he a mystery asked peterson  is he a mystery is archy stillman a mystery said wellsfargos man ferguson why the fourth dimensions foolishness to him  for ferguson was learned  peterson wanted to hear all about him everybody wanted to tell him everybody began but billy stevens the barkeeper called the house to order and said one at a time was best he distributed the drinks and appointed ferguson to lead ferguson said  well hes a boy and that is just about all we know about him you can pump him till you are tired it aint any use you wont get anything at least about his intentions or line of business or where hes from and such things as that and as for getting at the nature and getup of his main big chief mystery why hell just change the subject thats all you can guess till youre black in the faceits your privilegebut suppose you do where do you arrive at nowhere as near as i can make out  what is his big chief one  sight maybe hearing maybe instinct maybe magic maybe take your choicegrownups twentyfive children and servants half price now ill tell you what he can do you can start here and just disappear you can go and hide wherever you want to i dont care where it is nor how farand hell go straight and put his finger on you  you dont mean it  i just do though weathers nothing to himelemental conditions is nothing to himhe dont even take notice of them  oh come dark rain snow hey  its all the same to him he dont give a damn  oh sayincluding fog peraps  fog hes got an eye t can plunk through it like a bullet  now boys honor bright whats he giving me  its a fact they all shouted go on wellsfargo  well sir you can leave him here chatting with the boys and you can slip out and go to any cabin in this camp and open a bookyes sir a dozen of themand take the page in your memory and hell start out and go straight to that cabin and open every one of them books at the right page and call it off and never make a mistake  he must be the devil  more than one has thought it now ill tell you a perfectly wonderful thing that he done the other night he  there was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside the door flew open and an excited crowd burst in with the camps one white woman in the lead and crying  my child my child shes lost and gone for the love of god help me to find archy stillman weve hunted everywhere  said the barkeeper  sit down sit down mrs hogan and dont worry he asked for a bed three hours ago tuckered out tramping the trails the way hes always doing and went upstairs ham sandwich run up and roust him out hes in no 14  the youth was soon downstairs and ready he asked mrs hogan for particulars  bless you dear there aint any i wish there was i put her to sleep at seven in the evening and when i went in there an hour ago to go to bed myself she was gone i rushed for your cabin dear and you wasnt there and ive hunted for you ever since at every cabin down the gulch and now ive come up again and im that distracted and scared and heartbroke but thanks to god ive found you at last dear heart and youll find my child come on come quick  move right along im with you madam go to your cabin first  the whole company streamed out to join the hunt all the southern half of the village was up a hundred men strong and waiting outside a vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns the mass fell into columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders in a few minutes the hogan cabin was reached  theres the bunk said mrs hogan theres where she was its where i laid her at seven oclock but where she is now god only knows  hand me a lantern said archy he set it on the hard earth floor and knelt by it pretending to examine the ground closely heres her track he said touching the ground here and there and yonder with his finger do you see  several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best to see one or two thought they discerned something like a track the others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover one said maybe a childs foot could make a mark on it but i dont see how  young stillman stepped outside held the light to the ground turned leftward and moved three steps closely examining then said ive got the directioncome along take the lantern somebody  he strode off swiftly southward the files following swaying and bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge thus a mile and the mouth of the gorge was reached before them stretched the sagebrush plain dim vast and vague stillman called a halt saying we mustnt start wrong now we must take the direction again  he took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards then said come on its all right and gave up the lantern in and out among the sagebushes he marched a quarter of a mile bearing gradually to the right then took a new direction and made another great semicircle then changed again and moved due west nearly half a mileand stopped  she gave it up here poor little chap hold the lantern you can see where she sat  but this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel and no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that could detect the track of a cushion on a veneer like that the bereaved mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot lamenting  but where is she then some one said she didnt stay here we can see that much anyway  stillman moved about in a circle around the place with the lantern pretending to hunt for tracks  well he said presently in an annoyed tone i dont understand it he examined again no use she was herethats certain she never walked away from hereand thats certain its a puzzle i cant make it out  the mother lost heart then  oh my god oh blessed virgin some flying beast has got her ill never see her again  ah dont give up said archy well find herdont give up  god bless you for the words archy stillman and she seized his hand and kissed it fervently  peterson the newcomer whispered satirically in fergusons ear  wonderful performance to find this place wasnt it hardly worth while to come so far though any other supposititious place would have answered just as wellhey  ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo he said with some warmth  do you mean to insinuate that the child hasnt been here i tell you the child has been here now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a little fuss as  all right sang out stillman come everybody and look at this it was right under our noses all the time and we didnt see it  there was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child was alleged to have rested and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to see the thing that archys finger was resting upon there was a pause then a severalbarrelled sigh of disappointment pat riley and ham sandwich said in the one breath  what is it archy theres nothing here  nothing do you call that nothing and he swiftly traced upon the ground a form with his finger theredont you recognize it now its injun billys track hes got the child  god be praised from the mother  take away the lantern ive got the direction follow  he started on a run racing in and out among the sagebushes a matter of three hundred yards and disappeared over a sandwave the others struggled after him caught him up and found him waiting ten steps away was a little wickieup a dim and formless shelter of rags and old horseblankets a dull light showing through its chinks  you lead mrs hogan said the lad its your privilege to be first  all followed the sprint she made for the wickieup and saw with her the picture its interior afforded injun billy was sitting on the ground the child was asleep beside him the mother hugged it with a wild embrace which included archy stillman the grateful tears running down her face and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a golden stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in full richness nowhere but in the irish heart  i find her bymeby it is ten oclock billy explained she sleep out yonder vey tiredface wet been cryin spose fetch her home feed her she heap much hungrygo sleep gin  in her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him too calling him the angel of god in disguise and he probably was in disguise if he was that kind of an official he was dressed for the character  at half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village singing when johnny comes marching home waving its lanterns and swallowing the drinks that were brought out all along its course it concentrated at the tavern and made a night of what was left of the morning      part ii     i  the next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense sensation a grave and dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and appearance had arrived at the tavern and entered this formidable name upon the register  sherlock holmes  the news buzzed from cabin to cabin from claim to claim tools were dropped and the town swarmed toward the center of interest a man passing out at the northern end of the village shouted it to pat riley whose claim was the next one to flint buckners at that time fetlock jones seemed to turn sick he muttered to himself  uncle sherlock the mean luck of itthat he should come just when he dropped into a reverie and presently said to himself but whats the use of being afraid of him anybody that knows him the way i do knows he cant detect a crime except where he plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it according to instructions now there aint going to be any clues this timeso what show has he got none at all no sir everythings ready if i was to risk putting it off no i wont run any risk like that flint buckner goes out of this world tonight for sure then another trouble presented itself uncle sherlock ll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening and how am i going to get rid of him for ive got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight oclock this was an awkward matter and cost him much thought but he found a way to beat the difficulty well go for a walk and ill leave him in the road a minute so that he wont see what it is i do the best way to throw a detective off the track anyway is to have him along when you are preparing the thing yes thats the safestill take him with me   meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man but he kept his room and did not appear none but ferguson jake parker the blacksmith and ham sandwich had any luck these enthusiastic admirers of the great scientific detective hired the taverns detainedbaggage lockup which looked into the detectives room across a little alleyway ten or twelve feet wide ambushed themselves in it and cut some peepholes in the windowblind mr holmess blinds were down but byandby he raised them it gave the spies a hairlifting but pleasurable thrill to find themselves face to face with the extraordinary man who had filled the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities there he satnot a myth not a shadow but real alive compact of substance and almost within touching distance with the hand  look at that head said ferguson in an awed voice by gracious thats a head  you bet said the blacksmith with deep reverence look at his nose look at his eyes intellect just a battery of it  and that paleness said ham sandwich comes from thoughtthats what it comes from hell duffers like us dont know what real thought is  no more we dont said ferguson what we take for thinking is just blubberandslush  right you are wellsfargo and look at that frownthats deep thinkingaway down down forty fathom into the bowels of things hes on the track of something  well he is and dont you forget it saylook at that awful gravitylook at that pallid solemnessthere aint any corpse can lay over it  no sir not for dollars and its hisn by hereditary rights too hes been dead four times aready and theres history for it three times natural once by accident ive heard say he smells damp and cold like a grave and he  sh watch him therehes got his thumb on the bump on the near corner of his forehead and his forefinger on the off one his thinkworks is just agrinding now you bet your other shirt  thats so and now hes gazing up toward heaven and stroking his mustache slow and  now he has rose up standing and is putting his clues together on his left fingers with his right finger see he touches the forefingernow middle fingernow ringfinger  stuck  look at him scowl he cant seem to make out that clue so he  see him smilelike a tigerand tally off the other fingers like nothing hes got it boys hes got it sure  well i should say id hate to be in that mans place that hes after  mr holmes drew a table to the window sat down with his back to the spies and proceeded to write the spies withdrew their eyes from the peepholes lit their pipes and settled themselves for a comfortable smoke and talk ferguson said with conviction  boys its no use talking hes a wonder hes got the signs of it all over him  you haint ever said a truer word than that wellsfargo said jake parker say wouldnt it a been nuts if hed abeen here last night  oh by george but wouldnt it said ferguson then wed have seen scientific work intellectjust pure intellectaway up on the upper levels dontchuknow archy is all right and it dont become anybody to belittle him i can tell you but his gift is only just eyesight sharp as an owls as near as i can make it out just a grand natural animal talent no more no less and prime as far as it goes but no intellect in it and for awfulness and marvelousness no more to be compared to what this man does thanthanwhy let me tell you what hed have done hed have stepped over to hogans and glancedjust glanced thats allat the premises and thats enough see everything yes sir to the last little detail and hell know more about that place than the hogans would know in seven years next he would sit down

them aroundmumbles six years old changes them this way and thatagain mumbles five teethone acomingcatholicyarncottonkipdamn that kip then he straightens up and gazes toward heaven and plows his hands through his hairplows and plows muttering damn that kip then he stands up and frowns and begins to tally off his clues on his fingersand gets stuck at the ringfinger but only just a minutethen his face glares all up in a smile like a house afire and he straightens up stately and majestic and says to the crowd take a lantern a couple of you and go down to injun billys and fetch the childthe rest of you go long home to bed goodnight madam goodnight gents and he bows like the matterhorn and pulls out for the tavern thats his style and the onlyscientific intellectualall over in fifteen minutesno poking around all over the sagebrush range an hour and a half in a massmeeting crowd for him boysyou hear me  by jackson its grand said ham sandwich wellsfargo youve got him down to a dot he aint painted up any exacter to the life in the books by george i can just see himcant you boys  you bet you its just a photograft thats what it is  ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success and grateful he sat silently enjoying his happiness a little while then he murmured with a deep awe in his voice  i wonder if god made him  there was no response for a moment then ham sandwich said reverently  not all at one time i reckon     ii  at eight oclock that evening two persons were groping their way past flint buckners cabin in the frosty gloom they were sherlock holmes and his nephew  stop here in the road a moment uncle said fetlock while i run to my cabin i wont be gone a minute  he asked for somethingthe uncle furnished itthen he disappeared in the darkness but soon returned and the talkingwalk was resumed by nine oclock they had wandered back to the tavern they worked their way through the billiardroom where a crowd had gathered in the hope of getting a glimpse of the extraordinary man a royal cheer was raised mr holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage  uncle sherlocks got some work to do gentlemen that ll keep him till twelve or one but hell be down again then or earlier if he can and hopes some of youll be left to take a drink with him  by george hes just a duke boys three cheers for sherlock holmes the greatest man that ever lived shouted ferguson hip hip hip  hurrah hurrah hurrah tiger  the uproar shook the building so hearty was the feeling the boys put into their welcome upstairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently saying  what did you get me into that engagement for  i reckon you dont want to be unpopular do you uncle well then dont you put on any exclusiveness in a miningcamp thats all the boys admire you but if you was to leave without taking a drink with them theyd set you down for a snob and besides you said you had home talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night  the boy was right and wisethe uncle acknowledged it the boy was wise in another detail which he did not mentionexcept to himself uncle and the others will come handyin the way of nailing an alibi where it cant be budged  he and his uncle talked diligently about three hours then about midnight fetlock stepped downstairs and took a position in the dark a dozen steps from the tavern and waited five minutes later flint buckner came rocking out of the billiardroom and almost brushed him as he passed  ive got him muttered the boy he continued to himself looking after the shadowy form goodbygoodby for good flint buckner you called my mother awell never mind what its all right now youre taking your last walk friend  he went musing back into the tavern from now till one is an hour well spend it with the boys its good for the alibi  he brought sherlock holmes to the billiardroom which was jammed with eager and admiring miners the guest called the drinks and the fun began everybody was happy everybody was complimentary the ice was soon broken songs anecdotes and more drinks followed and the pregnant minutes flew at six minutes to one when the jollity was at its highest  boom  there was silence instantly the deep sound came rolling and rumbling from peak to peak up the gorge then died down and ceased the spell broke then and the men made a rush for the door saying  somethings blown up  outside a voice in the darkness said its away down the gorge i saw the flash  the crowd poured down the canyonholmes fetlock archy stillman everybody they made the mile in a few minutes by the light of a lantern they found the smooth and solid dirt floor of flint buckners cabin of the cabin itself not a vestige remained not a rag nor a splinter nor any sign of flint searchparties sought here and there and yonder and presently a cry went up  here he is  it was true fifty yards down the gulch they had found himthat is they had found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him fetlock jones hurried thither with the others and looked  the inquest was a fifteenminute affair ham sandwich foreman of the jury handed up the verdict which was phrased with a certain unstudied literary grace and closed with this finding to wit that deceased came to his death by his own act or some other person or persons unknown to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind but his cabin which was blown away and god have mercy on his soul amen  then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd for the stormcentre of interest was theresherlock holmes the miners stood silent and reverent in a halfcircle inclosing a large vacant space which included the front exposure of the site of the late premises in this considerable space the extraordinary man was moving about attended by his nephew with a lantern with a tape he took measurements of the cabin site of the distance from the wall of chaparral to the road of the height of the chaparral bushes also various other measurements he gathered a rag here a splinter there and a pinch of earth yonder inspected them profoundly and preserved them he took the lay of the place with a pocketcompass allowing two seconds for magnetic variation he took the time pacific by his watch correcting it for local time he paced off the distance from the cabin site to the corpse and corrected that for tidal differentiation he took the altitude with a pocketaneroid and the temperature with a pocketthermometer finally he said with a stately bow  it is finished shall we return gentlemen  he took up the line of march for the tavern and the crowd fell into his wake earnestly discussing and admiring the extraordinary man and interlarding guesses as to the origin of the tragedy and who the author of it might he  my but its grand luck having him herehey boys said ferguson  its the biggest thing of the century said ham sandwich it ll go all over the world you mark my words  you bet said jake parker the blacksmith it ll boom this camp aint it so wellsfargo  well as you want my opinionif its any sign of how i think about it i can tell you this yesterday i was holding the straight flush claim at two dollars a foot id like to see the man that can get it at sixteen today  right you are wellsfargo its the grandest luck a new camp ever struck say did you see him collar them little rags and dirt and things what an eye he just cant overlook a cluetaint in him  thats so and they wouldnt mean a thing to anybody else but to him why theyre just a booklarge print at that  sures youre born them odds and ends have got their little old secret and they think there aint anybody can pull it but land when he sets his grip there theyve got to squeal and dont you forget it  boys i aint sorry now that he wasnt here to roust out the child this is a bigger thing by a long sight yes sir and more tangled up and scientific and intellectual  i reckon were all of us glad its turned out this way glad george it aint any name for it dontchuknow archy could ve learnt something if hed had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works the system but no he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed the whole thing  its true as gospel i seen it myself well archys young hell know better one of these days  say boys who do you reckon done it  that was a difficult question and brought out a world of unsatisfying conjecture various men were mentioned as possibilities but one by one they were discarded as not being eligible no one but young hillyer had been intimate with flint buckner no one had really had a quarrel with him he had affronted every man who had tried to make up to him although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed there was one name that was upon every tongue from the start but it was the last to get utterancefetlock joness it was pat riley that mentioned it  oh well the boys said of course weve all thought of him because he had a million rights to kill flint buckner and it was just his plain duty to do it but all the same theres two things we cant get around for one thing he hasnt got the sand and for another he wasnt anywhere near the place when it happened  i know it said pat he was there in the billiardroom with us when it happened  yes and was there all the time for an hour before it happened  its so and lucky for him too hed have been suspected in a minute if it hadnt been for that     iii  the tavern diningroom had been cleared of all its furniture save one sixfoot pine table and a chair this table was against one end of the room the chair was on it sherlock holmes stately imposing impressive sat in the chair the public stood the room was full the tobaccosmoke was dense the stillness profound  the extraordinary man raised his hand to command additional silence held it in the air a few moments then in brief crisp terms he put forward question after question and noted the answers with umums nods of the head and so on by this process he learned all about flint buckner his character conduct and habits that the people were able to tell him it thus transpired that the extraordinary mans nephew was the only person in the camp who had a killinggrudge against flint buckner mr holmes smiled compassionately upon the witness and asked languidly  do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad fetlock jones was at the time of the explosion  a thunderous response followed  in the billiardroom of this house  ah and had he just come in  been there all of an hour  ah it is aboutaboutwell about how far might it be to the scene of the explosions  all of a mile  ah it isnt much of an alibi tis true but  a stormburst of laughter mingled with shouts of by jiminy but hes chainlightning and aint you sorry you spoke sandy shut off the rest of the sentence and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face in pathetic shame the inquisitor resumed  the lad joness somewhat distant connection with the case laughter having been disposed of let us now call the eyewitnesses of the tragedy and listen to what they have to say  he got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of cardboard on his knee the house held its breath and watched  we have the longitude and the latitude corrected for magnetic variation and this gives us the exact location of the tragedy we have the altitude the temperature and the degree of humidity prevailinginestimably valuable since they enable us to estimate with precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the mood and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night  buzz of admiration muttered remark by george but hes deep he fingered his clues and now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak to us  here we have an empty linen shotbag what is its message this that robbery was the motive not revenge what is its further message this that the assassin was of inferior intelligenceshall we say lightwitted or perhaps approaching that how do we know this because a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob the man buckner who never had much money with him but the assassin might have been a stranger let the bag speak again i take from it this article it is a bit of silverbearing quartz it is peculiar examine it pleaseyouand youand you now pass it back please there is but one lode on this coast which produces just that character and color of quartz and that is a lode which crops out for nearly two miles on a stretch and in my opinion is destined at no distant day to confer upon its locality a globegirdling celebrity and upon its two hundred owners riches beyond the dreams of avarice name that lode please  the consolidated christian science and mary ann was the prompt response  a wild crash of hurrahs followed and every man reached for his neighbors hand and wrung it with tears in his eyes and wellsfargo ferguson shouted the straight flush is on the lode and up she goes to a hunched and fifty a footyou hear me  when quiet fell mr holmes resumed  we perceive then that three facts are established to wit the assassin was approximately lightwitted he was not a stranger his motive was robbery not revenge let us proceed i hold in my hand a small fragment of fuse with the recent smell of fire upon it what is its testimony taken with the corroborative evidence of the quartz it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner what does it tell us further this gentlemen that the assassination was consummated by means of an explosive what else does it say this that the explosive was located against the side of the cabin nearest the roadthe front sidefor within six feet of that spot i found it  i hold in my fingers a burnt swedish matchthe kind one rubs on a safetybox i found it in the road six hundred and twentytwo feet from the abolished cabin what does it say this that the train was fired from that point what further does it tell us this that the assassin was lefthanded how do i know this i should not be able to explain to you gentlemen how i know it the signs being so subtle that only long experience and deep study can enable one to detect them but the signs are here and they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often noticed in the great detective narrativesthat all assassins are lefthanded  by jackson thats so said ham sandwich bringing his great hand down with a resounding slap upon his thigh blamed if i ever thought of it before  nor i nor i cried several oh there cant anything escape himlook at his eye  gentlemen distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim he did not wholly escape injury this fragment of wood which i now exhibit to you struck him it drew blood wherever he is he bears the telltale mark i picked it up where he stood when he fired the fatal train he looked out over the house from his high perch and his countenance began to darken he slowly raised his hand and pointed  there stands the assassin  for a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement then twenty voices burst out with  sammy hillyer oh hell no him its pure foolishness  take care gentlemenbe not hasty observehe has the bloodmark on his brow  hillyer turned white with fright he was near to crying he turned this way and that appealing to every face for help and sympathy and held out his supplicating hands toward holmes and began to plead  dont oh dont i never did it i give my word i never did it the way i got this hurt on my forehead was  arrest him constable cried holmes i will swear out the warrant  the constable moved reluctantly forwardhesitatedstopped  hillyer broke out with another appeal oh archy dont let them do it it would kill mother you know how i got the hurt tell them and save me archy save me  stillman worked his way to the front and said  yes ill save you dont be afraid then he said to the house never mind how he got the hurt it hasnt anything to do with this case and isnt of any consequence  god bless you archy for a true friend  hurrah for archy go in boy and play em a knockdown flush to their two pair n a jack shouted the house pride in their home talent and a patriotic sentiment of loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public heart and changing the whole attitude of the situation  young stillman waited for the noise to cease then he said  i will ask tom jeffries to stand by that door yonder and constable harris to stand by the other one here and not let anybody leave the room  said and done go on old man  the criminal is present i believe i will show him to you before long in case i am right in my guess now i will tell you all about the tragedy from start to finish the motive wasnt robbery it was revenge the murderer wasnt lightwitted he didnt stand six hundred and twentytwo feet away he didnt get hit with a piece of wood he didnt place the explosive against the cabin he didnt bring a shotbag with him and he wasnt lefthanded with the exception of these errors the distinguished guests statement of the case is substantially correct  a comfortable laugh rippled over the house friend nodded to friend as much as to say thats the word with the bark on it good lad good boy he aint lowering his flag any  the guests serenity was not disturbed stillman resumed  i also have some witnesses and i will presently tell you where you can find some more he held up a piece of coarse wire the crowd craned their necks to see it has a smooth coating of melted tallow on it and here is a candle which is burned halfway down the remaining half of it has marks cut upon it an inch apart soon i will tell you where i found these things i will now put aside reasonings guesses the impressive hitchings of odds and ends of clues together and the other showy theatricals of the detective trade and tell you in a plain straightforward way just how this dismal thing happened  he paused a moment for effectto allow silence and suspense to intensify and concentrate the houses interest then he went on  the assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains it was a good plan very ingenious and showed an intelligent mind not a feeble one it was a plan which was well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor in the first place he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart and lit it and timed it he found it took three hours to burn four inches of it i tried it myself for half an hour awhile ago upstairs here while the inquiry into flint buckners character and ways was being conducted in this room and i arrived in that way at the rate of a candles consumption when sheltered from the wind having proved his trial candles rate he blew it outi have already shown it to youand put his inchmarks on a fresh one  he put the fresh one into a tin candlestick then at the fivehour mark he bored a hole through the candle with a redhot wire i have already shown you the wire with a smooth coat of tallow on ittallow that had been melted and had cooled  with laborvery hard labor i should sayhe struggled up through the stiff chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of flint buckners place tugging an empty flourbarrel with him he placed it in that absolutely secure hidingplace and in the bottom of it he set the candlestick then he measured off about thirtyfive feet of fusethe barrels distance from the back of the cabin he bored a hole in the side of the barrelhere is the large gimlet he did it with he went on and finished his work and when it was done one end of the fuse was in buckners cabin and the other end with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder was in the hole in the candletimed to blow the place up at one oclock this morning provided the candle was lit about eight oclock yesterday eveningwhich i am betting it wasand provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the fusewhich i am also betting there was though i cant prove it boys the barrel is there in the chaparral the candles remains are in it in the tin stick the burntout fuse is in the gimlethole the other end is down the hill where the late cabin stood i saw them all an hour or two ago when the professor here was measuring off unimplicated vacancies and collecting relics that hadnt anything to do with the case  he paused the house drew a long deep breath shook its strained cords and muscles free and burst into cheers dang him said ham sandwich thats why he was snooping around in the chaparral instead of picking up points out of the pfessors game looky herehe aint no fool boys  no sir why great scott  but stillman was resuming  while we were out yonder an hour or two ago the owner of the gimlet and the trialcandle took them from a place where he had concealed themit was not a good placeand carried them to what he probably thought was a better one two hundred yards up in the pine woods and hid them there covering them over with pine needles it was there that i found them the gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel and now  the extraordinary man interrupted him he said sarcastically  we have had a very pretty fairy tale gentlemenvery pretty indeed now i would like to ask this young man a question or two  some of the boys winced and ferguson said  im afraid archys going to catch it now  the others lost their smiles and sobered down mr holmes said  let us proceed to examine into this fairytale in a consecutive and orderly wayby geometrical progression so to speaklinking detail to detail in a steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and unassailable march upon this tinsel toyfortress of error the dream fabric of a callowimagination to begin with young sir i desire to ask you but three questions at presentat present did i understand you to say it was your opinion that the supposititious candle was lighted at about eight oclock yesterday evening  yes sirabout eight  could you say exactly eight  well no i couldnt be that exact  um if a person had been passing along there just about that time he would have been almost sure to encounter that assassin do you think  yes i should think so  thank you that is all for the present i say all for the present  dern him hes laying for archy said ferguson  its so said ham sandwich i dont like the look of it  stillman said glancing at the guest i was along there myself at half past eightno about nine  indeed this is interestingthis is very interesting perhaps you encountered the assassin  no i encountered no one  ah thenif you will excuse the remarki do not quite see the relevancy of the information  it has none at present i say it has noneat present  he paused presently he resumed i did not encounter the assassin but i am on his track i am sure for i believe he is in this room i will ask you all to pass one by one in front of mehere where there is a good lightso that i can see your feet  a buzz of excitement swept the place and the march began the guest looking on with an iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified success stillman stooped shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed down intently at each pair of feet as it passed fifty men tramped monotonously bywith no result sixty seventy the thing was beginning to look absurd the guest remarked with suave irony  assassins appear to be scarce this evening  the house saw the humor if it and refreshed itself with a cordial laugh ten or twelve more candidates tramped byno danced by with airy and ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectatorsthen suddenly stillman put out his hand and said  this is the assassin  fetlock jones by the great sanhedrim roared the crowd and at once let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring remarks inspired by the situation  at the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand commanding peace the authority of a great name and a great personality laid its mysterious compulsion upon the house and it obeyed out of the panting calm which succeeded the guest spoke saying with dignity and feeling  this is serious it strikes at an innocent life innocent beyond suspicion innocent beyond peradventure hear me prove it observe how simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie listen my friends that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at any time  it made a deep impression men turned their eyes upon stillman with grave inquiry in them his face brightened and he said  i knew there was another one he stepped briskly to the table and glanced at the guests feet then up at his face and said you were with him you were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle that byandby fired the powder sensation and what is more you furnished the matches yourself  plainly the guest seemed hit it looked so to the public he opened his mouth to speak the words did not come freely  thiserthis is insanitythis  stillman pressed his evident advantage home he held up a charred match  here is one of them i found it in the barreland theres another one there  the guest found his voice at once  yesand put them there yourself  it was recognized a good shot stillman retorted  it is waxa breed unknown to this camp i am ready to be searched for the box are you  the guest was staggered this timethe dullest eye could see it he fumbled with his hands once or twice his lips moved but the words did not come the house waited and watched in tense suspense the stillness adding effect to the situation presently stillman said gently  we are waiting for your decision  there was silence again during several moments then the guest answered in a low voice  i refuse to be searched  there was no noisy demonstration but all about the house one voice after another muttered  that settles it hes archys meat  what to do now nobody seemed to know it was an embarrassing situation for the momentmerely of course because matters had taken such a sudden and unexpected turn that these unpractised minds were not prepared for it and had come to a standstill like a stopped clock under the shock but after a little the machinery began to work again tentatively and by twos and threes the men put their heads together and privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition one of these propositions met with much favor it was to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks for removing flint buckner and let him go but the cooler heads opposed it pointing out that addled brains in the eastern states would pronounce it a scandal and make no end of foolish noise about it finally the cool heads got the upper hand and obtained general consent to a proposition of their own their leader then called the house to order and stated itto this effect that fetlock jones be jailed and put upon trial  the motion was carried apparently there was nothing further to do now and the people were glad for privately they were impatient to get out and rush to the scene of the tragedy and see whether that barrel and the other things were really there or not  but nothe breakup got a check the surprises were not over yet for a while fetlock jones had been silently sobbing unnoticed in the absorbing excitements which had been following one another so persistently for some time but when his arrest and trial were decreed he broke out despairingly and said  no its no use i dont want any jail i dont want any trial ive had all the hard luck i want and all the miseries hang me now and let me out it would all come out anywaythere couldnt anything save me he has told it all just as if hed been with me and seen iti dont know how he found out and youll find the barrel and things and then i wouldnt have any chance any more i killed him and youd have done it too if hed treated you like a dog and you only a boy and weak and poor and not a friend to help you  and served him damned well right broke in ham sandwich looky here boys  from the constable order order gentlemen  a voice did your uncle know what you was up to  no he didnt  did he give you the matches sure enough  yes he did but he didnt know what i wanted them for  when you was out on such a business as that how did you venture to risk having him alongand him a detective hows that  the boy hesitated fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way then said shyly  i know about detectives on account of having them in the family and if you dont want them to find out about a thing its best to have them around when you do it  the cyclone of laughter which greeted this naïve discharge of wisdom did not modify the poor little waifs embarrassment in any large degree     iv  from a letter to mrs stillman dated merely tuesday  fetlock jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin and left there to await his trial constable harris provided him with a couple of days rations instructed him to keep a good guard over himself and promised to look in on him as soon as further supplies should be due  next morning a score of us went with hillyer out of friendship and helped him bury his late relative the unlamented buckner and i acted as first assistant pallbearer hillyer acting as chief just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger carrying an old handbag limped by with his head down and i caught the scent i had chased around the globe it was the odor of paradise to my perishing hope  in a moment i was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder he slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had withered him in his tracks and as the boys came running he struggled to his knees and put up his pleading hands to me and out of his chattering jaws he begged me to persecute him no more and said  you have hunted me around the world sherlock holmes yet god is my witness i have never done any man harm  a glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane that was my work mother the tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery i felt in that moment but nothing else can ever do it the boys lifted him up and gathered about him and were full of pity of him and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him and said cheer up and dont be troubled he was among friends now and they would take care of him and protect him and hang any man that laid a hand on him they are just like so many mothers the rough miningcamp boys are when you wake up the south side of their hearts yes and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up the opposite of that muscle they did everything they could think of to comfort him but nothing succeeded until wellsfargo ferguson who is a clever strategist said  if its only sherlock holmes thats troubling you you neednt worry any more  why asked the forlorn lunatic eagerly  because hes dead again  dead dead oh dont trifle with a poor wreck like me is he dead on honor nowis he telling me true boys  true as youre standing there said ham sandwich and they all backed up the statement in a body  they hung him in san bernardino last week added ferguson clinching the matter whilst he was searching around after you mistook him for another man theyre sorry but they cant help it now  theyre abuilding him a monument said ham sandwich with the air of a person who had contributed to it and knew  james walker drew a deep sighevidently a sigh of reliefand said nothing but his eyes lost something of their wildness his countenance cleared visibly and its drawn look relaxed a little we all went to our cabin and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for and while they were about it hillyer and i outfitted him from hat to shoeleather with new clothes of ours and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him old is the right word and a pity too old by the droop of him and the frost upon his hair and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face though he is only in his prime in the matter of years while he ate we smoked and chatted and when he was finishing he found his voice at last and of his own accord broke out with his personal history i cannot furnish his exact words but i will come as near it as i can   the wrong mans story  it happened like this i was in denver i had been there many years sometimes i remember how many sometimes i dontbut it isnt any matter all of a sudden i got a notice to leave or i would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long beforeyears and years beforein the east  i knew about that crime but i was not the criminal it was a cousin of mine of the same name what should i better do my head was all disordered by fear and i didnt know i was allowed very little timeonly one day i think it was i would be ruined if i was published and the people would lynch me and not believe what i said it is always the way with lynchings when they find out it is a mistake they are sorry but it is too latethe same as it was with mr holmes you see so i said i would sell out and get money to live on and run away until it blew over and i could come back with my proofs then i escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains somewhere and lived disguised and had a false name  i got more and more troubled and worried and my troubles made me see spirits and hear voices and i could not think straight and clear on any subject but got confused and involved and had to give it up because my head hurt so it got to be worse and worse more spirits and more voices they were about me all the time at first only in the night then in the day too they were always whispering around my bed and plotting against me and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out because i got no good rest  and then came the worst one night the whispers said well never manage because we cant see him and so cant point him out to the people  they sighed then one said we must bring sherlock holmes he can be here in twelve days  they all agreed and whispered and jibbered with joy but my heart broke for i had read about that man and knew what it would be to have him upon my track with his superhuman penetration and tireless energies  the spirits went away to fetch him and i got up at once in the middle of the night and fled away carrying nothing but the handbag that had my money in itthirty thousand dollars twothirds of it are in the bag there yet it was forty days before that man caught up on my track i just escaped from habit he had written his real name on a tavern register but had scratched it out and written dagget barclay in the place of it but fear gives you a watchful eye and keen and i read the true name through the scratches and fled like a deer  he has hunted me all over this world for three years and a halfthe pacific states australasia indiaeverywhere you can think of then back to mexico and up to california again giving me hardly any rest but that name on the registers always saved me and what is left of me is alive yet and i am so tired a cruel time he has given me yet i give you my honor i have never harmed him nor any man  that was the end of the story and it stirred those boys to bloodheat be sure of it as for meeach word burnt a hole in me where it struck  we voted that the old man should bunk with us and be my guest and hillyers i shall keep my own counsel naturally but as soon as he is well rested and nourished i shall take him to denver and rehabilitate his fortunes  the boys gave the old fellow the bonemashing goodfellowship handshake of the mines and then scattered away to spread the news  at dawn next morning wellsfargo ferguson and ham sandwich called us softly out and said privately  that news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread all around and the camps are up they are piling in from everywhere and are going to lynch the pfessor constable harris is in a dead funk and has telephoned the sheriff come along  we started on a run the others were privileged to feel as they chose but in my hearts privacy i hoped the sheriff would arrive in time for i had small desire that sherlock holmes should hang for my deeds as you can easily believe i had heard a good deal about the sheriff but for reassurances sake i asked  can he stop a mob  can he stop a mob can jack fairfax stop a mob well i should smile exdesperadonineteen scalps on his string can he oh i say  as we tore up the gulch distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly on the still air and grew steadily in strength as we raced along roar after roar burst out stronger and stronger nearer and nearer and at last when we closed up upon the multitude massed in the open area in front of the tavern the crash of sound was deafening some brutal roughs from dalys gorge had holmes in their grip and he was the calmest man there a contemptuous smile played about his lips and if any fear of death was in his british heart his iron personality was master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear  come to a vote men this from one of the daly gang shadbelly higgins quick is it hang or shoot  neither shouted one of his comrades hell be alive again in a week burnings the only permanency for him  the gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of approval and went struggling and surging toward the prisoner and closed around him shouting fire fires the ticket they dragged him to the horsepost backed him against it chained him to it and piled wood and pine cones around him waistdeep still the strong face did not blench and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips  a match fetch a match  shadbelly struck it shaded it with his hand stooped and held it under a pine cone a deep silence fell upon the mob the cone caught a tiny flame flickered about it a moment or two i seemed to catch the sound of distant hoofsit grew more distinctstill more and more distinct more and more definite but the absorbed crowd did not appear to notice it the match went out the man struck another stooped and again the flame rose this time it took hold and began to spreadhere and there men turned away their faces the executioner stood with the charred match in his fingers watching his work the hoofbeats turned a projecting crag and now they came thundering down upon us almost the next moment there was a shout  the sheriff  and straightway he came tearing into the midst stood his horse almost on his hind feet and said  fall back you guttersnipes  he was obeyed by all but their leader he stood his ground and his hand went to his revolver the sheriff covered him promptly and said  drop your hand you parlordesperado kick the fire away now unchain the stranger  the parlordesperado obeyed then the sheriff made a speech sitting his horse at martial ease and not warming his words with any touch of fire but delivering them in a measured and deliberate way and in a tone which harmonized with their character and made them impressively disrespectful  youre a nice lotnow aint you just about eligible to travel with this bilk hereshadbelly higginsthis loudmouthed sneak that shoots people in the back and calls himself a desperado if theres anything i do particularly despise its a lynching mob ive never seen one that had a man in it it has to tally up a hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor its made up of cowards and so is the community that breeds it and ninetynine times out of a hundred the sheriffs another one he pausedapparently to turn that last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of itthen he went on the sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowestdown coward there is by the statistics there was a hundred and eightytwo of them drawing sneak pay in america last year by the way its going pretty soon there ll be a new disease in the doctorbookssheriff complaint that idea pleased himany one could see it people will say sheriff sick again yes got the same old thing and next there ll be a new title people wont say hes running for sheriff of rapaho county for instance theyll say hes running for coward of rapaho lord the idea of a grownup person being afraid of a lynch mob  he turned an eye on the captive and said stranger who are you and what have you been doing  my name is sherlock holmes and i have not been doing anything  it was wonderful the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff notwithstanding he must have come posted he spoke up with feeling and said it was a blot on the country that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their fame and their ingenuity and whose histories of them had won every readers heart by the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting should be visited under the stars and stripes by an outrage like this he apologized in the name of the whole nation and made holmes a most handsome bow and told constable harris to see him to his quarters and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again then he turned to the mob and said  hunt your holes you scum which they did then he said follow me shadbelly ill take care of your case myself nokeep your popgun whenever i see the day that ill be afraid to have you behind me with that thing it ll be time for me to join last years hundred and eightytwo and he rode off in a walk shadbelly following  when we were on our way back to our cabin toward breakfasttime we ran upon the news that fetlock jones had escaped from his lockup in the night and is gone nobody is sorry let his uncle track him out if he likes it is in his line the camp is not interested     v  ten days later  james walker is all right in body now and his mind shows improvement too i start with him for denver tomorrow morning  next night brief note mailed at a waystation  as we were starting this morning hillyer whispered to me keep this news from walker until you think it safe and not likely to disturb his mind and check his improvement the ancient crime he spoke of was really committedand by his cousin as he said we buried the real criminal the other daythe unhappiest man that has lived in a centuryflint buckner his real name was jacob fuller there mother by help of me an unwitting mourner your husband and my father is in his grave let him rest
