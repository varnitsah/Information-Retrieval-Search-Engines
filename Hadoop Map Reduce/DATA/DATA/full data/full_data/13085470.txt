13085470	a sermon  preached at  the quakers meeting house  in gracechurchstreet london   eighth month 12th 1694    by william penn    salvation from sin by christ alone    london r h moore 162 fleetstreet and bancks and co exchangestreet manchester 1836      bancks and co printers manchester     the perusal of the first numbers of a series of tracts containing extracts from the writings of early friends and published for the avowed purpose of lowering the estimation in which those writings are held by the society and even of proving that many of them would reflect discredit upon a private library and ought truly to be accounted dangerous books has given rise to the present republication as an humble but sincere admirer of those principles of gospel truth which the early friends sought to promulgate as well by their writings as by eminently devoted lives and a constant and oft proved willingness to suffer for christs sake i must protest whether to any purpose or not against the illiberal and unjust mode of conduct resorted to by the publishers of the extracts in selecting short and partial sentences and thus as i conceive grossly misrepresenting some of the views of those worthies long since removed from the world on which they walked as strangers and as pilgrims and long since i doubt not permitted through the mercy of their god and saviour to enter into that better country where they are no more exposed to the trials of time no more exposed to the scoffs and persecutions of men and no more affected by the calumnies of false brethren  whilst however expressing a sincere and affectionate regard for the memories of those who have preceded me in religious professions i would add that i consider them worthy to be followed only as they followed christ and that if i go forth by the footsteps of this flock of my saviours companions it is that i may feed beside that good shepherds tents where i believe they found plentiful pasture  i would most explicitly state the present publication is no party act or an act originating in party feeling for though i must take a heartfelt interest in the present proceedings in our society yet i deeply feel that even if i see or think i see the ark of the covenant of our god unsteadily placed as upon a new cart there is a danger of putting forth like uzza of old uncalled and unprepared hands for its support  to the serious attention of all honest hearted enquirers after truth do i commend this little pamphlet believing that the principles set forth in the annexed sermon are the principles uniformly avowed and supported by the early friends and that however their views and writings may be distorted and belied the whole gospel of a crucified and risen saviour in all its freeness and in all its fullness was what they sought to publish and by their lives to adorn  c gilpin  manchester 4th month 1836     sermon   the great and blessed god that made heaven and earth the seas and the great fountains of the deep and rivers of water the almighty jehovah who is from everlasting to everlasting he also made man and woman and his design was to make them eternally happy and blessed and therefore he made man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them he made them after his own likeness holy wise merciful just patient and humble endued them with knowledge righteousness and true holiness but man and woman through their transgressions lost this image of god and with it lost their happiness and true blessedness that god made them in a capacity to enjoy  now in this state of misery into which we are fallen we are come short of the glory of god and it is out of this wretched woful state we must be brought else we shall never see the face of god with comfort this is an eternal truth of god and recorded in the holy scriptures john iii 16 that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life god so loved the world he gave his son to be a light unto the world that all might see their way back to god again for sin hath darkened the understanding and clouded the mind of man and woman and alienated them from the life of god and their hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin but now is the acceptable time now is the day of salvation the day of gods grace and favourable visitation wherein he visits men and women illuminates their minds and spirits with a light from heaven that they might see the deplorable state and condition wherein they are and what they are doing it is in this light that they have a day of grace vouchsafed to them that it may be well with them both here and for ever they that receive this light and come out of that which they are called from which is sin they may come to enjoy peace with god it was sin that first separated between god and man and it is sin now that hinders man from acquaintance with the lord who brings peace unto him it is by this light that we are to acquaint ourselves with god that we may be at peace thus saith the lord by the prophet it is sin has separated between me and you sin hath made a partition wall between god and us and god hath sent his son into the world to break down this partition wall that sin hath made that so fallen man might return to god and come into paradise again out of which sin hath cast him  now none can bring us back to god and into favour and communion with him but our lord jesus christ he is the light and leader of his people there is no name under heaven by which we can be saved but the name of jesus it is he that saves his people from their sins and it is in him alone that we are blessed blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven and whose sin is covered and for the sake of christ alone it is that the lord imputeth not iniquity to us now pray examine yourselves whether you be in the faith 2 cor xiii 5 prove your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except you be reprobates examine yourselves whether you have chosen the lord for your god and christ for your redeemer and whether you have forsaken your sins and returned from your evil ways and answered the visitation of the love of god in your souls do you believe in the lord jesus christ who came to seek and to save them that were lost he is the physician of value that was wounded to heal our wounds he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities and had the chastisement of our peace upon him that by his stripes we might be healed it is he alone that could do this who is sufficient for these things the lord found out one that is sufficient he hath laid help upon one that is mighty that is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto god by him god hath given him the spirit without measure and filled him with grace and truth that of his fullness we might all receive and grace for grace he is mighty to save the sons and daughters of men and to give them power to become the children of god  this was testified of old john i 12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them who believe on his name men want power over their sins when sin appears to be exceeding sinful they would overcome it and be rid of it when it is troublesome and when they are under a deep conviction of the evil of it and see the woful and miserable state that sin hath brought mankind into how they have lost the image of god and the favour of god they then desire to be restored and brought back again into their primitive state you that know the truth of god see how the work goes on in your hearts see how the image of god is carrying on upon you consider that the lord is a holy god of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation there is no peace to the wicked that walk in the broad way and grieve the holy spirit and do not answer his divine call there is a twofold call concerning man a call to repentance and a call to judgment the call to repentance is in this day of gods visitation they that receive it now that are so wise as to answer gods call and believe in the son of god and in his inward appearance that obey his voice when they hear his call saying come away come out of thy sins come out of the wickedness filthiness and pollution of the world come into the divine nature of the son of god come into his life into what life into the spiritual life the divine life thou hast been dead to god and alive to the world now that thou mayst sic be dead to sin and alive to god come unto him that hath all power in heaven and in earth committed to him o come unto christ the dear and blessed son of god in this day of grace and salvation and receive power to overcome thy sins then thou wilt be a conqueror and overcome the devil  we are of ourselves altogether insufficient for these things we are weak and impotent and our saviour hath told us without me ye can do nothing we are justified freely by gods grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ not justified by our own works how great a contradiction is it to charge them with the contrary that say they cannot preach nor pray but as the spirit of god moveth them blessed be god that hath made us sensible of our own weakness emptiness and poverty our help hath been in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth who hath given his son to be an helper and an allsufficient saviour to us with him he hath given sufficient power and strength whereby we are enabled to overcome the devil the enemy of our souls so that we may be enabled to stand against principalities and powers against spiritual wickedness and conquer all the powers of darkness and fight the good fight of faith and finish our course with joy and keep the faith seeing there is laid up for us a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give us at that day and not only to us saith the apostle but unto all them that love his appearing we have not an highpriest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin christ our redeemer was tempted that he might succour those that are tempted when the devil tempted our saviour in the wilderness and could not prevail he went away and left him the prince of this world found nothing in him upon which he could fasten his temptation christ will enable those that believe in him to overcome the devil and to be more than conquerors through him that loved them he came into the world to purge and purify his people and to be the author of eternal salvation to all them that believe in him and obey him but it is said he did not many mighty works among some to whom he preached the everlasting gospel because of their unbelief many will not believe in the inward and spiritual appearance of jesus christ the son of god who is the light of the world they will neither believe in the light nor walk in the light which will enable them to conquer the evil one who is the prince of darkness it is only through christ jesus the great captain of our salvation that we are victorious  therefore my friends open your hearts to the lord jesus christ receive this blessed gift of god which he offers to you and can god give you a greater gift than the son of his love and will not you gladly receive him and that great salvation which he hath purchased for you with his own blood but say some people we have received christ and believe in him and believe the divine authority of the holy scriptures but let me ask you who keeps house all this while what have you done for christ christ hath died for you but hast thou lived to him and hast thou died to the world and died to thy sins and lusts consider with yourselves it is both your great duty and interest to die to sin and live to christ that died for you and we must stand at christs tribunal and give an account to him of whatsoever we have done whether good or bad and he will judge us at the great day of his appearing blessed are you that receive the blessed son of god that now stands in spirit at the door and knocks open your heart and make room for him and let not the world keep him out and he will come in and sup with you and you with him and he will do that for you which you cannot do for yourselves the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak he will give thee power over sin and over the world and over the devil whenever he shall assault thee with his temptations say get thee behind me satan thou savourest not the things that be of god when people come to be spiritually minded they will taste and savour the things that are spiritual and heavenly if they be not things of god do not touch with them have nothing to do with them but walk in the spirit and savour the things of the spirit and hearken to the counsel of christ who speaks to you in the name of wisdom o ye simple ones understand wisdom and ye fools be of an understanding heart hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors for whoso findeth me findeth life hearken to the blessed counsel of christ hear his voice and obey it they that do his will shall know his doctrine the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant  they that have the saving knowledge of god and christ jesus which is life eternal they will walk in a correspondent and suitable manner to that knowledge and be holy in all manner of conversation they will not be only nominal christians but true christians israelites indeed in whom there is no guile they will receive christ jesus who is gods gift and knows sic the operation of his power in their souls these persons are fit to live and prepared to die when christ who is their life shall appear they shall appear with him in glory when the sound of the last trumpet shall be heard at the end of the world time shall be no more come away that day shall not be terrible to them that have put off the old man and put on the new man and have begun to live a new life and to have new affections new thoughts and resolutions and have laid up their treasure in heaven where their hearts are also they have that peace which the world cannot give and which death cannot take away blessed are they that take sanctuary in the name of jesus as in a strong tower they shall get power over their sins and over the vanity of their minds that die to sin and live to god and feel the constraining power and efficacy of the love of christ who hath loved them and washed them from their sins in his own blood and made them kings and priests to god  my friends hear the voice of wisdom who hath said whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the lord but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul be you early seekers seek the kingdom of god in the first place the lord calls from heaven my son give me thine heart let thy answer be lord take my heart purify and cleanse it break it and make it new make it fit for thy acceptance that i may find favour in thy sight without me saith our saviour ye can do nothing therefore desire him to do it for thee and to work in thee both to will and to do of his own good pleasure how dreadful is it to appear at the bar of gods justice as miserable sinners those that have not christ the great mediator to plead for them are miserable indeed therefore lay hold on christ now believe in him lay hold on his power and spirit in this day of your visitation if thou art under the power of sin and satan thou mayst sic receive power from christ to overcome all the power of darkness if the strong man armed hath got possession of thy heart christ will lay siege to it and if thou be willing to open the door christ will come in and cast out the strong man and spoil him of all his goods he will cast out the grand enemy of thy soul and take possession for himself that thou mayest be delivered from the power of satan and from the bondage of corruption and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of god and if the son of god make thee free thou shalt be free indeed for this end christ came into the world for this purpose was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and he will not lose the design of his coming but will finish transgression and make an end of sin and bring in everlasting righteousness  let us all come to christ and let none deceive themselves and live in their sins and yet think to come to heaven be not deceived saith the apostle god is not mocked for whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life labour for a sure grounded hope a just hope in the mercy of god for pardon and salvation then you must know a work of christ upon you and the power of the spirit of christ within you subduing your will to a holy subjection to the divine will that you may say with the apostle i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me then the call to judgment will be joyful to you for you shall then be justified and acquitted before the whole world at that great and general judgment and have an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ and it shall be well with you for ever now say to the righteous it shall be well with him not that it doth so appear at present for through many tribulations we must expect to enter into the kingdom of heaven and many are the troubles of the righteous but the lord will deliver them out of them all so that if in this life only saith the apostle we have hope we are of all men most miserable yet say to the righteous it shall be well with him whatsoever their trials troubles and tribulations are the lord will deliver them in the best time they have heaven in their eye and they look to the recompense of reward now what hast thou in thine eye is it the high calling in christ is this the mark thou aimest at and which thou hast in view is this the port and haven that thou art sailing to looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame heb xii 2 the apostle after he had been speaking of the suffering and martyrdom of those great saints of whom the world was not worthy heb xi how that through faith they subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopt the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight and turned to flight the armies of the aliens of women that received their dead to life again and others were tortured not accepting of deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection then he comes to speak of the sufferings of our lord jesus christ and bids us look unto him heb xii 1 2 3 wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin that doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despised the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds blessed are they that can endure all these things shame reproach contumely and disdain persecutions and afflictions that attend the testimony of jesus blessed are they that can endure the cross and despise the shame it is an internal cross which thou must endure for christ or thy own heart will reprove thee check thee and condemn thee for it but if thou comest to know a being crucified with christ thou shalt reign with him and be raised up to eternal glory with him unless thou knowest a dying to the world and a being crucified with christ thou canst not have a well grounded hope of everlasting happiness  therefore now friends examine yourselves about your title to heaven it is the wisdom and practice of the world to examine their titles and settlements and to see they be sure and firm and stable beforehand so we should make sure for heaven and eternal glory and of an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens before this earthly tabernacle be dissolved then for us to live will be christ and to die will be eternal gain blessed are they that bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus that bear his name and testify and join with him against the spirit of the world and the prince of the power of the air it is within that thou must join with christs appearance that so thou mayest be christianized and thy mind made truly christian thou must be purified in thy spirit and baptized with the holy ghost and with fire and know the powerful operation of the lord they that have not experience of the new birth they cannot enter into the kingdom of god  o my friends set before you the example of christ who was holy harmless and undefiled his life was glorious in holiness and as it becomes you so it highly concerns you to be holy in all manner of conversation for if you imitate not the life of christ you cannot be saved by his death he came into the world to redeem you from all iniquity and to save you from sin and hell labour to answer the dignity of your high and holy calling with a conversation becoming the gospel of christ for you are called to glory and virtue whatsoever troubles temptations and tribulations may attend you in your pilgrimage here below if you be faithful and sincere you will have peace with god through our lord jesus christ in all your labours and travels on this earth you may look up with joy for you have a serene heaven over your heads let christ be precious to you open the door of your hearts to him who is the king of glory he is oppressed in the hearts of the unclean but he is exalted and lifted up in the hearts of the faithful blessed are they that set him upon his throne in their hearts o learn of christ to be meek and lowly your humility will exalt him and will also exalt you at the last be faithful to the death and you shall receive a crown of life those that have eternal life in their eye and depend upon christ alone for salvation they have laid a sure foundation all other foundations will come to nothing they are founded in time and in time they will come to moulder away but that city that god is the builder and maker of that abraham had in his eye will never decay nor moulder away let us have this always in our eye that nothing may intercept our view we have here saith the apostle no continuing city we seek one that is to come in this world we are as sheep among wolves fear not little flock saith our saviour it is your fathers good pleasure to give you a kingdom if we be the sheep of christ we shall follow him for his sheep follow him and know his voice and a stranger they will not follow but they will flee from him for they know not the voice of a stranger my sheep saith christ hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any pluck them out of my hands here is encouragement for us to labour abundantly in the work of the lord for our labour shall not be in vain in the lord let us with moses choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and esteem the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt and have respect to the recompense of reward  friends i beseech you in the fear of god look up unto jesus the great mediator of the new covenant the author and finisher of your faith that by patient continuance in well doing you may seek for glory honour immortality and eternal life which you shall obtain if you persevere to the end for he that endureth unto the end shall be saved  be not weary of well doing for in due time you shall reap if you faint not he that hath appeared as a god of salvation and a mighty preserver of his people in all ages of the world and hath been so both to the primitive christians and to all our christian friends that are gone before us to an eternal rest if you faint not but follow them who through faith and patience do inherit the promises you shall lay down your heads in peace in him when you come to die and when time shall be no more you shall be for ever with the lord  to god be praise honour and glory who hath stretched forth his mighty arm to save who is the arm of the lord but christ jesus the redeemer of souls when we had undone ourselves and lost ourselves in wandering and departing from the lord the true and living god into darkness and the shadow of death he stretched forth his almighty arm to gather us and to bring us into the paradise of god again when we were driven out by our own sin from the face and presence of the lord christ jesus the great and good shepherd of his sheep came to seek and to save them that were lost the lost sheep that have wandered from him he will take them on his shoulder and bring them to his fold and he will make them lie down in green pastures and lead them by the still waters and satisfy them with the rivers of pleasure that are at gods right hand for evermore he hath promised that he will feed his flock like a shepherd and gather his lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom i hope christ jesus the great shepherd will find some here this day that have gone astray and gather them with his divine arm and keep them by his mighty power through faith unto salvation to him be all praise honour glory dominion and thanksgiving for he alone is worthy who is god over all blessed for ever and
