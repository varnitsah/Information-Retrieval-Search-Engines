prima dicta mihi summa dicenda camena   the years will pass and hearts will range you conquer time and care and change though time doth still delight to shed the dust on many a younger head though care oft coming hath the guile from younger lips to steal the smile though change makes younger hearts wax cold and sells new loves for loves of old time change nor care hath learned the art to fleck your hair to chill your heart to touch your tresses with the snow to mar your mirth of long ago change care nor time while life endure shall spoil our ancient friendship sure the love which flows from sacred springs in old unhappy faroff things from sympathies in grief and joy through all the years of man and boy  therefore to you the rhymes i strung when even this brindled head was young i bring and later rhymes i bring that flit upon as weak a wing but still for you for yours they sing    many of the verses and translations in this volume were published first in ballads and lyrics of old france 1872  though very sensible that they have the demerits of imitative and even of undergraduate rhyme i print them again because people i like have liked them  the rest are of different dates and lack though doubtless they need the excuse of having been written like some of the earlier pieces during college lectures  i would gladly have added to this volume what other more or less serious rhymes i have written but circumstances over which i have no control have bound them up with ballades and other toys of that sort  it may be as well to repeat in prose what has already been said in verse that grass of parnassus the pretty autumn flower grows in the marshes at the foot of the muses hill and other hills not at the top by any means  several of the versions from the greek anthology have been published in the fortnightly review and the sonnet on colonel burnaby appeared in punch these with pieces from other serials are reprinted by the courteous permission of the editors  the verses that were published in ballades and lyrics and in ballads and verses vain charles scribners sons new york are marked in the contents with an asterisk    grass of parnassus    pale star that by

to colonel ian hamilton   to you who know the face of war you that for england wander far you that have seen the ghazis fly from english lads not sworn to die you that have lain where deadly chill the mist crept oer the shameful hill you that have conquered mile by mile the currents of unfriendly nile and cheered the march and eased the strain when politics made valour vain ian to you from banks of ken we send our lays of englishmen    seekers for a city    believe me if that blissful that beautiful place were set on a hill visible to all the world i should long ago have journeyed thither   but the number and variety of the ways  for you know there is but one road that leads to corinth  hermotimus mr paters version  the poet says dear city of cecrops and wilt thou not say dear city of zeus  m antoninus   to corinth leads one road you say is there a corinth or a way each bland or blatant preacher hath his painful or his primrose path and not a soul of all of these but knows the city twixt the seas her fair unnumbered homes and all her gleaming amethystine wall  blind are the guides who know the way the guides who write and preach and pray i watch their lives and i divine they differ not from yours and mine  one man we knew and only one whose seeking for a citys done for what he greatly sought he found a city girt with fire around a city in an empty land between the wastes of sky and sand a city on a riverside where by the folk he loved he died 1  alas it is not ours to tread that path wherein his life he led not ours his heart to dare and feel keen as the fragrant syrian steel yet are we not quite cityless not wholly left in our distress is it not said by one of old sheep have i of another fold ah faint of heart and weak of will for us there is a city still  dear city

winds that wail the suns that burn from thee proceed to thee return  dear city of zeus shall we not say home to which none can lose the way born in that citys flaming bound we do not find her but are found within her wide and viewless wall the universe is girdled all all joys and pains all wealth and dearth all things that travail on the earth gods will they work if god there be if not what is my life to me  seek we no further but abide within this city great and wide in her and for her living we have no less joy than to be free nor death nor grief can quite appal the folk that dwell within her wall nor aught but with our will befall    the white pacha    vain is the dream  however hope may rave he perished with the folk he could not save and though none surely told us he is dead and though perchance another in his stead another not less brave when all was done had fled unto the southward and the sun had urged a way by force or won by guile to streams remotest of the secret nile had raised an army of the desert men and waiting for his hour had turned again and fallen on that false prophet yet we know gordon is dead and these things are not so nay not for englands cause nor to restore her trampled flagfor he loved honour more nay not for life revenge or victory would he have fled whose hour had dawned to die he will not come again whateer our need he will not come who is happy being freed from the deathly flesh and perishable things and lies of statesmen and rewards of kings nay somewhere by the sacred rivers shore he sleeps like those who shall return no more no more

tomorrow is a year since gordon died a year ago tonight the desert still crouched on the spring and panted for its fill of lust and blood  their old art statesmen plied and paltered and evaded and denied guiltless as yet except for feeble will and craven heart and calculated skill in long delays of their great homicide  a year ago tonight twas not too late the thought comes through our mirth again again methinks i hear the halting foot of fate approaching and approaching us and then comes cackle of the house and the debate enough he is forgotten amongst men    advance australia    on the offer of help from the australians after the fall of khartoum   sons of the giant ocean isle in sport our friendly foes for long well england loves you and we smile when you outmatch us many a while so fleet you are so keen and strong  you like that fairy people set of old in their enchanted sea far off from men might well forget an elder nations toil and fret might heed not aught but game and glee  but what your fathers were you are in lands the fathers never knew neath skies of alien sign and star you rally to the english war your hearts are english kind and true  and now when first on england falls the shadow of a darkening fate you hear the mother ere she calls you leave your oceangirdled walls and face her foemen in the gate    colonel burnaby    greek text   thou that on every field of earth and sky didst hunt for death who seemed to flee and fear how great and greatly fallen dost thou lie slain in the desert by some wandering spear not here alas may england say not here nor in this quarrel was it meet to die but in that dreadful battle drawing nigh to thunder through the afghan passes sheer  like aias by the ships shouldst thou have stood and in some glen have stayed the stream of flight the bulwark of thy people and their shield when indus or when helmund ran with blood till back into the northland and the night the smitten eagles scattered from the field    melville and coghill    the place of the little hand   dead with their eyes to the foe dead with the foe at their feet under the sky laid low truly their slumber is sweet though the wind from the camp of the slain men blow and the rain on the wilderness beat  dead for they chose to die when that wild race was run dead for they would not fly deeming their work undone nor cared to look on the face of the sky nor loved the light of the sun  honour we give them and tears and the flag they died to save rent from the rain of the spears wet from the war and the wave shall waft mens thoughts through the dust of the years back to their lonely grave     rhodocleia     to rhodocleiaon her melancholy singing    rhodocleia was beloved by rufinus one of the late poets of the greek anthology   still rhodocleia brooding on the dead still singing of the meads of asphodel lands desolate of delight say hast thou dreamed of or remembered the shores where shadows dwell nor know the sun nor see the stars of night  there midst thy music doth thy spirit gaze as a girl pines for home looking along the way that she hath come sick to return and counts the weary days so wouldst thou flee back to the multitude whose days are done wouldst taste the fruit that lured persephone the sacrament of death and die and be no more in the wind and sun  thou hast not dreamed it but remembered i know thou hast been there hast seen the stately dwellings of the dead rise in the twilight air and crossed the shadowy bridge the spirits tread and climbed the golden stair  nay by thy cloudy hair and lips that were so fair sad lips now mindful of some ancient smart and melancholy eyes the haunt of care i know thee who thou art that rhodocleia glory of the rose of hellas ere her close that rhodocleia who when all was done the golden time of greece and fallen her sun swayed her last poets heart  with roses did he woo thee and with song with thine own rose and with the lily sweet the darkeyed violet garlands of windflowers wet and fragrant lovelamps that the whole night long burned till the dawn was burning in the skies praising thy golden eyes and feet more silvery than thetis feet  but thou didst die and flit among the tribes outworn the unavailing myriads of the past oft he beheld thy face in dreams of morn and waking wept for it till his own time came at last and then he sought thee in the dusky land wide are the populous places of the dead where souls on earth once wed may never meet nor each take others hand each far from the other fled  so all in vain he sought for thee but thou didst never taste of the lethaean stream nor that forgetful fruit the mystic pomgranate but from the mighty warden fledst and now the fugitive of fate thou farest in our life as in a dream still wandering with thy lute like that sweet paynim lady of old song who sang and wandered long for love of her aucassin seeking him so with thy minstrelsy thou roamest dreaming of the country dim below the veiled sky  there doth thy lover dwell singing and seeking still to find thy face in that forgetful place thou shalt not meet him here not till thy singing clear through all the murmur of the streams of hell wins to the maidens ear may she perchance have pity on thee and call thine eager spirit to sit beside her feet passing throughout the long unechoing hall up to the shadowy throne where the lost lovers of the ages meet till then thou art alone     ave     our faith and troth all time and space controules above the highest sphere we meet unseen unknowne and greet as angels greet  col richard lovelace  1649    clevedon church    in memoriam h b   westward i watch the low green hills of wales the low sky silver grey the turbid channel with the wandering sails moans through the winter day there is no colour but one ashen light on tower and lonely tree the little church upon the windy height is grey as sky or sea but there hath he that woke the sleepless love slept through these fifty years there is the grave that has been wept above with more than mortal tears and far below i hear the channel sweep and all his waves complain as hallams dirge through all the years must keep its monotone of pain        grey sky brown waters as a bird that flies my heart flits forth from these back to the winter rose of northern skies back to the northern seas and lo the long waves of the ocean beat below the minster grey caverns and chapels worn of saintly feet and knees of them that pray and i remember me how twain were one beside that ocean dim i count the years passed over since the sun that lights me looked on him and dreaming of the voice that save in sleep shall greet me not again far far below i hear the channel sweep and all his waves complain    twilight on tweed    three crests against the saffron sky beyond the purple plain the kind remembered melody of tweed once more again  wan water from the border hills dear voice from the old years thy distant music lulls and stills and moves to quiet tears  like a loved ghost thy fabled flood fleets through the dusky land where scott come home to die has stood my feet returning stand  a mist of memory broods and floats the border waters flow the air is full of ballad notes borne out of long ago  old songs that sung themselves to me sweet through a boys day dream while trout below the blossomd tree plashed in the golden steam        twilight and tweed and eildon hill fair and too fair you be you tell me that the voice is still that should have welcomed me  1870    metempsychosis    i shall not see thee nay but i shall know perchance the grey eyes in anothers eyes shall guess thy curls in gracious locks that flow on purest brows yea and the swift surmise shall follow and track and find thee in disguise of all sad things and fair where sunsets glow when through the scent of heather faint and low the weak wind whispers to the day that dies  from all sweet art and out of all old rhyme thine eyes and lips are light and song to me the shadows of the beauty of all time in song or story are but shapes of thee alas the shadowy shapes ah sweet my dear shall life or death bring all thy being near    lost in hades    i dreamed that somewhere in the shadowy place grief of farewell unspoken was forgot in welcome and regret remembered not and hopeless prayer accomplished turned to praise on lips that had been songless many days hope had no more to hope for and desire and dread were overpast in white attire new born we walked among the new worlds ways  then from the press of shades a spirit threw towards me such apples as these gardens bear and turning i was ware of her and knew and followed her fleet voice and flying hair followed and found her not and seeking you i found you never dearest anywhere    a star in the night    the perfect piteous beauty of thy face is like a star the dawning drives away mine eyes may never see in the bright day thy pallid halo thy supernal grace but in the night from forth the silent place thou comest dim in dreams as doth a stray star of the starry flock that in the grey is seen and lost and seen a moments space  and as the earth at night turns to a star loved long ago and dearer than the sun so in the spiritual place afar at night our souls are mingled and made one and wait till one night fall and one dawn rise that brings no noon too splendid for your eyes    a sunset on yarrow    the wind and the day had lived together they died together and far away spoke farewell in the sultry weather out of the sunset over the heather the dying wind and the dying day  far in the south the summer levin flushed a flame in the grey soft air we seemed to look on the hills of heaven you saw within but to me twas given to see your face as an angels there  never again ah surely never shall we wait and watch where of old we stood the low goodnight of the hill and the river the faint light fade and the wan stars quiver twain grown one in the solitude    another way    come to me in my dreams and then one saith i shall be well again for then the night will more than pay the hopeless longing of the day  nay come not thou in dreams my sweet with shadowy robes and silent feet and with the voice and with the eyes that greet me in a soft surprise  last night last night in dreams we met and how today shall i forget or how remembering restrain mine incommunicable pain  nay where thy land and people are dwell thou remote apart afar nor mingle with the shapes that sweep the melancholy ways of sleep  but if perchance the shadows break if dreams depart and men awake if face to face at length we see be thine the voice to welcome me     hesperothen     by the example of certain grecian mariners who being safely returned from the war about troy leave yet again their old lands and gods seeking they know not what and choosing neither to abide in the fair phaeacian island nor to dwell and die with the sirens at length end miserably in a desert country by the sea is set forth the vanity of melancholy  and by the land of phaeacia is to be understood the place of art and of fair pleasures and by circes isle the place of bodily delights whereof men falling aweary attain to eld and to the darkness of that age  which thing master francoys rabelais feigned under the similitude of the isle of the macraeones    the seekers for phaeacia    there is a land in the remotest day where the soft night is born and sunset dies the eastern shore sees faint tides fade away that wash the lands where laughter tears and sighs make lifethe lands below the blue of common skies  but in the west is a mysterious sea what sails have seen it or what shipmen known with coasts enchanted where the sirens be with islands where a goddess walks alone and in the cedar trees the magic winds make moan  eastward the human cares of house and home cities and ships and unknown gods and loves westward strange maidens fairer than the foam and lawless lives of men and haunted groves wherein a god may dwell and where the dryad roves  the gods are careless of the days and death of toilsome men beyond the western seas the gods are heedless of their painful breath and love them not for they are not as these but in the golden west they live and lie at ease  yet the phaeacians well they love who live at the lights limit passing careless hours most like the gods and they have gifts to give even wine and fountains musical and flowers and song and if they will swift ships and magic powers  it is a quiet midland in the cool of the twilight comes the god though no man prayed to watch the maids and young men beautiful dance and they see him and are not afraid for they are neat of kin to gods and undismayed  ah would the bright red prows might bring us nigh the dreamy isles that the immortals keep but with a mist they hide them wondrously and far the path and dim to where they sleep the loved the shadowy lands along the shadowy deep    a song of phaeacia    the languid sunset mother of roses lingers a light on the magic seas the wide fire flames as a flower uncloses heavy with odour and loose to the breeze  the red rose clouds without law or leader gather and float in the airy plain the nightingale sings to the dewy cedar the cedar scatters his scent to the main  the strange flowers perfume turns to singing heard afar over moonlit seas the sirens song grown faint in winging falls in scent on the cedar trees  as waifs blown out of the sunset flying purple and rosy and grey the birds brighten the air with their wings their crying wakens a moment the weary herds  butterflies flit from the fairy garden living blossoms of flying flowers never the nights with winter harden nor moons wax keen in this land of ours  great fruits fragrant green and golden gleam in the green and droop and fall blossom and bud and flower unfolden swing and cling to the garden wall  deep in the woods as twilight darkens glades are red with the scented fire far in the dells the white maid hearkens song and sigh of the hearts desire  ah and as moonlight fades in morning maidens song in the matin grey faints as the first birds note a warning wakes and wails to the newborn day  the waking song and the dying measure meet and the waxing and waning light meet and faint with the hours of pleasure the rose of the sea and the sky is white     the departure from phaeacia     the phaeacians   why from the dreamy meadows more fair than any dream why seek ye for the shadows beyond the ocean stream  through straits of storm and peril through firths unsailed before why make you for the sterile the dark kimmerian shore  there no bright streams are flowing there day and night are one no harvest time no sowing no sight of any sun  no sound of song or tabor no dance shall greet you there no noise of mortal labour breaks on the blind chill air  are ours not happy places where gods with mortals trod saw not our sires the faces of many a present god   the seekers   nay now no god comes hither in shape that men may see they fare we know not whither we know not what they be  yea though the sunset lingers far in your fairy glades though yours the sweetest singers though yours the kindest maids  yet here be the true shadows here in the doubtful light amid the dreamy meadows no shadow haunts the night  we seek a city splendid with light beyond the sun or lands where dreams are ended and works and days are done    a ballad of departure  3    fair white bird what song art thou singing in wintry weather of lands oer sea dear white bird what way art thou winging where no grass grows and no green tree  i looked at the faroff fields and grey there grew no tree but the cypress tree that bears sad fruits with the flowers of may and whoso looks on it woe is he  and whoso eats of the fruit thereof has no more sorrow and no more love and who sets the same in his garden stead in a little space he is waste and dead    they hear the sirens for the second time    the weary sails a moment slept the oars were silent for a space as past hesperian shores we swept that were as a remembered face seen after lapse of hopeless years in hades when the shadows meet dim through the mist of many tears and strange and though a shadow sweet  so seemed the halfremembered shore that slumbered mirrored in the blue with havens where we touched of yore and ports that over well we knew then broke the calm before a breeze that sought the secret of the west and listless all we swept the seas towards the islands of the blest  beside a golden sanded bay we saw the sirens very fair the flowery hill whereon they lay the flowers set upon their hair their old sweet song came down the wind remembered music waxing strong ah now no need of cords to bind no need had we of orphic song  it once had seemed a little thing to lay our lives down at their feet that dying we might hear them sing and dying see their faces sweet but now we glanced and passing by no care had we to tarry long faint hope and rest and memory were more than any sirens song    circes isle revisited    ah circe circe in the wood we cried ah circe circe but no voice replied no voice from bowers oergrown and ruinous as fallen rocks upon the mountain side  there was no sound of singing in the air faded or fled the maidens that were fair no more for sorrow or joy were seen of us no light of laughing eyes or floating hair  the perfume and the music and the flame had passed away the memory of shame alone abode and stings of faint desire and pulses of vague quiet went and came  ah circe in thy sad changed fairy place our dead youth came and looked on us a space with drooping wings and eyes of faded fire and wasted hair about a weary face  why had we ever sought the magic isle that seemed so happy in the days erewhile why did we ever leave it where we met a world of happy wonders in one smile  back to the westward and the waning light we turned we fled the solitude of night was better than the infinite regret in fallen places of our dead delight    the limit of lands    between the circling ocean sea and the poplars of persephone there lies a strip of barren sand flecked with the seas last spray and strown with waste leaves of the poplars blown from gardens of the shadow land  with altars of old sacrifice the shore is set in mournful wise the mists upon the ocean brood between the water and the air the clouds are born that float and fare between the water and the wood  upon the grey sea never sail of mortals passed within our hail where the last weak waves faint and flow we heard within the poplar pale the murmur of a doubtful wail of voices loved so long ago  we scarce had care to die or live we had no honey cake to give no wine of sacrifice to shed there lies no new path over sea and now we know how faint they be the feasts and voices of the dead  ah flowers and dance ah sun and snow glad life sad life we did forego to dream of quietness and rest ah would the fleet sweet roses here poured light and perfume through the drear pale year and wan land of the west  sad youth that let the spring go by because the spring is swift to fly sad youth that feared to mourn or love behold how sadder far is this to know that rest is nowise bliss and darkness is the end thereof     verses     martial in town    last night within the stifling train lit by the foggy lamp oerhead sick of the sad last news i read verse of that joyous child of spain  who dwelt when rome was waxing cold within the roman din and smoke and like my heart to me they spoke these accents of his heart of old  brother had we but time to live and fleet the careless hours together with all that leisure has to give of perfect life and peaceful weather  the rich mans halls the anxious faces the weary forum courts and cases should know us not but quiet nooks but summer shade by field and well but county rides and talk of books at home with these we fain would dwell  now neither lives but day by day sees the suns wasting in the west and feels their flight and doth delay to lead the life he loveth best  so from thy city prison broke martial thy wail for life misspent and so through londons noise and smoke my heart replies to the lament  for dear as tagus with his gold and swifter salo were to thee so dear to me the woods that fold the streams that circle fernielea    april on tweed    as birds are fain to build their nest the first soft sunny day so longing wakens in my breast a month before the may when now the wind is from the west and winter melts away  the snow lies yet on eildon hill but soft the breezes blow if melting snows the waters fill we nothing heed the snow but we must up and take our will a fishing will we go  below the branches brown and bare beneath the primrose lea the trout lies waiting for his fare a hungry trout is he hes hooked and springs and splashes there like salmon from the sea  oh april tides a pleasant tide however times may fall and sweet to welcome spring the bride you hear the mavis call but all adown the waterside the springs most fair of all    tired of towns    when we spoke to her of the new jerusalem she said she would rather go to a country place in heaven  letters from the black country   im weary of towns it seems amost a pity we didnt stop down i the country and clem and you say that im bound for another city for the streets o the new jerusalem  and the streets are never like sheffield here nor the smoke dont cling like a smut to them but the water o life flows cool and clear through the streets o the new jerusalem  and the houses you say are of jasper cut and the gates are gaudy wi gold and gem but theres times i could wish as the gates was shut the gates o the new jerusalem  for i come from a country thats overbuilt wi streets that stifle and walls that hem and the gorse on a commons worth all the gilt and the gold of your new jerusalem  and i hope that theyll bring me in paradise to green lanes leafy wi bough and stem to a country place in the land o the skies and not to the new jerusalem    scythe song    mowers weary and brown and blithe what is the word methinks ye know endless overword that the scythe sings to the blades of the grass below scythes that swing in the grass and clover something still they say as they pass what is the word that over and over sings the scythe to the flowers and grass  hush ah hush the scythes are saying hush and heed not and fall asleep hush they say to the grasses swaying hush they sing to the clover deep hushtis the lullaby time is singing hush and heed not for all things pass hush ah hush and the scythes are swinging over the clover over the grass    pen and ink    ye wanderers that were my sires who read mens fortunes in the hand who voyaged with your smithy fires from waste to waste across the land why did you leave for garth and town your life by heath and rivers brink why lay your gipsy freedom down and doom your child to pen and ink  you wearied of the wildwood meal that crowned or failed to crown the day too honest or too tame to steal you broke into the beaten way plied loom or awl like other men and learned to love the guineas chink oh recreant sires who doomed me then to earn so fewwith pen and ink  where it hath fallen the tree must lie tis over late for me to roam yet the caged bird who hears the cry of his wild fellows fleeting home may feel no sharper pang than mine who seem to hear wheneer i think spate in the stream and wind in pine call me to quit dull pen and ink  for then the spirit wandering that slept within the blood awakes for then the summer and the spring i fain would meet by streams and lakes but ah my birthright long is sold but custom chains me link on link and i must get me as of old back to my tools to pen and ink    a dream    why will you haunt my sleep you know it may not be the grave is wide and deep that sunders you and me in bitter dreams we reap the sorrow we have sown and i would i were asleep forgotten and alone  we knew and did not know we saw and did not see the nets that long ago fate wove for you and me the cruel nets that keep the birds that sob and moan and i would we were asleep forgotten and alone    the singing rose    la rose qui chante et lherbe qui egare   white rose on the grey garden wall where now no nightwind whispereth call to the faroff flowers and call with murmured breath and musical till all the roses hear and all sing to my love what the white rose saith  white rose on the grey garden wall that long ago we sung again you come at summers call again beneath my windows all with trellised flowers is hung with clusters of the roses white like fragrant stars in a green night  once more i hear the sister towers each unto each reply the bloom is on those limes of ours the weak wind shakes the bloom in showers snow from a cloudless sky there is no change this happy day within the college gardens grey  st marys merton magdalenstill their sweet bells chime and swing the old years answer them and thrill a wintry heart against its will with memories of the spring that spring we sought the gardens through for flowers which neer in gardens grew  for we beside our nurses knee in fairy tales had heard of that strange rose which blossoms free on boughs of an enchanted tree and sings like any bird and of the weed beside the way that leadeth lovers steps astray  in vain we sought the singing rose whereof old legends tell alas we found it not mid those within the grey old college close that budded flowered and fell we found that herb called wandering and meet no more no more in spring  yes unawares the unhappy grass that leadeth steps astray we trod and so it came to pass that never more we twain alas shall

last we gathered roses in the garden i found my wits but truly you lost yours  the broken heart   july and june brought flowers and love to you but i would none thereof whose heart kept all through summer time a flower of frost and winter rime yours was true wisdomwas it not even love but i had clean forgot till seasons of the falling leaf all loves but one that turned to grief at length at touch of autumn tide when roses fell and summer died all in a dawning deep with dew love flew to me love fled from you the roses drooped their weary heads i spoke among the garden beds you would not hear you could not know summer and love seemed long ago as far as faint as dim a dream as to the dead this world may seem ah sweet in winters miseries perchance you may remember this how wisdom was not justified in summer time or autumn tide though for this once below the sun wisdom and love were made at one but love was bitterbought enough and wisdom light of wing as love    goodbye    kiss me and say goodbye goodbye there is no word to say but this nor any lips left for my lips to kiss nor any tears to shed when these tears dry kiss me and say goodbye  farewell be glad forget there is no need to say forget i know for youth is youth and time will have it so and though your lips are pale and your eyes wet farewell you must forget  you shall bring home your sheaves many and heavy and with blossoms twined of memories that go not out of mind let this one sheaf be twined with poppy leaves when you bring home your sheaves  in garnered loves of thine the ripe good fruit of many hearts and years somewhere let this lie grey and salt with tears it grew too near the sea wind and the brine of life this love of mine  this sheaf was spoiled in spring and overlong was green and early sere and never gathered gold in the late year from autumn suns and moons of harvesting but failed in frosts of spring  yet was it thine my sweet this love though weak as young corn withered whereof no man may gather and make bread thine though it never knew the summer heat forget not quite my sweet    an old prayer    greek text  odyssey xiii   my prayer an old prayer borroweth of ancient love and memory do thou farewell till eld and death that come to all men come to thee gently as winters early breath scarce felt what time the swallows flee to lands whereof no man knoweth of summer over land and sea so with thy soul may summer be even as the ancient singer saith do thou farewell till eld and death that come to all men come to thee    a la belle helene    after ronsard   more closely than the clinging vine about the wedded tree clasp thou thine arms ah mistress mine about the heart of me or seem to sleep and stoop your face soft on my sleeping eyes breathe in your life your heart your grace through me in kissing wise bow down bow down your face i pray to me that swoon to death breathe back the life you kissed away breathe back your kissing breath so by your eyes i swear and say my mighty oath and sure from your kind arms no maiden may my loving heart allure ill bear your yoke thats light enough and to the elysian plain when we are dead of love my love one boat shall bear us twain theyll flock around you fleet and fair all true loves that have been and you of all the shadows there shall be the shadow queen ah shadowloves and shadowlips ah while tis called today love me my love for summer slips and august ebbs away    sylvie et aurelie    in memory of gerard de nerval   two loves there were and one was born between the sunset and the rain her singing voice went through the corn her dance was woven neath the thorn on grass the fallen blossoms stain and suns may set and moons may wane but this love comes no more again  there were two loves and one made white thy singing lips and golden hair born of the citys mire and light the shame and splendour of the night she trapped and fled thee unaware not through the lamplight and the rain shalt thou behold this love again  go forth and seek by wood and hill thine ancient love of dawn and dew there comes no voice from mere or rill her dance is over fallen still the ballad burdens that she knew and thou must wait for her in vain till years bring back thy youth again  that other love afield afar fled the light love with lighter feet nay though thou seek where gravesteads are and flit in dreams from star to star that dead love shalt thou never meet till through bleak dawn and blowing rain thy soul shall find her soul again    a lost path    plotinus the greek philosopher had a certain proper mode of ecstasy whereby as porphyry saith his soul becoming free from the deathly flesh was made one with the spirit that is in the world   alas the path is lost we cannot leave our bright our clouded life and pass away as through strewn clouds that stain the quiet eve to heights remoter of the purer day the soul may not returning whence she came bathe herself deep in being and forget the joys that fever and the cares that fret made once more one with the eternal flame that breathes in all things ever more the same she would be young again thus drinking deep of her old life and this has been men say but this we know not who have only sleep to soothe us sleep more terrible than day where dead delights and fair lost faces stray to make us weary at our wakening and of that long lost path to the divine we dream as some greek shepherd erst might sing half credulous of easy proserpine and of the lands that lie beneath the days decline    the shade of helen    some say that helen went never to troy but abode in egypt for the gods having made in her semblance a woman out of clouds and shadows sent the same to be wife to paris  for this shadow then the greeks and trojans slew each other   why from the quiet hollows of the hills and extreme meeting place of light and shade wherein soft rains fell slowly and became clouds among sister clouds where fair spent beams and dying glories of the sun would dwell why have they whom i know not nor may know strange hands unseen and ruthless fashioned me and borne me from the silent shadowy hills hither to noise and glow of alien life to harsh and clamorous swords and sound of war  one speaks unto me words that would be sweet made harsh made keen with love that knows me not and some strange force within me or around makes answer kiss for kiss and sigh for sigh and somewhere there is fever in the halls that troubles me for no such trouble came to vex the cool far hollows of the hills  the foolish folk crowd round me and they cry that house and wife and lands and all troy town are little to lose if they may keep me here and see me flit a pale and silent shade among the streets bereft and helpless shrines  at other hours another life seems mine where one great river runs unswollen of rain by pyramids of unremembered kings and homes of men obedient to the dead there dark and quiet faces come and go around me then again the shriek of arms and all the turmoil of the ilian men  what are they even shadows such as i what make they  even thisthe sport of gods the sport of gods however free they seem ah would the game were ended and the light the blinding light and all too mighty suns withdrawn and i once more with sister shades unloved forgotten mingled with the mist dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills     sonnets     she    to h r

from care as deep as countless careless races of the dead not so for alien paths of dreams we tread and one beholds the faces that he sighs in vain to bring before his daylit eyes and waking he
