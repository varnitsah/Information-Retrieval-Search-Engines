49166650	some short stories  by henry james     contents  brooksmith  the real thing  the story of it  flickerbridge  mrs medwin     brooksmith   we are scattered now the friends of the late mr oliver offord but whenever we chance to meet i think we are conscious of a certain esoteric respect for each other yes you too have been in arcadia we seem not too grumpily to allow when i pass the house in mansfield street i remember that arcadia was there i dont know who has it now and dont want to know its enough to be so sure that if i should ring the bell there would be no such luck for me as that brooksmith should open the door mr offord the most agreeable the most attaching of bachelors was a retired diplomatist living on his pension and on something of his own over and above a good deal confined by his infirmities to his fireside and delighted to be found there any afternoon in the year from five oclock on by such visitors as brooksmith allowed to come up brooksmith was his butler and his most intimate friend to whom we all stood or i should say sat in the same relation in which the subject of the sovereign finds himself to the prime minister by having been for years in foreign lands the most delightful englishman any one had ever known mr offord had in my opinion rendered signal service to his country but i suppose he had been too much likedliked even by those who didnt like itso that as people of that sort never get titles or dotations for the horrid things theyve not done his principal reward was simply that we went to see him  oh we went perpetually and it was not our fault if he was not overwhelmed with this particular honour any visitor who came once came again to come merely once was a slight nobody im sure had ever put upon him his circle therefore was essentially composed of habitués who were habitués for each other as well as for him as those of a happy salon should be i remember vividly every element of the place down to the intensely londonish look of the grey opposite houses in the gap of the white curtains of the high windows and the exact spot where on a particular afternoon i put down my teacup for brooksmith lingering an instant to gather it up as if he were plucking a flower mr offords drawingroom was indeed brooksmiths garden his pruned and tended human parterre and if we all flourished there and grew well in our places it was largely owing to his supervision  many persons have heard much though most have doubtless seen little of the famous institution of the salon and many are born to the depression of knowing that this finest flower of social life refuses to bloom where the english tongue is spoken the explanation is usually that our women have not the skill to cultivate itthe art to direct through a smiling land between suggestive shores a sinuous stream of talk my affectionate my pious memory of mr offord contradicts this induction only i fear more insidiously to confirm it the sallow and slightly smoked drawingroom in which he spent so large a portion of the last years of his life certainly deserved the distinguished name but on the other hand it couldnt be said at all to owe its stamp to any intervention throwing into relief the fact that there was no mrs offord the dear man had indeed at the most been capable of one of those sacrifices to which women are deemed peculiarly apt he had recognisedunder the influence in some degree it is true of physical infirmitythat if you wish people to find you at home you must manage not to be out he had in short accepted the truth which many dabblers in the social art are slow to learn that you must really as they say take a line and that the only way as yet discovered of being at home is to stay at home finally his own fireside had become a summary of his habits why should he ever have left itsince this would have been leaving what was notoriously pleasantest in london the compact charmed cluster thinning away indeed into casual couples round the fine old lastcentury chimneypiece which with the exception of the remarkable collection of miniatures was the best thing the place contained mr offord wasnt rich he had nothing but his pension and the use for life of the somewhat superannuated house  when im reminded by some opposed discomfort of the present hour how perfectly we were all handled there i ask myself once more what had been the secret of such perfection one had taken it for granted at the time for anything that is supremely good produces more acceptance than surprise i felt we were all happy but i didnt consider how our happiness was managed and yet there were questions to be asked questions that strike me as singularly obvious now that theres nobody to answer them mr offord had solved the insoluble he had without feminine helpsave in the sense that ladies were dying to come to him and that he saved the lives of severalestablished a salon but i might have guessed that there was a method in his madness a law in his success he hadnt hit it off by a mere fluke there was an art in it all and how was the art so hidden who indeed if it came to that was the occult artist launching this inquiry the other day i had already got hold of the tail of my reply i was helped by the very wonder of some of the conditions that came back to methose that used to seem as natural as sunshine in a fine climate  how was it for instance that we never were a crowd never either too many or too few always the right people with the right peoplethere must really have been no wrong people at allalways coming and going never sticking fast nor overstaying yet never popping in or out with an indecorous familiarity how was it that we all sat where we wanted and moved when we wanted and met whom we wanted and escaped whom we wanted joining according to the accident of inclination the general circle or falling in with a single talker on a convenient sofa why were all the sofas so convenient the accidents so happy the talkers so ready the listeners so willing the subjects presented to you in a rotation as quickly foreordained as the courses at dinner a dearth of topics would have been as unheard of as a lapse in the service these speculations couldnt fail to lead me to the fundamental truth that brooksmith had been somehow at the bottom of the mystery if he hadnt established the salon at least he had carried it on brooksmith in short was the artist  we felt this covertly at the time without formulating it and were conscious as an ordered and prosperous community of his evenhanded justice all untainted with flunkeyism he had none of that vulgarityhis touch was infinitely fine the delicacy of it was clear to me on the first occasion my eyes rested as they were so often to rest again on the domestic revealed in the turbid light of the street by the opening of the housedoor i saw on the spot that though he had plenty of school he carried it without arrogancehe had remained articulate and human lecole anglaise mr offord used laughingly to call him when later on it happened more than once that we had some conversation about him but i remember accusing mr offord of not doing him quite ideal justice that he wasnt one of the giants of the school however was admitted by my old friend who really understood him perfectly and was devoted to him as i shall show which doubtless poor brooksmith had himself felt to his cost when his value in the market was originally determined the utility of his class in general is estimated by the foot and the inch and poor brooksmith had only about five feet three to put into circulation he acknowledged the inadequacy of this provision and im sure was penetrated with the everlasting fitness of the relation between service and stature if he had been mr offord he certainly would have found brooksmith wanting and indeed the laxity of his employer on this score was one of many things he had had to condone and to which he had at last indulgently adapted himself  i remember the old mans saying to me oh my servants if they can live with me a fortnight they can live with me for ever but its the first fortnight that tries em it was in the first fortnight for instance that brooksmith had had to learn that he was exposed to being addressed as my dear fellow and my poor child strange and deep must such a probation have been to him and he doubtless emerged from it tempered and purified this was written to a certain extent in his appearance in his spare brisk little person in his cloistered white face and extraordinarily polished hair which told of responsibility looked as if it were kept up to the same high standard as the plate in his small clear anxious eyes even in the permitted though not exactly encouraged tuft on his chin he thinks me rather mad but ive broken him in and now he likes the place he likes the company said the old man i embraced this fully after i had become aware that brooksmiths main characteristic was a deep and shy refinement though i remember i was rather puzzled when on another occasion mr offord remarked what he likes is the talkmingling in the conversation i was conscious i had never seen brooksmith permit himself this freedom but i guessed in a moment that what mr offord alluded to was a participation more intense than any speech could have representedthat of being perpetually present on a hundred legitimate pretexts errands necessities and breathing the very atmosphere of criticism the famous criticism of life quite an education sir isnt it sir he said to me one day at the foot of the stairs when he was letting me out and ive always remembered the words and the tone as the first sign of the quickening drama of poor brooksmiths fate it was indeed an education but to what was this sensitive young man of thirtyfive of the servile class being educated  practically and inevitably for the time to companionship to the perpetual the even exaggerated reference and appeal of a person brought to dependence by his time of life and his infirmities and always addicted moreoverthis was the exaggerationto the art of giving you pleasure by letting you do things for him there were certain things mr offord was capable of pretending he liked you to do even when he didntthis i mean if he thought you liked them if it happened that you didnt eitherwhich was rare yet might beof course there were crosspurposes but brooksmith was there to prevent their going very far this was precisely the way he acted as moderator he averted misunderstandings or cleared them up he had been capable strange as it may appear of acquiring for this purpose an insight into the french tongue which was often used at mr offords for besides being habitual to most of the foreigners and they were many who haunted the place or arrived with lettersletters often requiring a little worried consideration of which brooksmith always had cognisanceit had really become the primary language of the master of the house i dont know if all the malentendus were in french but almost all the explanations were and this didnt a bit prevent brooksmiths following them i know mr offord used to read passages to him from montaigne and saintsimon for he read perpetually when alonewhen they were alone that isand brooksmith was always about perhaps youll say no wonder mr offords butler regarded him as rather mad however if im not sure what he thought about montaigne im convinced he admired saintsimon a certain feeling for letters must have rubbed off on him from the mere handling of his masters books which he was always carrying to and fro and putting back in their places  i often noticed that if an anecdote or a quotation much more a lively discussion was going forward he would if busy with the fire or the curtains the lamp or the tea find a pretext for remaining in the room till the point should be reached if his purpose was to catch it you werent discreet you were in fact scarce human to call him off and i shall never forget a look a hard stony starei caught it in its passagewhich one day when there were a good many people in the room he fastened upon the footman who was helping him in the service and who in an undertone had asked him some irrelevant question it was the only manifestation of harshness i ever observed on brooksmiths part and i at first wondered what was the matter then i became conscious that mr offord was relating a very curious anecdote never before perhaps made so public and imparted to the narrator by an eyewitness of the fact bearing on lord byrons life in italy nothing would induce me to reproduce it here but brooksmith had been in danger of losing it if i ever should venture to reproduce it i shall feel how much i lose in not having my fellow auditor to refer to  the first day mr offords door was closed was therefore a dark date in contemporary history it was raining hard and my umbrella was wet but brooksmith received it from me exactly as if this were a preliminary for going upstairs i observed however that instead of putting it away he held it poised and trickling over the rug and i then became aware that he was looking at me with deep acknowledging eyeshis air of universal responsibility i immediately understoodthere was scarce need of question and answer as they passed between us when i took in that our good friend had given up as never before though only for the occasion i exclaimed dolefully what a difference it will makeand to how many people  i shall be one of them sir said brooksmith and that was the beginning of the end  mr offord came down again but the spell was broken the great sign being that the conversation was for the first time not directed it wandered and stumbled a little frightened like a lost childit had let go the nurses hand the worst of it is that now we shall talk about my healthcest la fin de tout mr offord said when he reappeared and then i recognised what a note of change that would befor he had never tolerated anything so provincial we ran to each others health as little as to the daily weather the talk became ours in a wordnot his and as ours even when he talked it could only be inferior in this form it was a distress to brooksmith whose attention now wandered from it altogether he had so much closer a vision of his masters intimate conditions than our superficialities represented there were better hours and he was more in and out of the room but i could see he was conscious of the decline almost of the collapse of our great institution he seemed to wish to take counsel with me about it to feel responsible for its going on in some form or other when for the second periodthe first had lasted several dayshe had to tell me that his employer didnt receive i half expected to hear him say after a moment do you think i ought to sir in his placeas he might have asked me with the return of autumn if i thought he had better light the drawingroom fire  he had a resigned philosophic sense of what his guestsour guests as i came to regard them in our colloquieswould expect his feeling was that he wouldnt absolutely have approved of himself as a substitute for mr offord but he was so saturated with the religion of habit that he would have made for our friends the necessary sacrifice to the divinity he would take them on a little further till they could look about them i think i saw him also mentally confronted with the opportunity to dealfor once in his lifewith some of his own dumb preferences his limitations of sympathy weeding a little in prospect and returning to a purer tradition it was not unknown to me that he considered that toward the end of our hosts career a certain laxity of selection had crept in  at last it came to be the case that we all found the closed door more often than the open one but even when it was closed brooksmith managed a crack for me to squeeze through so that practically i never turned away without having paid a visit the difference simply came to be that the visit was to brooksmith it took place in the hall at the familiar foot of the stairs and we didnt sit down at least brooksmith didnt moreover it was devoted wholly to one topic and always had the air of being already overbeginning so to say at the end but it was always interestingit always gave me something to think about its true that the subject of my meditation was ever the sameever its all very well but what will become of brooksmith even my private answer to this question left me still unsatisfied no doubt mr offord would provide for him but what would he providethat was the great point he couldnt provide society and society had become a necessity of brooksmiths nature i must add that he never showed a symptom of what i may call sordid solicitudeanxiety on his own account he was rather livid and intensely grave as befitted a man before whose eyes the shade of that which once was great was passing away he had the solemnity of a person winding up under depressing circumstances a longestablished and celebrated business he was a kind of social executor or liquidator but his manner seemed to testify exclusively to the uncertainty of our future i couldnt in those days have afforded iti lived in two rooms in jermyn street and didnt keep a man but even if my income had permitted i shouldnt have ventured to say to brooksmith emulating mr offord my dear fellow ill take you on the whole tone of our intercourse was so much more an implication that it was i who should now want a lift indeed there was a tacit assurance in brooksmiths whole attitude that he should have me on his mind  one of the most assiduous members of our circle had been lady kenyon and i remember his telling me one day that her ladyship had in spite of her own infirmities lately much aggravated been in person to inquire in answer to this i remarked that she would feel it more than any one brooksmith had a pause before saying in a certain tonetheres no reproducing some of his tonesill go and see her i went to see her myself and learned he had waited on her but when i said to her in the form of a joke but with a core of earnest that when all was over some of us ought to combine to club together and set brooksmith up on his own account she replied a trifle disappointingly do you mean in a publichouse i looked at her in a way that i think brooksmith himself would have approved and then i answered yes the offord arms what i had meant of course was that for the love of art itself we ought to look to it that such a peculiar faculty and so much acquired experience shouldnt be wasted i really think that if we had caused a few blackedged cards to be struck off and circulatedmr brooksmith will continue to receive on the old premises from four to seven business carried on as usual during the alterationsthe greater number of us would have rallied  several times he took me upstairsalways by his own proposaland our dear old friend in bed in a curious flowered and brocaded casaque which made him especially as his head was tied up in a handkerchief to match look to my imagination like the dying voltaire held for ten minutes a sadly shrunken little salon i felt indeed each time as if i were attending the last coucher of some social sovereign he was royally whimsical about his sufferings and not at all concernedquite as if the constitution provided for the case about his successor he glided over our sufferings charmingly and none of his jokesit was a gallant abstention some of them would have been so easywere at our expense now and again i confess there was one at brooksmiths but so pathetically sociable as to make the excellent man look at me in a way that seemed to say do exchange a glance with me or i shant be able to stand it what he wasnt able to stand was not what mr offord said about him but what he wasnt able to say in return his idea of conversation for himself was giving you the convenience of speaking to him and when he went to see lady kenyon for instance it was to carry her the tribute of his receptive silence where would the speech of his betters have been if proper service had been a manifestation of sound in that case the fundamental difference would have had to be shown by their dumbness and many of them poor things were dumb enough without that provision brooksmith took an unfailing interest in the preservation of the fundamental difference it was the thing he had most on his conscience  what had become of it however when mr offord passed away like any inferior personwas relegated to eternal stillness after the manner of a butler abovestairs his aspect on the eventfor the several successive daysmay be imagined and the multiplication by funereal observance of the things he didnt say when everything was overit was late the same dayi knocked at the door of the house of mourning as i so often had done before i could never call on mr offord again but i had come literally to call on brooksmith i wanted to ask him if there was anything i could do for him tainted with vagueness as this inquiry could only be my presumptuous dream of taking him into my own service had died away my service wasnt worth his being taken into my offer could only be to help him to find another place and yet there was an indelicacy as it were in taking for granted that his thoughts would immediately be fixed on another i had a hope that he would be able to give his life a different formthough certainly not the form the frequent result of such bereavements of his setting up a little shop that would have been dreadful for i should have wished to forward any enterprise he might embark in yet how could i have brought myself to go and pay him shillings and take back coppers over a counter my visit then was simply an intended compliment he took it as such gratefully and with all the tact in the world he knew i really couldnt help him and that i knew he knew i couldnt but we discussed the situationwith a good deal of elegant generalityat the foot of the stairs in the hall already dismantled where i had so often discussed other situations with him the executors were in possession as was still more apparent when he made me pass for a few minutes into the diningroom where various objects were muffled up for removal  two definite facts however he had to communicate one being that he was to leave the house for ever that night servants for some mysterious reason seem always to depart by night and the otherhe mentioned it only at the last and with hesitationthat he was already aware his late master had left him a legacy of eighty pounds im very glad i said and brooksmith was of the same mind it was so like him to think of me this was all that passed between us on the subject and i know nothing of his judgement of mr offords memento eighty pounds are always eighty pounds and no one has ever left me an equal sum but all the same for brooksmith i was disappointed i dont know what i had expected but it was almost a shock eighty pounds might stock a small shopa very small shop but i repeat i couldnt bear to think of that i asked my friend if he had been able to save a little and he replied no sir ive had to do things i didnt inquire what things they might have been they were his own affair and i took his word for them as assentingly as if he had had the greatness of an ancient house to keep up especially as there was something in his manner that seemed to convey a prospect of further sacrifice  i shall have to turn round a bit siri shall have to look about me he said and then he added indulgently magnanimously if you should happen to hear of anything for me  i couldnt let him finish this was in its essence too much in the really grand manner it would be a help to my getting him off my mind to be able to pretend i could find the right place and that help he wished to give me for it was doubtless painful to him to see me in so false a position i interposed with a few words to the effect of how well aware i was that wherever he should go whatever he should do he would miss our old friend terriblymiss him even more than i should having been with him so much more this led him to make the speech that has remained with me as the very text of the whole episode  oh sir its sad for you very sad indeed and for a great many gentlemen and ladies that it is sir but for me sir it is if i may say so still graver even than that its just the loss of something that was everything for me sir he went on with rising tears he was just all if you know what i mean sir you have others sir i daresaynot that i would have you understand me to speak of them as in any way tantamount but you have the pleasures of society sir if its only in talking about him sir as i daresay you do freelyfor all his blest memory has to fear from itwith gentlemen and ladies who have had the same honour thats not for me sir and ive to keep my associations to myself mr offord was my society and now you see i just havent any you go back to conversation sir after all and i go back to my place brooksmith stammered without exaggerated irony or dramatic bitterness but with a flat unstudied veracity and his hand on the knob of the streetdoor he turned it to let me out and then he added i just go downstairs sir again and i stay there  my poor child i replied in my emotion quite as mr offord used to speak my dear fellow leave it to me well look after you well all do something for you  ah if you could give me some one like him but there aint two such in the world brooksmith said as we parted  he had given me his addressthe place where he would be to be heard of for a long time i had no occasion to make use of the information he proved on trial so very difficult a case the people who knew him and had known mr offord didnt want to take him and yet i couldnt bear to try to thrust him among strangersstrangers to his past when not to his present i spoke to many of our old friends about him and found them all governed by the odd mixture of feelings of which i myself was consciousas well as disposed further to entertain a suspicion that he was spoiled with which i then would have nothing to do in plain terms a certain embarrassment a sensible awkwardness when they thought of it attached to the idea of using him as a menial they had met him so often in society many of them would have asked him and did ask him or rather did ask me to ask him to come and see them but a mere visitinglist was not what i wanted for him he was too short for people who were very particular nevertheless i heard of an opening in a diplomatic household which led me to write him a note though i was looking much less for something grand than for something human five days later i heard from him the secretarys wife had decided after keeping him waiting till then that she couldnt take a servant out of a house in which there hadnt been a lady the note had a ps its a good job there wasnt sir such a lady as some  a week later he came to see me and told me he was suited committed to some highly respectable peoplethey were something quite immense in the citywho lived on the bayswater side of the park i daresay it will be rather poor sir he admitted but ive seen the fireworks havent i sirit cant be fireworks every night after mansfield street there aint much choice there was a certain amount however it seemed for the following year calling one day on a country cousin a lady of a certain age who was spending a fortnight in town with some friends of her own a family unknown to me and resident in chester square the door of the house was opened to my surprise and gratification by brooksmith in person when i came out i had some conversation with him from which i gathered that he had found the large city people too dull for endurance and i guessed though he didnt say it that he had found them vulgar as well i dont know what judgement he would have passed on his actual patrons if my relative hadnt been their friend but in view of that connexion he abstained from comment  none was necessary however for before the lady in question brought her visit to a close they honoured me with an invitation to dinner which i accepted there was a largeish party on the occasion but i confess i thought of brooksmith rather more than of the seated company they required no depth of attentionthey were all referable to usual irredeemable inevitable types it was the world of cheerful commonplace and conscious gentility and prosperous density a fullfed material insular world a world of hideous florid plate and ponderous order and thin conversation there wasnt a word said about byron or even about a minor bard then much in view nothing would have induced me to look at brooksmith in the course of the repast and i felt sure that not even my overturning the wine would have induced him to meet my eye we were in intellectual sympathywe felt as regards each other a degree of social responsibility in short we had been in arcadia together and we had both come to this no wonder we were ashamed to be confronted when he had helped on my overcoat as i was going away we parted for the first time since the earliest days of mansfield street in silence i thought he looked lean and wasted and i guessed that his new place wasnt more human than his previous one there was plenty of beef and beer but there was no reciprocity the question for him to have asked before accepting the position wouldnt have been how many footmen are kept but how much imagination  the next time i went to the housei confess it wasnt very sooni encountered his successor a personage who evidently enjoyed the good fortune of never having quitted his natural level could any be higher he seemed to askover the heads of three footmen and even of some visitors he made me feel as if brooksmith were dead but i didnt dare to inquirei couldnt have borne his i havent the least idea sir i despatched a note to the address that worthy had given me after mr offords death but i received no answer six months later however i was favoured with a visit from an elderly dreary dingy person who introduced herself to me as mr brooksmiths aunt and from whom i learned that he was out of place and out of health and had allowed her to come and say to me that if i could spare half an hour to look in at him he would take it as a rare honour  i went the next dayhis messenger had given me a new addressand found my friend lodged in a short sordid street in marylebone one of those corners of london that wear the last expression of sickly meanness the room into which i was shown was above the small establishment of a dyer and cleaner who had inflated kid gloves and discoloured shawls in his shopfront there was a great deal of grimy infant life up and down the place and there was a hot moist smell within as of the boiling of dirty linen brooksmith sat with a blanket over his legs at a clean little window where from behind stiff bluishwhite curtains he could look across at a hucksters and a tinsmiths and a small greasy publichouse he had passed through an illness and was convalescent and his mother as well as his aunt was in attendance on him i liked the nearer relative who was bland and intensely humble but i had my doubts of the remoter whom i connected perhaps unjustly with the opposite publichouseshe seemed somehow greasy with the same greaseand whose furtive eye followed every movement of my hand as to see if it werent going into my pocket it didnt take this directioni couldnt unsolicited put myself at that sort of ease with brooksmith several times the door of the room opened and mysterious old women peeped in and shuffled back again i dont know who they were poor brooksmith seemed encompassed with vague prying beery females  he was vague himself and evidently weak and much embarrassed and not an allusion was made between us to mansfield street the vision of the salon of which he had been an ornament hovered before me however by contrast sufficiently he assured me he was really getting better and his mother remarked that he would come round if he could only get his spirits up the aunt echoed this opinion and i became more sure that in her own case she knew where to go for such a purpose im afraid i was rather weak with my old friend for i neglected the opportunity so exceptionally good to rebuke the levity which had led him to throw up honourable positionsfine stiff steady berths in bayswater and belgravia with morning prayers as i knew attached to one of them very likely his reasons had been profane and sentimental he didnt want morning prayers he wanted to be somebodys dear fellow but i couldnt be the person to rebuke him he shuffled these episodes out of sighti saw he had no wish to discuss them i noted further strangely enough that it would probably be a questionable pleasure for him to see me again he doubted now even of my power to condone his aberrations he didnt wish to have to explain and his behaviour was likely in future to need explanation when i bade him farewell he looked at me a moment with eyes that said everything how can i talk about those exquisite years in this place before these people with the old women poking their heads in it was very good of you to come to see me it wasnt my ideashe brought you weve said everything its over youll lose all patience with me and id rather you shouldnt see the rest i sent him some money in a letter the next day but i saw the rest only in the light of a barren sequel  a whole year after my visit to him i became aware once in dining out that brooksmith was one of the several servants who hovered behind our chairs he hadnt opened the door of the house to me nor had i recognised him in the array of retainers in the hall this time i tried to catch his eye but he never gave me a chance and when he handed me a dish i could only be careful to thank him audibly indeed i partook of two entrÉes of which i had my doubts subsequently converted into certainties in order not to snub him he looked well enough in health but much older and wore in an exceptionally marked degree the glazed and expressionless mask of the british domestic de race i saw with dismay that if i hadnt known him i should have taken him on the showing of his countenance for an extravagant illustration of irresponsive servile gloom i said to myself that he had become a reactionary gone over to the philistines thrown himself into religion the religion of his place like a foreign lady sur le retour i divined moreover that he was only engaged for the eveninghe had become a mere waiter had joined the band of the whitewaistcoated who go out there was something pathetic in this factit was a terrible vulgarisation of brooksmith it was the mercenary prose of butlerhood he had given up the struggle for the poetry if reciprocity was what he had missed where was the reciprocity now only in the bottoms of the wineglasses and the five shillingsor whatever they getclapped into his hand by the permanent man however i supposed he had taken up a precarious branch of his profession because it after all sent him less downstairs his relations with london society were more superficial but they were of course more various as i went away on this occasion i looked out for him eagerly among the four or five attendants whose perpendicular persons fluting the walls of london passages are supposed to lubricate the process of departure but he was not on duty i asked one of the others if he were not in the house and received the prompt answer just left sir anything i can do for you sir i wanted to say please give him my kind regards but i abstainedi didnt want to compromise him and i never came across him again  often and often in dining out i looked for him sometimes accepting invitations on purpose to multiply the chances of my meeting him but always in vain so that as i met many other members of the casual class over and over again i at last adopted the theory that he always procured a list of expected guests beforehand and kept away from the banquets which he thus learned i was to grace at last i gave up hope and one day at the end of three years i received another visit from his aunt she was drearier and dingier almost squalid and she was in great tribulation and want her sister mrs brooksmith had been dead a year and three months later her nephew had disappeared he had always looked after her a bit since her troubles i never knew what her troubles had beenand now she hadnt so much as a petticoat to pawn she had also a niece to whom she had been everything before her troubles but the niece had treated her most shameful these were details the great and romantic fact was brooksmiths final evasion of his fate he had gone out to wait one evening as usual in a white waistcoat she had done up for him with her own handsbeing due at a large party up kensington way but he had never come home again and had never arrived at the large party nor at any party that any one could make out no trace of him had come to lightno gleam of the white waistcoat had pierced the obscurity of his doom this news was a sharp shock to me for i had my ideas about his real destination his aged relative had promptly as she said guessed the worst somehow and somewhere he had got out of the way altogether and now i trust that with characteristic deliberation he is changing the plates of the immortal gods as my depressing visitant also said he never had got his spirits up i was fortunately able to dismiss her with her own somewhat improved but the dim ghost of poor brooksmith is one of those that i see he had indeed been spoiled     the real thing     chapter i   when the porters wife who used to answer the housebell announced a gentleman and a lady sir i had as i often had in those daysthe wish being father to the thoughtan immediate vision of sitters sitters my visitors in this case proved to be but not in the sense i should have preferred there was nothing at first however to indicate that they mightnt have come for a portrait the gentleman a man of fifty very high and very straight with a moustache slightly grizzled and a dark grey walkingcoat admirably fitted both of which i noted professionallyi dont mean as a barber or yet as a tailorwould have struck me as a celebrity if celebrities often were striking it was a truth of which i had for some time been conscious that a figure with a good deal of frontage was as one might say almost never a public institution a glance at the lady helped to remind me of this paradoxical law she also looked too distinguished to be a personality moreover one would scarcely come across two variations together  neither of the pair immediately spokethey only prolonged the preliminary gaze suggesting that each wished to give the other a chance they were visibly shy they stood there letting me take them inwhich as i afterwards perceived was the most practical thing they could have done in this way their embarrassment served their cause i had seen people painfully reluctant to mention that they desired anything so gross as to be represented on canvas but the scruples of my new friends appeared almost insurmountable yet the gentleman might have said i should like a portrait of my wife and the lady might have said i should like a portrait of my husband perhaps they werent husband and wifethis naturally would make the matter more delicate perhaps they wished to be done togetherin which case they ought to have brought a third person to break the news  we come from mr rivet the lady finally said with a dim smile that had the effect of a moist sponge passed over a sunk piece of painting as well as of a vague allusion to vanished beauty she was as tall and straight in her degree as her companion and with ten years less to carry she looked as sad as a woman could look whose face was not charged with expression that is her tinted oval mask showed waste as an exposed surface shows friction the hand of time had played over her freely but to an effect of elimination she was slim and stiff and so welldressed in dark blue cloth with lappets and pockets and buttons that it was clear she employed the same tailor as her husband the couple had an indefinable air of prosperous thriftthey evidently got a good deal of luxury for their money if i was to be one of their luxuries it would behove me to consider my terms  ah claude rivet recommended me i echoed and i added that it was very kind of him though i could reflect that as he only painted landscape this wasnt a sacrifice  the lady looked very hard at the gentleman and the gentleman looked round the room then staring at the floor a moment and stroking his moustache he rested his pleasant eyes on me with the remark he said you were the right one  i try to be when people want to sit  yes we should like to said the lady anxiously  do you mean together  my visitors exchanged a glance if you could do anything with me i suppose it would be double the gentleman stammered  oh yes theres naturally a higher charge for two figures than for one  we should like to make it pay the husband confessed  thats very good of you i returned appreciating so unwonted a sympathyfor i supposed he meant pay the artist  a sense of strangeness seemed to dawn on the lady we mean for the illustrationsmr rivet said you might put one in  put inan illustration i was equally confused  sketch her off you know said the gentleman colouring  it was only then that i understood the service claude rivet had rendered me he had told them how i worked in blackandwhite for magazines for storybooks for sketches of contemporary life and consequently had copious employment for models these things were true but it was not less truei may confess it now whether because the aspiration was to lead to everything or to nothing i leave the reader to guessthat i couldnt get the honours to say nothing of the emoluments of a great painter of portraits out of my head my illustrations were my potboilers i looked to a different branch of artfar and away the most interesting it had always seemed to meto perpetuate my fame there was no shame in looking to it also to make my fortune but that fortune was by so much further from being made from the moment my visitors wished to be done for nothing i was disappointed for in the pictorial sense i had immediately seen them i had seized their typei had already settled what i would do with it something that wouldnt absolutely have pleased them i afterwards reflected  ah youreyourea i began as soon as i had mastered my surprise i couldnt bring out the dingy word models it seemed so little to fit the case  we havent had much practice said the lady  weve got to do something and weve thought that an artist in your line might perhaps make something of us her husband threw off he further mentioned that they didnt know many artists and that they had gone first on the offchancehe painted views of course but sometimes put in figures perhaps i rememberedto mr rivet whom they had met a few years before at a place in norfolk where he was sketching  we used to sketch a little ourselves the lady hinted  its very awkward but we absolutely must do something her husband went on  of course were not so very young she admitted with a wan smile  with the remark that i might as well know something more about them the husband had handed me a card extracted from a neat new pocketbooktheir appurtenances were all of the freshestand inscribed with the words major monarch impressive as these words were they didnt carry my knowledge much further but my visitor presently added ive left the army and weve had the misfortune to lose our money in fact our means are dreadfully small  its awfully tryinga regular strain said mrs monarch  they evidently wished to be discreetto take care not to swagger because they were gentlefolk i felt them willing to recognise this as something of a drawback at the same time that i guessed at an underlying sensetheir consolation in adversitythat they had their points they certainly had but these advantages struck me as preponderantly social such for instance as would help to make a drawingroom look well however a drawingroom was always or ought to be a picture  in consequence of his wifes allusion to their age major monarch observed naturally its more for the figure that we thought of going in we can still hold ourselves up on the instant i saw that the figure was indeed their strong point his naturally didnt sound vain but it lighted up the question she has the best one he continued nodding at his wife with a pleasant afterdinner absence of circumlocution i could only reply as if we were in fact sitting over our wine that this didnt prevent his own from being very good which led him in turn to make answer we thought that if you ever have to do people like us we might be something like it she particularlyfor a lady in a book you know  i was so amused by them that to get more of it i did my best to take their point of view and though it was an embarrassment to find myself appraising physically as if they were animals on hire or useful blacks a pair whom i should have expected to meet only in one of the relations in which criticism is tacit i looked at mrs monarch judicially enough to be able to exclaim after a moment with conviction oh yes a lady in a book she was singularly like a bad illustration  well stand up if you like said the major and he raised himself before me with a really grand air  i could take his measure at a glancehe was six feet two and a perfect gentleman it would have paid any club in process of formation and in want of a stamp to engage him at a salary to stand in the principal window what struck me at once was that in coming to me they had rather missed their vocation they could surely have been turned to better account for advertising purposes i couldnt of course see the thing in detail but i could see them make somebodys fortunei dont mean their own there was something in them for a waistcoatmaker an hotelkeeper or a soapvendor i could imagine we always use it pinned on their bosoms with the greatest effect i had a vision of the brilliancy with which they would launch a table dhôte  mrs monarch sat still not from pride but from shyness and presently her husband said to her get up my dear and show how smart you are she obeyed but she had no need to get up to show it she walked to the end of the studio and then came back blushing her fluttered eyes on the partner of her appeal i was reminded of an incident i had accidentally had a glimpse of in parisbeing with a friend there a dramatist about to produce a play when an actress came to him to ask to be entrusted with a part she went through her paces before him walked up and down as mrs monarch was doing mrs monarch did it quite as well but i abstained from applauding it was very odd to see such people apply for such poor pay she looked as if she had ten thousand a year her husband had used the word that described her she was in the london current jargon essentially and typically smart her figure was in the same order of ideas conspicuously and irreproachably good for a woman of her age her waist was surprisingly small her elbow moreover had the orthodox crook she held her head at the conventional angle but why did she come to me she ought to have tried on jackets at a big shop i feared my visitors were not only destitute but artisticwhich would be a great complication when she sat down again i thanked her observing that what a draughtsman most valued in his model was the faculty of keeping quiet  oh she can keep quiet said major monarch then he added jocosely ive always kept her quiet  im not a nasty fidget am i it was going to wring tears from me i felt the way she hid her head ostrichlike in the other broad bosom  the owner of this expanse addressed his answer to me perhaps it isnt out of place to mentionbecause we ought to be quite businesslike oughtnt wethat when i married her she was known as the beautiful statue  oh dear said mrs monarch ruefully  of course i should want a certain amount of expression i rejoined  of courseand i had never heard such unanimity  and then i suppose you know that youll get awfully tired  oh we never get tired they eagerly cried  have you had any kind of practice  they hesitatedthey looked at each other weve been photographedimmensely said mrs monarch  she means the fellows have asked us themselves added the major  i seebecause youre so goodlooking  i dont know what they thought but they were always after us  we always got our photographs for nothing smiled mrs monarch  we might have brought some my dear her husband remarked  im not sure we have any left weve given quantities away she explained to me  with our autographs and that sort of thing said the major  are they to be got in the shops i inquired as a harmless pleasantry  oh yes hersthey used to be  not now said mrs monarch with her eyes on the floor     chapter ii   i could fancy the sort of thing they put on the presentation copies of their photographs and i was sure they wrote a beautiful hand it was odd how quickly i was sure of everything that concerned them if they were now so poor as to have to cam shillings and pence they could never have had much of a margin their good looks had been their capital and they had goodhumouredly made the most of the career that this resource marked out for them it was in their faces the blankness the deep intellectual repose of the twenty years of countryhouse visiting that had given them pleasant intonations i could see the sunny drawingrooms sprinkled with periodicals she didnt read in which mrs monarch had continuously sat i could see the wet shrubberies in which she had walked equipped to admiration for either exercise i could see the rich covers the major had helped to shoot and the wonderful garments in which late at night he repaired to the smokingroom to talk about them i could imagine their leggings and waterproofs their knowing tweeds and rugs their rolls of sticks and cases of tackle and neat umbrellas and i could evoke the exact appearance of their servants and the compact variety of their luggage on the platforms of country stations  they gave small tips but they were liked they didnt do anything themselves but they were welcome they looked so well everywhere they gratified the general relish for stature complexion and form they knew it without fatuity or vulgarity and they respected themselves in consequence they werent superficial they were thorough and kept themselves upit had been their line people with such a taste for activity had to have some line i could feel how even in a dull house they could have been counted on for the joy of life at present something had happenedit didnt matter what their little income had grown less it had grown leastand they had to do something for pocketmoney their friends could like them i made out without liking to support them there was something about them that represented credittheir clothes their manners their type but if credit is a large empty pocket in which an occasional chink reverberates the chink at least must be audible what they wanted of me was help to make it so fortunately they had no childreni soon divined that they would also perhaps wish our relations to be kept secret this was why it was for the figurethe reproduction of the face would betray them  i liked themi felt quite as their friends must have donethey were so simple and i had no objection to them if they would suit but somehow with all their perfections i didnt easily believe in them after all they were amateurs and the ruling passion of my life wasthe detestation of the amateur combined with this was another perversityan innate preference for the represented subject over the real one the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of representation i liked things that appeared then one was sure whether they were or not was a subordinate and almost always a profitless question there were other considerations the first of which was that i already had two or three recruits in use notably a young person with big feet in alpaca from kilburn who for a couple of years had come to me regularly for my illustrations and with whom i was stillperhaps ignoblysatisfied i frankly explained to my visitors how the case stood but they had taken more precautions than i supposed they had reasoned out their opportunity for claude rivet had told them of the projected Édition de luxe of one of the writers of our daythe rarest of the novelistswho long neglected by the multitudinous vulgar and dearly prized by the attentive need i mention philip vincent had had the happy fortune of seeing late in life the dawn and then the full light of a higher criticism an estimate in which on the part of the public there was something really of expiation the edition preparing planned by a publisher of taste was practically an act of high reparation the woodcuts with which it was to be enriched were the homage of english art to one of the most independent representatives of english letters major and mrs monarch confessed to me they had hoped i might be able to work them into my branch of the enterprise they knew i was to do the first of the books rutland ramsay but i had to make clear to them that my participation in the rest of the affairthis first book was to be a testmust depend on the satisfaction i should give if this should be limited my employers would drop me with scarce common forms it was therefore a crisis for me and naturally i was making special preparations looking about for new people should they be necessary and securing the best types i admitted however that i should like to settle down to two or three good models who would do for everything  should we have often toaput on special clothes mrs monarch timidly demanded  dear yesthats half the business  and should we be expected to supply our own costumes  oh no ive got a lot of things a painters models put onor put offanything he likes  and you meanathe same  the same  mrs monarch looked at her husband again  oh she was just wondering he explained if the costumes are in general use i had to confess that they were and i mentioned further that some of themi had a lot of genuine greasy lastcentury thingshad served their time a hundred years ago on living worldstained men and women on figures not perhaps so far removed in that vanished world from their type the monarchs quoi of a breeched and bewigged age well put on anything that fits said the major  oh i arrange thatthey fit in the pictures  im afraid i should do better for the modern books id come as you like said mrs monarch  she has got a lot of clothes at home they might do for contemporary life her husband continued  oh i can fancy scenes in which youd be quite natural and indeed i could see the slipshod rearrangements of stale propertiesthe stories i tried to produce pictures for without the exasperation of reading themwhose sandy tracts the good lady might help to people but i had to return to the fact thatfor this sort of workthe daily mechanical grindi was already equipped the people i was working with were fully adequate  we only thought we might be more like some characters said mrs monarch mildly getting up  her husband also rose he stood looking at me with a dim wistfulness that was touching in so fine a man wouldnt it be rather a pull sometimes to haveato have he hung fire he wanted me to help him by phrasing what he meant but i couldnti didnt know so he brought it out awkwardly the real thing a gentleman you know or a lady i was quite ready to give a general assenti admitted that there was a great deal in that this encouraged major monarch to say following up his appeal with an unacted gulp its awfully hardweve tried everything the gulp was communicative it proved too much for his wife before i knew it mrs monarch had dropped again upon a divan and burst into tears her husband sat down beside her holding one of her hands whereupon she quickly dried her eyes with the other while i felt embarrassed as she looked up at me there isnt a confounded job i havent applied forwaited forprayed for you can fancy wed be pretty bad first secretaryships and that sort of thing you might as well ask for a peerage id be anythingim strong a messenger or a coalheaver id put on a goldlaced cap and open carriagedoors in front of the haberdashers id hang about a station to carry portmanteaux id be a postman but they wont look at you there are thousands as good as yourself already on the ground gentlemen poor beggars whove drunk their wine whove kept their hunters  i was as reassuring as i knew how to be and my visitors were presently on their feet again while for the experiment we agreed on an hour we were discussing it when the door opened and miss churm came in with a wet umbrella miss churm had to take the omnibus to maida vale and then walk half a mile she looked a trifle blowsy and slightly splashed i scarcely ever saw her come in without thinking afresh how odd it was that being so little in herself she should yet be so much in others she was a meagre little miss churm but was such an ample heroine of romance she was only a freckled cockney but she could represent everything from a fine lady to a shepherdess she had the faculty as she might have had a fine voice or long hair she couldnt spell and she loved beer but she had two or three points and practice and a knack and motherwit and a whimsical sensibility and a love of the theatre and seven sistersand not an ounce of respect especially for the h the first thing my visitors saw was that her umbrella was wet and in their spotless perfection they visibly winced at it the rain had come on since their arrival  im all in a soak there was a mess of people in the bus i wish you lived near a stytion said miss churm i requested her to get ready as quickly as possible and she passed into the room in which she always changed her dress but before going out she asked me what she was to get into this time  its the russian princess dont you know i answered the one with the golden eyes in black velvet for the long thing in the cheapside  golden eyes i say cried miss churm while my companions watched her with intensity as she withdrew she always arranged herself when she was late before i could turn round and i kept my visitors a little on purpose so that they might get an idea from seeing her what would be expected of themselves i mentioned that she was quite my notion of an excellent modelshe was really very clever  do you think she looks like a russian princess major monarch asked with lurking alarm  when i make her yes  oh if you have to make her he reasoned not without point  thats the most you can ask there are so many who are not makeable  well now heres a ladyand with a persuasive smile he passed his arm into his wifeswhos already made  oh im not a russian princess mrs monarch protested a little coldly i could see she had known some and didnt like them there at once was a complication of a kind i never had to fear with miss churm  this young lady came back in black velvetthe gown was rather rusty and very low on her lean shouldersand with a japanese fan in her red hands i reminded her that in the scene i was doing she had to look over some ones head i forget whose it is but it doesnt matter just look over a head  id rather look over a stove said miss churm and she took her station near the fire she fell into position settled herself into a tall attitude gave a certain backward inclination to her head and a certain forward droop to her fan and looked at least to my prejudiced sense distinguished and charming foreign and dangerous we left her looking so while i went downstairs with major and mrs monarch  i believe i could come about as near it as that said mrs monarch  oh you think shes shabby but you must allow for the alchemy of art  however they went off with an evident increase of comfort founded on their demonstrable advantage in being the real thing i could fancy them shuddering over miss churm she was very droll about them when i went back for i told her what they wanted  well if she can sit ill tyke to bookkeeping said my model  shes very ladylike i replied as an innocent form of aggravation  so much the worse for you that means she cant turn round  shell do for the fashionable novels  oh yes shell do for them my model humorously declared aint they bad enough without her i had often sociably denounced them to miss churm     chapter iii   it was for the elucidation of a mystery in one of these works that i first tried mrs monarch her husband came with her to be useful if necessaryit was sufficiently clear that as a general thing he would prefer to come with her at first i wondered if this were for proprietys sakeif he were going to be jealous and meddling the idea was too tiresome and if it had been confirmed it would speedily have brought our acquaintance to a close but i soon saw there was nothing in it and that if he accompanied mrs monarch it wasin addition to the chance of being wantedsimply because he had nothing else to do when they were separate his occupation was gone and they never had been separate i judged rightly that in their awkward situation their close union was their main comfort and that this union had no weak spot it was a real marriage an encouragement to the hesitating a nut for pessimists to crack their address was humblei remember afterwards thinking it had been the only thing about them that was really professionaland i could fancy the lamentable lodgings in which the major would have been left alone he could sit there more or less grimly with his wifehe couldnt sit there anyhow without her  he had too much tact to try and make himself agreeable when he couldnt be useful so when i was too absorbed in my work to talk he simply sat and waited but i liked to hear him talkit made my work when not interrupting it less mechanical less special to listen to him was to combine the excitement of going out with the economy of staying at home there was only one hindrancethat i seemed not to know any of the people this brilliant couple had known i think he wondered extremely during the term of our intercourse whom the deuce i did know he hadnt a stray sixpence of an idea to fumble for so we didnt spin it very fine we confined ourselves to questions of leather and even of liquorsaddlers and breechesmakers and how to get excellent claret cheapand matters like good trains and the habits of small game his lore on these last subjects was astonishinghe managed to interweave the stationmaster with the ornithologist when he couldnt talk about greater things he could talk cheerfully about smaller and since i couldnt accompany him into reminiscences of the fashionable world he could lower the conversation without a visible effort to my level  so earnest a desire to please was touching in a man who could so easily have knocked one down he looked after the fire and had an opinion on the draught of the stove without my asking him and i could see that he thought many of my arrangements not half knowing i remember telling him that if i were only rich id offer him a salary to come and teach me how to live sometimes he gave a random sigh of which the essence might have been give me even such a bare oldbarrack as this and id do something with it when i wanted to use him he came alone which was an illustration of the superior courage of women his wife could bear her solitary second floor and she was in general more discreet showing by various small reserves that she was alive to the propriety of keeping our relations markedly professionalnot letting them slide into sociability she wished it to remain clear that she and the major were employed not cultivated and if she approved of me as a superior who could be kept in his place she never thought me quite good enough for an equal  she sat with great intensity giving the whole of her mind to it and was capable of remaining for an hour almost as motionless as before a photographers lens i could see she had been photographed often but somehow the very habit that made her good for that purpose unfitted her for mine at first i was extremely pleased with her ladylike air and it was a satisfaction on coming to follow her lines to see how good they were and how far they could lead the pencil but after a little skirmishing i began to find her too insurmountably stiff do what i would with it my drawing looked like a photograph or a copy of a photograph her figure had no variety of expressionshe herself had no sense of variety you may say that this was my business and was only a question of placing her yet i placed her in every conceivable position and she managed to obliterate their differences she was always a lady certainly and into the bargain was always the same lady she was the real thing but always the same thing there were moments when i rather writhed under the serenity of her confidence that she was the real thing all her dealings with me and all her husbands were an implication that this was lucky for me meanwhile i found myself trying to invent types that approached her own instead of making her own transform itselfin the clever way that was not impossible for instance to poor miss churm arrange as i would and take the precautions i would she always came out in my pictures too talllanding me in the dilemma of having represented a fascinating woman as seven feet high which out of respect perhaps to my own very much scantier inches was far from my idea of such a personage  the case was worse with the majornothing i could do would keep him down so that he became useful only for the representation of brawny giants i adored variety and range i cherished human accidents the illustrative note i wanted to characterise closely and the thing in the world i most hated was the danger of being ridden by a type i had quarrelled with some of my friends about it i had parted company with them for maintaining that one had to be and that if the type was beautifulwitness raphael and leonardothe servitude was only a gain i was neither leonardo nor raphaeli might only be a presumptuous young modern searcher but i held that everything was to be sacrificed sooner than character when they claimed that the obsessional form could easily be character i retorted perhaps superficially whose it couldnt be everybodysit might end in being nobodys  after i had drawn mrs monarch a dozen times i felt surer even than before that the value of such a model as miss churm resided precisely in the fact that she had no positive stamp combined of course with the other fact that what she did have was a curious and inexplicable talent for imitation her usual appearance was like a curtain whichshe could draw up at request for a capital performance this performance was simply suggestive but it was a word to the wiseit was vivid and pretty sometimes even i thought it though she was plain herself too insipidly pretty i made it a reproach to her that the figures drawn from her were monotonously bÊtement as we used to say graceful nothing made her more angry it was so much her pride to feel she could sit for characters that had nothing in common with each other she would accuse me at such moments of taking away her reputytion  it suffered a certain shrinkage this queer quantity from the repeated visits of my new friends miss churm was greatly in demand never in want of employment so i had no scruple in putting her off occasionally to try them more at my ease it was certainly amusing at first to do the real thingit was amusing to do major monarchs trousers they were the real thing even if he did come out colossal it was amusing to do his wifes back hairit was so mathematically neatand the particular smart tension of her tight stays she lent herself especially to positions in which the face was somewhat averted or blurred she abounded in ladylike back views and profils perdus when she stood erect she took naturally one of the attitudes in which courtpainters represent queens and princesses so that i found myself wondering whether to draw out this accomplishment i couldnt get the editor of the cheapside to publish a really royal romance a tale of buckingham palace sometimes however the real thing and the makebelieve came into contact by which i mean that miss churm keeping an appointment or coming to make one on days when i had much work in hand encountered her invidious rivals the encounter was not on their part for they noticed her no more than if she had been the housemaid not from intentional loftiness but simply because as yet professionally they didnt know how to fraternise as i could imagine they would have likedor at least that the major would they couldnt talk about the omnibusthey always walked and they didnt know what else to tryshe wasnt interested in good trains or cheap claret besides they must have feltin the airthat she was amused at them secretly derisive of their ever knowing how she wasnt a person to conceal the limits of her faith if she had had a chance to show them on the other hand mrs monarch didnt think her tidy for why else did she take pains to say to meit was going out of the way for mrs monarchthat she didnt like dirty women  one day when my young lady happened to be present with my other sittersshe even dropped in when it was convenient for a chati asked her to be so good as to lend a hand in getting tea a service with which she was familiar and which was one of a class that living as i did in a small way with slender domestic resources i often appealed to my models to render they liked to lay hands on my property to break the sitting and sometimes the chinait made them feel bohemian the next time i saw miss churm after this incident she surprised me greatly by making a scene about itshe accused me of having wished to humiliate her she hadnt resented the outrage at the time but had seemed obliging and amused enjoying the comedy of asking mrs monarch who sat vague and silent whether she would have cream and sugar and putting an exaggerated simper into the question she had tried intonationsas if she too wished to pass for the real thingtill i was afraid my other visitors would take offence  oh they were determined not to do this and their touching patience was the measure of their great need they would sit by the hour uncomplaining till i was ready to use them they would come back on the chance of being wanted and would walk away cheerfully if it failed i used to go to the door with them to see in what magnificent order they retreated i tried to find other employment for themi introduced them to several artists but they didnt take for reasons i could appreciate and i became rather anxiously aware that after such disappointments they fell back upon me with a heavier weight they did me the honour to think me most their form they werent romantic enough for the painters and in those days there were few serious workers in blackandwhite  besides they had an eye to the great job i had mentioned to themthey had secretly set their hearts on supplying the right essence for my pictorial vindication of our fine novelist they knew that for this undertaking i should want no costumeeffects none of the frippery of past agesthat it was a case in which everything would be contemporary and satirical and presumably genteel if i could work them into it their future would be assured for the labour would of course be long and the occupation steady  one day mrs monarch came without her husbandshe explained his absence by his having had to go to the city while she sat there in her usual relaxed majesty there came at the door a knock which i immediately recognised as the subdued appeal of a model out of work it was followed by the entrance of a young man whom i at once saw to be a foreigner and who proved in fact an italian acquainted with no english word but my name which he uttered in a way that made it seem to include all others i hadnt then visited his country nor was i proficient in his tongue but as he was not so meanly constitutedwhat italian isas to depend only on that member for expression he conveyed to me in familiar but graceful mimicry that he was in search of exactly the employment in which the lady before me was engaged i was not struck with him at first and while i continued to draw i dropped few signs of interest or encouragement he stood his ground howevernot importunately but with a dumb doglike fidelity in his eyes that amounted to innocent impudence the manner of a devoted servanthe might have been in the house for yearsunjustly suspected suddenly it struck me that this very attitude and expression made a picture whereupon i told him to sit down and wait till i should be free there was another picture in the way he obeyed me and i observed as i worked that there were others still in the way he looked wonderingly with his head thrown back about the high studio he might have been crossing himself in saint peters before i finished i said to myself the fellows a bankrupt orangemonger but a treasure  when mrs monarch withdrew he passed across the room like a flash to open the door for her standing there with the rapt pure gaze of the young dante spellbound by the young beatrice as i never insisted in such situations on the blankness of the british domestic i reflected that he had the making of a servantand i needed one but couldnt pay him to be only thatas well as of a model in short i resolved to adopt my bright adventurer if he would agree to officiate in the double capacity he jumped at my offer and in the event my rashnessfor i had really known nothing about himwasnt brought home to me he proved a sympathetic though a desultory ministrant and had in a wonderful degree the sentiment de la pose it was uncultivated instinctive a part of the happy instinct that had guided him to my door and helped him to spell out my name on the card nailed to it he had had no other introduction to me than a guess from the shape of my high north window seen outside that my place was a studio and that as a studio it would contain an artist he had wandered to england in search of fortune like other itinerants and had embarked with a partner and a small green handcart on the sale of penny ices the ices had melted away and the partner had dissolved in their train my young man wore tight yellow trousers with reddish stripes and his name was oronte he was sallow but fair and when i put him into some old clothes of my own he looked like an englishman he was as good as miss churm who could look when requested like an italian     chapter iv   i thought mrs monarchs face slightly convulsed when on her coming back with her husband she found oronte installed it was strange to have to recognise in a scrap of a lazzarone a competitor to her magnificent major it was she who scented danger first for the major was anecdotically unconscious but oronte gave us tea with a hundred eager confusionshe had never been concerned in so queer a processand i think she thought better of me for having at last an establishment they saw a couple of drawings that i had made of the establishment and mrs monarch hinted that it never would have struck her he had sat for them now the drawings you make from us they look exactly like us she reminded me smiling in triumph and i recognised that this was indeed just their defect when i drew the monarchs i couldnt anyhow get away from themget into the character i wanted to represent and i hadnt the least desire my model should be discoverable in my picture miss churm never was and mrs monarch thought i hid her very properly because she was vulgar whereas if she was lost it was only as the dead who go to heaven are lostin the gain of an angel the more  by this time i had got a certain start with rutland ramsay the first novel in the great projected series that is i had produced a dozen drawings several with the help of the major and his wife and i had sent them in for approval my understanding with the publishers as i have already hinted had been that i was to be left to do my work in this particular case as i liked with the whole book committed to me but my connexion with the rest of the series was only contingent there were moments when frankly it was a comfort to have the real thing under ones hand for there were characters in rutland ramsay that were very much like it there were people presumably as erect as the major and women of as good a fashion as mrs monarch there was a great deal of countryhouse lifetreated it is true in a fine fanciful ironical generalised wayand there was a considerable implication of knickerbockers and kilts there were certain things i had to settle at the outset such things for instance as the exact appearance of the hero and the particular bloom and figure of the heroine the author of course gave me a lead but there was a margin for interpretation i took the monarchs into my confidence i told them frankly what i was about i mentioned my embarrassments and alternatives oh take him mrs monarch murmured sweetly looking at her husband and what could you want better than my wife the major inquired with the comfortable candour that now prevailed between us  i wasnt obliged to answer these remarksi was only obliged to place my sitters i wasnt easy in mind and i postponed a little timidly perhaps the solving of my question the book was a large canvas the other figures were numerous and i worked off at first some of the episodes in which the hero and the heroine were not concerned when once i had set them up i should have to stick to themi couldnt make my young man seven feet high in one place and five feet nine in another i inclined on the whole to the latter measurement though the major more than once reminded me that he looked about as young as any one it was indeed quite possible to arrange him for the figure so that it would have been difficult to detect his age after the spontaneous oronte had been with me a month and after i had given him to understand several times over that his native exuberance would presently constitute an insurmountable barrier to our further intercourse i waked to a sense of his heroic capacity he was only five feet seven but the remaining inches were latent i tried him almost secretly at first for i was really rather afraid of the judgement my other models would pass on such a choice if they regarded miss churm as little better than a snare what would they think of the representation by a person so little the real thing as an italian streetvendor of a protagonist formed by a public school  if i went a little in fear of them it wasnt because they bullied me because they had got an oppressive foothold but because in their really pathetic decorum and mysteriously permanent newness they counted on me so intensely i was therefore very glad when jack hawley came home he was always of such good counsel he painted badly himself but there was no one like him for putting his finger on the place he had been absent from england for a year he had been somewherei dont remember whereto get a fresh eye i was in a good deal of dread of any such organ but we were old friends he had been away for months and a sense of emptiness was creeping into my life i hadnt dodged a missile for a year  he came back with a fresh eye but with the same old black velvet blouse and the first evening he spent in my studio we smoked cigarettes till the small hours he had done no work himself he had only got the eye so the field was clear for the production of my little things he wanted to see what i had produced for the cheapside but he was disappointed in the exhibition that at least seemed the meaning of two or three comprehensive groans which as he lounged on my big divan his leg folded under him looking at my latest drawings issued from his lips with the smoke of the cigarette  whats the matter with you i asked  whats the matter with you  nothing save that im mystified  you are indeed youre quite off the hinge whats the meaning of this new fad and he tossed me with visible irreverence a drawing in which i happened to have depicted both my elegant models i asked if he didnt think it good and he replied that it struck him as execrable given the sort of thing i had always represented myself to him as wishing to arrive at but i let that passi was so anxious to see exactly what he meant the two figures in the picture looked colossal but i supposed this was not what he meant inasmuch as for aught he knew to the contrary i might have been trying for some such effect i maintained that i was working exactly in the same way as when he last had done me the honour to tell me i might do something some day well theres a screw loose somewhere he answered wait a bit and ill discover it i depended upon him to do so where else was the fresh eye but he produced at last nothing more luminous than i dont knowi dont like your types this was lame for a critic who had never consented to discuss with me anything but the question of execution the direction of strokes and the mystery of values  in the drawings youve been looking at i think my types are very handsome  oh they wont do  ive been working with new models  i see you have they wont do  are you very sure of that  absolutelytheyre stupid  you mean i amfor i ought to get round that  you cantwith such people who are they  i told him so far as was necessary and he concluded heartlessly ce sont des gens quil faut mettre a la porte  youve never seen them theyre awfully goodi flew to their defence  not seen them why all this recent work of yours drops to pieces with them its all i want to see of them  no one else has said anything against itthe cheapside people are pleased  every one else is an ass and the cheapside people the biggest asses of all come dont pretend at this time of day to have pretty illusions about the public especially about publishers and editors its not for such animals you workits for those who know coloro che sanno so keep straight for me if you cant keep straight for yourself there was a certain sort of thing you used to try forand a very good thing it was but this twaddle isnt in it when i talked with hawley later about rutland ramsay and its possible successors he declared that i must get back into my boat again or i should go to the bottom his voice in short was the voice of warning  i noted the warning but i didnt turn my friends out of doors they bored me a good deal but the very fact that they bored me admonished me not to sacrifice themif there was anything to be done with themsimply to irritation as i look back at this phase they seem to me to have pervaded my life not a little i have a vision of them as most of the time in my studio seated against the wall on an old velvet bench to be out of the way and resembling the while a pair of patient courtiers in a royal antechamber im convinced that during the coldest weeks of the winter they held their ground because it saved them fire their newness was losing its gloss and it was impossible not to feel them objects of charity whenever miss churm arrived they went away and after i was fairly launched in rutland ramsay miss churm arrived pretty often they managed to express to me tacitly that they supposed i wanted her for the low life of the book and i let them suppose it since they had attempted to study the workit was lying about the studiowithout discovering that it dealt only with the highest circles they had dipped into the most brilliant of our novelists without deciphering many passages i still took an hour from them now and again in spite of jack hawleys warning it would be time enough to dismiss them if dismissal should be necessary when the rigour of the season was over hawley had made their acquaintancehe had met them at my firesideand thought them a ridiculous pair learning that he was a painter they tried to approach him to show him too that they were the real thing but he looked at them across the big room as if they were miles away they were a compendium of everything he most objected to in the social system of his country such people as that all convention and patentleather with ejaculations that stopped conversation had no business in a studio a studio was a place to learn to see and how could you see through a pair of featherbeds  the main inconvenience i suffered at their hands was that at first i was shy of letting it break upon them that my artful little servant had begun to sit to me for rutland ramsay they knew i had been odd enoughthey were prepared by this time to allow oddity to artiststo pick a foreign vagabond out of the streets when i might have had a person with whiskers and credentials but it was some time before they learned how high i rated his accomplishments they found him in an attitude more than once but they never doubted i was doing him as an organgrinder there were several things they never guessed and one of them was that for a striking scene in the novel in which a footman briefly figured it occurred to me to make use of major monarch as the menial i kept putting this off i didnt like to ask him to don the liverybesides the difficulty of finding a livery to fit him at last one day late in the winter when i was at work on the despised oronte who caught ones idea on the wing and was in the glow of feeling myself go very straight they came in the major and his wife with their society laugh about nothing there was less and less to laugh at came in like countrycallersthey always reminded me of thatwho have walked across the park after church and are presently persuaded to stay to luncheon luncheon was over but they could stay to teai knew they wanted it the fit was on me however and i couldnt let my ardour cool and my work wait with the fading daylight while my model prepared it so i asked mrs monarch if she would mind laying it outa request which for an instant brought all the blood to her face her eyes were on her husbands for a second and some mute telegraphy passed between them their folly was over the next instant his cheerful shrewdness put an end to it so far from pitying their wounded pride i must add i was moved to give it as complete a lesson as i could they bustled about together and got out the cups and saucers and made the kettle boil i know they felt as if they were waiting on my servant and when the tea was prepared i said hell have a cup pleasehes tired mrs monarch brought him one where he stood and he took it from her as if he had been a gentleman at a party squeezing a crushhat with an elbow  then it came over me that she had made a great effort for memade it with a kind of noblenessand that i owed her a compensation each time i saw her after this i wondered what the compensation could be i couldnt go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them oh it was the wrong thing the stamp of the work for which they sathawley was not the only person to say it now i sent in a large number of the drawings i had made for rutland ramsay and i received a warning that was more to the point than hawleys the artistic adviser of the house for which i was working was of opinion that many of my illustrations were not what had been looked for most of these illustrations were the subjects in which the monarchs had figured without going into the question of what had been looked for i had to face the fact that at this rate i shouldnt get the other books to do i hurled myself in despair on miss churmi put her through all her paces i not only adopted oronte publicly as my hero but one morning when the major looked in to see if i didnt require him to finish a cheapside figure for which he had begun to sit the week before i told him i had changed my mindid do the drawing from my man at this my visitor turned pale and stood looking at me is he your idea of an english gentleman he asked  i was disappointed i was nervous i wanted to get on with my work so i replied with irritation oh my dear majori cant be ruined for you  it was a horrid speech but he stood another momentafter which without a word he quitted the studio i drew a long breath for i said to myself that i shouldnt see him again i hadnt told him definitely that i was in danger of having my work rejected but i was vexed at his not having felt the catastrophe in the air read with me the moral of our fruitless collaboration the lesson that in the deceptive atmosphere of art even the highest respectability may fail of being plastic  i didnt owe my friends money but i did see them again they reappeared together three days later and given all the other facts there was something tragic in that one it was a clear proof they could find nothing else in life to do they had threshed the matter out in a dismal conferencethey had digested the bad news that they were not in for the series if they werent useful to me even for the cheapside their function seemed difficult to determine and i could only judge at first that they had come forgivingly decorously to take a last leave this made me rejoice in secret that i had little leisure for a scene for i had placed both my other models in position together and i was pegging away at a drawing from which i hoped to derive glory it had been suggested by the passage in which rutland ramsay drawing up a chair to artemisias pianostool says extraordinary things to her while she ostensibly fingers out a difficult piece of music i had done miss churm at the piano beforeit was an attitude in which she knew how to take on an absolutely poetic grace i wished the two figures to compose together with intensity and my little italian had entered perfectly into my conception the pair were vividly before me the piano had been pulled out it was a charming show of blended youth and murmured love which i had only to catch and keep my visitors stood and looked at it and i was friendly to them over my shoulder  they made no response but i was used to silent company and went on with my work only a little disconcertedeven though exhilarated by the sense that this was at least the ideal thingat not having got rid of them after all presently i heard mrs monarchs sweet voice beside or rather above me i wish her hair were a little better done i looked up and she was staring with a strange fixedness at miss churm whose back was turned to her do you mind my just touching it she went ona question which made me spring up for an instant as with the instinctive fear that she might do the young lady a harm but she quieted me with a glance i shall never forgeti confess i should like to have been able to paint thatand went for a moment to my model she spoke to her softly laying a hand on her shoulder and bending over her and as the girl understanding gratefully assented she disposed her rough curls with a few quick passes in such a way as to make miss churms head twice as charming it was one of the most heroic personal services ive ever seen rendered then mrs monarch turned away with a low sigh and looking about her as if for something to do stooped to the floor with a noble humility and picked up a dirty rag that had dropped out of my paintbox  the major meanwhile had also been looking for something to do and wandering to the other end of the studio saw before him my breakfastthings neglected unremoved i say cant i be useful here he called out to me with an irrepressible quaver i assented with a laugh that i fear was awkward and for the next ten minutes while i worked i heard the light clatter of china and the tinkle of spoons and glass mrs monarch assisted her husbandthey washed up my crockery they put it away they wandered off into my little scullery and i afterwards found that they had cleaned my knives and that my slender stock of plate had an unprecedented surface when it came over me the latent eloquence of what they were doing i confess that my drawing was blurred for a momentthe picture swam they had accepted their failure but they couldnt accept their fate they had bowed their heads in bewilderment to the perverse and cruel law in virtue of which the real thing could be so much less precious than the unreal but they didnt want to starve if my servants were my models then my models might be my servants they would reverse the partsthe others would sit for the ladies and gentlemen and they would do the work they would still be in the studioit was an intense dumb appeal to me not to turn them out take us on they wanted to saywell do anything  my pencil dropped from my hand my sitting was spoiled and i got rid of my sitters who were also evidently rather mystified and awestruck then alone with the major and his wife i had a most uncomfortable moment he put their prayer into a single sentence i say you knowjust let us do for you cant you i couldntit was dreadful to see them emptying my slops but i pretended i could to oblige them for about a week then i gave them a sum of money to go away and i never saw them again i obtained the remaining books but my friend hawley repeats that major and mrs monarch did me a permanent harm got me into false ways if it be true im content to have paid the pricefor the memory     the story of it     chapter i   the weather had turned so much worse that the rest of the day was certainly lost the wind had risen and the storm gathered force they gave from time to time a thump at the firm windows and dashed even against those protected by the verandah their vicious splotches of rain beyond the lawn beyond the cliff the great wet brush of the sky dipped deep into the sea but the lawn already vivid with the touch of may showed a violence of watered green the budding shrubs and trees repeated the note as they tossed their thick masses and the cold troubled light filling the pretty saloon marked the spring afternoon as sufficiently young the two ladies seated there in silence could pursue without difficultyas well as clearly without interruptiontheir respective tasks a confidence expressed when the noise of the wind allowed it to be heard by the sharp scratch of mrs dyotts pen at the table where she was busy with letters  her visitor settled on a small sofa that with a palmtree a screen a stool a stand a bowl of flowers and three photographs in silver frames had been arranged near the light woodfire as a choice cornermaud blessingbourne her guest turned audibly though at intervals neither brief nor regular the leaves of a book covered in lemoncoloured paper and not yet despoiled of a certain fresh crispness this effect of the volume for the eye would have made it as presumably the newest french noveland evidently from the attitude of the reader goodconsort happily with the special tone of the room a consistent air of selection and suppression one of the finer aesthetic evolutions if mrs dyott was fond of ancient french furniture and distinctly difficult about it her inmates could be fondwith whatever critical cocks of charming darkbraided heads over slender sloping shouldersof modern french authors nothing had passed for half an hournothing at least to be exact but that each of the companions occasionally and covertly intermitted her pursuit in such a manner as to ascertain the degree of absorption of the other without turning round what their silence was charged with therefore was not only a sense of the weather but a sense so to speak of its own nature maud blessingbourne when she lowered her book into her lap closed her eyes with a conscious patience that seemed to say she waited but it was nevertheless she who at last made the movement representing a snap of their tension she got up and stood by the fire into which she looked a minute then came round and approached the window as if to see what was really going on at this mrs dyott wrote with refreshed intensity her little pile of letters had grown and if a look of determination was compatible with her fair and slightly faded beauty the habit of attending to her business could always keep pace with any excursion of her thought yet she was the first who spoke  i trust your book has been interesting  well enough a little mild  a louder throb of the tempest had blurred the sound of the words a little wild  dear notimid and tame unless ive quite lost my sense  perhaps you have mrs dyott placidly suggestedreading so many  her companion made a motion of feigned despair ah you take away my courage for going to my room as i was just meaning to for another  another french one  im afraid  do you carry them by the dozen  into innocent british homes maud tried to remember i believe i brought threeseeing them in a shopwindow as i passed through town it never rains but it pours but ive already read two  and are they the only ones you do read  french ones maud considered oh no dannunzio  and whats that mrs dyott asked as she affixed a stamp  oh you dear thing her friend was amused yet almost showed pity i know you dont read maud went on but why should you you live  yeswretchedly enough mrs dyott returned getting her letters together she left her place holding them as a neat achieved handful and came over to the fire while mrs blessingbourne turned once more to the window where she was met by another flurry  maud spoke then as if moved only by the elements do you expect him through all this  mrs dyott just waited and it had the effect indescribably of making everything that had gone before seem to have led up to the question this effect was even deepened by the way she then said whom do you mean  why i thought you mentioned at luncheon that colonel voyt was to walk over surely he cant  do you care very much mrs dyott asked  her friend now hesitated it depends on what you call much if you mean should i like to see himthen certainly  well my dear i think he understands youre here  so that as he evidently isnt coming maud laughed its particularly flattering or rather she added giving up the prospect again it would be i think quite extraordinarily flattering if he did except that of course she threw in he might come partly for you  partly is charming thank you for partly if you are going upstairs will you kindly mrs dyott pursued put these into the box as you pass  the younger woman taking the little pile of letters considered them with envy nine you are good youre always a living reproach  mrs dyott gave a sigh i dont do it on purpose the only thing this afternoon she went on reverting to the other question would be their not having come down  and as to that you dont know  noi dont know but she caught even as she spoke a rattattat of the knocker which struck her as a sign ah there  then i go and maud whisked out  mrs dyott left alone moved with an air of selection to the window and it was as so stationed gazing out at the wild weather that the visitor whose delay to appear spoke of the wiping of boots and the disposal of drenched mackintosh and cap finally found her he was tall lean fine with little in him on the whole to confirm the titular in the colonel voyt by which he was announced but he had left the army so that his reputation for gallantry mainly depended now on his fighting liberalism in the house of commons even these facts however his aspect scantily matched partly no doubt because he looked as was usually said unenglish his black hair cropped close was lightly powdered with silver and his dense glossy beard that of an emir or a caliph and grown for civil reasons repeated its handsome colour and its somewhat foreign effect his nose had a strong and shapely arch and the dark grey of his eyes was tinted with blue it had been said of himin relation to these signsthat he would have struck you as a jew had he not in spite of his nose struck you so much as an irishman neither responsibility could in fact have been fixed upon him and just now at all events he was only a pleasant weatherwashed windbattered briton who brought in from a struggle with the elements that he appeared quite to have enjoyed a certain amount of unremoved mud and an unusual quantity of easy expression it was exactly the silence ensuing on the retreat of the servant and the closed door that marked between him and his hostess the degree of this ease they met as it were twice the first time while the servant was there and the second as soon as he was not the difference was great between the two encounters though we must add in justice to the second that its marks were at first mainly negative this communion consisted only in their having drawn each other for a minute as close as possibleas possible that is with no help but the full clasp of hands thus they were mutually held and the closeness was at any rate such that for a little though it took account of dangers it did without words when words presently came the pair were talking by the fire and she had rung for tea he had by this time asked if the note he had despatched to her after breakfast had been safely delivered  yes before luncheon but im always in a state whenexcept for some extraordinary reasonyou send such things by hand i knew without it that you had come it never fails im sure when youre thereim sure when youre not  he wiped before the glass his wet moustache i see but this morning i had an impulse  it was beautiful but they make me as uneasy sometimes your impulses as if they were calculations make me wonder what you have in reserve  because when small children are too awfully good they die well i am a small child compared to youbut im not dead yet i cling to life  he had covered her with his smile but she continued grave im not half so much afraid when youre nasty  thank you what then did you do he asked with my note  you deserve that i should have spread it out on my dressingtableor left it better still in maud blessingbournes room  he wondered while he laughed oh but what does she deserve  it was her gravity that continued to answer yesit would probably kill her  she believes so in you  she believes so in you so dont be too nice to her  he was still looking in the chimneyglass at the state of his beardbrushing from it with his handkerchief the traces of wind and wet if she also then prefers me when im nasty it seems to me i ought to satisfy her shall i now at any rate see her  shes so like a pea on a pan over the possibility of it that shes pulling herself together in her room  oh then we must try and keep her together but why graceful tender pretty tooquite or almost as she isdoesnt she remarry  mrs dyott appearedand as if the first timeto look for the reason because she likes too many men  it kept up his spirits and how many may a lady like  in order not to like any of them too much ah that you know i never found outand its too late now when she presently pursued did you last see her  he really had to think would it have been since last november or sosomewhere or other where we spent three days  oh at surredge i know all about that i thought you also met afterwards  he had again to recall so we did wouldnt it have been somewhere at christmas but it wasnt by arrangement he laughed giving with his forefinger a little pleasant nick to his hostesss chin then as if something in the way she received this attention put him back to his question of a moment before have you kept my note  she held him with her pretty eyes do you want it back  ah dont speak as if i did take things  she dropped her gaze to the fire no you dont not even the hard things a really generous nature often would she quitted however as if to forget that the chimneyplace i put it there  youve burnt it good it made him easier but he noticed the next moment on a table the lemoncoloured volume left there by mrs blessingbourne and taking it up for a look immediately put it down you might while you were about it have burnt that too  youve read it  dear yes and you  no said mrs dyott it wasnt for me maud brought it  it pulled her visitor up mrs blessingbourne brought it  for such a day as this but she wondered how you look is it so awful  oh like his others something had occurred to him his thought was already far does she know  know what  why anything  but the door opened too soon for mrs dyott who could only murmur quicklytake care     chapter ii   it was in fact mrs blessingbourne who had under her arm the book she had gone up fora pair of covers showing this time a pretty a candid blue she was followed next minute by the servant who brought in tea the consumption of which with the passage of greetings inquiries and other light civilities between the two visitors occupied a quarter of an hour mrs dyott meanwhile as a contribution to so much amenity mentioned to maud that her fellow guest wished to scold her for the books she reada statement met by this friend with the remark that he must first be sure about them but as soon as he had picked up the new the blue volume he broke out into a frank dear dear  have you read that too mrs dyott inquired how much youll have to talk over together the other one she explained to him maud speaks of as terribly tame  ah i must have that out with her you dont feel the extraordinary force of the fellow voyt went on to mrs blessingbourne  and so round the hearth they talkedtalked soon while they warmed their toes with zest enough to make it seem as happy a chance as any of the quieter opportunities their imprisonment might have involved mrs blessingbourne did feel it then appeared the force of the fellow but she had her reserves and reactions in which voyt was much interested mrs dyott rather detached herself mainly gazing as she leaned back at the fire she intervened however enough to relieve maud of the sense of being listened to that sense with maud was too apt to convey that one was listened to for a fool yes when i read a novel i mostly read a french one she had said to voyt in answer to a question about her usual practice for i seem with it to get hold more of the real thingto get more life for my money only im not so infatuated with them but that sometimes for months and months on end i dont read any fiction at all  the two books were now together beside them then when you begin again you read a mass  dear no i only keep up with three or four authors  he laughed at this over the cigarette he had been allowed to light i like your keeping up and keeping up in particular with authors  one must keep up with somebody mrs dyott threw off  i daresay im ridiculous mrs blessingbourne conceded without heeding it but thats the way we express ourselves in my part of the country  i only alluded said voyt to the tremendous conscience of your sex its more than mine can keep up with you take everything too hard but if you cant read the novel of british and american manufacture heaven knows im at one with you it seems really to show our sense of life as the sense of puppies and kittens  well maud more patiently returned im told all sorts of people are now doing wonderful things but somehow i remain outside  ah its they its our poor twangers and twaddlers who remain outside they pick up a living in the street and who indeed would want them in  mrs blessingbourne seemed unable to say and yet at the same time to have her idea the subject in truth she evidently found was not so easy to handle people lend me things and i try but at the end of fifty pages  there you are yesheaven help us  but what i mean she went on isnt that i dont get woefully weary of the eternal french thing whats their sense of life  ah voilÀ mrs dyott softly sounded  oh but it is one you can make it out voyt promptly declared they do what they feel and they feel more things than we they strike so many more notes and with so different a hand when it comes to any account of a relation say between a man and a womani mean an intimate or a curious or a suggestive onewhere are we compared to them they dont exhaust the subject no doubt he admitted but we dont touch it dont even skim it its as if we denied its existence its possibility youll doubtless tell me however he went on that as all such relations are for us at the most much simpler we can only have all round less to say about them  she met this imputation with the quickest amusement i beg your pardon i dont think i shall tell you anything of the sort i dont know that i even agree with your premiss  about such relations he looked agreeably surprised you think we make them largeror subtler  mrs blessingbourne leaned back not looking like mrs dyott at the fire but at the ceiling i dont know what i think  its not that she doesnt know mrs dyott remarked its only that she doesnt say  but voyt had this time no eye for their hostess for a moment he watched maud it sticks out of you you know that youve yourself written something havent youand published ive a notion i could read you  when i do publish she said without moving youll be the last one i shall tell i have she went on a lovely subject but it would take an amount of treatment  tell us then at least what it is  at this she again met his eyes oh to tell it would be to express it and thats just what i cant do what i meant to say just now she added was that the french to my sense give us only again and again for ever and ever the same couple there they are once more as one has had them to satiety in that yellow thing and there i shall certainly again find them in the blue  then why do you keep reading about them mrs dyott demanded  maud cast about i dont she sighed at all events i shant any more i give it up  youve been looking for something i judge said colonel voyt that youre not likely to find it doesnt exist  what is it mrs dyott desired to know  i never look maud remarked for anything but an interest  naturally but your interest voyt replied is in something different from life  ah not a bit i love life in art though i hate it anywhere else its the poverty of the life those people show and the awful bounders of both sexes that they represent  oh now we have you her interlocutor laughed to me when alls said and done they seem to beas near as art can comein the truth of the truth it can only take what life gives it though it certainly may be a pity that that isnt better your complaint of their monotony is a complaint of their conditions when you say we get always the same couple what do you mean but that we get always the same passion of course we do voyt pursued if what youre looking for is another thats what you wont anywhere find  maud for a while said nothing and mrs dyott seemed to wait well i suppose im looking more than anything else for a decent woman  oh then you mustnt look for her in pictures of passion thats not her element nor her whereabouts  mrs blessingbourne weighed the objection does it not depend on what you mean by passion  i think i can mean only one thing the enemy to behaviour  oh i can imagine passions that are on the contrary friends to it  her fellowguest thought doesnt it depend perhaps on what you mean by behaviour  dear no behaviours just behaviourthe most definite thing in the world  then what do you mean by the interest you just now spoke of the picture of that definite thing  yescall it that women arent always vicious even when theyre  when theyre what voyt pressed  when theyre unhappy they can be unhappy and good  that one doesnt for a moment deny but can they be good and interesting  that must be mauds subject mrs dyott interposed to show a woman who is im afraid my dear she continued you could only show yourself  youd show then the most beautiful specimen conceivableand voyt addressed himself to maud but doesnt it prove that life is against your contention more interesting than art life you embellish and elevate but art would find itself able to do nothing with you and on such impossible terms would ruin you  the colour in her faint consciousness gave beauty to her stare ruin me  he means mrs dyott again indicated that youd ruin art  without on the other handvoyt seemed to assentits giving at all a coherent impression of you  she wants her romance cheap said mrs dyott  oh noi should be willing to pay for it i dont see why the romancesince you give it that nameshould be all as the french inveterately make it for the women who are bad  oh they pay for it said mrs dyott  do they  so at leastmrs dyott a little corrected herselfone has gathered for i dont read your books you know that theyre usually shown as doing  maud wondered but looking at voyt theyre shown often no doubt as paying for their badness but are they shown as paying for their romance  my dear lady said voyt their romance is their badness there isnt any other its a hard law if you will and a strange but goodness has to go without that luxury isnt to be good just exactly all round to go without he put it before her kindly and clearlyregretfully too as if he were sorry the truth should be so sad he and she his pleasant eyes seemed to say would had they had the making of it have made it better one has heard it beforeat least i have one has heard your question put but always when put to a mind not merely muddled for an inevitable answer why dont you cher monsieur give us the drama of virtue because chÈre madame the high privilege of virtue is precisely to avoid drama the adventures of the honest lady the honest lady hasnt cant possibly have adventures  mrs blessingbourne only met his eyes at first smiling with some intensity doesnt it depend a little on what you call adventures  my poor maud said mrs dyott as if in compassion for sophistry so simple adventures are just adventures thats all you can make of them  but her friend talked for their companion and as if without hearing doesnt it depend a good deal on what you call drama maud spoke as one who had already thought it out doesnt it depend on what you call romance  her listener gave these arguments his very best attention of course you may call things anything you likespeak of them as one thing and mean quite another but why should it depend on anything behind these words we usethe adventure the novel the drama the romance the situation in short as we most comprehensively saybehind them all stands the same sharp fact which they all in their different ways represent  precisely mrs dyott was full of approval  maud however was full of vagueness what great fact  the fact of a relation the adventures a relation the relations an adventure the romance the novel the drama are the picture of one the subject the novelist treats is the rise the formation the development the climax and for the most part the decline of one and what is the honest lady doing on that side of the town  mrs dyott was more pointed she doesnt so much as form a relation  but maud bore up doesnt it depend again on what you call a relation  oh said mrs dyott if a gentleman picks up her pockethandkerchief  ah even thats one their friend laughed if she has thrown it to him we can only deal with one that is one  surely maud replied but if its an innocent one  doesnt it depend a good deal mrs dyott asked on what you call innocent  you mean that the adventures of innocence have so often been the material of fiction yes voyt replied thats exactly what the bored reader complains of he has asked for bread and been given a stone what is it but with absolute directness a question of interest or as people say of the story whats a situation undeveloped but a subject lost if a relation stops wheres the story if it doesnt stop wheres the innocence it seems to me you must choose it would be very pretty if it were otherwise but thats how we flounder art is our flounderings shown  mrs blessingbourneand with an air of deference scarce supported perhaps by its sketchinesskept her deep eyes on this definition but sometimes we flounder out  it immediately touched in colonel voyt the spring of a genial derision thats just where i expected you would one always sees it come  he has you notice mrs dyott parenthesised to maud seen it come so often and he has always waited for it and met it  met it dear lady simply enough its the old story mrs blessingbourne the relations innocent that the heroine gets out of the books innocent thats the story of her getting out but what the devilin the name of innocencewas she doing in  mrs dyott promptly echoed the question you have to be in you know to get out so there you are already with your relation its the end of your goodness  and the beginning said voyt of your play  arent they all for that matter even the worst mrs dyott pursued supposed some time or other to get out but if meanwhile theyve been in however briefly long enough to adorn a tale  theyve been in long enough to point a moral that is to point ours with which and as if a sudden flush of warmer light had moved him colonel voyt got up the veil of the storm had parted over a great red sunset  mrs dyott also was on her feet and they stood before his charming antagonist who with eyes lowered and a somewhat fixed smile had not moved  weve spoiled her subject the elder lady sighed  well said voyt its better to spoil an artists subject than to spoil his reputation i mean he explained to maud with his indulgent manner his appearance of knowing what he has got hold of for that in the last resort is his happiness  she slowly rose at this facing him with an aspect as handsomely mild as his own you cant spoil my happiness  he held her hand an instant as he took leave i wish i could add to it     chapter iii   when he had quitted them and mrs dyott had candidly asked if her friend had found him rude or crude maud repliedthough not immediatelythat she had feared showing only too much how charming she found him but if mrs dyott took this it was to weigh the sense how could you show it too much  because i always feel that thats my only way of showing anything its absurd if you like mrs blessingbourne pursued but i never know in such intense discussions what strange impression i may give  her companion looked amused was it intense  i was maud frankly confessed  then its a pity you were so wrong colonel voyt you know is right mrs blessingbourne at this gave one of the slow soft silent headshakes to which she often resorted and which mostly accompanied by the light of cheer had somehow in spite of the small obstinacy that smiled in them a special grace with this grace for a moment her friend looking her up and down appeared impressed yet not too much so to take the next minute a decision oh my dear im sorry to differ from any one so lovelyfor youre awfully beautiful tonight and your frocks the very nicest ive ever seen you wear but hes as right as he can be  maud repeated her motion not so right at all events as he thinks he is or perhaps i can say she went on after an instant that im not so wrong i do know a little what im talking about  mrs dyott continued to study her you are vexed you naturally dont like itsuch destruction  destruction  of your illusion  i have no illusion if i had moreover it wouldnt be destroyed i have on the whole i think my little decency  mrs dyott stared let us grant it for argument what then  well ive also my little drama  an attachment  an attachment  that you shouldnt have  that i shouldnt have  a passion  a passion  shared  ah thank goodness no  mrs dyott continued to gaze the objects unaware  utterly  mrs dyott turned it over are you sure  sure  thats what you call your decency but isnt it mrs dyott asked rather his  dear no its only his good fortune  mrs dyott laughed but yours darlingyour good fortune where does that come in  why in my sense of the romance of it  the romance of what of his not knowing  of my not wanting him to if i didmaud had touchingly worked it outwhere would be my honesty  the inquiry for an instant held her friend yet only it seemed for a stupefaction that was almost amusement can you want or not want as you like where in the world if you dont want is your romance  mrs blessingbourne still wore her smile and she now with a light gesture that matched it just touched the region of her heart there  her companion admiringly marvelled a lovely place for it no doubtbut not quite a place that i can see to make the sentiment a relation  why not what more is required for a relation for me  oh all sorts of things i should say and many more added to those to make it one for the person you mention  ah that i dont pretend it either should be or can be i only speak for myself  this was said in a manner that made mrs dyott with a visible mixture of impressions suddenly turn away she indulged in a vague movement or two as if to look for something then again found herself near her friend on whom with the same abruptness in fact with a strange sharpness she conferred a kiss that might have represented either her tribute to exalted consistency or her idea of a graceful close of the discussion you deserve that one should speak for you  her companion looked cheerful and secure how can you without knowing  oh by guessing its not  but that was as far as mrs dyott could get its not said maud any one youve ever seen  ah then i give you up  and mrs dyott conformed for the rest of mauds stay to the spirit of this speech it was made on a saturday night and mrs blessingbourne remained till the wednesday following an interval during which as the return of fine weather was confirmed by the sunday the two ladies found a wider range of action there were drives to be taken calls made objects of interest seen at a distance with the effect of much easy talk and still more easy silence there had been a question of colonel voyts probable return on the sunday but the whole time passed without a sign from him and it was merely mentioned by mrs dyott in explanation that he must have been suddenly called as he was so liable to be to town that this in fact was what had happened he made clear to her on thursday afternoon when walking over again late he found her alone the consequence of his sunday letters had been his taking that day the 415 mrs voyt had gone back on thursday and he now to settle on the spot the question of a piece of work begun at his place had rushed down for a few hours in anticipation of the usual collective move for the weeks end he was to go up again by the late train and had to count a littlea fact accepted by his hostess with the hard pliancy of practicehis present happy moments too few as these were however he found time to make of her an inquiry or two not directly bearing on their situation the first was a recall of the question for which mrs blessingbournes entrance on the previous saturday had arrested her answer had that lady the idea of anything between them  no im sure theres one idea she has got mrs dyott went on but its quite different and not so very wonderful  what then is it  well that shes herself in love  voyt showed his interest you mean she told you  i got it out of her  he showed his amusement poor thing and with whom  with you  his surprise if the distinction might be made was less than his wonder you got that out of her too  noit remains in which is much the best way for it for you to know it would be to end it  he looked rather cheerfully at sea is that then why you tell me  i mean for her to know you know it therefore its in your interest not to let her  i see voyt after a moment returned your real calculation is that my interest will be sacrificed to my vanityso that if your other idea is just the flame will in fact and thanks to her morbid conscience expire by her taking fright at seeing me so pleased but i promise you he declared that she shant see it so there you are she kept her eyes on him and had evidently to admit after a little that there she was distinct as he had made the case however he wasnt yet quite satisfied why are you so sure im the man  from the way she denies you  you put it to her  straight if you hadnt been shed of course have confessed to youto keep me in the dark about the real one  poor voyt laughed out again oh you dear souls  besides his companion pursued i wasnt in want of that evidence  then what other had you  her state before you camewhich was what made me ask you how much you had seen her and her state after it mrs dyott added and her state she wound up while you were here  but her state while i was here was charming  charming thats just what i say  she said it in a tone that placed the matter in its right lighta light in which they appeared kindly quite tenderly to watch maud wander away into space with her lovely head bent under a theory rather too big for it voyts last word however was that there was just enough in itin the theoryfor them to allow that she had not shown herself on the occasion of their talk wholly bereft of sense her consciousness if they let it aloneas they of course after this mercifully mustwas in the last analysis a kind of shy romance not a romance like their own a thing to make the fortune of any author up to the markone who should have the invention or who could have the courage but a small scared starved subjective satisfaction that would do her no harm and nobody else any good who but a dufferhe stuck to his contentionwould see the shadow of a story in it     flickerbridge     chapter i   frank granger had arrived from paris to paint a portraitan order given him as a young compatriot with a future whose early work would some day have a price by a lady from new york a friend of his own people and also as it happened of addies the young woman to whom it was publicly both affirmed and denied that he was engaged other young women in parisfellowmembers there of the little tight transpontine world of artstudyprofessed to know that the pair had several times over renewed their fond understanding this however was their own affair the last phase of the relation the last time of the times had passed into vagueness there was perhaps even an impression that if they were inscrutable to their friends they were not wholly crystalline to each other and themselves what had occurred for granger at all events in connexion with the portrait was that mrs bracken his intending model whose return to america was at hand had suddenly been called to london by her husband occupied there with pressing business but had yet desired that her displacement should not interrupt her sittings the young man at her request had followed her to england and profited by all she could give him making shift with a small studio lent him by a london painter whom he had known and liked a few years before in the french atelier that then cradled and that continued to cradle so many of their kind  the british capital was a strange grey world to him where people walked in more ways than one by a dim light but he was happily of such a turn that the impression just as it came could nowhere ever fail him and even the worst of these things was almost as much an occupationputting it only at thatas the best mrs bracken moreover passed him on and while the darkness ebbed a little in the april days he found himself consolingly committed to a couple of fresh subjects this cut him out work for more than another month but meanwhile as he said he saw a lota lot that with frequency and with much expression he wrote about to addie she also wrote to her absent friend but in briefer snatches a meagreness to her reasons for which he had long since assented she had other play for her pen as well as fortunately other remuneration a regular correspondence for a prominent boston paper fitful connexions with public sheets perhaps also in cases fitful and a mind above all engrossed at times to the exclusion of everything else with the study of the short story this last was what she had mainly come out to go into two or three years after he had found himself engulfed in the mystery of carolus she was indeed on her own deep sea more engulfed than he had ever been and he had grown to accept the sense that for progress too she sailed under more canvas it hadnt been particularly present to him till now that he had in the least got on but the way in which addie hadand evidently still more wouldwas the theme as it were of every tongue she had thirty short stories out and nine descriptive articles his three or four portraits of fat american ladiesthey were all fat all ladies and all americanwere a poor show compared with these triumphs especially as addie had begun to throw out that it was about time they should go home it kept perpetually coming up in paris in the transpontine world that as the phrase was america had grown more interesting since they left addie was attentive to the rumour and as full of conscience as she was of taste of patriotism as of curiosity had often put it to him frankly with what he who was of new york recognised as her new england emphasis im not sure you know that we do real justice to our country granger felt he would do it on the dayif the day ever camehe should irrevocably marry her no other country could possibly have produced her     chapter ii   but meanwhile it befell that in london he was stricken with influenza and with subsequent sorrow the attack was short but sharphad it lasted addie would certainly have come to his aid most of a blight really in its secondary stage the good ladies his sittersthe ladies with the frizzled hair with the diamond earrings with the chins tending to the massiveleft for him at the door of his lodgings flowers soup and love so that with their assistance he pulled through but his convalescence was slow and his weakness out of proportion to the muffled shock he came out but he went about lame it tired him to painthe felt as if he had been ill three months he strolled in kensington gardens when he should have been at work he sat long on penny chairs and helplessly mused and mooned addie desired him to return to paris but there were chances under his hand that he felt he had just wit enough left not to relinquish he would have gone for a week to the seahe would have gone to brighton but mrs bracken had to be finishedmrs bracken was so soon to sail he just managed to finish her in timethe day before the date fixed for his breaking ground on a greater business still the circumvallation of mrs dunn mrs dunn duly waited on him and he sat down before her feeling however ere he rose that he must take a long breath before the attack while asking himself that night therefore where he should best replenish his lungs he received from addie who had had from mrs bracken a poor report of him a communication which besides being of sudden and startling interest applied directly to his case  his friend wrote to him under the lively emotion of having from one day to another become aware of a new relative an ancient cousin a sequestered gentlewoman the sole survival of the english branch of the family still resident at flickerbridge in the old family home and with whom that he might immediately betake himself to so auspicious a quarter for change of air she had already done what was proper to place him as she said in touch what came of it all to be brief was that granger found himself so placed almost as he read he was in touch with miss wenham of flickerbridge to the extent of being in correspondence with her before twentyfour hours had sped and on the second day he was in the train settled for a fivehours run to the door of this amiable woman who had so abruptly and kindly taken him on trust and of whom but yesterday he had never so much as heard this was an odditythe whole incident wasof which in the corner of his compartment as he proceeded he had time to take the size but the surprise the incongruity as he felt could but deepen as he went it was a sufficiently queer note in the light or the absence of it of his late experience that so complex a product as addie should have any simple insular tie but it was a queerer note still that she should have had one so long only to remain unprofitably unconscious of it not to have done something with it used it worked it talked about it at least and perhaps even writtenthese things at the rate she moved represented a loss of opportunity under which as he saw her she was peculiarly formed to wince she was at any rate it was clear doing something with it now using it working it certainly already talkingand yes quite possibly writingabout it she was in short smartly making up what she had missed and he could take such comfort from his own action as he had been helped to by the rest of the facts succinctly reported from paris on the very morning of his start  it was the singular story of a sharp splitin a good english housethat dated now from years back a worthy briton of the best middling stock had during the fourth decade of the century as a very young man in dresden whither he had been despatched to qualify in german for a stool in an uncles countinghouse met admired wooed and won an american girl of due attractions domiciled at that period with her parents and a sister who was also attractive in the saxon capital he had married her taken her to england and there after some years of harmony and happiness lost her the sister in question had after her death come to him and to his young child on a visit the effect of which between the pair eventually defined itself as a sentiment that was not to be resisted the bereaved husband yielding to a new attachment and a new response and finding a new union thus prescribed had yet been forced to reckon with the unaccommodating law of the land encompassed with frowns in his own country however marriages of this particular type were wreathed in smiles in his sistersinlaw so that his remedy was not forbidden choosing between two allegiances he had let the one go that seemed the least close and had in brief transplanted his possibilities to an easier air the knot was tied for the couple in new york where to protect the legitimacy of such other children as might come to them they settled and prospered children came and one of the daughters growing up and marrying in her turn was if frank rightly followed the mother of his own addie who had been deprived of the knowledge of her indeed in childhood by death and been brought up though without undue tension by a stepmothera character breaking out thus anew  the breach produced in england by the invidious action as it was there held of the girls grandfather had not failed to widenall the more that nothing had been done on the american side to close it frigidity had settled and hostility had been arrested only by indifference darkness therefore had fortunately supervened and a cousinship completely divided on either side of the impassable gulf of the impenetrable curtain each branch had put forth its leavesa foliage wanting in the american quarter it was distinct enough to granger of no sign or symptom of climate and environment the graft in new york had taken and addie was a vivid an unmistakable flower at flickerbridge or wherever on the other hand strange to say the parent stem had had a fortune comparatively meagre fortune it was true in the vulgarest sense had attended neither party addies immediate belongings were as poor as they were numerous and he gathered that miss wenhams pretensions to wealth were not so marked as to expose the claim of kinship to the imputation of motive to this ladys single identity the original stock had at all events dwindled and our young man was properly warned that he would find her shy and solitary what was singular was that in these conditions she should desire she should endure to receive him but that was all another story lucid enough when mastered he kept addies letters exceptionally copious in his lap he conned them at intervals he held the threads  he looked out between whiles at the pleasant english land an april aquarelle washed in with wondrous breadth he knew the french thing he knew the american but he had known nothing of this he saw it already as the remarkable miss wenhams setting the doctors daughter at flickerbridge with nippers on her nose a palette on her thumb and innocence in her heart had been the miraculous link she had become aware even there in our world of wonders that the current fashion for young women so equipped was to enter the parisian lists addie had accordingly chanced upon her on the slopes of montparnasse as one of the english girls in one of the thoroughgoing sets they had met in some easy collocation and had fallen upon common ground after which the young woman restored to flickerbridge for an interlude and retailing there her adventures and impressions had mentioned to miss wenham who had known and protected her from babyhood that that ladys own name of adelaide was as well as the surname conjoined with it borne to her knowledge in paris by an extraordinary american specimen she had then recrossed the channel with a wonderful message a courteous challenge to her friends duplicate who had in turn granted through her every satisfaction the duplicate had in other words bravely let miss wenham know exactly who she was miss wenham in whose personal tradition the flame of resentment appeared to have been reduced by time to the palest ashesfor whom indeed the story of the great schism was now but a legend only needing a little less dimness to make it romanticmiss wenham had promptly responded by a letter fragrant with the hope that old threads might be taken up it was a relationship that they must puzzle out together and she had earnestly sounded the other party to it on the subject of a possible visit addie had met her with a definite promise she would come soon she would come when free she would come in july but meanwhile she sent her deputy frank asked himself by what name she had described by what character introduced him to flickerbridge he mainly felt on the whole as if he were going there to find out if he were engaged to her he was at sea really now as to which of the various views addie herself took of it to miss wenham she must definitely have taken one and perhaps miss wenham would reveal it this expectation was in fact his excuse for a possible indiscretion     chapter iii   he was indeed to learn on arrival to what he had been committed but that was for a while so much a part of his first general impression that the particular truth took time to detach itself the first general impression demanding verily all his faculties of response he almost felt for a day or two the victim of a practical joke a gross abuse of confidence he had presented himself with the moderate amount of flutter involved in a sense of due preparation but he had then found that however primed with prefaces and prompted with hints he hadnt been prepared at all how could he be he asked himself for anything so foreign to his experience so alien to his proper world so little to be preconceived in the sharp north light of the newest impressionism and yet so recognised after all in the event so noted and tasted and assimilated it was a case he would scarce have known how to describecould doubtless have described best with a full clean brush supplemented by a play of gesture for it was always his habit to see an occasion of whatever kind primarily as a picture so that he might get it as he was wont to say so that he might keep it well together he had been treated of a sudden in this adventure to one of the sweetest fairest coolest impressions of his lifeone moreover visibly complete and homogeneous from the start oh it was there if that was all one wanted of a thing it was so there that as had befallen him in italy in spain confronted at last in dusky sidechapel or rich museum with great things dreamed of or with greater ones unexpectedly presented he had held his breath for fear of breaking the spell had almost from the quick impulse to respect to prolong lowered his voice and moved on tiptoe supreme beauty suddenly revealed is apt to strike us as a possible illusion playing with our desireinstant freedom with it to strike us as a possible rashness  this fortunately howeverand the more so as his freedom for the time quite left himdidnt prevent his hostess the evening of his advent and while the vision was new from being exactly as queer and rare and impayable as improbable as impossible as delightful at the eight oclock dinnershe appeared to keep these immense hoursas she had overwhelmingly been at the five oclock tea she was in the most natural way in the world one of the oddest apparitions but that the particular means to such an end could be natural was an inference difficult to make he failed in fact to make it for a couple of days but thenthough then onlyhe made it with confidence by this time indeed he was sure of everything luckily including himself if we compare his impression with slight extravagance to some of the greatest he had ever received this is simply because the image before him was so rounded and stamped it expressed with pure perfection it exhausted its character it was so absolutely and so unconsciously what it was he had been floated by the strangest of chances out of the rushing stream into a clear still backwatera deep and quiet pool in which objects were sharply mirrored he had hitherto in life known nothing that was old except a few statues and pictures but here everything was old was immemorial and nothing so much so as the very freshness itself vaguely to have supposed there were such nooks in the world had done little enough he now saw to temper the glare of their opposites it was the fine touches that counted and these had to be seen to be believed  miss wenham fiftyfive years of age and unappeasably timid unaccountably strange had on her reduced scale an almost gothic grotesqueness but the final effect of ones sense of it was an amenity that accompanied ones steps like wafted gratitude more flurried more spasmodic more apologetic more completely at a loss at one moment and more precipitately abounding at another he had never before in all his days seen any maiden lady yet for no maiden lady he had ever seen had he so promptly conceived a private enthusiasm her eyes protruded her chin receded and her nose carried on in conversation a queer little independent motion she wore on the top of her head an upright circular cap that made her resemble a caryatid disburdened and on other parts of her person strange combinations of colours stuffs shapes of metal mineral and plant the tones of her voice rose and fell her facial convulsions whether tendingone could scarce make outto expression or repression succeeded each other by a law of their own she was embarrassed at nothing and at everything frightened at everything and at nothing and she approached objects subjects the simplest questions and answers and the whole material of intercourse either with the indirectness of terror or with the violence of despair these things none the less her refinements of oddity and intensities of custom her betrayal at once of conventions and simplicities of ease and of agony her roundabout retarded suggestions and perceptions still permitted her to strike her guest as irresistibly charming he didnt know what to call it she was a fruit of time she had a queer distinction she had been expensively produced and there would be a good deal more of her to come  the result of the whole quality of her welcome at any rate was that the first evening in his room before going to bed he relieved his mind in a letter to addie which if space allowed us to embody it in our text would usefully perform the office of a plate it would enable us to present ourselves as profusely illustrated but the process of reproduction as we say costs he wished his friend to know how grandly their affair turned out she had put him in the way of something absolutely specialan old house untouched untouchable indescribable an old corner such as one didnt believe existed and the holy calm of which made the chatter of studios the smell of paint the slang of critics the whole sense and sound of paris come back as so many signs of a huge monkeycage he moved about restless while he wrote he lighted cigarettes and nervous and suddenly scrupulous put them out again the night was mild and one of the windows of his large high room which stood over the garden was up he lost himself in the things about him in the type of the room the last century with not a chair moved not a point stretched he hung over the objects and ornaments blissfully few and adorably good perfect pieces all and never one for a change french the scene was as rare as some fine old print with the best bits down in the corners old books and old pictures allusions remembered and aspects conjectured reappeared to him he knew not what anxious islanders had been trying for in their backward hunt for the homely but the homely at flickerbridge was all style even as style at the same time was mere honesty the larger the smaller pasthe scarce knew which to call itwas at all events so hushed to sleep round him as he wrote that he had almost a bad conscience about having come how one might love it but how one might spoil it to look at it too hard was positively to make it conscious and to make it conscious was positively to wake it up its only safety of a truth was to be left still to sleepto sleep in its large fair chambers and under its high clean canopies  he added thus restlessly a line to his letter maundered round the room again noted and fingered something else and then dropping on the old flowered sofa sustained by the tight cubes of its cushions yielded afresh to the cigarette hesitated stared wrote a few words more he wanted addie to know that was what he most felt unless he perhaps felt more how much she herself would want to yes what he supremely saw was all that addie would make of it up to his neck in it there he fairly turned cold at the sense of suppressed opportunity of the outrage of privation that his correspondent would retrospectively and as he even divined with a vague shudder almost vindictively nurse well what had happened was that the acquaintance had been kept for her like a packet enveloped and sealed for delivery till her attention was free he saw her there heard her and felt herfelt how she would feel and how she would as she usually said rave some of her young compatriots called it yell and in the reference itself alas illustrated their meaning she would understand the place at any rate down to the ground there wasnt the slightest doubt of that her sense of it would be exactly like his own and he could see in anticipation just the terms of recognition and rapture in which she would abound he knew just what she would call quaint just what she would call bland just what she would call weird just what she would call wild she would take it all in with an intelligence much more fitted than his own in fact to deal with what he supposed he must regard as its literary relations she would have read the longwinded obsolete memoirs and novels that both the figures and the setting ought clearly to remind one of she would know about the past generationsthe lumbering country magnates and their turbaned wives and roundeyed daughters who in other days had treated the ruddy sturdy tradeless townthe solid square houses and wide walled gardens the streets today all grass and gossip as the scene of a local season she would have warrant for the assemblies dinners deep potations for the smoked sconces in the dusky parlours for the long muddy century of family coaches holsters highwaymen she would put a finger in short just as he had done on the vital spotthe rich humility of the whole thing the fact that neither flickerbridge in general nor miss wenham in particular nor anything nor any one concerned had a suspicion of their characters and their merit addie and he would have to come to let in light  he let it in then little by little before going to bed through the eight or ten pages he addressed to her assured her that it was the happiest case in the world a little pictureyet full of style tooabsolutely composed and transmitted with tradition and tradition only in every stroke tradition still noiselessly breathing and visibly flushing marking strange hours in the tall mahogany clocks that were never wound up and that yet audibly ticked on all the elements he was sure he should see would hang together with a charm presenting his hostessa strange iridescent fish for the glazed exposure of an aquariumas afloat in her native medium he left his letter open on the table but looking it over next morning felt of a sudden indisposed to send it he would keep it to add more for there would be more to know yet when three days had elapsed he still had not sent it he sent instead after delay a much briefer report which he was moved to make different and for some reason less vivid meanwhile he learned from miss wenham how addie had introduced him it took time to arrive with her at that point but after the rubicon was crossed they went far afield     chapter iv   oh yes she said you were engaged to her that was whysince i had broken outshe thought i might like to see you as i assure you ive been so delighted to but arent you the good lady asked as if she saw in his face some ground for doubt  assuredlyif she says so it may seem very odd to you but i havent known and yet ive felt that being nothing whatever to you directly i need some warrant for consenting thus to be thrust on you we were the young man explained engaged a year ago but since then if you dont mind my telling you such things i feel now as if i could tell you anything i havent quite known how i stand it hasnt seemed we were in a position to marry things are better now but i havent quite known how shed see them they were so bad six months ago that i understood her i thought as breaking off i havent broken ive only accepted for the timebecause men must be easy with womenbeing treated as the best of friends well i try to be i wouldnt have come here if i hadnt been i thought it would be charming for her to know youwhen i heard from her the extraordinary way you had dawned upon her and charming therefore if i could help her to it and if im helping you to know her he went on isnt that charming too  oh i so want to miss wenham murmured in her unpractical impersonal way youre so different she wistfully declared  its you if i may respectfully ecstatically say so who are different thats the point of it all im not sure that anything so terrible really ought to happen to you as to know us  well said miss wenham i do know you a little by this time dont i and i dont find it terrible its a delightful change for me  oh im not sure you ought to have a delightful change  why notif you do  ah i can bear it im not sure you can im too bad to spoili am spoiled im nobody in short im nothing ive no type youre all type it has taken delicious long years of security and monotony to produce you you fit your frame with a perfection only equalled by the perfection with which your frame fits you so this admirable old house all timesoftened white within and timefaded red without so everything that surrounds you here and that has by some extraordinary mercy escaped the inevitable fate of exploitation so it all i say is the sort of thing that were it the least bit to fall to pieces could never ah never more be put together again i have dear miss wenham granger went on happy himself in his extravagance which was yet all sincere and happier still in her deep but altogether pleased mystificationive found do you know just the thing one has ever heard of that you most resemble youre the sleeping beauty in the wood  he still had no compunction when he heard her bewilderedly sigh oh youre too delightfully droll  no i only put things just as they are and as ive also learned a little thank heaven to see themwhich isnt i quite agree with you at all what any one does youre in the deep doze of the spell that has held you for long years and it would be a shame a crime to wake you up indeed i already feel with a thousand scruples that im giving you the fatal shake i say it even though it makes me sound a little as if i thought myself the fairy prince  she gazed at him with her queerest kindest look which he was getting used to in spite of a faint fear at the back of his head of the strange things that sometimes occurred when lonely ladies however mature began to look at interesting young men from over the seas as if the young men desired to flirt its so wonderful she said that you should be so very odd and yet so very goodnatured well it all came to the same thingit was so wonderful that she should be so simple and yet so little of a bore he accepted with gratitude the theory of his languorwhich moreover was real enough and partly perhaps why he was so sensitive he let himself go as a convalescent let her insist on the weakness always left by fever it helped him to gain time to preserve the spell even while he talked of breaking it saw him through slow strolls and soft sessions long gossips fitful hopeless questionsthere was so much more to tell than by any contortion she couldand explanations addressed gallantly and patiently to her understanding but not by good fortune really reaching it they were perfectly at crosspurposes and it was the better and they wandered together in the silver haze with all communication blurred  when they sat in the sun in her formal garden he quite knew how little even the tenderest consideration failed to disguise his treating her as the most exquisite of curiosities the term of comparison most present to him was that of some obsolete musical instrument the oldtime order of her mind and her air had the stillness of a painted spinnet that was duly dusted gently rubbed but never tuned nor played on her opinions were like dried roseleaves her attitudes like british sculpture her voice what he imagined of the possible tone of the old gilded silverstringed harp in one of the corners of the drawingroom the lonely little decencies and modest dignities of her life the fine grain of its conservatism the innocence of its ignorance all its monotony of stupidity and salubrity its cold dulness and dim brightness were there before him meanwhile within him strange things took place it was literally true that his impression began again after a lull to make him nervous and anxious and for reasons peculiarly confused almost grotesquely mingled or at least comically sharp he was distinctly an agitation and a new tastethat he could see and he saw quite as much therefore the excitement she already drew from the vision of addie an image intensified by the sense of closer kinship and presented to her clearly with various erratic enhancements by her friend the doctors daughter at the end of a few days he said to her do you know she wants to come without waiting any longer she wants to come while im here i received this morning her letter proposing it but ive been thinking it over and have waited to speak to you the thing is you see that if she writes to you proposing it  oh i shall be so particularly glad     chapter v   they were as usual in the garden and it hadnt yet been so present to him that if he were only a happy cad there would be a good way to protect her as she wouldnt hear of his being yet beyond precautions she had gone into the house for a particular shawl that was just the thing for his knees and blinking in the watery sunshine had come back with it across the fine little lawn he was neither fatuous nor asinine but he had almost to put it to himself as a small task to resist the sense of his absurd advantage with her it filled him with horror and awkwardness made him think of he didnt know what recalled something of maupassantsthe smitten miss harriet and her tragic fate there was a preposterous possibilityyes he held the strings quite in his handsof keeping the treasure for himself that was the art of lifewhat the real artist would consistently do he would close the door on his impression treat it as a private museum he would see that he could lounge and linger there live with wonderful things there lie up there to rest and refit for himself he was sure that after a little he should be able to paint theredo things in a key he had never thought of before when she brought him the rug he took it from her and made her sit down on the bench and resume her knitting then passing behind her with a laugh he placed it over her own shoulders after which he moved to and fro before her his hands in his pockets and his cigarette in his teeth he was ashamed of the cigarettea villainous false note but she allowed liked begged him to smoke and what he said to her on it in one of the pleasantries she benevolently missed was that he did so for fear of doing worse that only showed how the end was really in sight i dare say it will strike you as quite awful what im going to say to you but i cant help it i speak out of the depths of my respect for you it will seem to you horrid disloyalty to poor addie yesthere we are there i am at least in my naked monstrosity he stopped and looked at her till she might have been almost frightened dont let her come tell her not to ive tried to prevent it but she suspects  the poor woman wondered suspects  well i drew it in writing to her on reflexion as mild as i couldhaving been visited in the watches of the night by the instinct of what might happen something told me to keep back my first letterin which under the first impression i myself rashly raved and i concocted instead of it an insincere and guarded report but guarded as i was i clearly didnt keep you down as we say enough the wonder of your colourdaub you over with grey as i mightmust have come through and told the tale she scents battle from afarby which i mean she scents quaintness but keep her off its hideous what im sayingbut i owe it to you i owe it to the world shell kill you  you mean i shant get on with her  oh fatally see how i have and see how you have with me shes intelligent moreover remarkably pretty remarkably good and shell adore you  well then  why that will be just how shell do for you  oh i can hold my own said miss wenham with the headshake of a horse making his sleighbells rattle in frosty air  ah but you cant hold hers shell rave about you shell write about you youre niagara before the first white travellerand you know or rather you cant know what niagara became after that gentleman addie will have discovered niagara shell understand you in perfection shell feel you down to the ground not a delicate shade of you will she lose or let any one else lose youll be too weird for words but the words will nevertheless come youll be too exactly the real thing and be left too utterly just as you are and all addies friends and all addies editors and contributors and readers will cross the atlantic and flock to flickerbridge just in order sounanimously universally vociferouslyto leave you youll be in the magazines with illustrations youll be in the papers with headings youll be everywhere with everything you dont understandyou think you do but you dont heaven forbid you should understand thats just your beautyyour sleeping beauty but you neednt you can take me on trust dont have her give as a pretext as a reason anything in the world you like lie to herscare her away ill go away and give you upill sacrifice everything myself granger pursued his exhortation convincing himself more and more if i saw my way out my way completely through id pile up some fabric of fiction for heri should only want to be sure of its not tumbling down one would have you see to keep the thing up but id throw dust in her eyes id tell her you dont do at allthat youre not in fact a desirable acquaintance id tell her youre vulgar improper scandalous id tell her youre mercenary designing dangerous id tell her the only safe course is immediately to let you drop id thus surround you with an impenetrable legend of conscientious misrepresentation a circle of pious fraud and all the while privately keep you for myself  she had listened to him as if he were a band of music and she herself a small shy gardenparty i shouldnt like you to go away i shouldnt in the least like you not to come again  ah there it is he replied how can i come again if addie ruins you  but how will she ruin meeven if she does what you say i know im too old to change and really much too queer to please in any of the extraordinary ways you speak of if its a question of quizzing me i dont think my cousin or any one else will have quite the hand for it that you seem to have so that if you havent ruined me  but i havethats just the point granger insisted ive undermined you at least ive left after all terribly little for addie to do  she laughed in clear tones well then well admit that youve done everything but frighten me  he looked at her with surpassing gloom nothat again is one of the most dreadful features youll positively like itwhats to come youll be caught up in a chariot of fire like the prophetwasnt there was there oneof old thats exactly whyif one could but have done ityoud have been to be kept ignorant and helpless theres something or other in latin that says its the finest things that change the most easily for the worse you already enjoy your dishonour and revel in your shame its too lateyoure lost     chapter vi   all this was as pleasant a manner of passing the time as any other for it didnt prevent his oldworld corner from closing round him more entirely nor stand in the way of his making out from day to day some new source as well as some new effect of its virtue he was really scared at moments at some of the liberties he took in talkat finding himself so familiar for the great note of the place was just that a certain modern ease had never crossed its threshold that quick intimacies and quick oblivions were a stranger to its air it had known in all its days no rude no loud invasion serenely unconscious of most contemporary things it had been so of nothing so much as of the diffused social practice of running in and out granger held his breath on occasions to think how addie would run there were moments when more than at others for some reason he heard her step on the staircase and her cry in the hall if he nevertheless played freely with the idea with which we have shown him as occupied it wasnt that in all palpable ways he didnt sacrifice so far as mortally possible to stillness he only hovered ever so lightly to take up again his thread she wouldnt hear of his leaving her of his being in the least fit again as she said to travel she spoke of the journey to londonwhich was in fact a matter of many hoursas an experiment fraught with lurking complications he added then day to day yet only hereby as he reminded her giving other complications a larger chance to multiply he kept it before her when there was nothing else to do that she must consider after which he had his times of fear that she perhaps really would make for him this sacrifice  he knew she had written again to paris and knew he must himself again writea situation abounding for each in the elements of a plight if he stayed so long why then he wasnt better and if he wasnt better addie might take it into her head they must make it clear that he was better so that suspicious alarmed at what was kept from her she shouldnt suddenly present herself to nurse him if he was better however why did he stay so long if he stayed only for the attraction the sense of the attraction might be contagious this was what finally grew clearest for him so that he had for his mild disciple hours of still sharper prophecy it consorted with his fancy to represent to her that their young friend had been by this time unsparingly warned but nothing could be plainer than that this was ineffectual so long as he himself resisted the ordeal to plead that he remained because he was too weak to move was only to throw themselves back on the other horn of their dilemma if he was too weak to move addie would bring him her strengthof which when she got there she would give them specimens enough one morning he broke out at breakfast with an intimate conviction theyd see that she was actually startingtheyd receive a wire by noon they didnt receive it but by his theory the portent was only the stronger it had moreover its grave as well as its gay side since grangers paradox and pleasantry were only the method most open to him of conveying what he felt he literally heard the knell sound and in expressing this to miss wenham with the conversational freedom that seemed best to pay his way he the more vividly faced the contingency he could never return and though he announced it with a despair that did what might be to make it pass as a joke he saw how whether or no she at last understood she quite at last believed him on this to his knowledge she wrote again to addie and the contents of her letter excited his curiosity but that sentiment though not assuaged quite dropped when the day after in the evening she let him know she had had a telegram an hour before  she comes thursday  he showed not the least surprise it was the deep calm of the fatalist it had to be i must leave you then tomorrow  she looked on this as he had never seen her it would have been hard to say whether what showed in her face was the last failure to follow or the first effort to meet and really not to come back  never never dear lady why should i come back you can never be again what you have been i shall have seen the last of you  oh she touchingly urged  yes for i should next find you simply brought to selfconsciousness youll be exactly what you are i charitably admitnothing more or less nothing different but youll be it all in a different way we live in an age of prodigious machinery all organised to a single end that end is publicitya publicity as ferocious as the appetite of a cannibal the thing therefore is not to have any illusionsfondly to flatter yourself in a muddled moment that the cannibal will spare you he spares nobody he spares nothing it will be all right youll have a lovely time youll be only just a public characterblown about the world for all youre worth and proclaimed for all youre worth on the housetops it will be for that mind i quite recognisebecause addie is superioras well as for all you arent so goodbye  he remained however till the next day and noted at intervals the different stages of their friends journey the hour this time she would really have started the hour shed reach dover the hour shed get to town where shed alight at mrs dunns perhaps shed bring mrs dunn for mrs dunn would swell the chorus at the last on the morrow as if in anticipation of this stillness settled between them he became as silent as his hostess but before he went she brought out shyly and anxiously as an appeal the question that for hours had clearly been giving her thought do you meet her then tonight in london  dear no in what position am i alas to do that when can i ever meet her again he had turned it all over if i could meet addie after this you know i could meet you and if i do meet addie he lucidly pursued what will happen by the same stroke is that i shall meet you and thats just what ive explained to you i dread  you mean she and i will be inseparable  he hesitated i mean shell tell me all about you i can hear her and her ravings now  she gave againand it was infinitely sadher little whinnying laugh oh but if what you say is true youll know  ah but addie wont wont i mean know that i knowor at least wont believe it wont believe that any one knows such he added with a strange smothered sigh is addie do you know he wound up that what after all has most definitely happened is that youve made me see her as ive never done before  she blinked and gasped she wondered and despaired oh no it will be you ive had nothing to do with it everythings all you  but for all it mattered now youll see he said that shes charming i shall go for tonight to oxford i shall almost cross her on the way  then if shes charming what am i to tell her from you in explanation of such strange behaviour as your flying away just as she arrives  ah you neednt mind about thatyou neednt tell her anything  she fixed him as if as never again its none of my business of course i feel but isnt it a little cruel if youre engaged  granger gave a laugh almost as odd as one of her own oh youve cost me thatand he put out his hand to her  she wondered while she took it cost you  were not engaged goodbye     mrs medwin     chapter i   well we are a pair the poor ladys visitor broke out to her at the end of her explanation in a manner disconcerting enough the poor lady was miss cutter who lived in south audley street where she had an upper half so concise that it had to pass boldly for convenient and her visitor was her halfbrother whom she hadnt seen for three years she was remarkable for a maturity of which every symptom might have been observed to be admirably controlled had not a tendency to stoutness just affirmed its independence her present no doubt insisted too much on her past but with the excuse sufficiently valid that she must certainly once have been prettier she was clearly not contented with onceshe wished to be prettier again she neglected nothing that could produce that illusion and being both fair and fat dressed almost wholly in black when she added a little colour it was not at any rate to her drapery her small rooms had the peculiarity that everything they contained appeared to testify with vividness to her position in society quite as if they had been furnished by the bounty of admiring friends they were adorned indeed almost exclusively with objects that nobody buys as had more than once been remarked by spectators of her own sex for herself and would have been luxurious if luxury consisted mainly in photographic portraits slashed across with signatures in baskets of flowers beribboned with the cards of passing compatriots and in a neat collection of red volumes blue volumes alphabetical volumes aids to london lucidity of every sort devoted to addresses and engagements to be in miss cutters tiny drawingroom in short even with miss cutter aloneshould you by any chance have found her sowas somehow to be in the world and in a crowd it was like an agencyit bristled with particulars  this was what the tall lean loose gentleman lounging there before her might have appeared to read in the suggestive scene over which while she talked to him his eyes moved without haste and without rest oh come mamie he occasionally threw off and the words were evidently connected with the impression thus absorbed his comparative youth spoke of waste even as her positiveher too positivespoke of economy there was only one thing that is to make up in him for everything he had lost though it was distinct enough indeed that this thing might sometimes serve it consisted in the perfection of an indifference an indifference at the present moment directed to the pleaa plea of inability of pure destitutionwith which his sister had met him yet it had even now a wider embrace took in quite sufficiently all consequences of queerness confessed in advance to the false note that in such a setting he almost excruciatingly constituted he cared as little that he looked at moments all his impudence as that he looked all his shabbiness all his cleverness all his history these different things were written in himin his premature baldness his seamed strained face the lapse from bravery of his long tawny moustache above all in his easy friendly universally acquainted eye so much too sociable for mere conversation what possible relation with him could be natural enough to meet it he wore a scant rough inverness cape and a pair of black trousers wanting in substance and marked with the sheen of time that had presumably once served for evening use he spoke with the slowness helplessly permitted to americansas something too slow to be stoppedand he repeated that he found himself associated with miss cutter in a harmony calling for wonder she had been telling him not only that she couldnt possibly give him ten pounds but that his unexpected arrival should he insist on being much in view might seriously interfere with arrangements necessary to her own maintenance on which he had begun by replying that he of course knew she had long ago spent her money but that he looked to her now exactly because she had without the aid of that convenience mastered the art of life  id really go away with a fiver my dear if youd only tell me how you do it its no use saying only as youve always said that people are very kind to you what the devil are they kind to you for  well one reason is precisely that no particular inconvenience has hitherto been supposed to attach to me im just what i am said mamie cutter nothing less and nothing more its awkward to have to explain to you which moreover i really neednt in the least im clever and amusing and charming she was uneasy and even frightened but she kept her temper and met him with a grace of her own i dont think you ought to ask me more questions than i ask you  ah my dear said the odd young man ive no mysteries why in the world since it was what you came out for and have devoted so much of your time to havent you pulled it off why havent you married  why havent you she retorted do you think that if i had it would have been better for youthat my husband would for a moment have put up with you do you mind my asking you if youll kindly go now she went on after a glance at the clock im expecting a friend whom i must see alone on a matter of great importance  and my being seen with you may compromise your respectability or undermine your nerve he sprawled imperturbably in his place crossing again in another sense his long black legs and showing above his low shoes an absurd reach of particoloured sock i take your point well enough but maynt you be after all quite wrong if you cant do anything for me couldnt you at least do something with me if it comes to that im clever and amusing and charming too ive been such an ass that you dont appreciate me but people like mei assure you they do they usually dont know what an ass ive been they only see the surface whichand he stretched himself afresh as she looked him up and downyou can imagine them cant you rather taken with im what i am too nothing less and nothing more thats true of us as a family you see we are a crew he delivered himself serenely his voice was soft and flat his pleasant eyes his simple tones tending to the solemn achieved at moments that effect of quaintness which is in certain connexions socially so known and enjoyed english people have quite a weakness for memore than any others i get on with them beautifully ive always been with them abroad they think me the young man explained diabolically american  you such stupidity drew from her a sigh of compassion  her companion apparently quite understood it are you homesick mamie he asked with wondering irrelevance  the manner of the question made her for some reason in spite of her preoccupations break into a laugh a shade of indulgence a sense of other things came back to her you are funny scott  well remarked scott thats just what i claim but are you so homesick he spaciously inquired not as to a practical end but from an easy play of intelligence  im just dying of it said mamie cutter  why so am i her visitor had a sweetness of concurrence  were the only decent people miss cutter declared and i know you dontyou cant and i cant explain come in she continued with a return of her impatience and an increase of her decision at seven sharp  she had quitted her seat some time before and now to get him into motion hovered before him while still motionless he looked up at her something intimate in the silence appeared to pass between thema community of fatigue and failure and after all of intelligence there was a final cynical humour in it it determined him in any case at last and he slowly rose taking in again as he stood there the testimony of the room he might have been counting the photographs but he looked at the flowers with detachment whos coming  mrs medwin  american  dear no  then what are you doing for her  i work for every one she promptly returned  for every one who pays so i suppose yet isnt it only we who do pay  there was a drollery not lost on her in the way his queer presence lent itself to his emphasised plural  do you consider that you do  at this with his deliberation he came back to his charming idea only try me and see if i cant be made to work me in on her sharply presenting her back he stared a little at the clock if i come at seven may i stay to dinner  it brought her round again impossible im dining out  with whom  she had to think with lord considine  oh my eye scott exclaimed  she looked at him gloomily is that sort of tone what makes you pay i think you might understand she went on that if youre to sponge on me successfully you mustnt ruin me i must have some remote resemblance to a lady  yes but why must i her exasperated silence was full of answers of which however his inimitable manner took no account you dont understand my real strength i doubt if you even understand your own youre clever mamie but youre not so clever as i supposed however he pursued its out of mrs medwin that youll get it  get what  why the cheque that will enable you to assist me  on this for a moment she met his eyes if youll come back at seven sharpnot a minute before and not a minute after ill give you two fivepound notes  he thought it over whom are you expecting a minute after  it sent her to the window with a groan almost of anguish and she answered nothing till she had looked at the street if you injure me you know scott youll be sorry  i wouldnt injure you for the world what i want to do in fact is really to help you and i promise you that i wont leave youby which i mean wont leave londontill ive effected something really pleasant for you i like you mamie because i like pluck i like you much more than you like me i like you very very much he had at last with this reached the door and opened it but he remained with his hand on the latch what does mrs medwin want of you he thus brought out  she had come round to see him disappear and in the relief of this prospect she again just indulged him  the impossible  he waited another minute and youre going to do it  im going to do it said mamie cutter  well then that ought to be a haul call it three fivers he laughed at seven sharp and at last he left her alone     chapter ii   miss cutter waited till she heard the housedoor close after which in a sightless mechanical way she moved about the room readjusting various objects he had not touched it was as if his mere voice and accent had spoiled her form but she was not left too long to reckon with these things for mrs medwin was promptly announced this lady was not more than her hostess in the first flush of her youth her appearancethe scattered remains of beauty manipulated by tasteresembled one of the light repasts in which the fragments of yesterdays dinner figure with a conscious ease that makes up for the want of presence she was perhaps of an effect still too immediate to be called interesting but she was candid gentle and surprisednot fatiguingly surprised only just in the right degree and her white faceit was too whitewith the fixed eyes the somewhat touzled hair and the louis seize hat might at the end of the very long neck have suggested the head of a princess carried on a pike in a revolution she immediately took up the business that had brought her with the air however of drawing from the omens then discernible less confidence than she had hoped the complication lay in the fact that if it was mamies part to present the omens that lady yet had so to colour them as to make her own service large she perhaps overcoloured for her friend gave way to momentary despair  what you mean is then that its simply impossible  oh no said mamie with a qualified emphasis its possible  but disgustingly difficult  as difficult as you like  then what can i do that i havent done  you can only wait a little longer  but thats just what i have done ive done nothing else im always waiting a little longer  miss cutter retained in spite of this pathos her grasp of the subject the thing as ive told you is for you first to be seen  but if people wont look at me  they will  they will mrs medwin was eager  they shall her hostess went on its their only having heardwithout having seen  but if they stare straight the other way mrs medwin continued to object you cant simply go up to them and twist their heads about  its just what i can said mamie cutter  but her charming visitor heedless for the moment of this attenuation had found the way to put it its the old story you cant go into the water till you swim and you cant swim till you go into the water i cant be spoken to till im seen but i cant be seen till im spoken to  she met this lucidity miss cutter with but an instants lapse you say i cant twist their heads about but i have twisted them  it had been quietly produced but it gave her companion a jerk they say yes  she summed it up all but one she says no  mrs medwin thought then jumped lady wantridge  miss cutter as more delicate only bowed admission i shall see her either this afternoon or late tomorrow but she has written  her visitor wondered again may i see her letter  no she spoke with decision but i shall square her  then how  welland miss cutter as if looking upward for inspiration fixed her eyes a while on the ceilingwell it will come to me  mrs medwin watched herit was impressive and will they come to youthe others this question drew out the fact that they wouldso far at least as they consisted of lady edward lady bellhouse and mrs pouncer who had engaged to muster at the signal of tea on the 14thprepared as it were for the worst there was of course always the chance that lady wantridge might take the field in such force as to paralyse them though that danger at the same time seemed inconsistent with her being squared it didnt perhaps all quite ideally hang together but what it sufficiently came to was that if she was the one who could do most for a person in mrs medwins position she was also the one who could do most against it would therefore be distinctly what our friend familiarly spoke of as collarwork the effect of these mixed considerations was at any rate that mamie eventually acquiesced in the idea handsomely thrown out by her client that she should have an advance to go on with miss cutter confessed that it seemed at times as if one scarce could go on but the advance was in spite of this delicacy still more delicately mademade in the form of a banknote several sovereigns some loose silver and two coppers the whole contents of her purse neatly disposed by mrs medwin on one of the tiny tables it seemed to clear the air for deeper intimacies the fruit of which was that mamie lonely after all in her crowd and always more helpful than helped eventually brought out that the way scott had been going on was what seemed momentarily to overshadow her own power to do so  ive had a descent from him but she had to explain my halfbrotherscott homer a wretch  what kind of a wretch  every kind i lose sight of him at timeshe disappears abroad but he always turns up again worse than ever  violent  no  maudlin  no  only unpleasant  no rather pleasant awfully cleverawfully travelled and easy  then whats the matter with him  mamie mused hesitatedseemed to see a wide past i dont know  something in the background then as her friend was silent something queer about cards mrs medwin threw off  i dont knowand i dont want to  ah well im sure i dont mrs medwin returned with spirit the note of sharpness was perhaps also a little in the observation she made as she gathered herself to go do you mind my saying something  mamie took her eyes quickly from the money on the little stand you may say what you like  i only mean that anything awkward you may have to keep out of the way does seem to make more wonderful doesnt it that you should have got just where you are i allude you know to your position  i see miss cutter somewhat coldly smiled to my power  so awfully remarkable in an american  ah you like us so  mrs medwin candidly considered but we dont dearest  her companions smile brightened then why do you come to me  oh i like you mrs medwin made out  then thats it there are no americans its always you  me mrs medwin looked lovely but a little muddled  me mamie cutter laughed but if you like me you dear thing you can judge if i like you she gave her a kiss to dismiss her ill see you again when ive seen her  lady wantridge i hope so indeed ill turn up late tomorrow if you dont catch me first has it come to you yet the visitor now at the door went on  no but it will theres time  oh a little less every day  miss cutter had approached the table and glanced again at the gold and silver and the note not indeed absolutely overlooking the two coppers the balance she put it the day after  that very night if you like  then count on me  oh if i didnt but the door closed on the dark idea yearningly then and only when it had done so miss cutter took up the money  she went out with it ten minutes later and the calls on her time being many remained out so long that at halfpast six she hadnt come back at that hour on the other hand scott homer knocked at her door where her maid who opened it with a weak pretence of holding it firm ventured to announce to him as a lesson well learnt that he hadnt been expected till seven no lesson none the less could prevail against his native art he pleaded fatigue her the maids dreadful depressing london and the need to curl up somewhere if shed just leave him quiet half an hour that old sofa upstairs would do for it of which he took quickly such effectual possession that when five minutes later she peeped nervous for her broken vow into the drawingroom the faithless young woman found him extended at his length and peacefully asleep     chapter iii   the situation before miss cutters return developed in other directions still and when that event took place at a few minutes past seven these circumstances were by the foot of the stair between mistress and maid the subject of some interrogative gasps and scared admissions lady wantridge had arrived shortly after the interloper and wishing as she said to wait had gone straight up in spite of being told he was lying down  she distinctly understood he was there  oh yes maam i thought it right to mention  and what did you call him  well maam i thought it unfair to you to call him anything but a gentleman  mamie took it all in though there might well be more of it than one could quickly embrace but if she has had time she flashed to find out he isnt one  oh maam she had a quarter of an hour  then she isnt with him still  no maam she came down again at last she rang and i saw her here and she said she wouldnt wait longer  miss cutter darkly mused yet had already waited  quite a quarter  mercy on us she began to mount before reaching the top however she had reflected that quite a quarter was long if lady wantridge had only been shocked on the other hand it was short if she had only been pleased but how could she have been pleased the very essence of their actual crisis was just that there was no pleasing her mamie had but to open the drawingroom door indeed to perceive that this was not true at least of scott homer who was horribly cheerful  miss cutter expressed to her brother without reserve her sense of the constitutional the brutal selfishness that had determined his mistimed return it had taken place in violation of their agreement exactly at the moment when it was most cruel to her that he should be there and if she must now completely wash her hands of him he had only himself to thank she had come in flushed with resentment and for a moment had been voluble but it would have been striking that though the way he received her might have seemed but to aggravate it presently justified him by causing their relation really to take a stride he had the art of confounding those who would quarrel with him by reducing them to the humiliation of a stirred curiosity  what could she have made of you mamie demanded  my dear girl shes not a woman whos eager to make too much of anythinganything i mean that will prevent her from doing as she likes what she takes into her head of course he continued to explain if its something she doesnt want to do shell make as much as moses  mamie wondered if that was the way he talked to her visitor but felt obliged to own to his acuteness it was an exact description of lady wantridge and she was conscious of tucking it away for future use in a corner of her miscellaneous little mind she withheld however all present acknowledgment only addressing him another question did you really get on with her  have you still to learn darlingi cant help again putting it to youthat i get on with everybody thats just what i dont seem able to drive into you only see how i get on with you  she almost stood corrected what i mean is of course whether  whether she made love to me shyly yetor becauseshamefully she would certainly have liked awfully to stay  then why didnt she  because on account of some other matterand i could see it was trueshe hadnt time twenty minutesshe was here lesswere all she came to give you so dont be afraid ive frightened her away shell come back  mamie thought it over yet you didnt go with her to the door  she wouldnt let me and i know when to do what im toldquite as much as what im not told she wanted to find out about me i mean from your little creature a pearl of fidelity by the way  but what on earth did she come up for mamie again found herself appealing and just by that fact showing her need of help  because she always goes up then as in the presence of this rapid generalisation to say nothing of that of such a relative altogether miss cutter could only show as comparatively blank i mean she knows when to go up and when to come down she has instincts she didnt know whom you might have up here its a kind of compliment to you anyway why mamie scott pursued you dont know the curiosity we any of us inspire you wouldnt believe what ive seen the bigger bugs they are the more theyre on the lookout  mamie still followed but at a distance the lookout for what  why for anything that will help them to live youve been here all this time without making out then about them what ive had to pick out as i can theyre dead dont you see and were alive  you ohmamie almost laughed about it  well theyre a wornout old lot anyhow theyve used up their resources they do look out and ill do them the justice to say theyre not afraidnot even of me he continued as his sister again showed something of the same irony lady wantridge at any rate wasnt thats what i mean by her having made love to me she does what she likes mind it you know he was by this time fairly teaching her to read one of her best friends and when after it he had come back to the great point of his lessonthat of her failure through feminine inferiority practically to grasp the truth that their being just as they were he and she was the real card for them to playwhen he had renewed that reminder he left her absolutely in a state of dependence her impulse to press him on the subject of lady wantridge dropped it was as if she had felt that whatever had taken place something would somehow come of it she was to be in a manner disappointed but the impression helped to keep her over to the next morning when as scott had foretold his new acquaintance did reappear explaining to miss cutter that she had acted the day before to gain time and that she even now sought to gain it by not waiting longer what she promptly intimated she had asked herself could that friend be thinking of she must show where she stood before things had gone too far if she had brought her answer without more delay she wished to make it sharp mrs medwin never no my dearnot i there i stop  mamie had known it would be collarwork but somehow now at the beginning she felt her heart sink it was not that she had expected to carry the position with a rush but that as always after an interval her visitors defences really loomedand quite as it were to the material visiontoo large she was always planted with them voluminous in the very centre of the passage was like a person accommodated with a chair in some unlawful place at the theatre she wouldnt move and you couldnt get round mamies calculation indeed had not been on getting round she was obliged to recognise that too foolishly and fondly she had dreamed of inducing a surrender her dream had been the fruit of her need but conscious that she was even yet unequipped for pressure she felt almost for the first time in her life superficial and crude she was to be paidbut with what was she to that end to pay she had engaged to find an answer to this question but the answer had not according to her promise come and lady wantridge meanwhile massed herself and there was no view of her that didnt show her as verily by some process too obscure to be traced the hard depository of the social law she was no younger no fresher no stronger really than any of them she was only with a kind of haggard fineness a sharpened taste for life and with all sorts of things behind and beneath her more abysmal and more immoral more secure and more impertinent the points she made were two in number one was that she absolutely declined the other was that she quite doubted if mamie herself had measured the job the thing couldnt be done but say it could be was mamie quite the person to do it to this miss cutter with a sweet smile replied that she quite understood how little she might seem so im only one of the persons to whom it has appeared that you are  then who are the others  well to begin with lady edward lady bellhouse and mrs pouncer  do you mean that theyll come to meet her  ive seen them and theyve promised  to come of course lady wantridge said if i come  her hostess cast about oh of course you could prevent them but i should take it as awfully kind of you not to wont you do this for me mamie pleaded  her friend looked over the room very much as scott had done do they really understand what its for  perfectly so that she may call  and what good will that do her  miss cutter faltered but she presently brought it out naturally what one hopes is that youll ask her  ask her to call  ask her to dine ask her if youd be so truly sweet for a sunday or something of that sort and even if only in one of your most mixed parties to catchmore  miss cutter felt the less hopeful after this effort in that her companion only showed a strange good nature and it wasnt a satiric amiability though it was amusement take mrs medwin into my family  some day when youre taking forty others  ah but what i dont see is what it does for you youre already so welcome among us that you can scarcely improve your position even by forming for us the most delightful relation  well i know how dear you are mamie cutter replied but one has after all more than one side and more than one sympathy i like her you know and even at this lady wantridge wasnt shocked she showed that ease and blandness which were her way unfortunately of being most impossible she remarked that she might listen to such things because she was clever enough for them not to matter only mamie should take care how she went about saying them at large when she became definite however in a minute on the subject of the public facts miss cutter soon found herself ready to make her own concession of course she didnt dispute them there they were they were unfortunately on record and nothing was to be done about them but tomamie found it in truth at this point a little difficult  well what pretend already to have forgotten them  why not when youve done it in so many other cases  there are no other cases so bad one meets them at any rate as they come some you can manage others you cant its no use you must give them up theyre past patching theres nothing to be done with them theres nothing accordingly to be done with mrs medwin but to put her off and lady wantridge rose to her height  well you know i do do things mamie quavered with a smile so strained that it partook of exaltation  you help people oh yes ive known you to do wonders but stick said lady wantridge with strong and cheerful emphasis to your americans  miss cutter gazing got up you dont do justice lady wantridge to your own compatriots some of them are really charming besides said mamie working for mine often strikes me so far as the interestthe inspiration and excitement dont you knowgo as rather too easy you all as i constantly have occasion to say like us so  her companion frankly weighed it yes it takes that to account for your position ive always thought of you nevertheless as keeping for their benefit a regular working agency they come to you and you place them there remains i confess her ladyship went on in the same free spirit the great wonder  of how i first placed my poor little self yes mamie bravely conceded when i began there was no agency i just worked my passage i didnt even come to you did i you never noticed me till as mrs short stokes says i was way way up mrs medwin she threw in cant get over it then as her friend looked vague over my social situation  well its no great flattery to you to say lady wantridge goodhumouredly returned that she certainly cant hope for one resembling it yet it really seemed to spread there before them you simply made mrs short stokes  in spite of her name mamie smiled  oh your names in spite of everything  ah im something of an artist with which and a relapse marked by her wistful eyes into the gravity of the matter she supremely fixed her friend she felt how little she minded betraying at last the extremity of her need and it was out of this extremity that her appeal proceeded have i really had your last word it means so much to me  lady wantridge came straight to the point you mean you depend on it  awfully  is it all you have  all now  but mrs short stokes and the othersrolling arent they dont they pay up  ah sighed mamie if it wasnt for them  lady wantridge perceived youve had so much  i couldnt have gone on  then what do you do with it all  oh most of it goes back to them there are all sorts and its all help some of them have nothing  oh if you feed the hungry lady wantridge laughed youre indeed in a great way of business is mrs medwinher transition was immediatereally rich  really he left her everything  so that if i do say yes  it will quite set me up  i seeand how much more responsible it makes one but id rather myself give you the money  oh mamie coldly murmured  you mean i maynt suspect your prices well i daresay i dont but id rather give you ten pounds  oh mamie repeated in a tone that sufficiently covered her prices the question was in every way larger do you never forgive she reproachfully inquired the door opened however at the moment she spoke and scott homer presented himself     chapter iv   scott homer wore exactly to his sisters eyes the aspect he had worn the day before and it also formed to her sense the great feature of his impartial greeting  how dye do mamie how dye do lady wantridge  how dye do again lady wantridge replied with an equanimity striking to her hostess it was as if scotts own had been contagious it was almost indeed as if she had seen him before had she ever so seen himbefore the previous day while miss cutter put to herself this question her visitor at all events met the one she had previously uttered ever forgive this personage echoed in a tone that made as little account as possible of the interruption dear yes the people i have forgiven she laughedperhaps a little nervously and she was now looking at scott the way she looked at him was precisely what had already had its effect for his sister the people i can  can you forgive me asked scott homer  she took it so easily butwhat  mamie interposed she turned directly to her brother dont try her leave it so she had had an inspiration it was the most extraordinary thing in the world dont try himshe had turned to their companion she looked grave sad strange leave it so yes it was a distinct inspiration which she couldnt have explained but which had come prompted by something she had caughtthe extent of the recognition expressedin lady wantridges face it had come absolutely of a sudden straight out of the opposition of the two figures before herquite as if a concussion had struck a light the light was helped by her quickened sense that her friends silence on the incident of the day before showed some sort of consciousness she looked surprised do you know my brother  do i know you lady wantridge asked of him  no lady wantridge scott pleasantly confessed not one little mite  well then if you must go and mamie offered her a hand but ill go down with you not you she launched at her brother who immediately effaced himself his way of doing soand he had already done so as for lady wantridge in respect to their previous encounterstruck her even at the moment as an instinctive if slightly blind tribute to her possession of an idea and as such in its celerity made her so admire him and their common wit that she on the spot more than forgave him his queerness he was right he could be as queer as he liked the queerer the better it was at the foot of the stairs when she had got her guest down that what she had assured mrs medwin would come did indeed come did you meet him here yesterday  dear yes isnt he too funny  yes said mamie gloomily he is funny but had you ever met him before  dear no  ohand mamies tone might have meant many things  lady wantridge however after all easily overlooked it i only knew he was one of your odd americans thats why when i heard yesterday here that he was up there awaiting your return i didnt let that prevent me i thought he might be he certainly her ladyship laughed is  yes hes very american mamie went on in the same way  as you say we are fond of you goodbye said lady wantridge  but mamie had not half done with her she felt more and moreor she hoped at leastthat she looked strange she was no doubt if it came to that strange lady wantridge she almost convulsively broke out i dont know whether youll understand me but i seem to feel that i must act with youi dont know what to call itresponsibly he is my brother  surelyand why not lady wantridge stared hes the image of you  thank youand mamie was stranger than ever  oh hes goodlooking hes handsome my dear oddlybut distinctly her ladyship was for treating it much as a joke  but mamie all sombre would have none of this she boldly gave him up i think hes awful  he is indeeddelightfully and where do you get your ways of saying things it isnt anythingand the things arent anything but its so droll  dont let yourself all the same mamie consistently pursued be carried away by it the thing cant be donesimply  lady wantridge wondered done simply  done at all  but what cant be  why what you might thinkfrom his pleasantness what he spoke of your doing for him  lady wantridge recalled forgiving him  he asked you if you couldnt but you cant its too dreadful for me as so near a relation to have loyallyloyally to youto say it but hes impossible  it was so portentously produced that her ladyship had somehow to meet it whats the matter with him  i dont know  then whats the matter with you lady wantridge inquired  its because i wont know mamienot without dignityexplained  then i wont either  precisely dont its something mamie pursued with some inconsequence thatsomewhere or other at some time or otherhe appears to have done something that has made a difference in his life  something lady wantridge echoed again what kind of thing  mamie looked up at the light above the door through which the london sky was doubly dim i havent the least idea  then what kind of difference  mamies gaze was still at the light the difference you see  lady wantridge rather obligingly seemed to ask herself what she saw but i dont see any it seems at least she added such an amusing one and he has such nice eyes  oh dear eyes mamie conceded but with too much sadness for the moment about the connexions of the subject to say more  it almost forced her companion after an instant to proceed do you mean he cant go home  she weighed her responsibility i only make outmores the pitythat he doesnt  is it then something too terrible  she thought again i dont know whatfor menis too terrible  well then as you dont know what is for women eithergoodbye her visitor laughed  it practically wound up the interview which however terminating thus on a considerable stir of the air was to give miss cutter for several days the sense of being much blown about the degree to which to begin with she had been drawnor perhaps rather pushedcloser to scott was marked in the brief colloquy that she on her friends departure had with him he had immediately said it youll see if she doesnt ask me down  so soon  oh ive known them at placesat cannes at pau at shanghaido it sooner still i always know when they will you cant make out they dont love me he spoke almost plaintively as if he wished she could  then i dont see why it hasnt done you more good  why mamie he patiently reasoned what more good could it as i tell you he explained it has just been my life  then why do you come to me for money  oh they dont give me that scott returned  so that it only means then after all that i at the best must keep you up  he fixed on her the nice eyes lady wantridge admired do you mean to tell me that alreadyat this very momentim not distinctly keeping you  she gave him back his look wait till she has asked you and then mamie added decline  scott not too grossly wondered as acting for you  mamies next injunction was answer enough but beforeyescall  he took it in callbut decline good  the rest she said i leave to you and she left it in fact with such confidence that for a couple of days she was not only conscious of no need to give mrs medwin another turn of the screw but positively evaded in her fortitude the reappearance of that lady it was not till the fourth day that she waited upon her finding her as she had expected tense  lady wantridge will  yes though she says she wont  she says she wont ooh mrs medwin moaned  sit tight all the same i have her  but how  through scottwhom she wants  your bad brother mrs medwin stared what does she want of him  to amuse them at catchmore anything for that and he would but he shant mamie declared he shant go unless she comes she must meet you firstyoure my condition  oooh mrs medwins tone was a wonder of hope and fear but doesnt he want to go  he wants what i want she draws the line at you i draw the line at him  but shedoesnt she mind that hes bad  it was so artless that mamie laughed noit doesnt touch her besides perhaps he isnt it isnt as for youpeople seem not to know he has settled everything at all events by going to see her its before her that hes the thing shell have to have  have to  for sundays in the country a featurethe feature  so she has asked him  yesand he has declined  for me mrs medwin panted  for me said mamie on the doorstep but i dont leave him for long her hansom had waited shell come  lady wantridge did come she met in south audley street on the fourteenth at tea the ladies whom mamie had named to her together with three or four others and it was rather a masterstroke for miss cutter that if mrs medwin was modestly present scott homer was as markedly not this occasion however is a medal that would take rare casting as would also for that matter even the minor light and shade the lower relief of the pecuniary transaction that mrs medwins flushed gratitude scarce awaited the dispersal of the company munificently to complete a new understanding indeed on the spot rebounded from it the conception of which in mamies mind had promptly bloomed he shant go now unless he takes you then as her fancy always moved quicker for her client than her clients owndown with him to catchmore when he goes to amuse them you she serenely developed shall amuse them too mrs medwins response was again rather oddly divided but she was sufficiently intelligible when it came to meeting the hint that this latter provision would represent success to the tune of a separate fee say mamie had suggested the same  very well the same  the knowledge that it was to be the same had perhaps something to do also with the obliging spirit in which scott eventually went it was all at the last rather hurrieda party rapidly got together for the grand duke who was in england but for the hour who had goodnaturedly proposed himself and who liked his parties small intimate and funny this one was of the smallest and was finally judged to conform neither too little nor too much to the other conditionsafter a brief whirlwind of wires and counterwires and an iterated waiting of hansoms at various doorsto include mrs medwin it was from catchmore itself that snatching a momenton the wondrous sunday afternoon this lady had the harmonious thought of sending the new cheque she was in bliss enough but her scribble none the less intimated that it was scott who amused them most he was the feature
