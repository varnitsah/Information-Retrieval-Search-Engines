forms the third volume of the bound to succeed series like the preceding tales this story is complete in itself  the rush to the faraway territory of alaska when gold in large quantities was discovered upon klondike creek was somewhat similar to the rush to california in years gone by the gold fever spread to even the remotest of our hamlets and men young and old poured forth ready to endure every hardship if only the muchcoveted prize might be secured that many succeeded and that many more failed is now a matter of history although of recent date  in this story are related the adventures of two maine boys who leave their home among the lumbermen travel to california there to join their uncle an experienced miner and several other men and start on the long trip to the klondike by way of dyea chilkoot pass and the lakes and streams forming the headwaters of the mighty yukon river after many perils the gold district is reached and here a summer and winter are passed the former in hunting for the precious metal and the latter in a never ending struggle to sustain life until the advent of spring  in writing the description of this new el dorado the author has endeavored to be as accurate as possible and has consulted for this purpose the leading authorities on alaska and its resources as well as digested the sometimes tedious but nevertheless always interesting government reports covering this subject regarding the personal experiences of his heroes he would add that nearly every incident cited has been taken from life as narrated by those who joined in the frenzied rush to the new gold fields    edward stratemeyer    newark n j   april 1 1899     contents     chapter                                               page         i a letter

prisoner please                    196     to alaska for gold     chapter i  a letter from the west   it is not a question of what we should like to do randy it is a question of what we must do  i know it earl one thing is certain the way matters stand we cant pay the quarters rent for this timber land tomorrow unless we borrow the money and where we are going for it i havent the least idea  nor i its a pity the jackson lumber company had to go to pieces i wonder where jackson is  in canada most likely they would put him in jail if they could catch him and he knows it  he ought to be put in jail burst out earl who was the elder of the two portney brothers that two hundred dollars he cheated us out of would just put us on our feet but without it we cant even pay bills now owing and caleb norcross is just aching to sell this land to dan roland  if we have to get out what are we to do questioned randy soberly i dont believe we can get work unless we go into the woods as mere  choppers  we shall have to do something was earls unsatisfactory response  the portney brothers lived upon a small timber claim in the state of maine their parents had died three years before from injuries received in a terrible forest fire which had at that time swept the locality the family had never been rich and after the sad affair the boys were left to shift for themselves the father had owned an interest in a timber claim and this had been sold for three hundred dollars and with the proceeds the two brothers had rented another claim and gone to work to get out lumber for a new company which had begun operations in the vicinity  earl was now eighteen years of age and randolph or randy as he was always called was nearly seventeen both lads were so tall wellbuilt and muscular that they appeared older neither had had a real sickness in his life and the pair were admirably calculated physically to cope with the hardships which came to them later  the collapse of the new lumber combination and the running away of its head man aaron jackson had proved a serious blow to their prospects as has been intimated the company owed them two hundred dollars for timber and as not a cent was forthcoming they found themselves in debt not only for the quarters rent for the land they were working but also at the general supply store at the village of basco three miles away the boys had worked hard early and late to make both ends meet and it certainly looked as if they did not deserve the hard luck which had befallen them  it was supper time and the pair had just finished a scanty meal of beans bread and the remains of a brook trout randy had been lucky enough to catch before breakfast randy threw himself down on the doorstep while earl washed and dried the few dishes  i wonder if we cant get something out of the lumber company mused the younger brother as he gazed meditatively at his boots which were sadly in need of soling and heeling theyve lots of timber on hand  all covered by a mortgage to some boston concern replied earl i asked squire dobson about it he said we shouldnt get a penny  humph randy drew a deep breath by the way has squire dobson learned anything about fred yet  hes pretty sure fred ran away to new york  i cant understand why he should run away from such a good home can you you wouldnt catch me doing it  he ran away because he didnt want to finish studying fred always was a wild dick i shouldnt wonder if he ended up by going out west to hunt indians earl gave a short laugh hell have his eyeteeth cut one of these days hullo here comes caleb norcross now  earl was looking up the winding road through the woods and gazing in the direction randy saw a tall lean individual astride a bony horse riding swiftly toward the cabin  well boys whats the best word was the sharp greeting given by caleb norcross as he came to a halt at the cabin door  i dont know as there is any best word mr norcross replied earl quietly  i was over to bill stigers place and thought if i could see you tonight about the rent money it would save you a three miles trip tomorrow  you know we cant pay you just at present mr norcross went on earl the suspension of the lumber company has left us in the lurch  the face of the tall lean man darkened how much did they stick you for he asked abruptly  two hundred dollars  two hundred dollars you were fools to trust em that much i wouldnt have trusted em a centnot a penny  they were well recommended put in randy even squire dobson trusted them  that dont make no difference i dont trust folks unless i know what im doing although i did trust you boys added caleb norcross hastily your father was always a straight man  and we are straight too burst out randy stung by the insinuation you shall have your money if only you will give us a little time  how are you going to get it  well earn it said earl i am sure we can get out enough timber by fall to square accounts  that wont do for menot at all if you cant pay up tomorrow you can consider your claim on the land at an end  you wont give us any time  no i can sell this whole section to dan roland and im going to do it  you are very hardhearted mr norcross began randy when a look from his elder brother silenced him  i aint hardheartedim only looking after my own growled caleb norcross if i let things run id do as the lumber company didbust up so you cant pay nohow  no we cant pay answered earl  then ill expect you to quit by tomorrow noon  without waiting for another word caleb norcross turned around his bony steed and urged him forward in less than a minute he had disappeared in the direction whence he had come with sinking hearts the boys watched him out of sight  the blow they had dreaded had fallen and for several seconds neither spoke then randy who had pulled off one boot flung it across the kitchen floor  i dont care he can have his old place he cried angrily well never get rich here if we stay a hundred years im sick and tired of cutting timber just for ones meals  its all well enough to talk so randy was the elder brothers cautious response but where are we to go if we leave here  oh anywhere we might try our luck down in bangor or maybe boston  earl smiled faintly wed cut pretty figures in a city im thinking after a life in the backwoods  a backwoods boy became president  do you wish to try for the presidency  no but it shows what can be done and im tired of drudging in the woods without any excitement or anything new from one years end to another father and mother gave us pretty good educations and we ought to make the most of that  i knew he wanted to sell this land to dan roland went on earl after a pause i fancy he is going to get a good price too  if roland pays over five hundred dollars he will get cheated the timber at the south end is good for nothing  the boys entered the cabin lit the lamp and sat down to discuss the situation it was far from promising and an hour later each retired to bed in a very uneasy frame of mind they were up before daybreak and at breakfast earl announced his intention to go to basco and see what could be done  you might as well stay at home he continued it may be norcross will come back and reconsider matters  not he exclaimed randy nevertheless he promised to remain and look over some clothing which needed mending for these sturdy lads were in the habit of doing everything for themselves even to sewing up rents and darning socks such are the necessities of real life in the backwoods  it was a bright sunny morning well calculated to cheer any ones spirits yet randy felt far from lighthearted when left alone he could not help but wonder what would happen next  weve got just twentyeight dollars and a half in cash left he mused as he set to work to replace some buttons on one of earls working shirts and we owe about six dollars at the general store three dollars and a quarter for those new axes and the coffee mill and twenty to norcross heighho but its hard lines to be poor with ones nose continually to the grindstone i wonder if we shouldnt have done better if we had struck out as uncle foster did six years ago he has seen a lot of the world and made money besides  earl had expected to be gone the best part of the forenoon and randy was surprised at halfpast nine to see his elder brother returning from the village earl was walking along the road at the top of his speed and as he drew closer he held up a letter  its a letter from uncle foster he cried as soon as he was within speaking distance its got such wonderful news in it that i thought i ought to come home with it at once  wonderful news repeated randy what does he say  he says he is going back to alaskato some new gold field that has just been discovered thereand he wants to know if we will go with him     chapter ii  the boys reach a decision   uncle foster is going back to alaska said randy slowly  yes he is going to start almost immediately too added his elder brother he says the new gold diggings are something immense and he wants to stake a claim at the earliest possible date  randy drew a long breath to alaska what a tremendous trip that would befive thousand miles at least and going to such an almost unknown region would be very much like starting for the north pole  he remembered well that his uncle foster had paid a visit to alaska three years previous sailing from san francisco to st michaels island and then taking a yukon river steamboat to a trading camp known as fort cudahy they had received several letters from him while he was up there working for the alaskan transportation company part of the time and hunting for gold whenever the opportunity offered the letters had told of the intense cold and the suffering and of numerous unsuccessful attempts to strike a paying claim around fort cudahy and at another camp known as circle city his uncle had taken up several claims but they had not panned out very well and mr portney had finally returned to the united states to interest himself in a colorado silver mine  let me see the letter said randy and earl handed it over i dont see how we are to pay our way to alaska or anywhere else added the younger boy ruefully as he opened the epistle  you will see presently rejoined earl read it aloud uncle writes such a twisted hand i want to make sure i read aright and randy started at once  creede col april 5  my dear nephewsi suppose you have been looking for a letter from me all winter but the fact is i have been away from this vicinity since last december a man from british columbia wanted me to buy an interest in a gold mine at a settlement called dunbars and i went with him the mine proved to be worthless and i left dunbars and went to victoria and stayed there until three weeks ago  while i was in victoria i ran across two miners whom i had met while at fort cudahy in alaska they reported that a new gold field had been discovered farther up the yukon river at a place known as klondike creek there had been an exodus from circle city and fort cudahy to this new region and a camp known as dawson city had been started they said that there were about a dozen small creeks flowing into the klondike and into the yukon at this point and that it was reported and proved that the entire district was rich with gold  i was chary of believing the men at first for i know only too well how many wildcat reports start up in every mining camp but a couple of days later i heard another report from juneau alaska to the effect that several miners had come down from this same territory by way of the lakes and chilkoot pass and had brought with them over thirtyfive thousand dollars in nuggets and gold dust taken out of a place called hunkers creek which runs into the klondike  from these reports and from others which are floating around i am convinced that they have at last struck the rich vein of yellow metal which i always believed would be located there and i am now making preparations to try my luck again in that territory and if you two boys want to go along and think you can stand the climate which is something awful for nine months in the year ill see you through i do not know how you are fixed for cash but i have been lucky in colorado and i will pay all expenses providing you will agree to remain with me for two years working as i work for a onehalf interest in all our discoveriesthat is a onequarter interest to each of you and a onehalf interest to myself the expense of a years trip to alaska by the route we shall take over the mountain pass will be between six and eight hundred dollars each for we shall have to take nearly all our outfitsclothing tools and provisionsalong  i am now on the point of starting for san francisco and shall arrive there probably before this letter reaches you my address will be the palace hotel and i wish you to telegraph me immediately at my expense if you will go or not do not attempt to accept my offer unless both of you are perfectly well and strong and willing to stand great hardships for the sake of what we may have the good luck to find and if you do go dont blame me if we are all disappointed and come home poorer than we went  if you accept the offer i will telegraph you sufficient money to messrs bartwell  stone boston to pay your fare to san francisco and i shall expect to see you at the latter city before the 20th of the month for i am going to start for the new gold fields even if i have to go with strangers as soon as possible with love to you both i remain  your affectionate uncle  foster c portney  oh earl lets go burst from randys lips as he finished the long letter this is just what ive been waiting for lets go to alaska and make our fortunes  go to alaska and be frozen to death you mean replied earl yet he smiled even as he spoke do you know that the thermometer goes down to forty degrees below zero out there in winter  well were used to roughing it out here in these woods  these woods cant hold a candle to alaska for barrenness randy think of a winter nine months long and ice all the year round uncle said in one of his other letters that the ground never thawed out more than a few feet excepting in favored localities  do you mean to say youll let such a splendid chance slip by demanded the younger lad straightening up and looking his brother full in the face and let it slip too when were in such trouble here  no i didnt say that randy but we ought to consider the matter carefully before we make up our minds according to the letter well have to spend at least two years in the gold fields  ill spend ten if i can make money  uncle said in that other letter that no one seemed to care to stay in the upper portion of alaska more than two or three years at a time  well im in for the trip heart and soul hurrah for thewhats the name of that creekklondike hurrah for the klondike i wonder if its on the map  randy rushed over to the little shelf which contained all the schoolbooks the family had ever possessed and brought forth a large geography much the worse for wear there was no separate map of alaska but there was one of north america and this he scanned with interest  heres the yukon and heres the porcupine and the pelly rivers but i dont see any klondike he said seriously i wonder where it can be  you cant expect to find a little creek on a map that shows up the yukon river as less than two inches long said earl why the yukon is between two and three thousand miles long circle city must be up there he continued pointing to where the yukon touched the 144° of longitude and if thats so this new gold field cant be so very far off although in such a great territory a few hundred miles this way or that are hardly counted  but youll go wont you earl pleaded randy as he restored the geography to the shelf well never make more than our pork and beans out here in the woods  earl picked up a small stick from the fireplace and brought out his pocketknife he always had to go to whittling when he wanted to do some hard thinking if we accepted uncle fosters invitation to come to san francisco there would be no turning back he remarked after a moment of silence  we shouldnt want to turn back as soon as that  and we couldnt turn back after we once got into alaska there is no such thing as travelling back and forth between the months of october and may the rivers freeze up and everything is snow and ice  well wed have plenty of provisionsuncle would be sure to see to that weve got to vacate here you must remember in a day or two  again earl was silent he had sharpened up one end of the stick and now he turned to the other i wonder where we could telegraph from best he said at last  randys eyes lit up instantly and he caught his big brother by the shoulder good for you earl i knew you would say yes he cried why we can telegraph from spruceville cant we  we can if theyll trust us for the telegram  if they wont ill pay for it im not going to let such a chance slide by the thing of it is randy added sobering down suddenly how are we to get to boston to get the money uncle intends to send on  well have to sell off our things here theyll bring in something although not much  good i never thought of that  for two hours the boys talked matters over and in the excitement dinner was entirely forgotten then a telegram was prepared which ran as follows        will sell out and come on as soon as possible  it was agreed that earl should send the message from spruceville a town four miles beyond basco this was a seven miles tramp but he did not mind it having walked the distance many times previously he procured a bite to eat and with the letter from his uncle in his pocket he started off he intended to show the letter to the telegraph operator in case the man should hesitate to send the message with charges to be paid at the other end  at basco earl met a number of workmen of the district among whom was tom roland the brother of the lumberman who intended to buy the timber land from caleb norcross roland was a man whom nobody liked and earl passed him without a word although it was evident from rolands manner that the latter desired to stop for a talk with tom roland was a fellow named guardley a neerdowell who had been up before the squire on more than one occasion for drinking and stealing the reader will do well to remember both tom roland and guardley for they are destined to play a most important part in the chapters which follow  the middle of the afternoon had passed before earl struck the outskirts of spruceville and made his way to the little railroad station where was located the telegraph office his errand was soon explained to the young man in charge and he felt in his pocket to bring forth the slip of paper randy had written out and his uncles letter  to his consternation both were missing he remembered well where he had placed them yet to make sure he searched his clothing thoroughly his search was useless the message and the letter were gone     chapter iii  a false identification   gone  that was the single word which dropped from earls lips as he stood at the window of the telegraph office at spruceville and hunted for the missing letter from his uncle foster he cared nothing for the messagethat could easily be rewrittenbut the letter was highly important  not finding it about his person he commenced to retrace his steps with his eyes on the ground an hour was spent in this manner and then he returned slowly to the office  i want to send a message to san francisco and i had a letter with me to show that it was all right he explained will you send the message anyhow and collect at the other end the man who is to receive the message wanted it sent that way  the telegraph operator mused for a moment then he asked earl who he was and where he lived and finally said he guessed it would be all right the message was again written out and ten minutes later it was on its long journey westward by way of boston the business finished earl thanked the operator and started on his return home  he was very much out of sorts with himself and wondered what his younger brother would think of him i neednt find fault with randy for being careless after this he sighed almost bitterly im as bad as he is and worse one thing is a comfort though i remember the name of that boston firm that is to provide us with our moneybartwell  stone i had better make a note of that and he did  the evening shadows were beginning to fall when basco was again reached on the main street of the little town earl halted to think matters over why wouldnt it be a good thing to let folks know that they wanted to sell out their household goods and their tools and other things he made his way to the general store  well portney i heard you had been put off your place was the greeting received from the general storekeeper  we have not been put offwe are going to leave it mr andrews  oh where are you going  to alaska  alaska you must be joking  no sir my uncle foster portney has sent for randy and me to come to san francisco and the three of us are going to some new gold fields  well what about my bill asked the storekeeper anxiously he was interested in but little outside of his business of course that has got to be settled before you leave  we will pay up never fear but we want to sell off all our stuff first will you let me write out a notice to that effect and post it outside  yes you can do that going to sell off eh what have you got  earl enumerated the various articles he and randy had listed to sell they were not of great value and the storekeeper smiled grimly  they wont bring much  they ought to bring thirty or forty dollars  youll be lucky to get ten  ten dollars wont see us through we have got to get enough to pay our bills and secure our passage down to boston  and how much will that be questioned peleg andrews cautiously earl made a rapid calculation with the money already on hand and that owing for tools and groceries twentyfive dollars ought to see them through  we must have thirty dollars for the stuff  peleg andrews said no more but turned away to wait on a customer that had just come in procuring sheets of paper earl set to work and penned two notices both alike stating that the goods and chattels of the portney brothers would be sold within the next three days to the highest bidders and a list of the articles followed one of the notices was tacked up in front of the store and the other in front of the hotel and then earl returned home  as the big brother had expected randy was much put out about the loss of the letter but he was glad that earl had gone ahead nevertheless and before he retired that night he brought forth some of the articles to be sold and mended and cleaned them up  the two were eating breakfast when the first prospective buyer rode up in a farm wagon it was a lumberman from over the ridge behind basco who was thinking of settling down to cabin life by himself he made an offer of fifteen dollars for everything in sight but earl held out for forty dollars  the man was about to drive away when a second lumberman drove up followed by peleg andrews in his store wagon both of the newcomers were eager to buy although they affected indifference bidding became rather lively and at last the goods were split up between the first comer and the storekeeper the former paying thirty dollars and the latter twenty dollars for what they got this made fifty dollars in all and out of this amount earl settled with peleg andrews on the spot  it was while the men were loading the goods preparatory to taking them away that caleb norcross appeared he had expected to make a cheap purchase and was keenly disappointed to find he was too late  getting out eh he ventured  yes answered earl briefly you can have your keys in a couple of hours here is your money  i aint in any hurry grumbled the landlord  isnt dan roland going to take the property asked randy curiously  no he backed out last night answered caleb norcross and to avoid being questioned further he moved away  fortunately for the two boys there was an old trunk in the cabin and also a small wooden box which could be made to hold clothing and these they packed with such effects as they intended to take along a bargain was struck with the man who had failed to purchase any of the other goods and the two boxes were placed in his wagon and then the lads were ready to leave the spot which had been their home for many years  well im sure i wish you success said peleg andrews as he shook each by the hand but it looks foolhardy to megoing away off to alaska  youll be glad enough to come back home see if you dont put in caleb norcross he did not offer to shake hands at which the boys were just as well satisfied in a minute more the brothers were up beside the lumberman on the wagon seat the whip cracked and the horse started and the long trip to alaska could be said to have fairly begun  a stop was made at basco where earl settled up such bills as still remained unpaid and then the horse set off on a trot for spruceville which was reached less than threequarters of an hour later at the latter place a way train for bangor was due and they had barely time to procure tickets and get their baggage checked before it came along and took them on board  weve made a flying start and no mistake was randys comment as he leaned back in the cushioned seat two days ago we never dreamed of going to alaska or anywhere else  i hope we havent any cause to regret our hasty action answered earl gravely then he immediately brightened up but weve started now so let us make the most of it  the ride over the rough roads had made them hungry but they had to wait until bangor was reached before they could obtain anything to eat it was late in the evening when the train rolled into the station and they alighted both boys had been in bangor several times so they did not feel quite like strangers having obtained supper at a restaurant they made their way to the river docks and asked concerning the boat for boston having decided to make that trip by water the boat was in and having procured their passage they were privileged to go on board and sleep there overnight  the trip to boston was an uneventful one although full of novelty to earl and randy who had never taken such a voyage before they might have enjoyed it still more had they not been so anxious concerning what was before them alas little did they dream of all the grave perils the future held in store  we dont want to look too green said earl when the steamboat was tying up at her wharf and the passengers were preparing to go ashore  oh i guess well pass in a crowd said randy laughing all we want to look out for is that we are not robbed or something like that  leaving their baggage on check the two boys started from fosters wharf up into the city they had no idea where the firm of bartwell  stone were located but earl was certain they could easily be found by consulting a directory  the elder brother was on the point of entering a large store in quest of the book mentioned when randy pulled his arm and pointed down the street there goes a fire engine earl he cried lets follow it i should like to see how they manage a fire in a city  earl was willing and away they went easily keeping up with the engine which had to proceed slowly through the crowded thoroughfare the fire was in a paint and oil works and burnt fiercely for over an hour before it was gotten under control the boys lingered around watching the movements of the firemen with keen interest and it was two hours later before earl caught randy by the shoulder and hauled him out of the mob of people  remember were bound for alaska he said we cant afford to stop at every sight on the way  a few blocks further on a directory was found in a drug store and the address of bartwell  stone jotted down they lost no further time in hunting up the firm of bankers and brokers who occupied the ground floor of a substantial business structure  i am earl portney explained earl to the clerk who asked them what they wanted this is my brother randolph our uncle foster portney said he would send on some money for us from san francisco has it arrived yet  ill see was it a telegraph order  i suppose so  the clerk disappeared into an inner apartment to be gone several minutes when he came out he was accompanied by a tall sharpeyed man in rusty black  these are not the young men who called for the money said the man in rusty black there must be some mistake here  were the other men identified mr stone questioned the clerk while both randy and earl pricked up their ears  oh yes a clerk from johnstons restaurant identified them as earl and randolph portney besides they held the original letter which had been sent by their uncle foster portney from san francisco     chapter iv  a serious setback   earl and randy could scarcely believe their ears what was this gentleman in rusty black saying that two men had been identified as themselves and had called for the money sent on by their uncle foster  there is a mistake somewhere said the clerk turning to the brothers you say you are earl and randolph portney  we are both replied in a breath  two men were here not two hours ago and were identified as the ones to receive the money they had a letter from their uncle in which he wanted them to come to san francisco and join him in a trip to alaska  that letter was ours burst out earl i lost it a couple of days ago  the clerk turned to the elderly gentleman who looked more serious than ever  have you any idea who those men were asked the gentleman  they were a couple of thieves thats certain said randy bluntly the money was to come to us and nobody else  where did you lose that letter  i lost it on the road between naddy brook and spruceville replied earl and gave some of the particulars the full story of his uncles offer to randy and himself followed to which mr stone listened closely he was a fair judge of human nature and saw at once that the two boys were no sharpers and that their story was most likely true  well if you are the real portney brothers we are out exactly three hundred dollars he said after considerable talking i paid over that money in good faith too on the strength of the letter and the identification  we had nothing to do with that answered earl stoutly feeling he must stand up for his rights  of course not butjust wait here a few minutes and ill try to find that clerk from the restaurant who identified the rascals  mr stone put on a silk hat and went out to be gone nearly or quite half an hour he returned accompanied by another mana police officialto whom the particulars of the occurrence had been given  that identification was also part of the swindle the broker explained i could not find the clerk at the restaurant and i am convinced now that he was not the man he made me believe he was  but what about our money said earl coldly thinking the broker might try to shift the responsibility of the affair  if you can find some reliable party known to us to identify you i will pay the sum to you was the answer but ive got to be sure of the identification this timeand you cant blame me for that added the broker with a short laugh  no we cant blame you for that repeated earl yet at the same time wondering who there was in that strange city who knew them  i dont know of any one here who knows us put in randy reading his elder brothers thought i wish uncle had sent the money in some other way  see here put in the police official since those swindlers had the letter that was lost up near where you come from perhaps you know the men mr stone cant you describe them  as well as he was able the broker did so but the description was so indefinite that both earl and randy shook their heads  i know a dozen men who look a good deal like that description said the older brother its possible they were lumbermen like ourselves  yes they did look like lumbermen replied mr stone that is why i was not so particular about their identification  for another half hour the matter was talked over and then as it was getting time to close up the office for the day earl and randy left to find some one to identify them were such a thing possible at the corner of the block both halted  im blessed if i know what to do were randys words i cant think of a soul who knows us here  there used to be a man named curtis gordon who once lived at bascohe owned the feed mill there he came to boston and started a flour business but whether he would remember me is a question he hasnt seen me in about eight years  we might try himit would be better than nothing cried randy eagerly let us hunt him up in the directory  this was done and they found mr curtis gordons place of business after a search lasting over an hour several clerks were in attendance who supplied the information that mr gordon had gone to new york and would not be back for two days  stumped again murmured randy dismally did you ever see such luck  never give up answered earl as cheerfully as he could i wonder if mrs gordon lives in town  what if she does  id call on her and perhaps she can help us out she used to know me  from the clerks in the store they received the gordons home address it was a fine place on the back bay and it was nightfall by the time the boys reached it they were ushered into the waitinghall by a servant who immediately went off to notify her mistress who was at dinner  from the diningroom came a murmur of talking and one of the voices sounded strangely familiar to earl hark randy he whispered isnt that squire dobson speaking  it is ejaculated randy we are saved at last  mrs gordon came to them a minute later having excused herself to her guest the boys mission was soon explained earl at the same time offering an excuse for calling at the meal hour he mentioned squire dobson and that individual was called from the table  well well exclaimed the squire of basco a short stout and rather jolly type of a country official i didnt expect to see you in boston although i heard yesterday that you were bound for alaska or some such place mrs gordon these are daniel portneys boysyou must remember daniel portneythe one who lost his life in that dreadful forest fire up our way some years ago  mrs gordon did remember and she gave both lads a warm greeting it was several minutes before earl could get down to business and then the matter of identification was left to squire dobson who said he would see them through in the morning as soon as the bartwell  stone offices were open  i dont know them he said but i know some bankers on the same block and we can introduce each other  mrs gordon was glad enough to see some folks from the district which had once been her home and asked the brothers to partake of dinner with the squire and her family of boys and girls after some hesitation the invitation was accepted and two hours were spent at the mansion  during the course of this time it was learned by earl and randy that squire dobson had come down from maine in search of his son a happygolucky lad who had run away from home as previously mentioned the squire had heard from a friend that fred had been seen near the docks in boston but he had been unable so far to locate the wayward youth  im afraid he has either gone to new york or on some long ocean trip said the squire to earl hes a foolish boy and is causing me no end of trouble if you ever run across him send him home at once  i willif hell go answered earl but neither he nor randy ever dreamed of meeting fred dobson where they did  the visit over the brothers left to hunt up some cheap hotel at which to stop for the night this was an easy matter and at ten oclock they retired a sound sleep however was out of the question for both were anxious concerning the outcome of their dealings with bartwell  stone  promptly at the hour appointed they met the squire at the office of the brokers and bankers another banker well known to both squire dobson and to mr stone was introduced all around and thus randy and earls identification was established beyond a doubt this accomplished earl received three hundred dollars in cash for which he and randy signed a receipt and the transaction was over  just outside of the office the boys separated from the squire of basco and the former lost no time in making their way to the depot of the new york  new england railroad  i dont know what route is best to take to san francisco said earl i guess we had better buy tickets as far as new york first and this was done and a few hours later saw them safe on board a train with their baggage in the car ahead at the depot earl had obtained a number of folders of different routes to the west and these he intended to study while on his way to the great metropolis  oh but railroad travelling is fine cried randy enthusiastically as the long train sped on its way through hills and valleys and past numerous pretty towns and villages all alive with the hum of a thousand industries one feels as if he would like to ride forever  im afraid youll be tired of riding by the time we reach san francisco said earl who nevertheless also enjoyed the journey this is only a little trip of six or seven hours the next will be one of many days and nights  i wonder how they sleep on a train went on randy curiously  well learn soon enough randy only dont let every one see how green we are added earl in a whisper  at one of the stations in connecticut where a ten minutes stop was made the two lads alighted to stretch their legs and take a look around they had been seated in the last car and now they walked forward along the broad platform  suddenly randy caught his brothers arm earl earl look he ejaculated and pointed to a window of the smokingcar there are tom roland and jasper guardley what can they be doing on this train  earl glanced to where randy pointed and saw that his brother was right at the same instant tom roland saw them and he drew back and motioned for his companion to do the same earl noted the movement and stood stockstill  randy i wonder he began and stopped short  what earl isnt it queer they should be on this train from boston  yes randy do you think it is possible that tom roland would be so dishonest as toto  to get that money earl broke in the younger boy he might beand yes mr stones description of the two swindlers fits roland and guardley exactly     chapter v  a night in new york   the description certainly does fit these two men said earl with some hesitation and it is queer that roland should be down here when only a few days ago he was in basco guardley i know is not above cheatinghes been up before squire dobson several times for it  let us go and have a talk with them said randy impulsively if they stole that money i want to know it  its not our business to hunt those swindlers up answered earl hesitatingly yet he followed randy to the platform of the smokingcar and they were soon inside and making their way to where roland and guardley sat pulling away at two blacklooking cigars  how do you do earl said tom roland familiarly as soon as the boys appeared its queer we should be on the same train isnt it  it is queer answered earl stiffly taken aback by the greeting where are you bound  guardley and i are going to try our luck in the west say i heard you boys were bound for alaska is that true  yes  it costs a heap to go theredidnt know you had so much money put in guardley with a smile that neither earl nor randy appreciated  and i didnt know you had any money for a western trip returned the older brother rather sharply  oh tom here is seeing me through answered guardley but both randy and earl noted that he appeared somewhat confused for the moment  guardley has done me several good turns and it wouldnt be fair for me to turn my back on him finished tom roland we are going right through to san francisco how about yourselves  we stop off at new york said randy  its a pity we cant travel together began roland when earl cut him short  roland did you pick up a letter belonging to me asked the boy  the mans eyes dropped but only for the fraction of a second a letter belonging to you he repeated no where did you lose it  somewhere around basco did you see it guardley  the second man shook his head was it important he asked  very said earl laconically and then as the train began to move again he motioned to randy and the two started back for their seat in the last car  what do you think questioned randy when they were seated  i dont know what to think its mighty queer the pair should leave basco in such a hurry  we left in a hurry but we had a good reason  and they may havea reason most folks dont look for  do you think they left on account of some crooked work cried randy  that would probably be jasper guardleys reason for getting away but its not our affair and we have enough other matters to think of concluded earl after a pause when we get to new york well be like stray cattle in a hundredacre lot we must look out not to get lost and above all things not to lose our money  and engage the cheapest and quickest passage to san francisco said randy let us look over those folders before it gets too late its too dark to see much outside  the lamps were lighted in the car and they lost no further time in digesting the contents of the folders of the railroad companies and pouring over the maps of the various routes to the golden gate  one looks about as good as another on paper remarked earl at last i think we had best take the new york central railroad to chicago then the rock island  chicago to rock island and then the southern pacific well find out about that route when we reach new york  it was exactly ten oclock in the evening that the train rolled into the grand central depot at fortysecond street and randy and earl alighted the crowd was very thick and though both looked for roland and guardley the two men could not be discovered the coming and going of so many people confused them and the many cries which greeted them as they emerged on the street did not tend to set them at ease  cab sir coupé this way for the broadway central hotel evening papers post or telegram mail and express  several came up to the two boys offering them cab rides and the like but both randy and earl shook their heads then earl remembered that the ticket office was close at hand and he and his brother went inside again a long talk with the ticket clerk followed and they concluded to take the new york central road to chicago and from there as previously intended the train would start at ten in the morning and earl bought two tickets paying an amount which brought their cash balance down quite low once more  never mind that pays for about all well need said randy let us leave the tickets to be called for and then theyll be safe  no indeed said earl some one may call for them just as the money was called for ill carry my ticket in an inside pocket and you had best do the same  this settled the brothers strolled out once more it was rather late but they could not resist the temptation to a walk down broadway of which they had heard so often they trudged as far as the postoffice took a look at park row and the numerous newspaper buildings and the brooklyn bridge all lit up in a blaze of electric lights and then earl happened to glance at the clock on st pauls church  halfpast twelve randy he ejaculated gracious well never find a hotel open as late as this let us get back to the vicinity of the depot again  i guess the hotels are open all night here answered the younger brother let us ride up broadway on that street car and they boarded a cable car which speedily took them back to fortysecond street a convenient hotel was found close to the railroad station and they lost no time in retiring the constant rumble and roar of the elevated trains disturbed them not a little and it was well into the morning hours before both dropped off into dreamland not to awaken until a bell boy aroused them at seven oclock  after a hasty breakfast another look was taken around the city finding they had the time they took an elevated train to the battery and back staying long enough at the lower end of the city to catch a glimpse of castle garden with its aquarium and the statue of liberty out in the bay  one could spend a month in sightseeing here sighed randy i wish we had had the time to do boston and new york thoroughly  ten oclock found them on the train which was to take them through to chicago without change of cars the cars were comfortably filled but there was no crowding again they looked for roland and guardley but without success  i guess they remained in new york said earl but for once the young fellow was mistaken  leaving the vicinity of the metropolis the train began its long journey up the beautiful hudson but the journey northward did not last long soon the train branched to the westward and plunged into the hills and rolling lands of the mohawk valley city after city were left behind with a whir and a rush that almost took randys breath from him at noon a stop was made for lunch then on they went again supper was served in a diningcar and both boys voted it about the best meal they had ever tasted  after the lamps were lit it was not long before the passengers began to think of going to bed both randy and earl watched the porter closely as he drew out the beds from the narrow closets in the sloping roof of the car set up the little wooden partitions and otherwise arranged the sleepingapartments the boys had a section to themselves and concluded to sleep together in the lower berth so the upper berth was left out  a sleepingcar is a great institution said earl as they turned in why a train like this is just a moving house and nothing else  shortly after noon of the day following chicago was reached here they had a three hours stop and spent the time in a ride on state street and a trip to the roof of the great masonic temple where a grand birdseye view of the entire city was to be seen spread out far below them  and so the long trip westward continued to tell of all the places stopped at would be impossible all day long for nearly a week they sat at their car window taking in the sights of cities towns prairies and mountains there were wonderful bridges to cross and perilous turns to make at which both held their breath expecting each moment to be dashed to pieces in the mountains a severe storm was encountered and the rolling of the thunder was aweinspiring so long was it kept up  but all journeys long and short must come to an end and one fine morning the boys found themselves safe and sound in san francisco and on their way to the palace hotel the trip overland had brightened them a good bit and they no longer looked as green as when they had started  they had just stepped from a market street car in front of the hotel when they saw a youth coming down the hotel steps who looked strangely familiar in spite of the somewhat ragged clothing he wore  randy who is that fellow questioned earl quickly as he caught his brother by the elbow  why if it isnt fred dobson burst from randys lips how in the world did he get away out here fred dobson fred dobson stop we want to talk to you he called out as the youth in question was on the point of hurrying off     chapter vi  preparations for departure   randy portney came from the lips of the boy addressed as he turned to stare at the person who had called out his name and earl too wherewhere did you come from  from basco of course returned randy how did you get away out here  ii came out on a train from chicago stammered fred dobson but he did not add that the train had been a freight and that the stolen ride had been both uncomfortable and full of peril  we met your father in boston put in earl he said if we should ever run across you to tell you to come home  im not going back was the reply of the squires son i came out here to make my fortune  im afraid youll find it rather hard work ventured randy and he glanced at freds shabby suit around basco the youth had dressed better than any one else  ive been playing in hard luck lately was the slangy reply but say what are you two fellows doing out here  we came on to join our uncle said randy he is going to take us to alaska with him  alaska to those new gold fields a fellow reads about in the daily papers  yes  id like to go there myself said the runaway readily  it costs a good deal of money to go fred remarked earl he rather liked the squires son in spite of his wild ways a fellow must take along a years provisions  so ive heard i wonder if i couldnt work my way up on one of the boats  i wouldnt advise you to go said randy why you are not used to hard work and they say work up there is of the hardest kind  oh i can work if i have to where is your uncle  hes stopping at this hotel randy turned to earl let us see if uncle foster is in and we can talk to fred some time later  this was decided upon and the squires son walked off promising to be back in a few hours  he puts on a pretty good face but i fancy he is homesick nevertheless remarked earl as he and randy made their way to the hotel office they were just about to ask for their uncle when a hand was laid on earls shoulder  earl randy how are you my boys just as fresh and hearty as when i saw you last and how both of you are growing why earl you are almost a man im glad to see you yes i am and foster portney beamed at both from a pair of brown eyes set in a round ruddy face which was half covered with a long beard he was a large and rugged man and his open manner had made him many friends  what a beard youve got uncle foster were randys first words as he winced at the close grip foster portney gave his hand you look like all the rest of the westerners around here  im glad we had no trouble in finding you put in earl whose hand also tingled from the grip given it he remembered now that his uncle had always been considered an unusually strong man i know hell stand the alaskan climate well enough even if we dont he thought  didnt have any trouble getting here did you questioned foster portney your message came on time  we had a little setback in boston answered earl and told of the trouble about the money his uncle listened with a sober look on his broad face  that was too bad truly lads but its the loss of that firm of bankers and brokers they ought to have been sure of the identification and you think the thieves were two men named roland and guardley they must be thorough rascals  we are not sure broke in randy hastily it only looks that way  i see foster portney mused for a moment well we cant lose time in trying to investigate i was hoping you two boys would turn up today or tomorrow day after tomorrow a boat sails for juneau and if i rustle around i think i can secure passage for ourselves and our traps if we dont catch this boat well have to wait two weeks or else take a train for portland and wait ten days  but we havent a thing uncle foster cried randy that is outside of our clothing which is in our trunks on check at the railroad station  and that clothing for the most part will have to be left behind randy for a country like alaska one must be differently dressed than here each of you will have to have a suit of furs and plenty of flannels and all that sort of thing  and where shall we get them  there is a regular outfitting store not far from here but the first thing to be done now you have turned up is to secure those passage tickets to juneau the alaskan fever is setting in strong here and well not be alone on our trip over chilkoot pass and along the headwaters of the yukon  im in the dark about this trip i must confess said earl where is this pass you mention and where is the klondike creek or river  ill show you the route tonight boys on a map just issued by our government the best map out so far but come along to that steamboat office or well get left  five minutes later saw the boys and their uncle on a street car which ran close to the dock at which the steamboat lay taking in her cargo which consisted mainly of the outfits of miners and prospectors the boat which was named the golden hope had been chartered especially for this trip and a temporary shipping office had been established close at hand around this office was congregated a motley collection of men all eager to obtain passage to juneau as cheaply as it could be had  through this crowd foster portney shoved his way with randy and earl close behind him it was some minutes before they could get to the ticket office  i want three tickets said mr portney how much freight will you carry on them  six hundred pounds and not a pound more for anybody was the quick reply  and when do you sail  wednesday at twelve oclock sharp what are the names we dont want any mixup in this rush  the names were put down and the money for the passage paid over and with their tickets in their pockets the three struggled to get out of the crowd which was growing more dense every minute close at hand was a big billboard on which was posted a large circular headed in big black letters    the gold fields of alaska    direct route via juneau and over chilkoot pass   now is the time to go and stake your claim  that circular is enough to set almost any one crazy said earl as he read it over well i hope we strike a bonanza  the reports are very encouraging replied foster portney who in spite of his usual cool headedness had the gold fever nearly as badly as any one in san francisco you see he went on the sooner we get there the better for we wont have much time left after arriving before the long and terribly cold winter sets in  earl had imagined that the six hundred pounds of freight must be divided between the three but soon learned that six hundred pounds was the limit for each person  well never carry that much will we he queried why how are we going to get all that stuff over the pass you mentioned  well get indians to pack it over theyll charge twenty or thirty cents a pound but its the best that can be done some hire pack mules and dog teams but my experience has been that indians are the most reliable  dinner was now had and then the three proceeded to the outfitting store foster portney had previously mentioned on the way their uncle asked the boys what they had in their trunks that nothing not needed might be purchased  two hours were spent in buying clothing and both earl and randy thought their uncle would never get done adding to the pile first came a dozen suits of flannel underwear and with them a dozen pairs of heavy socks and half a dozen of light ones then came two suits of woollen clothing strongly made and with large pockets two pairs of strong shoes and a pair of arctics and two pairs of walrushide bootsheavy it is true but strong as iron finally came a suit of furs and two caps each with a guard which could be pulled down to the neck leaving only two holes for the eyes  i reckon youve got handkerchiefs and such extras said mr portney so now all you want so far as wearing is concerned is a few pairs of smoked glasses to prevent snowblindness  the general outfitter was also able to supply these and he suggested they take along about ten yards of mosquito netting  mosquito netting cried randy what for  during the short summer mosquitoes are exceedingly thick in alaska said his uncle and made the purchase suggested  it was now getting late and foster portney said they had best wait until the following morning before buying the campingout things bedding and other necessities ill make a careful list tonight he added  they returned to the palace hotel where randy and earl found fred dobson awaiting them  say was the greeting of the squires son is half of basco moving out to san francisco  what do you mean questioned earl with a puzzled look  why i was down at the railroad station about an hour ago and i saw a train come in from chicago with tom roland and jasper guardley on board     chapter vii  buying the outfits   you saw tom roland and jasper guardley burst from the lips of the portney brothers simultaneously  yes replied fred dobson i couldnt believe my eyes at first but when i felt sure i was right i ran up to speak to roland  and what did he say queried earl  he didnt give me a chance to speak to him he and guardley disappeared in the crowd like a flash i rather think they saw me and avoided me  earl and randy exchanged glances tom roland and jasper guardley had followed them to san francisco what could it mean  i shouldnt wonder if they are bound for alaska too burst out randy oh earl supposing they got that letter  its more than likely they did said the elder youth quickly ill wager both of them are going to try their fortunes in the new gold fields well they had a cheap trip west he concluded bitterly  if we could prove they got the money we could have them locked up  but we cant prove it randy we havent time so well just have to let matters stand where they are for my part i never want to see either of them again said earl decidedly  fred dobson had listened to the latter part of the conversation with interest and now he wished to know what it all meant  they must be guilty he said after randy had recited the facts guardley is a bad egg you know he was up before my father several times but say randy he went on as earl turned away with foster portney to secure extra accommodations at the hotel for the two following nights cant you fix it up with your uncle so that i can go to alaska with him ill work like a slave for the chance to go  randy had expected something of this sort and had talked the matter over with earl and now he shook his head  i dont believe i can fred my uncle is only taking us along because we are related and because he knows we are both strong and used to hard work i really dont believe you could stand it in the new gold fields he has warned us that the exposure is something awful  oh i know but i can stand more than you think pleaded fred  besides that it wouldnt be right added randy you ran away from home and its your duty to go back  oh dont preach my father doesnt care where i am  yes he does fred he cares a good deal and then your mother must be worried too  at the mention of his mother fred dobsons face changed color for a moment and when next he spoke there seemed to be a suspicious lump in his throat  iim going to send mother a letter ill write it tonight  you should have written long ago fred  oh dont preach then you wont speak to your uncle and the squires son looked into randys face wistfully  yes ill speak to him but it wont do any good fred  it was not long after this that foster portney and earl came back having hired an extra room for the time desired the uncle had been introduced to fred and now he invited the runaway to take supper with them  it was not until the meal was nearly over that fred urged randy to broach the subject next his heart foster portney listened patiently to all randy had to say and also gave ear to freds pleadings but his face did not brighten up into anything like an encouraging look  no dobson i cant take you was his reply in the first place earl and randy are all the companions i wish to take along that is and grub stake as we term it in mining slangpay their way that means and in the second place it wouldnt be right you are a minor and have run away from home and if anything it is my duty to see that you go back besides this you do not look strong and i believe you have never done any real hard work and that wont do for alaska only those who know how to rough it stand any show whatever of getting along there my advice to you is to go back where you belong  as may be surmised this plain speech did not suit fred dobson at all and he felt more than ill at ease for the remainder of the repast as soon as he could do so gracefully he arose to go  i dont suppose ill see you again for a long while he said as he held out his hand to earl and to randy well good luck to you anyway  randy caught earl by the arm and gave it a little pinch how are you off for cash fred he asked in a low tone  oh ive got a little money with me answered fred quietly but did not add that the sumtotal of his fortune amounted to exactly sixtyfive cents  perhaps we can help you a little put in earl who understood the pinch randy had given him we havent much but if a few dollars will do any good  will you let me have two dollars asked the squires son eagerly  yes  and ill let you have two more added randy and the amounts were passed over on the spot and fred thanked them very profusely a few minutes later he had thanked foster portney for the supper bade all goodby and was gone  not a half bad boy was the comment of mr portney his one fault is i reckon that he has been allowed to have his own way too long roughing it out here will most likely make a man of him unless he gets into bad company and goes to the dogs  i am going to write to his folks and let them know where he is said earl and the letter was penned and mailed before he went to bed  the three were on their way early on the following morning to complete the purchase of their outfits for all must be packed up and on the steamboat deck by seven oclock the next morning to insure being stored on board of the golden hope  the first purchases made were those of a good tent bedding woollen blankets rubber sleepingbags a large piece of oiled canvas and several lynxskin robes  now for our tools with which to cut down trees build boats and the like said foster portney remember we are almost like pioneers in a new land  for boatbuilding purposes they purchased a good whipsaw a crosscut saw a jack plane and a draw knife a large and a small axe a hammer brace and bits six pounds of assorted nails several pounds of oakum for calking and some pitch to this outfit was added fifty yards of threequarterinch rope  dont we want some canvas for sail asked randy who was intensely interested and who felt somewhat as if he was going out to play at robinson crusoe  no the other bits of canvas will do for that responded foster portney now for the campingout things he went on and had soon procured a goodsized water kettle a fryingpan broiler bean pot tin measure extra baking and cooking tins three tin plates and cups three sets of knives and forks coffee pot and strainer salt and pepper shakers and a strong paperfibre water pail  that about ends that he said when each article bought had been carefully scrutinized to see that it was perfect now for food and medicines and then well be about done  the food list made randy smile grimly no luxuries there he whispered to earl we are going to live as plain as we did up in maine or plainer  the list consisted of the following a hundred pounds of flour with bakingpowder twenty pounds of smoked ham and bacon two dozen cans of tomatoes a dozen cans of other vegetables a small sack of potatoes a dozen cans of condensed milk twenty pounds of sugar ten pounds of salt twenty pounds of coffee a sack of beans pepper and other spices and mustard to these were added a few cans of fruit by way of delicacies  the food packed they made their way to a drug store and procured a small family chest of various medicines and added to this several bottles of liquor which however were to be used only for medicinal purposes for none of the party were drinkers  foster portney already had a serviceable pistol and he now procured for this weapon a sufficient supply of cartridges he also bought a pistol for randy and a shotgun for earl the gun will be the most useful weapon he said for it will help put lots of game into our eatingpot and that is what we shall want  wont we want a fishingline or two asked earl i have one in my trunk but it is not of much account  yes well buy several firstclass ones and a book of flies fish to a hungry man are as acceptable as any other game answered his uncle and the articles mentioned were purchased without delay  the list was now filled yet foster portney spent nearly an hour more in picking up such odds and ends as pins needles spools of thread three good pocket compasses and burningglasses a pocket notebook for each with pencils and some writingpaper and envelopes finally he took them to a little shop on a side street where each procured a monstrous knapsack of oiled canvas having straps to be placed over the shoulders and an extra strap to come up over the front part of the head  what an affair said randy with a laugh i never saw a knapsack with a headpiece before  youll find it an easy thing to carry said his uncle try it and randy did so and was astonished to learn how much the headstrap improved the carrying powers  the best part of the evening was spent in packing the things they had purchased and it was not until after ten oclock that the last of the bundles were ready and duly tagged  now we have only a few more things to get said foster portney the most important of the whole outfit and as randy and earl looked at him blankly he smiled in an odd way what could three gold hunters do without picks shovels and pans  to be sure shouted randy and earl reddened over the idea that he had not thought of the things before  well get them in the morning for they wont have to be packed said the uncle we have done enough for today  and randy who was tired out agreed with him that it had been a busy day indeed he went to bed with his head in a whirl about alaska and how they were to get there and of the wonderful finds of gold which awaited all hands he was full of the brightest of hopes and the hardships so soon to be encountered did not bother him     chapter viii  on the way to juneau   get up randy dont you know we are to start for alaska today cried earl at six oclock on the following morning come now turn out  oh my but im tired still grumbled randy as he stretched himself nevertheless he hopped out of bed a moment later and was dressed almost as soon as his brother they had barely finished when their uncle came to summon them to breakfast  well hunt up those tools and then i have a little private business to attend to announced foster portney so we must move lively  breakfast the last meal to be eaten in san francisco was quickly disposed of and then followed a halfhours inspection of various picks shovels and goldwashing pans at a hardware store that made a specialty of miners tools the boys were greatly interested and as earl said it made them feel more like prospectors to own a pick and a shovel each the final bundle was made and shipped to the steamboat dock and foster portney left them  meet me at the dock at eleven oclock he said as he hurried away  the boys had still several private matters to be settled their trunks were to be sold also some old clothing at the hotel they obtained the addresses of several dealers in secondhand goods and they had one of the dealers call and look at the stuff he offered ten dollars for the lot and as they did not see their way to doing better they accepted his terms and the goods were removed without delay  let us take a walk around while we have the chance said earl it is only ten oclock  randy was willing and off they started up market street to the city hall and then back and into montgomery and kearney streets taking in all the sights as they went almost before they knew it it was time to go to the wharf  we dont want to keep uncle foster waiting said earl but when they reached the wharf their uncle was nowhere in sight  the crowd which had collected to see the gold seekers off was a large one and more people kept coming every moment the almost magic name klondike was on every tongue and there were hundreds who expressed the wish that they were going along  alaska is full of gold one man declared full of gold all youve got to do is to locate it  thats just it said earl to his brother if you can locate it youre all right if not and he finished by a shrug of his broad shoulders  youre not sorry were going are you demanded randy quickly  sorry not a bit of it but it doesnt pay to be too sanguine randy my boy  quarter of an hour passed and the jam on the dock began to become uncomfortable brawny men predominated but there were also many others therewives to bid goodby to their husbands girls to wish their lovers goodluck and children to catch a last embrace from their parents many of the women were in tears and a number of other eyes were moist and altogether the scene was rather a sober one  what can be keeping uncle foster asked randy as the minutes to the time for sailing slipped by i dont see him anywhere do you  earl did not and he was as anxious as his brother back and forth they pushed their way but without success then earl looked at the silver watch he carried ten minutes to twelve he ejaculated  let us go on board and stand where uncle foster can see us suggested randy in a tone of voice which was far from steady supposing their uncle should not turn up what should they do to go alone on that trip seemed out of the question  luckily they had their tickets so getting on board was not difficult a number of the passengers glanced at them curiously  goin ter alaska asked one brawny fellow whose face was almost entirely concealed by his tangled beard well well aint yer most afraid yell git done up  well try to keep on top answered earl the fellow wished to continue the conversation but both earl and randy were too impatient just then to listen to him and moved off to another part of the boat  five minutes more had passed and an officer was going around shouting all ashore thats going we sail in five minutes those to be left behind began to pass over the gangplankit was a hasty handshake and a last goodby on every side the boys looked at each other doubtfully  if he doesnt come began earl when his quick eye caught sight in the crowd of a hat that he recognized uncle foster uncle foster portney come on board he yelled at the top of his sturdy lungs  mr portney in the jam of people below heard and looked up in a moment he had caught sight of his nephews and he shook his hand at them soon he was mounting the gangplank the last of the passengers to come on board he was out of breath and gave the boys an odd smile  i suppose i gave you a scare he said i didnt mean to be so late but those business matters took longer than i intended and then there was a blockade of street cars and i had to walk it but were all right now i reckon he added gazing around goodby to san francisco when we see her again may our pockets be lined with gold and he took off his soft felt hat and waved it at the crowd on shore  the boat was now swinging clear of the wharf and thousands of hats and handkerchiefs were waving there she goes hurrah for alaska if you strike it rich let us know god be with you these and a hundred other cries rang out and they were kept up until the steamer was far out in the stream and on her way up the bay to the golden gate  the run to the gate did not take long and by the middle of the afternoon the steamer was standing out boldly into the pacific ocean on her way almost due north it had been rather muggy and now a heavy mist set in and by evening the boys were glad enough to leave the deck and arrange their stateroom it contained four berths two for themselves one for mr portney and the last for a stranger who was down on the ships list as captain luke zoss  i wonder who captain zoss can be said randy to earl when the door of the stateroom was suddenly flung open and the bushybearded man who had spoken to them on deck came in he stared at them in surprise for a second then burst into a hearty fit of laughter  wall wall so its you as are goin ter be my messmates on this yere trip he exclaimed all right lads glad ter have ye he held out a brawny hand my handle is luke zoss but most of the boys know me as capn luke may i be so inquisitive as to ask your names  my name is earl portney and this is my brother randy answered earl the hearty way of the stranger pleased him and he was sure he should like zoss  portney eh i used ter know a man by thet namefoster portney o colorady  why hes our uncle and he is with us cried randy and just then his uncle came in and he and captain zoss shook hands they had met in creede where zoss had once been a mining superintendent and knew each other quite well  all bound fer the klondike exclaimed the captain hooray were sure to strike it eh portney i know you wouldnt be agoin thar unless gold was to be picked up goin over chilkoot pass i take it foster portney nodded then we might as well stick together eh it will be better than pairing off with somebody as might be wuss nor a hoss thief eh o course it would  again the captain shook hands then he asked the boys where they came from and was pleased to learn they were used to a life in the open air  i was a lumberman myself onctup in michigan he said but thar wasnt enough excitement so i gave it up to seek gold and silver minin and prospectin just suit meleaswise so long as the grub holds out one thing is in our favorscarcity o men up in them new gold fields now down in colorady its differentall overrun with men eh portney  yes well have rather an open field answered foster portney and then followed a long discussion about the new gold fields and what might be expected when dyea was reached and the terrible climb over the mountains began the discussion lasted until ten oclock and the boys listened with interest and picked up many stray bits of information both concluded that the overland trip to the mines would prove every bit as rough and dangerous as they had pictured it  the distance from san francisco to juneau alaska is in round figures one thousand miles the golden hope was not as large as a regular ocean liner yet she was a fast boat and it was expected that she would cover the distance inside of four days much of course would depend upon the weather encountered for she was heavily loaded with both passengers and freight the freight had given even the owners concern for much of it was piled high on the outer decks  on the second day out and some time after cape blanco had been sighted through the glass the sky to the westward began to darken and the sailors announced an approaching storm soon the sun went under a heavy bank of clouds and a stiff breeze sprung up which threw the long heavy swells of the ocean into millions of whitecaps dancing and skipping on every side as far as eye could reach  we are in for it now was the announcement which went the rounds presently it began to rain and all endeavored to seek the shelter of the cabin which speedily became crowded to suffocation the boys their uncle and captain zoss were in the forward part of the boat and they saw the course changed so that the golden hope stood out straight to meet the blow  we are going to have no fun of this said foster portney with a grave shake of his head if i know anything about matters that storm will be an extra heavy one and the events of the next hour proved that he was right     chapter ix  the fate of a stowaway   my gracious were going to the bottom sure  it was randy who made the observation the storm had struck the steamer in all its fury and the pitching of the vessel made it almost impossible for a person to keep his feet randy clutched a handrail fastened near by and earl did the same while mr portney and captain zoss braced up against a ceiling post the only thing that kept many from falling was the fact that there was no vacant floor space they were in it like sardines in a tin as randy expressed it  some of the outside freight is bound to go remarked foster portney a minute later ah as i thoughtthe captain has ordered it cut away there goes some poor fellows outfits too bad  i hope our stuff isnt among it cried earl but theyll be responsible wont they  yes theyll be responsible earl but we dont want their moneywe want our goods for it may be difficult if not impossible to duplicate the things at juneau but i imagine our goods are in the hold  our clothing and provisions are said randy i saw them put down just before we started but the tools may be out there  if they began captain zoss but broke off short as a mighty crash was heard from the rear deck the crash was followed by the jingle of broken glass and sharp cries of pain and alarm  there was every evidence of a panic but the cooler heads restored order and then it was found that a miners outfit had caused all the trouble it had been loosened from the deck but before it could be thrown overboard a lurch of the steamer had sent it sailing through the air straight through a cabin window the miner to whom the outfit belonged had been one of those to be most scared by its unceremonious entrance  for three hours the storm raged in all its fury and during that time no one but the officers and crew were allowed on deck nearly all the outside freight was thrown away a loss which amounted to several thousand dollars at last the wind and the rain gradually abated and by nightfall the golden hope was again proceeding on her journey northward  on the following day they ran by vancouver island and it was calculated that they would reach juneau by noon of the day following all were anxious concerning the outfits which had been lost overboard and the miners and officers tried to make out a list of them the work proceeded all day and it was not until nightfall that it was learned positively that the goods belonging to the portneys and to captain zoss were safe  the first sight of juneau was rather disappointing to the boys who had expected to see a much larger place juneau is but a small town lying on the western coast of a peninsula formed by the lynn canal and the wide mouth of the taku river directly opposite is douglas island the town lies on a small patch of flat ground backed up by several high mountains it is principally a trading centre the harbor is a fairly good one and on account of the rush to the gold fields the stores were increasing constantly  as soon as the steamer reached her landing place a wild rush for shore ensued and then began a hunt for some vessel which might take the party up to dyea where the journey by water would for the present come to an end the water up the lynn canal as it is termed although it is not at all a canal as we know them and through dyea inlet is shallow and consequently ocean steamers do not go beyond juneau  ill hunt up passage on some boat said foster portney to the boys you remain here and watch our goods those fellows who lost their outfits are angry enough and some of them would like nothing better than to appropriate ours and let us look to the steamboat company for redress  while he was gone the task of bringing the goods from the steamers hold was started for no one wanted to be delayed in juneau any longer than was necessary randy and earl watched the work closely and as soon as their things appeared they claimed them and had the lot transferred to a spot at the end of the rather rotten and shaky dock  presently as they stood waiting for the reappearance of their uncle and captain zoss who had gone with mr portney they noticed a commotion on board the golden hope a stowaway had been found in the hold of the vessel and the sailors and stevedores had brought the fellow out more dead than alive  get off of here cried the captain of the steamer in a rage as he booted the fellow not once but half a dozen times get out i say if we were down in san francisco id have you locked up in a minute its a pity i didnt find you out when we were on the tripid amade you work your passage and more go before i heave you overboard  and with a final kick the stowaway was run off the gangplank to fall in a heap on the dock too weak from the confinement and want of proper food to stand  its fred dobson ejaculated randy oh earl look  it is fred true enough replied earl as much surprised as his brother forgetful of their outfits for the time being both ran forward and picked up the son of the squire of basco freds eyes were closed his face was as white as chalk and they saw at a glance that he had fainted  illustration with a final kick the stowaway was run off the gangplankpage 72  get some water randy said earl as he began to work over the prostrate figure i wonder if there is a doctor handy he looks as if he was half starved to death  as randy ran off a crowd began to collect a few to sympathize but the majority to look on merely in curiosity or to make audible comments that it served the boy right since he had no business to steal a trip  got a crazy notion to go to the gold fields i reckon said one bystander he ought to be home where his mamma could spank him  at this there was a coarse laugh which was quickly hushed when another man a young fellow of not more than twentythree stepped forward and announced that he was a doctor he soon succeeded in bringing fred around  he wants something to eat as much as anything said the newcomer there is a restaurant over yonder better take him there and get him some soup and stale breadhis stomach isnt strong enough to bear a regular meal  randy and earl thanked the doctor and did as advised while the crowd gradually melted away to tend to its own affairs fred was ravenously hungry yet he ate with difficulty when the food was set before him  ive had nothing to eat for about forty hours he said when he felt strong enough to talk i spent that four dollars you two gave me in buying provisions crackers cheese and the like but on the second day out the rats got at the crackers and cheese and ate nearly the whole of them then one of my bottles of water was smashed during that storm and though it was as close as pepper down there i hadnt a mouthful to drink i thought i was going to die just before they opened the hold and began to remove the cargo  but fred what made you do it asked earl reproachfully it was the height of foolishness  im bound to go to the gold fields earl you two are going there to make a fortune and why cant i make a fortune too  because you are not fit for life out there thats why you suffered a good deal in coming this far but let me tell you that i expect to suffer a good deal more than that before the klondike river is reached and we have endured the hardships of an alaskan winter supposing you succeed in getting away up in alaska and are taken sick who is going to care for you and how are you going to get back home now i dont want to preach but my advice is to go back to basco at once  and thats my advice too fred broke in randy i know you are as old as i am but you know you never did such work as earl and i are used to and some of the experienced miners even laugh at us if uncle foster hadnt known that we were used to hard work out in the open in midwinter at that he would never have dreamed of asking us to go with him he told us so  randy and earl both spoke earnestly and it was not their fault that what they had to say did not take effect but fred dobson was both wild and reckless and he shook his head  im bound to go if i have to walk the rest of the way he said i thought i would strike your uncle again when we reached the place but if you are so dead set against me ill not say another word but try to paddle my own canoe as the saying is of course im much obliged for what you did for me in san francisco and here and some day ill make it up to you see if i dont  we dont want you to make it up fred only act sensible and steer for home when you next strike out said earl he was about to go on when the entrance of his uncle and captain zoss into the restaurant caused him to stop  humph so youve turned up again were foster portneys words i heard there had been a stowaway on board of the golden hope it was the most foolish move you could make lad the prospector turned to his youngest nephew randy where are our outfits  oh my burst out randy leaping to his feet earl we forgot all about them  earl said nothing but he reached the door of the restaurant almost as quickly as his brother there was a crowd in the roadway outside but they quickly forced a passage through and ran for the steamer dock a large number of outfits were spread here there and everywhere but the spot where they had left those belonging to their own party was vacant     chapter x  up the lynn canal   randy and earl gazed about them in hopeless bewilderment the outfits belonging to themselves their uncle and to captain zoss were gone who had taken them and was there any chance of recovery  we should have looked after them said earl bitterly it was foolishness to leave the stuff especially after uncle foster had warned us  i wonder if any of those miners who lost their outfits from the steamer are guilty said randy as they started on another tour of the juneau wharf i remember one fellow with a red beard and a scar on his nose who looked at the stuff rather closely when we came ashore  let us start to make inquiries randy we must get our outfits back if we dont uncle foster will never forgive us  yes and well be in a pickle besides groaned the younger brother by the look of things in this settlement mining outfits are rather scarce  yes i heard one man saying that about everything worth having had been gobbled up several weeks ago and the storekeepers were awaiting new consignments from san francisco portland and seattle  with anxious hearts they walked around the wharf and along a side road also piled high with miners goods and steamer freight presently a man joined them it was captain zoss  well whars our packs he questioned and looked glum when told of what had occurred by the boots lads we must find emaint no two ways about that why to go to the mines without tools would be wuss nor a hen sittin on a nest without eggs been all over the dock yer say he paused an instant ill make a round o the saloons if the things was stolen like as not the thieves would want to git em out of sight in quick order eh  he was about to leave them when they were hailed by a man standing near the entrance to a new store that was going up on the opposite side of the way it was the doctor who had so kindly come to fred dobsons assistance  whats up he called out looking for your traps theyre all right i had them brought up here for safe keeping when you went off with the sick lad i knew they wouldnt be secure down on the wharf there are half a dozen quarrels on down there over lost and mixedup baggage  randy and earl felt much relieved and so did the captain they ran over to the new store and sure enough everything was there in a heap alongside of the packs owned by the doctor they thanked the medical man for his kindness and a short talk followed the doctors name was kenneth barwaithe and he was an englishman who had practised for a year in victoria he too was bound for the new gold fields either for mining purposes or to set himself up in business  the hundreds of miners going up there will need doctoring he explained and i am all prepared to dose them with medicine set a broken leg amputate an arm or pull an aching tooth  tharll be work for you said captain zoss with a laugh but the wust disease up thar will be one ye cant touch nohow  indeed and what is that questioned kenneth barwaithe with interest  starvation was the solemn reply  in order to relieve their uncle of further anxiety randy and earl returned to where they had left mr portney they found him in earnest conversation with fred dobson the face of the squires son was very red and his eyes were downcast  ill write home at once they heard fred say in a low voice im glad earl wrote from san francisco my folks will at least know i am alive and wellthat is as well as a fellow can be who was half starved to death he added ruefully  and you ought to go home ladits the proper place for you  well maybe i willafter i have earned enough around here to take me mr portney  foster portneys hand was in his pocket and earl and randy saw him hand fred a tendollar bill pay me back whenever you feel rich enough to do so he said and the squires son gave him a ready promise to that effect  foster portney and captain zoss had been fortunate enough to secure passage up to dyea on a little steamboat which was to leave early the next day the craft was a freight boat but carried passengers whenever she could get them no time was lost in transferring their goods to this craft fred dobson helping them carry their loads doctor barwaithe had also secured passage in the craft and soon became one of the party later on matters were talked over by him and the others and it was agreed that the five should stick together until the klondike region was reached the forming of little parties of five or more was popular among those who travelled by the overland route into alaska by such means there was less danger of a man getting lost in the mountains and the preparation of meals along the way was easier for each man of a party took his turn at feeding the rest so that only one set of packs had to be unstrapped and packed again instead of the lot besides this the building and sailing of a boat down the lakes and through the rapids by one man was next to impossible  it was very difficult to obtain accommodations at any of the sostyled hotels in juneau so all hands encamped for the night on the deck of the freighter fred dobson managing to smuggle himself in with the regular party in the morning fred approached the captain of the boat for a situation but was turned off in language far from fit to transcribe to these pages  got more on board than we want now boy so git ashore in a hurry for were on the point of sailing and with a wistful goodby to randy earl and the others the squires son leaped to the dock five minutes later the lines were cast off and the wheezy overloaded craft started northward on the lynn canal  the distance from juneau to dyea is a hundred and eighteen miles past berners bay and katsehan river into chilkoot inlet and finally up dyea inlet the run for the most part is past gigantic glaciers on one side and mountains covered with snow and ice on the other  gracious this is a touch of winter and no mistake ejaculated randy as the steamboat ploughed steadily on her way and they stood by the rail taking in the desolate sight see how those little icebergs sparkle in the sunshine  far off to the west of this canal is the great muir glacier said foster portney it is the largest glacier in the world that island which we just passed is douglas and there is situated the great treadwell mine one of the richest gold mines heretofore discovered in alaska  have we got to climb mountains like that questioned earl as he pointed to the snowcapped summits to the eastward  have we got to climb em burst in captain zoss why them aint an ant hill to the ones were to crawl over lad just wait till we get up into dyea inlet and youll catch sight o mountains as will give you the yellow shakes as the boys call it now i dont want to discourage ye he went on as he saw earl take a deep breath i want to prepare ye for the wust thats all that passthe chilkootis the wust part o the whole trip being about threequarters of a mile high and betwixt mountains twice that size  well we can climb threequarters of a mile i guess if the grade isnt too steep said randy  the captain turned away and smiled to himself he was more than doubtful if the boys would ever get safely over to lake linderman the first of the lakes on the other side of the mountain range  it was well that they had dressed themselves warmly for on account of the sun shining on the glaciers the air was filled with a mist which chilled them to the bone the channel was filled with loose pieces of ice and ever and anon the steamer would strike a miniature iceberg with a crash which was clearly heard by all on board  after a few hours of gazing at the monotonous presentation of glaciers and snowcovered hills and mountains the boys turned their attention to those on board it was a motley collection of people most of the men were americans but there was also a fair sprinkling of canadians germans and half a dozen indians the latter were of the chilkoot tribe and interested randy more than anything else they were a roundfaced stalwart set of fellows and several of them had bands of black painted across the upper parts of their faces  they paint the black around their eyes as a preventive of snowblindness explained foster portney as soon as either of you find your eyes hurting from the glare you had better put on a pair of the smoked goggles  dinner on the steamer was served under the rather scanty shelter on the upper deck but fifteen could be accommodated at once and as there were over sixty people on board it took some time to satisfy them all the fare was principally beef stew bread coffee and rice pudding but the cold air gave every one a good appetite and the boys did full justice to all that was offered them  at turningin time there was more than one little row for sleeping accommodations were limited berths were at a premium and had been secured by the more fortunate ones when the steamer had landed at juneau foster portney gathered his party around him in the shelter of the wheelhouse on deck and here they slept huddled together like sheep in a cattle car  not like stopping at the palace hotel in san francisco is it said his uncle to randy but never mind as soon as we leave dyea well have all the room we want and more  sleeping like this keeps a fellow warm said randy who felt somehow as if he was out for a lark but by and by when somebody passed over him in the dark and slipped on his chest he did not think it quite so much fun  however the night passed quickly enough and at daybreak all were stirring for they had reached dyea inlet and a landing was expected before noon a stiff breeze was blowing and the inlet a long narrow arm of chilkoot inlet and the canal was filled with angry waves blowing from off shore presently the first sight of dyea was gained and half an hour later an anchor was dropped and the voyage so far as the steamer was concerned was over     chapter xi  the start from dyea   randy and earl found dyea but a small settlement there was one store which had been established for some time and half a dozen others which had sprung up to accommodate the miners and adventurers who were pouring into the place the total white population did not number a hundred but there were a very large number of indiansmen women and childrenall anxious to obtain employment as packcarriers over the mountains  the steamer had anchored some distance from the beach and it was no light work to get the packs ashore in the heavy sea that was running four small boats were employed for the purpose and more than one bundle was lost overboard in making the transfer to land  there goes one of my packs suddenly sang out dr barwaithe as a small boat loaded high above the gunwales capsized just as the shore was struck a wild scramble by the miners was made to recover their goods the doctor would have gone into the icy water also but he could not swim  several indians who were watching the scene rushed up to the medical man get heem fo one dolla said the largest of the redmen and the doctor made the bargain on the spot at once the indian and his helper leaped into the surf and swam toward the pack which contained the doctors clothing and bedding and was becoming rapidly water soaked they reached the pack as it was about to sink and after ten minutes of hard work brought it out on the pebbly shore  by the middle of the afternoon all hands found themselves encamped along the halfdriedup stream back of the settlement here there were nearly a hundred tents of miners and prospectors who were not quite ready to attempt the trip over chilkoot pass  the indian who had rescued the doctors pack stuck to the medical man for the job of transferring his goods over to lake linderman stating he and his companions would do the work for fifteen cents a pound  what do you think of that rate asked dr barwaithe of foster portney while randy and earl looked on with interest  i dont know but that its fair enough was the reply  but wouldnt it be better to take horses from here and use indians only over the pass you know we have about thirteen miles to travel before the pass is reached  we had better take the indians from here put in captain zoss thars no tellin if we can git em further on eh  yes and we might as well get used to walking it from here too added mr portney it will do randy and earl some good not but that i imagine they can tramp as well as any of us  weve tramped for many a mile through the maine woods when we were out hunting said randy by the way he went on i havent seen any game yet outside of a few birds  the big indian who rejoiced in the name of salmon head was waiting for an answer his squaw and two boys standing close by the squaw was a tall thin woman of forty whose face was painted a greasy black down to the tip of her nose the balance of her countenance being left its natural color yellowish red the boys were sturdy lads of perhaps ten and twelve as used to carrying heavy burdens as their parents  the bargain was struck with salmon head to have the goods of the entire party packed over from that spot to the shore of lake linderman for fifteen cents a pound the work to be accomplished within the next four days weather permitting the boys had expected to carry some of the goods but at this foster portney shook his head  you couldnt carry over forty or fifty pounds and maybe not that over the pass he said and i would rather pay the price and have you reserve your strength you can each carry a knapsack filled with food in case you wander from the trail although dont let this happen if you can possibly avoid it the best rule in going over any pass is to keep at least two other members of the party in sight constantly  in spite of the close proximity of the snowcapped mountains the night was a comparatively warm one and no inconvenience was experienced by the party in their tents they had two one belonging to mr portney and the boys the other being one captain zoss and dr barwaithe had purchased at juneau for mutual comfort the tents were put up end to end and being both water and wind tight were almost as good to sleep in as a cabin  the outfits had been carefully parcelled out to the indians salmon head carrying a load of over a hundred and twentyfive pounds his squaw carrying a hundred pounds and the sons loads of about half that weight relatives of these indians carried the remainder of the loads for these chilkoot people like other redmen believed in keeping all they could in the family  usually the journey to lake linderman was made in two stages the first from dyea to the entrance to chilkoot pass and the second over the pass itself and down to the lake which may fairly be called the southern headwaters of the yukon river this course was to be pursued by the present party and bright and early on the following morning they started out on what was destined to be the most perilous trip of their lives captain zoss went ahead with the indians while the boys and their uncle and the doctor kept in a bunch behind  at the start the trip was along the bottom of a deep cañon on either side of which arose mountains and cliffs for the most part covered with snow and ice down in this cañon flowed what is called the dyea river a mere mountain torrent dashing over rocks and crags and here and there broadening out into a shallow flow over sand and pebbles walking was rough for at times they had to leap from one great rock to another or else let themselves down to wade through water and sand up to their knees the wind had calmed down yet once in a while it sent upon them a flurry of fine snow from the distant mountain tops  we are not getting ahead very fast puffed randy as he and the others came to a halt on a flat rock to rest weve been walking for three hours and i doubt if we have covered more than five miles  i heard at dyea that the thirteen miles to the entrance to the pass is considered a good days journey said earl im rather glad im not carrying that load salmon head has strapped to his back  it would take me a week to get that load up said randy i cant understand how those boys get along  its a matter of training said foster portney i dare say either of you can cut down a tree in half the time that those chilkoots can do it  on they went again the trail now growing steeper and more barren a few stunted firs lined the cañon and here and there could be seen a halfdead vine twisted about the fir branches and that was all so far as vegetation went and this was coming summer time  it must be dreariness itself in winter remarked earl to his uncle as they trudged along side by side i never saw anything so desolate not even in the wildest parts of maine  it is this desolate look which has kept men out of alaska earl many have known of there being gold there but they preferred to remain down in the states where living at least was more certain and congenial youll find my lad that you will need all your nerve and backbone to withstand what is before you perhaps i did wrong in urging you to join me  no you didntim glad i came and so is randy and well get through answered earl hastily oh look he pointed to where a flock of birds were circling far overhead shall i give them a shot  no no cried foster portney hastily i forgot to tell you i arranged with the indians that no shot should be fired on the trip excepting some one was in trouble and needed assistance ill inform the others and he halted for the others to come up  captain zoss provided the dinner at about one oclock all hands taking it easy on some clear rocks in the sunshine as may be supposed the fare was a plain one yet to randy and earl nothing had ever tasted better for climbing and the bracing mountain air gave them enormous appetites they could have eaten more than was provided but understood that from henceforth until further supplies were assured rations would be dealt out with a sparing hand  as soon as the dinner dishes had been cleaned and repacked the journey to sheep camp as the stoppingplace was called was renewed the trail was now steeper than ever and more than once the stream of water had to be crossed every one was suffering from wet feet but as all had on several pairs of heavy socks this did no further damage than to render them cold in their nether limbs as the trail grew rougher the indians who knew every footstep forged ahead and the others were allowed to shift for themselves  it was about the middle of the afternoon that randy and his uncle were walking one behind the other with captain zoss and dr barwaithe just in the rear the captain had been relating one of his experiences in mountain climbing in colorado to which all had listened with interest the story was finished and they were congratulating themselves that the end of the days tramp was close at hand when randy suddenly looked around in alarm  where is earl he asked  earl exclaimed mr portney why he is ahead isnt he  no he dropped behind to fix his boot was the quick reply earl earl  the cry was repeated and the others also took it up then they waited for an answer but none came earl had disappeared they waited for five minutes for him to make his reappearance but he did not come and then they started on a search for him     chapter xii  earl has an adventure   as randy had explained earl had stopped on the trail to fix his boot in crossing the mountain stream he had shipped a lot of water and he sat down on a rock and held up his foot to allow the water to run out on the ground  unfortunately for the youth he had rested on a rock which was by no means secure on the bank of the stream and now as he leaned to one side the rock slipped from its restingplace and down went poor earl into the water head first as luck would have it he struck in some loose sand otherwise he would have been seriously injured even as it was he was stunned for the moment and before he could turn he had gulped down a great deal of water he was nearly blinded by some fine sand getting into his eyes and began to flounder around as though in the midst of an ocean instead of a watercourse less than fifty feet wide and five feet deep  it took several minutes for him to save himself by reaching a large rock in the centre of the stream collecting his scattered senses he cleared his eyes as best he could and took a view of his situation  the rock was six feet in diameter and two feet above the top of the water on either side flowed the stream at a rate which he knew would be quite sufficient to take him off his feet should he attempt to ford to shore what was to be done in this emergency he did not at first know the others had gone on ahead and although he called to them no one heard his cry  had he had his gun he would have fired it had the weapon been in condition but less than quarter of an hour before he had passed the fowlingpiece over to captain zoss the captain having asked to inspect it he must help himself or go without assistance  standing on the rock he saw that escape to either side was out of the question and escape up the stream was also cut off below however were a series of rocks running off to shore and after some hesitation he dropped into the stream and allowed himself to be carried down to these rocks  five minutes of struggling in the current found him safe on the opposite shore to that upon which the lower portion of the trail to chilkoot pass lay the question now was how to get back to the other side of the river  ill walk along on this side until i get a chance to cross over he said half aloud and then the loneliness of his situation dawned upon him he struck out without delay determined to catch up with the others of the party as quickly as possible  for the first quarter of a mile earl did very well but soon he noted to his dismay that the stream was widening and that consequently he was getting further and further away from the other side he had been making his way along a cliff lined with short firs now the cliff came to an abrupt end and beyond he beheld nothing but a mass of jagged rocks and a jungle of brush to pass through which would be next to impossible  stumped now he muttered to himself and his face fell as he surveyed his situation the stream at this point was all of one hundred and fifty feet wide and the trail opposite was not close to the waters edge but wound in behind the rocks and fir trees  ive got to get over to that trail thats certain he went on after a disagreeable pause here goes to try the water again and with extreme care he began the descent of the cliff which was some twenty feet high the bottom was reached in safety and he found himself standing in water and sand half up to his knees  because of the widening of the stream at this point the current was not so strong and he began to wade in deeper and deeper until onequarter of the width had been passed and he found himself up to his waist he shivered with the cold and felt like going back but a few steps more brought him to a sandbar where the water scarcely touched his knees overjoyed at this he attempted to follow up the bar soon reaching and passing the middle of the river he was wading on more confidently than ever when of a sudden the bar came to an end and down he plunged into a pool over his head  the one thing to do now was to swim and earl struck out boldly for the shore still thirty feet away the weight of his heavy clothing was against him and the current carried him on and on down the stream and toward a mass of jagged rocks fearful to behold had he been of a less rugged temperament the cold water might have given him both a chill and a cramp  five minutes of fearful anxiety passed and earl was almost exhausted when putting his foot down he struck bottom at a depth of four feet this encouraged him and he renewed his effort to reach the bank beyond yet another pool had to be crossed and when finally he did pull himself out of the stream and safe up on a sloping rock he was too exhausted to do aught but lie down on his side and pant for breath  it was here that randy and his uncle found him just as he was making an effort to gain his feet and continue his search for them they were overjoyed to learn that he had not suffered serious injury they called to captain zoss and dr barwaithe who were close by and soon all were together again  captain zoss had an extra shirt in his pack and this earl borrowed along with a dry coat belonging to his uncle both articles of wearing apparel were too large for him but he gladly exchanged them for the time being for his wet ones and then the delayed journey toward sheep camp was continued  when the restingplace for the night was gained it was found that all of the indians had come in over an hour before and had sought out a comfortable camp for them under a large overhanging rock a number of others had also arrived and over a dozen tents had been pitched in addition to those already there according to lot it was randys turn to get a meal ready and he set to work without delay starting a roaring fire of pine branches and logs that earl might warm and dry himself dr barwaithe had brought with him a newly patented sheetiron camp stove and on this a pot of water was soon boiling to be used in making coffee while randy also offered them fried potatoes and a deliciously cooked fish one of the indians brought in  outside of the doctor who was not used to walking over such rough ground no one felt any ill effects of the days journey although all were glad to turn in at the earliest possible moment the doctor had worn a slight blister on his heel and in order to prevent this giving him serious concern later he put some salve on it and bound it up before retiring  ere they crawled into the tent both boys took a look at the great white mountains which loomed up before them here was the entrance to chilkoot pass and there almost lost among the clouds was the dreaded summit with mountains still higher on either side of it randy drew closer to earl as he surveyed the aweinspiring scene  earl weve got an everlasting hard climb before us he whispered do you think well make it  we must make it randy was the low and earnest reply it wont do to show the white feather now uncle would never forgive us  some parts of it look like crawling up the side of a house and randy shuddered if a fellow should fall hed break his neck sure  i guess youre right randy although it may not be so bad when one is right on top of it there is a sort of a trail you know although its not much i heard salmon head tell uncle he hoped it would be cold tomorrow night and that we should start for the pass about four or five oclock in the afternoon i wonder what he meant by that  i heard captain zoss speaking of it they start toward evening so as to pass the deepest snows on the summit about midnight when a crust forms to walk on for at this season of the year the deep snows are too soft to be trusted when the sun is shining  and what happens to a fellow i wonder if he breaks through the snow  i dont know im surei guess he goes to kingdom come and randy shuddered again well know all about it by this time tomorrow night and then both boys retired to dream of perilous climbs over the snowclad mountains and fearful falls into gigantic crevasses until both awoke in a fright and covered with cold perspiration  it was not until late that anybody was stirring the next day it was earls turn to get breakfast and he told them if they would wait he would treat them to freshly baked beans and hot bread and all waited while earl was at work with randy helping him two of the indian boys came up and their efforts at making themselves understood were laughable finally randy made out that they wanted an old silk neckerchief he possessed and he gave it to tomablink the older youth who was as proud of the article as if it had been worth a small fortune  under the advice of foster portney all took it easy in camp that day in order to reserve their strength for the struggle to come even the indians seemed to grow a bit uneasy concerning what was before them for although they had climbed over the pass a number of times they well knew what a rough and highly dangerous proceeding each new trip was likely to be on this terrible pass more than one indian and white man had been lost never to be heard of again  at last at exactly four oclock in the afternoon salmon head announced his readiness to start as chief of the indian party he had looked to it that each carriers pack was properly adjusted and now he gave several directions to the whites to the effect that they should keep together as much as possible and always in sight of his own people  dont think there be an easy this way or that he said in broken english indian know best way in the endyou follow him day and night or you lost stick foot deep down when climb and no let go with hands  his manner was so earnest all promised to remember his words then the crowd of whites and indians was gathered together the tents were struck and packed and the terrifying journey over the dreadful chilkoot pass was begun     chapter xiii  at the summit of chilkoot pass   at sheep camp which lay in something of a hollow there had been a goodly collection of trees and brush but now as the little party started on the journey to the summit of chilkoot pass all this was left behind and nothing confronted them but immense beds or glaciers of snow which crunched under their feet and gave forth a hollow sound at certain points they could plainly hear the rushing of water far beneath  gracious if a fellow went through this crust of snow what would happen to him said randy as he trudged on with his uncle just ahead of him and earl behind  let us hope that no such fate overtakes any of the party replied mr portney gravely it is not likely that one can break through here he added for the snow in the trail is pretty well packed down  the blinding glare of the sun had caused all to put on their smoked glasses or goggles but now as the great orb of day was lost to sight behind the mountain tops these protectors for the eyes were removed that they might see their way clearer the alaskan twilight was creeping on them causing all their surroundings to turn to a pale blue color the mists of the mountains were also rising and on every hand were weird ghostlike shadows which enhanced this scene of wild desolation  on and on went the white members of the party doing their best to keep the sturdy indian packcarriers well in sight but the red people with their hideously painted faces knew every foot of the way and made rapid progress and it was all the others could do at times to keep up  by ten oclock it began to grow colder and even the boys could feel the crust of snow on which they were trudging becoming firmer beneath their feet it was far from dark a pale glimmer of light hanging on every mountain top but now the trail became suddenly steeper and they found themselves going straight up the side of a hill several hundred feet high  plant your feet firmly at every step were foster portneys words of caution and remember looking back will do you no good  this last warning was for randys benefit for the lad had just looked back and shivered over the awful descent below him a fall would mean a long roll and a broken neck over a cliff below  captain zoss had gone on ahead with the indians and just before midnight he came back with a warning to watch out for several splits or crevasses in the glaciers they were now traversing  salmon head says he heard a report of several new ones just before starting and these are as yet unmarked he said  well be as careful as we can said dr barwaithe we can do no more  they now passed over a broad plain of snow where the mists hung more thickly than ever they had almost reached the centre of the plain when a loud cry from the indians ahead caused them to halt  what can be the meaning of that questioned earl can they be in trouble  presently from among the mists appeared the form of one of the indian carriers without his bundle he soon explained in broken english that he had been sent back by salmon head to warn them of a split in the ice field just ahead one of the indian women had slipped in and it was by mere good fortune that some of the men had rescued her  this indian remained with them until the crack was reached where he resumed his pack and went on the opening was an irregular one from four to eight feet wide and of unfathomable depth fortunately the sides were well defined and firm so they had small trouble in leaping across  it was good of them to send a man back said the doctor as he paused to peer down into the crevasse had we not been warned we might have slipped into that without knowing it  the trail now wound in and out among a number of small hills and once again the party ahead was lost to sight with the increasing cold came a stiff wind through the passes bringing down upon their heads a veritable storm of snow swept from the mountain tops above  i can readily understand how impossible it would be to make ones way through this pass during the winter said dr barwaithe a regular fall of snow would mean a blizzard down here and a snowing in from which there would be no escape until spring arrived  and think of the cold said earl phew the thermometer must go to about forty below zero  it does go as low as that at times replied his uncle no travelling through this pass during the long alaskan winter is entirely out of the question the man to undertake it would be a madman  they had come to the end of the comparatively level portion of the trail and now climbing so dangerous was at hand that little more was said from one steep icy elevation they would crawl to the next until several hundred feet up then came a turn around a cliff where the passageway was scarcely two feet wide with a wall on one side and what appeared misty bottomless space on the other here the indians had fastened a handrope which each was glad enough to clutch as he wormed his way along to safer ground  well i dont want any more of that said earl with a long sigh of relief a slip there and it would be goodby sure  yes and i guess they would never even get your body added randy  there was no time left to halt for the indians were pressing on their endurance and especially the endurance of the women and the boys proving a constant wonder to randy and earl the latter declaring that they must be tougher than pine knots to stand it  one more big climb boys and well be at the summit was the welcome announcement made by captain zoss but when earl and randy looked at the climb he mentioned their hearts fairly sank within them and they wondered how in the world they were going to make it without its costing them their lives  an almost sheer wall of ice and snow confronted them rising in an irregular form to a height of four hundred feet this cliff if such it might be called was more light at its top than at the base and consequently it appeared to stand out towards them as they gazed up at it along the face the indian packcarriers were crawling like flies on a lumpy whitewashed wall  we cant do began randy when he felt his arm pinched by earl  we must do it randy came back in a whisper the indians are doing it and so can weif well put our grit into it  now take it slow and be sure of one foot before you move the next said foster portney warning them again dig as deeply into the ice and snow as you can and above all things randy and earl dont look back and the uncle shook his fist to emphasize his words  a breathing spell was taken and then they started slowly for the base of the cliff where captain zoss got down on his knees to make sure that they were on the right trail if trail it could be called he soon announced that one party had gone up at one place and the others at a spot about thirty feet to the left  ill try my luck here he said and the doctor agreed to follow him there was no telling which trail was the better and the portneys took the other mr portney going first with randy next and earl last the uncle wished to make sure of the footing before he allowed the boys to come after him  the first hundred feet up were not as difficult as randy and earl had imagined but now every step had to be calculated and when half way up foster portney came to a halt  heres a very steep place he announced without however looking back randy when you reach it catch hold of the spur of ice with your left hand and put your foot just beneath it tell earl to do the same  i will answered randy but when the spot mentioned was reached poor randys heart leaped into his throat the sheer wall before him was nearly as high as a house and there was nothing to cling to but little lumps of ice which stuck out here and there the lumps might crack off and thenhe did not dare to think further than that he was strangely tempted to look below him but his uncles words of warning rang in his earsdont look back and he did not  one step was taken and then another and randy felt as if he was suspended in the air with nothing above or beneath him a brief vision of himself lying mangled far below flashed across his mind and he wished himself safe back in the woods of maine again what was all the gold in alaska worth alongside of such an agonizing risk of life as this  but he must go on he could not remain where he was forever the next step was even more difficult and he held his breath as he took it he had been climbing up the cliff for less than quarter of an hour yet he felt a year older than when he had begun would the climb never come to an end  take it easy boys we are almost there came the encouraging voice of foster portney although the uncle was almost as fearful as his nephews a little to the right now and beware of those snow lumps they are not firm enough to hold to i can see the top just above my head ah here i am now randy another step and give me your hand now earl take the same step randy took there you are thank god we are safe so far  the two boys echoed their uncles sentiment with a deep feeling in their hearts which they never forgot the summit of chilkoot pass had been reached at last     chapter xiv  boatbuilding at lake linderman   the portneys having reached the highest point of chilkoot pass were presently joined by captain zoss and dr barwaithe who had gone through a similar experience to that just described the doctor had once come very close to losing his footing and he declared that he would not make the climb again for a million dollars  they stopped for a few minutes to view the scene from the edge of the cliff on either side were the still taller mountains while below them stretched that portion of the pass just travelled like a valley of glittering ice thick with mist and windswept snow an intense silence reigned broken occasionally by the booming and crunching of some immense glacier in the distance  a grand scene but one not particularly suited to my feelings said the doctor let us go on  yes the sooner we git out o this yere pass the better i will be pleased added the captain ive had enough climbin ter last me two lifetimes eh and he gave a grunt and strode off and the others followed  that is i believe the most perilous part of the trip to the gold fields remarked foster portney of course we have still a good bit of rough country to traverse and rapids in the rivers to shoot but nothing quite so bad as that  the ice fields from the summit sloped gradually downward to a basin some distance below called crater lake this little lake was frozen solid from top to bottom and covered with snow it was hemmed in on three sides by tall mountains while on the fourth there was a cañonlike opening where an icebound stream led the way over rocks and tiny cliffs to lake linderman at the end of the pass just before reaching the latter lake they passed several large posts set up close to the trail which was now once more clearly defined  those are surveyors posts said foster portney in reply to a question from earl we have just passed from united states into british territory  this then is the northwest territory said earl  yes my boy and the entire klondike region from ogilvie to belle isle is in that territory  as they descended to the lower level of the pass the solid ice gave way to rotten ice and slush in which they frequently sank to their ankles here the stream broadened out into several ponds and finally ended in a wide marshy expanse forming the upper end of lake linderman along the edge of this marsh they picked their way first however stopping for dinner for the night had passed and the forenoon had been consumed in the journey from crater lake the indians kept pressing on and they followed  it was dark again when they came up at last with their packcarriers encamped under some timber which stood on a little bluff not over two hundred feet from the lake salmon heads party had started a rousing fire and this was a welcome sight for it made all feel more at home no time was lost in getting out the cooking utensils and the doctors stove and while they were preparing other things the indians brought several fish from the lake to be baked  i guess well get our fill of fish before long remarked earl  dont you want any now smiled his uncle  want any uncle foster indeed i do why im so hungry i could almost eat horse meat was earls earnest reply and he bustled around with the cups and plates that they might not be delayed as soon as the coffee biscuits and fish were done  the indians remained near by all night and early in the morning a general reckoningup took place and the packcarriers were paid off in gold and silver not caring to take the paper money which was offered all had done very well and foster portney captain zoss and dr barwaithe did not dispute the amounts asked although they were a trifle high as soon as they were paid off the indians packed up their own articles but a handful in number and hurried away in the direction whence they had come  good gracious are they going right back to dyea exclaimed randy in amazement  yes my lad was captain zosss answer salmon head calculates to pilot another lot o miners over as soon as possible its his hayin time ye see an he intends ter make the most o it  at this earl laughed i guess hes not going to let his legs get stiff he cried im as stiff as an old mule this morning whats to do today  well locate some timber for boatbuilding said his uncle and get our traps into shape and then rest there is no use in killing ourselves all at once weve got a matter of five hundred miles to journey yet  if we go up into the timber i suppose we can try our hand at shooting something if anything turns up said randy  certainly shoot all the game you can boys well want it to help eke out our stores  there were numerous odds and ends to do about the camp and it was not until after dinner that they started into the timber to select some wood which might be used in boatbuilding it was now that the boys knowledge of timber stood them in good stead and it took but a short while to pick out a tree which was closegrained and comparatively free from knots they had brought their axes with them and had the tree down in short order then they lopped off the branches and cut off the top and left it in the sun to dry out as much as possible before attacking it with their boatbuilding tools  this accomplished earl and randy set off the former with the shotgun and the other with his pistol to stir up whatever might be around in the way of game they followed the edge of the cliff to where it sloped down to the lake shore  presently earl thought he saw something in the brush along the water front and taking up a halfdecayed stick he threw it at the spot at once there was a squawk and half a dozen wild geese arose in the air bang went the shotgun and crack went randys pistol and three of the geese were seen to throw back their heads and sink  we hit em cried randy and ran down followed by his brother two of the fowls were dead and the other was speedily put out of its misery by earl with a blow from the gunstock they had been cautioned not to waste their ammunition so had not ventured a second round at the balance of the flock  these ought to make good eating observed randy as he picked up the game that is if they dont taste too fishy here is my bullet hole right through the neck you killed the other two  with the dead geese over their shoulders they continued their hunt for game and presently stirred up a number of wild birds at which earl blazed away bringing down five the birds were small and hardly worth the trouble of cleaning and cooking yet they took them along  geese eh exclaimed captain zoss as they entered camp wall thats not so bad we kin have a goose potpie o one and stuff the other with bread an beans eh all hands agreed this would be an excellent plan and the boys set about cleaning the game without delay the captain assisting them at the work  toward night they espied a band of indians coming down the trail with their packs and followed by half a dozen miners a hardy but not an evillooking crowd the miners had left dyea twentyfour hours later than themselves and had brought with them the material for a flatbottomed scow fifteen feet long and four feet wide the indians had carried this material over the pass but how it had been accomplished was a mystery to the boys and the others  hang me if i dont reckon they have a secret way o their own was captain zosss comment they couldnt cart them boards up that steep cliff nohow and randy and earl were half inclined to believe the captains suspicions to be true  the miners who went by the name of the idaho crowd because they came from that state encamped next to the doctors crowd as they were speedily termed on account of having a medical man with them and all became well acquainted before night the idaho crowd had just heard of an extra large find being made on gold bottom creek which flowed into the klondike river and they were anxious to get up there without delay and consequently spent half the night in putting their boat together for an early start on the following morning  youre the fust boys ive heerd tell on bound for the gold diggins said one of the men to randy and earl im afeard yell find it kinder tough luck for as far ez i kin understand it is tough even on a man whar are ye from californy  no from the backwoods of maine answered earl and we are used to roughing it  gee shoo didnt know the news had struck out so allfired far ez thet wall if youre from the backwoods taint likely youll suffer ez much ez some of the tenderfoots wots older wish ye the best o luck and the man turned away to his boatbuilding again  eight oclock of the following morning found the idaho crowd on its way down lake linderman in the meantime the boys foster portney and captain zoss had started into the timber with their tools leaving dr barwaithe to watch camp and bake several days supply of bread and biscuits and also to parboil some beans for baking  the tree selected for cutting up had been allowed to fall over a large flat rock and now the first work was to prop up the lower end this done both ends were sawed off even and a good portion of the bark was scaled off then earl and randy sharpened up several wedges and tried their hands at splitting up the trunk into a suitable size for whipsawing  this was no light work and had they not had a knowledge of woodcraft it would have been next to impossible to do what the lads aided by their uncle and the captain accomplished by nightfall the tree was split and sawed up into more than a dozen slabs of varying thickness and these were laid out for working up in the morning  when the party returned to the edge of the lake they found that three other crowds had come in over the pass and there was quite a settlement of tents alongshore in one of the parties there was a young woman the wife of a prospector who had stood the arduous climb nearly as well as any one  hullo portney suddenly cried a voice to earl as he was walking around among the tents i didnt know you had got this far  earl turned swiftly and was nearly dumfounded to find himself confronted by tom roland while jasper guardley stood but a few feet away     chapter xv  on to lake bennett   the face of tom roland wore a smile but in his eyes was an anxious look which earl did not fail to notice as he surveyed the two acquaintances from basco the young prospector was much taken aback by this sudden appearance for he had not dreamed of meeting roland and guardley in this outoftheway spot  aint you glad to see a feller from maine went on roland as earl did not speak and he held out his hand which the youth took rather coldly guardley had come up to shake hands too but now he did not risk making the offer  are you two bound for the klondike at length asked earl  of course was rolands sharp reply what else would we be doing up here  what started youthe fact that we were going  well i allow as that had a little to do with it earl but guardley got a letter from a friend of his who is up there nowa man named stephens he said guardley ought to come up at once and as he didnt want to go alone i came along how are you making out  we are doing very well  you and your brother came on with your uncle didnt you  yes  any others in the party  yes two men  tom rolands eyes dropped for a moment me and guardley have been havin rather a hard road of it all alone he went on weve been thinking of joining forces with somebody  well our crowd is complete answered earl quickly  then you wont consider taking in two more providing of course we do our share of work and pay our share of the expenses  i dont think so roland  who is at the head of your party  nobody in particular we all work together  maybe you had better speak to the boys uncle put in guardley come on  he stalked off and after some slight hesitation tom roland followed with earl at his side foster portney was found mending a corner of the tent which had become torn in packing randy was beside him and uttered a cry when he beheld the two men from basco  tom roland and jasper guardley he whispered to his uncle those are the fellows we thought got that money on a false identification  is that so returned foster portney what can earl be bringing them here for  this is mr portney i take it said guardley after clearing his throat awkwardly i was thinking  he and his friend want to join us put in earl i told them that our party was complete  hullo randy broke in roland carelessly youd like us to come into your crowd wouldnt you  randy was staggered at the request coming so unexpectedly he glanced at earl before replying no i guess not he said  why whats the matter with you cried roland half angrily we are all maine folks and friends ought to stick together seems to me  he turned to foster portney and introduced himself and guardley and stated his case adding that he and his companion only wanted to join some party until dawson city was reached mr portney listened quietly and then turned to captain zoss who stood near  i dont believe we want any more in our crowd do you  i reckon weve got aplenty was the captains answer still if they are friends to the boys  but they are not whispered earl and what is more we consider them doubtful characters  then we dont want em nohow  this camp is full came from inside where dr barwaithe sat examining his sore foot which was neither better nor worse that boat we are building wont hold more than five people along with our outfits  the faces of both roland and guardley grew dark all right if you dont want us well hook fast somewhere else muttered roland and turned on his heel  maybe youll regret throwing us off some day came from guardley as he passed earl and then the two men were lost to sight among the tents up the lake shore  oh what cheek burst from randy when they were gone i wouldnt have roland in the party for a farm  id be afraid of guardleys stealing everything we had said earl as if we didnt know his real character and that he had been up before judge dobson lots of times  i reckon theyll stand watching especially that last curfrom what he said to randy said captain zoss hes got a bad eye he has eh  all hands slept soundly after their hard days work in the timber and it was not until they heard others stirring in the morning that they arose as he was not working on the boat dr barwaithe took it upon himself to perform the household duties as he expressed it and soon a wellcooked breakfast was arranged on a rude table captain zoss had stuck up the doctor was an excellent cook and foster portney could not help but ask him whence his knowledge had been derived  its easily explained said the doctor i have an older sister who was once the head of a cooking school in montreal she insisted on it that every one should know how to cook especially a bachelor like myself and she used to deliver her lectures to me at home before delivering them at the school i believe i was an apt pupil but i never dreamed at that time of how useful the knowledge would become  which goes for to prove a feller cant know too much remarked captain zoss but come on he added draining off his big tin cup of coffee and springing up that ere boat aint going to build itself and off he hurried for the woods carrying all of the tools he could carry in a moment the boys and foster portney followed him  they found the rough slabs of lumber as they had left them and sticking them up in convenient places began the task of smoothing them off into boards working first with their axes and then with the drawingknife and the plane it was no light labor and night was again upon them by the time the boards were ready and hauled to the edge of the lake after supper foster portney brought out a measuringrule and marked off the different parts of the boat which was to be a flatbottom affair with a blunt stern and rather a longpointed bow  another day at lake linderman saw the craft put together false bottom seats and all it was a clumsy affair and they were glad that they had enough oakum and pitch along to make her fairly watertight the other parties in camp were also boatbuilding and the scene in the clear and fairly warm weather was a busy one  randy had cut down a small straight tree for a mast and this was easily set in place and held by guards running across from one gunwale to another the yard and the boom of this mast were primitive affairs to be put up whenever desired  as soon as the pitch had hardened preparations for leaving the camp were made all the goods and tools were packed up into the smallest possible space and stored on board of the wild goose as randy had christened the craft the eatables clothing and blankets being placed on top so as not to be injured by the water which might get in the last thing to be taken down was the tent the fly of which was then adjusted for a sail  all aboard cried randy as he leaped into the bow with earl behind him captain zoss followed them to help keep a lookout ahead while mr portney and dr barwaithe took places in the stern one to manage the rudder and the other with an oar ready for use should they run upon a bar or mudflat  lake linderman is but a few miles long lying in the midst of snowclad mountains similar to those left behind although not quite so high at its lower end it connects with lake bennett by a short river where are situated the homan rapids these rapids are among the most dangerous encountered in sailing along the headwaters of the yukon and are feared more by some miners than are the famous white horse rapids which the party must pass through later on to avoid the homan rapids many miners travelled straight from chilkoot pass to lake bennett before stopping to build their boats  but it was all new territory to our party for even foster portney in his previous trip to alaska had not passed in this direction a stiff breeze sent them on their way down lake linderman and all expressed themselves as well satisfied with the sailing qualities of the wild goose  were coming to the end of the lake observed earl when scarcely an hour had passed there is the river over to the right  in a few minutes more the sail was lowered and they came to anchor at the mouth of the river the water at this point was smooth enough but some distance ahead could be seen the leaping and swirling whitecaps of the rapids leading to the lake below  illustration the water was boiling on every sidepage 125  i reckon well have to take a line ashore and haul her through observed captain zoss after an examination of the situation we dont want to run no risk of bein upsot so early in the game  this was agreed to and the captain and dr barwaithe took one line to the left shore and foster portney and randy another to the right leaving earl to steer or use the rudder as might be best  some loose ice floating along the lake shores had partly choked the stream but there was a clear place near the centre and into this the wild goose drifted it was not long before she was caught in the strong current which sent the ice cakes crunching and banging along her sides and the spray flying up into earls face he had started to use the rudder but now saw this was useless and sprang forward with the long oar  steady to the left not to the right swing her around a bit you fellows over there easy now easy shove off from that rock earl now then let her down a few feet that was a narrow shave boys there you go again steady now steady steady  so the cries and directions ran on as the boat proceeded on her perilous voyage the water was boiling on every side and the lines which held the craft were as tight as whipcords considerable water had been shipped and earl was wet from head to foot but he kept his place and shoved off this way and that with might and main  hold hard suddenly shouted foster portney look out earl the line is going to break  the words were hardly spoken when snap went the line the boat end hitting earl a sharp crack in the neck thus released the wild goose swung around and made straight for a series of rocks which all had been working hard to avoid should she strike she would become a total wreck beyond a doubt and all their outfits would be lost     chapter xvi  an exciting night in camp   when the line parted foster portney and randy were thrown flat on their backs in the six inches of slush and water in which they had been wading along the edge of the rapids but they did not care for this the one thought of both was of earl and how the boat would fare now that there was only one line by which to guide her  as for earl the shock also caused him to lose his balance and he went down heavily on one of the packs with which the wild goose was freighted but he recovered instantly and sprang to the bow oar in hand the craft had swung around as has been related and was on the point of smashing on the rocks when he put out the oar and tried to sheer off  hold her hold her roared captain zoss to earl take the line but dont pull he added to the doctor and the next instant he was in the icy water up to his waist he could not reach the bow of the boat but he gained the stern and catching hold of the rudder he swung the wild goose in toward a rock and held her there  throw the broken line to earl and let him tie it quick he shouted to foster portney but the broken line was floating amid the loose ice and it was several seconds before it could be secured in that time the current again caught the boat from another direction and sheering along the rocks in front the craft made a wild plunge ahead and downward dragging the captain in her wake  earl will be killed groaned randy and his heart leaped into his throat as the wild goose seemed swallowed up in the foaming and boiling waters below them his uncle did not reply but darted out of the water and down the bank of the river as fast as his feet could carry him dr barwaithe who had been compelled to let go the line in order to save himself was also running and now randy likewise took to his heels  fortunately for earl he kept his wits about him even though he realized the great peril he was in in previous years he had helped raft lumber in maine during the spring freshets so that the situation was not such a novel one but there was a vast difference between steering logs which could not be harmed and navigating a boat loaded with all their possessions and he felt the responsibility he clung to the long oar and used it as best he could whenever the opportunity offered which was not often  in less than ten minutes the ride was over and the wild goose shot with a swish into lake bennett by this time captain zoss had managed to crawl on board and give earl a helping hand the craft had struck a dozen times twice rather sharply but beyond a scraping on one side and a slight crack in the bow which was speedily caulked up she escaped injury the two on board ran to one shore to take dr barwaithe on board and then stood over to where mr portney and randy awaited them  that was a providential escape were foster portneys words when he saw that earl was safe i wouldnt have you run such a risk again for a fortune  and i dont want to run such a risk again replied earl with rather a sickly smile he was greatly shaken up and it was a long while before he felt like himself randy could hardly keep from hugging his brother because of the escape  it was a fool move of ours from the start said captain zoss speaking plainly for the icy bath had not improved his temper we should have packed our outfits along the river and let the boat take care of herself with plenty of lines to guide her i wont stand fer any such move as that agin not much eh  you are right captain said foster portney gravely well be more cautious in the future  yes yes broke in the doctor what should we have done had this young man been killed and all our traps been lost it would have been better to have carried boat and all around from one lake to the next  it was a sober party which went into camp that night on the rather rocky shore of lake bennett sober and rather out of sorts in the bargain the captain insisted on building an immense fire and while he sat drying himself by it he found fault with everything which came into view later on the others of the crowd found that the captain got these moods every once in a while and never meant all he said but now they did not know this and it made the two boys at least unhappy  might have knowed it grumbled captain zoss with two kids along instead o nothing but growedup men as know their business the next time i jine a crowd it will be o those as has at least voted eh  i cant agree with you that it was the boys fault replied dr barwaithe the line broke and that started the whole thing  well boys is boys and men wouldnt have let sech a thing happen snapped the captain see yere i want my coffee hot he roared to randy who was preparing supper no lukewarm dishwater fer me eh  ill give it to you as hot as the fire will make it i cant do any more was randys short answer he was as much out of sorts as any one then the captain turned to earl and found fault with the timber in the boat and by the time they sat down to eat all felt thoroughly put out  the doctor tried to enliven matters by relating some of his experiences in college and he even gave them a song or two for he was a good singer with a sweet tenor voice all enjoyed the singing but the captain looked as glum as ever  im sorry weve got that old curmudgeon along said earl as he and randy turned in together on the rubber blanket gracious i never imagined he could be so disagreeable  nor i grumbled his brother and to think that we have got to put up with him until we reach the gold diggings  the tent had been pitched in the shelter of a number of high rocks and at some distance from the lake front the wild goose rested in a tiny cove secured by a painter attached to a stake driven deeply into the sandy shore there was a little swell on the water caused by the rising wind but no one supposed this would prove sufficient to do the craft any harm  as they expected to remain in that camp but one night only a single tent had been erected for the entire party so all hands were huddled closely together it was not long before they were all asleep  when earl awoke it was still dark he roused up with a start to find the wind blowing violently outside it was raining and snowing together and it was some snow on his face which had caused him to awake he was about to get up when randy called to him  whats up  theres a storm on snow and rain and i guess well have to look to the fastenings of the tent answered earl  the talking awoke the others the wind was increasing rapidly and already the front left end of the tent was flapping violently torn loose from its pegging earl donned his overcoat and ran outside to hold it down while he called to randy to bring the hammer with which to bury the pegs anew  fasten her tight ill take a look after the boat cried captain zoss and rushed off in the darkness followed by foster portney by this time the doctor was also out and he and the boys began the task of securing the shelter a heavy gust of wind came on and in a flash the canvas was sailing high in the air held down only by the pegs on one side to secure the cloth was no mean work and they had to wait for fully a minute in the rain and snow until the wind abated  this is going to the gold diggings with a vengeance murmured dr barwaithe  a fellow could most fly there in this wind panted randy earl have you a peg handy  not a one  neither have i and its as dark as pitch  here are two pegs said the doctor i wonder if i can stir up that fire he added starting to where the campfire had been the fire was out and the sheetiron stove lay over on its side with a mess of beans overturned in the oven to light a new fire under existing circumstances was out of the question and the medical man went back to assist the boys  the tent had hardly been secured when there came a great flurry of snow which almost blinded them randy had been for running down to the lake but now he crawled under the canvas and hesitated in the meantime dr barwaithe set the stove up once more and tried to rescue such of the beans as were worth it  the rain is giving way to snow began earl when he stopped short as a faint shout reached them through the whistling wind its uncles voice we are wanted down there he added and started off on a run as the cry was repeated randy followed a minutes run and they reached the beach a hundred feet above where captain zoss and foster portney were standing  whats the matter demanded earl quickly  the boat is gone was his uncles alarming reply she has drifted off in the storm and we cant catch sight of her anywhere     chapter xvii  a hunt for food   randy and earl were much dismayed by their uncles announcement the wild goose had disappeared where to ah that was the question in vain they tried to pierce the darkness of the night and the snowsquall nothing in the shape of a craft could be discerned upon the broad waters of lake bennett  i told ye to mind how ye tied up that yere craft growled captain zoss wrathfully to earl any lubber could have tied her up better than you did  you expect me to do everything retorted earl beginning to lose his temper too i did the best i could why didnt you look after it  he was too busy taking it easy by the fire put in randy bound to stand up for his brother as well as to put in a shot for himself  none o your impudence boy roared the captain and he turned as if to strike randy but now foster portney caught his arm and threw it back  stop it all of you said he this is no time to quarrel the wind and not earl is responsible for this for i looked to the tying up myself after he was done were all out of sorts but we neednt act like children over it our duty is to find the boat and that as quickly as possible  i reckon shes gone down the lake grumbled the captain after an awkward pause the winds that way  well go down and see if we cant sight her answered foster portney  away they went on a run earl who was tall and light in weight easily outdistanced the rest and reached a rocky cliff where the lake made a slight bend he went up the cliff to stumble headlong into a narrow gulch cutting his chin and his left hand picking himself up he started on but soon stopped i ought to warn the others was his thought and he turned and hurried back  captain zoss was ahead of the others and was on top of the cliff when earl shouted to him stop captain stop or youll get hurt came at the top of his voice and the captain halted just in time to save himself from a disastrous fall he climbed down the gulch and up at the other side and yelled a warning to those behind soon all four stood upon another level stretch of the lake shore  nothing was to be seenthat is nothing but the flying snowflakes dropping into the windswept and whitecapped waters beneath they continued to walk on until the cold chilled each to the marrow of his bones  we might as well get back and wait till morning said foster portney with a heavy sigh we can do nothing in the darkness let us hope the boat will beach herself somewhere and remain rightside up  with chattering teeth they started on the return randy by his uncles side and earl behind captain zoss half the distance to the tent had been covered when the captain paused and ranged up beside earl  earl you mustnt mind me when i git in my tantrums he said jerkily i git em every once in a while see its nateral with meallers was but i aint bad at heart an i shant forgit ye for savin me a dirty fall mark that and its not your fault the boat is goneanything would have torn loose in this yere gale he paused for a moment an i didnt mean ter hit randyits only a way i have ter frighten folksa poor way too as i acknowledge come on and before earl could reply he was stalking on his head bent far down to keep the snow from his eyes earl clung close to him and from that night he and the captain were better friends than ever later on randy received a like apology and when he got to know the captain better voted him all right though a bit cranky at times  dr barwaithe was as dismayed as any of them had been when the news was broken to him but he agreed that nothing was to be accomplished while the darkness and the storm lasted he had dragged the cooking stove up to the entrance to the tent and was trying to start a fire twice the tiny flames had flickered and gone out but now fanned vigorously the wood caught and soon the stove was redhot the top spluttering with the snowflakes which fell upon it the fire warmed the air in the tent and for the balance of the night the party rested comfortably in body if not in mind  with the coming of morning the storm abated and by eight oclock the sun was struggling to shine through the drifting clouds the captain as if to atone for his misdeeds prepared breakfast giving to earl and randy the best of the flapjacks turned out the captain was a great hand at these cakes and the party was certain to get them whenever he was cook  for all we know the boat may have gone clear down to the entrance to tagish lake remarked foster portney while finishing the repast i see nothing for us to do but to walk along the lake shore and keep our eyes open  shall we take our traps along asked the doctor i can carry the cook stove if you can divide the rest of the stuff among you  a short discussion followed and feeling certain the boat had gone down the lake if anywhere it was decided by all hands to pack the outfit and take it along the packing took some time and when the start was made the storm had cleared away entirely leaving the sky as bright as one could wish  a mile of the shore had been covered when foster portney called a halt and directed attention to an object floating in the direction from which they had come its a boat he cried a moment later  our boat questioned randy eagerly  i cant say mr portney and the others watched the craft with interest no its not our boat but another and there are several people on board  lets hail em and git em to search for the wild goose said captain zoss and they walked back and after some trouble succeeded in attracting the attention of the party on the water there were three men in the boat and a woman the latter being the same they had met in camp at lake linderman to all the newcomers foster portney told his story  o course well help you said the miner who had his wife on board one o you can git aboard here and well cruise around the lake on a hunt aint got room fer more n one he went on and say whos the doctor among ye  i am responded dr barwaithe  then you might ez well do the trick fer lizy here dont feel extry well an it will be fair play fer you to give her some medicine i take it  ill do what i can for her said the doctor but most of my medicines are on board of the lost boat  then weve got ter find her sure pop fer lizy does feel most distressin like with a pain in her head an a crick in her back went on wodley the miner  the doctor hopped on board and after a few words more the boat set off in search of the wild goose and the hunt from the lake shore was continued slowly the forenoon wore away and still nothing was seen of the missing craft the other boat with the doctor had long since been lost to view up the lake  it was getting toward supper time when foster portney turned to earl who in addition to some of the camping outfit carried the shotgun i just caught a glance of something on legs up among yonder rocks he said if you can you might as well knock it over for it wont be long before all of us will want something to eat  earl was glad enough to try his hand at hunting and turned over his traps to his companions soon he was climbing the rocks to which his uncle had pointed he had not gone over five hundred feet when he beheld a small deer gazing at him in alarm before he could draw a bead on the animal the deer was gone behind a neighboring cliff  feeling moderately sure that this was the animal his uncle had seen and that the deer would not go far but might even come back out of curiosity earl began to climb the cliff a profusion of brush grew among the rocks and these afforded him a good handhold and he was soon at the top  although hemmed in on three sides by mountains the way to the lake was clear and looking in that direction he saw far to the opposite shore the boat containing dr barwaithe and their newly made friends he watched the boat for a minute when a clatter of sharp hoofs on the cliff made him whirl around just in time to catch a second sight of the deer his gun came up quick enough now and the charge took the animal full in the breast  struck in this fashion many an animal would have rolled over dead but the deer of alaska which are growing more scarce every year are a sturdy lot and though terribly wounded this specimen did not drop staggering for a brief moment he turned and then fled in the direction from which he had come  earl was amazed but determined not to lose his game after such a shot he hastily reloaded and made after the game less than two score of steps brought him almost to the end of the cliff and he discovered the deer crouched in the shelter of the rocks its dark eyes glaring angrily up came his gun and the weapon was discharged just as the animal sprang forward the shot was a glancing one doing little harm and the next instant the wounded beast was upon the boy     chapter xviii  on to the white horse rapids   for a brief instant as the deer rushed upon him earl was fairly paralyzed having had no idea that the wounded animal might attack him but as those glaring eyes came closer and the antlers were lowered he realized that something must be done and leaped to the inner side of the narrow cliff  crash the deer had struck him on the arm it was a heavy blow and only the sharp rock to one side of him saved the youth from serious injury then as the animal bounded back for a second attack earl shoved out the gun pressed it at the deers breast and sent the beast tumbling from the cliff into the gulch below it was done so rapidly that the animal had no time to save itself it went down with a crash and a dull thud and looking over the rocks the boy saw that it lay on its back unable to run off on account of a broken leg as soon as he could he reloaded the shotgun and put his game out of its misery  that was a narrow escape and no fooling he half muttered as he looked about for some place where he might descend to the bottom of the gulch a quarter of an hour later he had the deer bound on top of a tree branch and was dragging it toward the lake shore  a deer cried randy and foster portney simultaneously as they caught sight of the prize well that was well worth going after continued the latter  you had a narrow escape exclaimed randy when earls story was told if you hadnt shoved him over he would have gored you to death  it was quite dark by the time they went into camp the deer was soon cut up and they dined that evening on the choicest of venison steak the remainder of the meat was hung up to dry while a portion of it was thoroughly salted  in addition to the fire in the camp stove a big blaze was lit on the shore that dr barwaithe and the others might be guided hither if they succeeded in finding the wild goose but the night wore away without interruption and by six oclock the next morning the search for the missing craft was renewed  were most down to tagish lake i reckon remarked captain zoss i dont believe the wild goose could go through ceptin she was bottom side up and minus our traps which i dont hope fer eh  the entrance to tagish lake was reached and they were speculating on what to do next when randy shouted here they come and they have the wild goose in tow  his announcement proved correct and quarter of an hour later wodley sent his own craft up to the bank with a swish through the watergrass and tundra or moss which was now beginning to show itself on every side the wild goose was close behind and they noted with satisfaction that she seemed to be in the same condition as they had left her  we found her stuck in the mud on the other side announced dr barwaithe the wind had just sent her along and left her and the only damage done is to some of the provisions which were soaked by the rain and snow  we can be thankful its not worse replied foster portney if she had not turned up i dont know what we would have done  dr barwaithe had become well acquainted with the party and had given mrs wodley some medicine containing a large quantity of quinine for the woman was suffering from chills and fever something frequently met with in alaska  it did not take long for both parties to haul their boats into tagish lake and once on that broad sheet of water all sail was set for the six miles of river which connects that body of water with marsh lake called by many mud lake on account of its shallowness and soft bottom  as they skimmed along earl and randy under the directions of their uncle sorted over the provisions putting aside for immediate use such as would not keep after being wet this had scarcely been finished when the end of tagish lake appeared in sight  there is some sort o a camp ahead announced captain zoss dont look like er miners strike either injuns ill bet  the captain was right the camp was a rude one consisting of half a dozen huts and dugouts the indians numbered about two score and they were the most disagreeable randy and earl had yet beheld each was painted from forehead to chin with greasy black and red paint and all wore filthy skin suits which could be smelt further than you could see them according to randys notion the indians tried to sell them some fish but the members of the party declined and pointed to the deer meat then one of the indians begged earl to let him have the deers head and antlers for a string of beautiful pike and the youth made the trade for although he would have liked to keep the trophy carrying it up into the gold regions was out of the question the deer meat had been divided with the wodley party and now a similar disposition was made of the fish  the day was fine with the wind in the right direction and soon they came to the end of marsh lake which is fifteen miles long and heavily fringed on all sides with timber and brush on several occasions they ran in water so shallow they were in danger of going aground but the sharp eyes of captain zoss saved them and the second day saw them encamped within sight of the fiftymile river which connects marsh lake with lake labarge the last of the lakes they were to traverse on the way to the gold regions  by day after tomorrow well strike the white hoss rapids said captain zoss then i reckon well have jest sech a time as we had up ter homan rapids  excuse me rejoined earl one such experience is enough in a lifetime  i have been talking to wodley put in foster portney he has been through the rapids and he says he will give us a hand when we get there he advises taking the boats through almost empty  the captain allowed this would be safer although to be sure it would also be far more laborious for everything not left in the boat would have to be carried over the roughest kind of a trail running some distance away from the stream  the two parties camped side by side and it made each feel more at home to have the other at hand for among these lofty and coldlooking mountains one was very apt to have a lonely feeling creeping over him if no companion were at hand  how a man could attempt this trip all alone is something i cant understand observed randy imagine getting lost in those mountains over yonder it makes a fellow shiver to think of it  men have been lost out here replied dr barwaithe gravely and lost so thoroughly they have never been heard of again if a man gets lost in the mountains and he is of a nervous temperament the chances are that after a week or a month of it he will lose his mind and go crazy  i guess that is what would happen to me answered randy oh whats that stung me a mosquito i declare who would expect to find one of those pests at this season of the year  youll get mosquitoes enough presently replied foster portney dont you remember the mosquito netting i brought along during the short summer here the insects are apt to worry the life out of a person  i suppose they thrive in this moss that i see around said earl what did you say it was called uncle foster tundra  yes tundra earl the moss is thicker than this up in the north and covers everything if it wasnt for the moss i think the ground might thaw out more in the summer but as it is the moss prevents the sun from striking in and the ground is as hard as in midwinter six or eight feet below the surface  the moss doesnt seem to have any effect on the berry bushes though said randy i see em everywhere do they bear fruit  oh yes they have everything in the way of berries up here randy but they are rather small and they havent the flavor of those at home the berries have to take the place of larger fruits such as apples pears and peaches and the birds live on them  well we wont starve as long as we have berries birds and fish said earl i dont see where this cry of starvation comes in i must say  o course ye dontnot now burst in captain zoss but wait till winter sets in then the berries will be gone an birds will be mighty scarce  but well have the fish captain we can cut holes in the ice on the river and spear them as we do down in maine  wall maybe my lad but ye dont catch me atryin it when i kin git anything elsenot with the ice eight or ten feet thick an the mercury down to forty below nuthin at all  it was not long after that they turned in and never did they sleep more soundly although a number of mosquitoes visited them foster portney was the first to get up and by the time the boys followed a delicious smell of frying fish and boiling coffee was floating through the air  a ten minutes ride on the lake brought them close to the entrance of the river here the water was broken up into a dozen currents swirling this way and that and throwing the spray in every direction on either side of this watercourse were high walls  now fer the tug o war said captain zoss and immediate preparations were made to shoot the cañon and the falls of which randy and earl had heard so much once past that dangerous spot the remainder of the trip to the gold regions would be an easy one     chapter xix  nearing the end of a long journey   both earl and randy had heard from the miner wodley that it was only of late years that prospectors after gold in alaska had had the daring to shoot the white horse rapids of which even the indians in their light canoes were afraid formerly white men had packed everything even to their boats round the dangerous runs of water a task which to them looked herculean when they gazed at the tall mountains and at the crooked trail wodley pointed out  after much talking by all hands it was decided that wodleys boat should go through first loaded down only with the mining tools which would not suffer from getting wet wodley was at first going to take the trip alone leaving his wife and the other miners of the party to join the portney crowd but at the last moment captain zoss asked to be allowed to take a hand and the offer was accepted  the sail was taken from the buster as wodley had named his craft a heavyset affair built to stand some rough usage and each armed with an oar and a heavy pole the two men shoved off from the rocky shore a few strokes sufficed to send them into the current and fairly caught the boat swung around and started on her mad career through the cañon of rocks and water and flying spray  shes off shouted earl and followed by randy he sped alongshore and up to the edge of the cañon where he might see what progress was made but hardly had they reached a convenient spot when the buster shot along far beneath them and around a bend and was hidden from view in the midst of a whirlpool of waters that threatened each instant to ingulf her  if she isnt smashed up before she reaches the end of the cañon then ill miss my guess ejaculated earl my but how she did spin along  wodley ought to know what hes doing answered randy if she is smashed up i hope he and the captain come out alive  they returned to where the others had been left and took up the heavy packs which had been assigned to them all the things to be carried had been equally divided among the men and the boys and it was calculated that three trips would be necessary to move the outfits  that day proved the hardest they had yet experienced and by the time it was dark both randy and earl felt as if their backs were broken and their feet to use earls expression walked off they had carried onethird of their traps to a beautiful spot just at the head of the worst of the white horse rapids which it may be well to add here are many miles in extent  contrary to the expectation of the boys wodley and captain zoss had brought the buster through in safety they had had only one alarm just at the end of the cañon proper when the boat had swung around on a hidden rock and shipped about half a barrel of water they were wet to the skin and this along with the story they told made mrs wodley insist upon it that her husband allow the other men of the party to bring the wild goose through on the day following  as captain zoss had made the trip once it was decided that he and earl should take the next trip while the others made another tramp over the trail with more of the traps they encamped at the white horse rapids but started back toward lake marsh before sunrise  its easy enough earl said the captain on embarking on the wild goose all youve got to do is to keep your wits about you and your eyes on the rocks tie the pail fast to the seat so it wont float away if the boat gives too much of a lurch if we have to bail any you had better do it  they were soon on the way out of the brightness of the early sunshine into the gloom of the yawning cañon which seemed to swallow them up the roar of the waters between the rocks was deafening and the flying spray sent a shiver through earl yet he stood to his post manfully realizing that there was no turning back now that the perilous trip was once begun  to the left shore roared captain zoss presently and earl scarcely heard him the captain waved his elbow frantically while using his pole and earl saw what was wanted they were running close to some halfsubmerged rocks a vigorous use of the pole a slight grating which made the youth hold his breath and that danger at least was past  but more were ahead and they grew thicker and thicker as the wild goose leaped turned and twisted first in one mad current and then another swish came a huge wave into the craft nearly taking earl from his feet then before he could make up his mind whether to begin bailing or not the boat slid up almost on her sterns end and most of the water went flying forth now for the left shore and mind the channel roared the captain once more and then the oars came into play and on they bounded through a clear cut in the rocks not over twentyfive feet wide the cut at an end the captain threw down his oar with a deep breath of satisfaction  the wust on its over he announced jest pole her along easylike now and well be down to camp inside of half an hour  the strain on the wild goose had caused several of the seams to part but it was decided to do nothing with these until after the worst of the white horse rapids had been passed they must now take their crafts out of water and carry or ride them on rollers to the foot of the falls  this was a job lasting several days for both the wild goose and the buster were heavy and it took all the men in both parties to move one boat at a time but at last the greatest of the falls was passed and then it was decided to draw the boats along through what remained and after another hard days labor they had the satisfaction of finding themselves free from further obstacles and encamped midway between tahkheena river and the head of lake labarge that day was sunday and it was spent in perfect rest by all  thus far since the snowsquall on lake bennett fine weather had favored them but now monday set in cloudy and threatening as soon as breakfast was over the wild goose was patched up and pitched over and all of the outfit placed on board the buster was already loaded and with the wind from the westward they tacked down the river and into lake labarge a clear sheet of water some twenty odd miles in length and varying from two to four miles in width about midway from either end of the lake there was an island and on this rocky shore they were compelled to seek shelter about the middle of the afternoon for the wind had increased to a goodsized blow and to sail in such a boat was consequently out of the question  both the wild goose and the buster had hardly been drawn up out of harms way than it began to rain seeing this all lost no time in pitching the tents and in building fires to keep warm for in this section of alaska a rain even in the summer is sure to make one feel cold the tents were pegged down with extra care and this was a good thing for by nightfall the wind had increased to a hurricane  the travellers to the gold regions were stormbound at lake labarge for two days it did not rain all this time but the wind blew too strongly to venture from shore the time was spent inside the tent and hung rather heavily although occasionally relieved by a song from the doctor or a yarn told by captain zoss or wodley who along with his wife and crimmins and johnson the other two miners made themselves quite at home with the portney party  the wind has moderated at last said randy who was the first out on the third morning now let us make the most of the fine weather while it lasts  the others were more than willing and the stove and camping outfit were taken down to the wild goose without delay the wodley party was also stirring but did not start until some time later on and the two parties did not see each other again until many a day later  the journey to the end of lake labarge was quickly made and they entered the thirtymile watercourse at that time unnamed which connects the lake with the big salmon and the lewes rivers randy and earl were in charge the men taking it easy over their pipes for the captain was an inveterate smoker and mr portney and the doctor indulged occasionally in the weed  a good many miles had been covered when earl happening to glance at his pocket compass announced that they were sailing almost due southward and that cant be right he said to randy we ought to be headed for the northwest  well were on the river all right answered randy nevertheless he spoke to his uncle about it who at once consulted his pocket map  ill tell you what youve done he announced presently instead of sticking to the river that flows northward you have turned into the teslin which flows to the south swing the wild goose around at once  much crestfallen over their mistake the boys did as requested they had to go back nearly four miles as they calculated before they saw the opening which had previously escaped their notice but once right they found the wind directly in their favor and with the sail set to its fullest they bowled along until the big salmon was reached and they swept into the broad waters of the lewes river  and now for the yukon and the gold regions cried dr barwaithe how much further have we to go he questioned turning to foster portney  about three hundred and fifty miles was the answer and with the exception of the rink and five finger rapids which dont amount to much so i have heard well have straight sailing ten days more ought to see us at dawson city ready to stake our claims     chapter xx  the gold fields at last   on the following day the wind died down utterly and no progress could be made in the wild goose excepting by the use of oars and this was slow and laborious work they took turns at rowing two at a turn with the others taking it easy on the blankets for the river was now broad and deep and as smooth as a millpond  on the second day they seemed to leave the rocks behind and emerged into a slightly hilly country here the banks of the stream were overgrown with bushes and flowers the latter just starting to push forth their buds in countless profusion of variety and color the transformation was almost magical and more than one spoke of it  thats the way of things in alaska said foster portney there are no spring and autumn just winter and summer and thats all the warm weather which is now coming on will last until september and then winter will come almost before you know it  earl had noticed the increase in heat since leaving the lakes and now he perspired freely while pulling at the long oar randy sat in the bow taking in the sights a flock of wild geese came sweeping toward them and he asked for permission to take a shot with the gun his aim was a good one and two of the creatures fell where they were readily picked up  well have stuffed goose tonight said the captain with a grin its a pity we aint got sage an onions ter stuff it with  perhaps i can find something to take the place of sage said the doctor this variety of bushes and vines ought to produce some similar herb  during the past two days they had noted a number of islands in the river and that night they made a landing on one of these in preference to tying up on shore mosquitoes were more numerous than ever but a smudge built by foster portney soon drove the most of the insects off  the island was several acres in extent and while the captain busied himself in roasting a goose and frying some potatoes he had traded in from wodley for a bit of bacon randy and earl took a tramp around to stretch their legs and prospect on the sly one carried a pick and a shovel and the other a goldwashing pan and coming to a hollow where they could work unobserved they set about getting out some dirt from under a series of rocks the pan was soon full and then earl started to wash by pouring water on top and giving it the rotary motion he had heard his uncle mention  the labor was harder than either of them had imagined and four panfuls of dirt were washed out leaving nothing but smooth stones behind they were about to continue the process when they heard their uncle calling them and a moment later foster portney appeared he started to laugh but quickly checked himself  digging for gold eh he said well i dont think youll find any here the formation of the ground isnt right if there is any precious metal around at all its at the bottom of yonder river might as well give it up and somewhat disgusted the boys returned to camp it was the only time they tried prospecting until the regular gold fields were reached  two days later found them at the rink and five finger rapids owing to the melting of the snow and ice under the increasing heat of the sun the river was very high now and consequently both spots were passed with comparative ease the dangerous rocks being covered to a depth of a yard or more in consequence of this increase of water the river had overflowed its bank for miles forming great lakes and marshes everywhere and at times it was almost impossible for them to keep to the channel once they did make a false turn only to find themselves half an hour later in a blind pocket as dr barwaithe put it  the rapids and the tachun river passed it was almost a straight sail northwest to the ruins of old fort selkirk but little could be seen of the former fort the indians having overturned the very foundations in their search for trinkets and articles of value they encamped at the spot overnight and were joined on the following morning by two other parties who had crossed chilkoot pass two days after themselves  of these parties earl asked for news of tom roland and jasper guardley and was informed that the men had joined a crowd of irishmen from portland who were coming through on a large raft theyre a tough crowd tooall of em said the speaker if they dont get into trouble before they leave the gold diggings it will be mighty queer  from old fort selkirk to dawson city is a distance of one hundred and sixty miles through a country so varied that it is next to impossible to describe it at times the voyagers found themselves sailing calmly along on a broad expanse of water dotted here and there with wooded islands rich in new foliage and evergreen trees and again the stream would narrow with high and rocky hills on either side here the water would flow swiftly over and around jagged rocks and the utmost care would have to be exercised in avoiding a smashup once they did receive a severe shakingup and had to run for a low island with all possible speed to avoid becoming waterlogged this happened in the forenoon and it took the balance of the day to make the wild goose as seaworthy as before  a week and more had slipped by since leaving the rink rapids and now all were on the watch for the first sight of the new gold fields every one was in a state of suppressed excitement they had met half a dozen miners sailing back and forth on the river and from these had learned that everything was booming and that strikes were panning out big the eyes of both randy and earl glistened when they heard these stories and the hardships endured since leaving dyea were forgotten  hurrah theres a miners tent suddenly shouted randy late one afternoon weve struck the diggings at last  there are half a dozen tents and a board cabin added earl pointing still further on i guess youre right randy i wonder if that is the klondike river over yonder it looks mighty small  thats only a creek said foster portney well land and see how far we are from dawson  the wild goose was easily beached and they lost no time in hunting up the miners to whom the tents and the cabin belonged they were a party of frenchmen from canada and could speak but little english dr barwaithe spoke to them in their native tongue and soon learned that the place was bakers creek and that dawson city was about six miles further on the frenchmen were very conservative but admitted that they were doing very well at placermining taking out an average of thirty dollars a day per man  thirty dollars a day cried randy a fellow can get rich quick enough at that rate  hardlywith such a short season answered his uncle yet thirty dollars isnt bad by any means  im up yere to strike a fortune put in the captain no measly little thirty dollars a day fer me  both randy and earl wished to remain behind to see the frenchmen wash out the gold dust but the others were impatient to go on and they were soon on the way once more  if the claims are good around here it wont be long before they are taken up said foster portney for as you can see men are pouring in over the mountains every day not to say anything of those who make the long trip by way of the ocean and up the yukon  well im just crazy to get to work declared randy just think of the gold lying around ready to be picked up  his uncle smiled poor randy little did he dream of the many backaches and privations in store for him  to the left of the river there now arose a long chain of hills and mountains sloping gradually to the waters edge on the right were smaller hills and great marshes fairly choked with bushes and wild growths of vines and flowers the tundra was everywhere and over all circled flocks and flocks of wild birds a few mosquitoes and something they had not yet seenhorseflies the horseflies were black and green in color and a bite from one of them made captain zoss utter a mighty yell of pain it was like the stab of a dagger he declared afterwards and so angry did the bite become and so painful that the doctor was called upon to treat it with a soothing lotion  it was after seven oclock but still daylight when dr barwaithe raised his hand for the others to become silent listen he said i think i heard a steamboat whistle ah i was right a boat is on the river  a few minutes passed and they heard the whistle again then earl pointed ahead excitedly theres the boat and she is tied up to the river bank there are half a dozen buildings and fifty tents or more ill wager its dawson  with hearts which beat quickly they sailed forward using the oars to make the wild goose move the faster another turn of the stream and the mining town could be seen quite plainly ten minutes later they ran up just behind the steamboat and tied fast the long trip was at an end the new diggings with all their golden hopes lay before them     chapter xxi  a day in dawson city   at the time of which i write dawson city was little better than a rude mining camp containing as has been previously mentioned a half dozen board buildings and fifty tents strung along what was known as the principal street back in the timber land a rude sawmill had been set up and this was beginning to get out lumber at the moderate price of one hundred and twentyfive dollars per thousand feet  a year before dawson city had been unknown but the rich finds of gold on bonanza and gold bottom creeks had caused the miners to leave circle city and forty mile post and boom the new el dorado as it was termed and the settlement grew as if by magic from the wild rush to stake claims many rows resulted but the cooler heads speedily took matters in hand and each man was allowed a claim from five to fifteen hundred feet long and extending the width of the creek or gulch in which it was located  these claims were not located upon the klondike river which joins the yukon at dawson city as has been often supposed but upon the little watercourses running into the klondike these goldbearing diggings are or were variously called bonanza gold bottom and bear creeks which flow into the klondike direct and hunker last chance el dorado adams shantantay and other creeks and semiwet gulches which are tributaries to the creeks first named the names were arbitrary and were often changed to suit the miners tastes  to randy and earl the camp presented the appearance of having just moved in as the younger brother termed it on every side were miners outfits stacked in little piles while their owners were either at hand erecting tents or off prospecting or buying supplies there was but one store a rude board building not over twenty by thirty feet in which everything on hand was offered at most extravagant prices flour sold for sixty dollars per barrel beans fifty cents per pound bacon and canned meats seventyfive cents per pound and other goods in proportion there were no fresh meats excepting two sides of beef just brought in by the little flatbottomed steamboat from circle city and which were rapidly disposed of at two dollars to five dollars per pound a crate of eggs were at hand to be purchased at one dollar per dozen but as most of the eggs were stale the contents of the crate went begging of miners tools a pick or a shovel brought ten dollars to fifteen dollars while washing pans were not to be found and had to be manufactured by the miners themselves wearing apparel was also scarce and earl saw twenty dollars given for a flannel shirt and five dollars for a pair of socks both articles being paid for in gold dust  as it was evening most of the miners had given up work and come into the camp to talk trade and learn the latest news every one was in a quiver of excitement and the announcement that an extra good find had been made on hunker creek caused many to strike out during the night to make new claims in that vicinity  let us go too cried randy and earl joined in but the men talked it over and decided to remain in dawson city until they learned more about the lay of the land they pitched their tent as close to where their boat lay as possible but it is doubtful if any of the party slept through that short night which had hardly anything of darkness  all told there were not over six hundred white men in camp and in addition there were perhaps a hundred indians with their squaws children and dogs for no alaskan indian family is complete without from one to a halfdozen canines attached the indians were there to sell fish and game and to pick up odd jobs of packcarrying they took but little interest in the gold strikes and it was but rarely that they could be found mining and then never for themselves  one of the first lessons to be learned by the boys and the others was that of keeping their outfits intact hardly were they up in the morning than a dozen miners and prospectors came shuffling around offering them various prices for this and that had they been willing to sell they could have disposed of all they possessed by noon but cautioned by foster portney they were firm and nothing was allowed to change hands but a small bottle of cough syrup which the doctor sold for an ounce of gold worth sixteen dollars to a poor fellow suffering with a slight attack of pneumonia the doctor wanted no pay but the miner insisted on giving it saying he would pay a thousand dollars if the physician would make him as well and strong as ever again  after many careful inquiries it was decided that the party should first try its luck on gold bottom creek at some spot near to where the watercourse was joined by hunker and last chance creeks they had learned that while bonanza and el dorado creeks were paying well all the best claims in those localities were already staked out  two days later found them encamped at the entrance to a tiny watercourse which flowed into gold bottom creek they had come in from the klondike with their outfits on their backs and half a dozen indians to aid them for the trail was over rough rocks and through lowlands of berry bushes and tundraa wearisome walk which to randy at least seemed to have no end often they sank up to their knees in the muck and cold water and once the doctor got stuck and had to be hauled forth by main strength and minus one boot which was afterward recovered a promising spot was reached by nightfall the indians were paid and sent off and they set about making themselves a home temporary or permanent as fortune might elect  a flat surface on the side of a small hill was selected and the tents were placed end to end as before but tightened down to stay then a trench was dug around the sides and the back so that when it rained the water might drain off this done the interior was carpeted with small branches of pine and evergreen  a good healthful smell said the doctor referring to the greens and one that will ward off many a cold on the top of those branches one ought to sleep almost as comfortably as on a feather bed  the interior of the tents arranged a fireplace was next in order a semicircular affair of stone in which the sheetiron stove might be sheltered from the wind then came a cache for the provisions to be stored away and their domestic arrangements were complete  it was bright and early on the day following that all hands set off to prospect along the bottom of the gulch which the boys had named prosper they were divided into two parties the doctor and the captain in one and the boys and their uncle in the other the latter turned up to the left arm of the gulch and presently came to a little hollow where the tiny stream of water flowing along had deposited some coarse sand to a depth of eight to twenty inches  now well shovel up some of this sand in the pan and see what it amounts to said foster portney dont take what is right on top boys if there is any gold it is down next to the bed rock and dont fill the pan too full the boys worked eagerly and soon had the pan nearly full of the sand mr portney then carried it to a nearby pool and allowed the water to run over the top then brushed off the surface and began to wash down this took several minutes and randy and earl stood by almost breathless during the process  at last only a handful of sand and dirt remained at the bottom of the pan all three examined it with care here and there could be seen a tiny grain of dull yellow  that is gold explained foster portney but there is hardly enough to pay probably three or four cents worth in all  is that all cried randy and his voice was full of disappointment earl said nothing but gathered up the pick and shovel and moved on  in two days a dozen other spots had been tried with even worse success and the three in the party began to imagine that the gulch was of no consequence so far as staking a claim there was concerned to add to their discomfiture a miner came along who said he had gone all over that locality a month previous  aint nothin thar he announced nothin wuth over four or five cents a panful better try your luck elsewar friends  well put in another day over here announced foster portney one day wont count very much and ground is often gone over a dozen times before the right strike is made  they had brought a lunch with them and now sat down on the edge of a small stony cliff to eat it the boys were tremendously hungry and could have devoured twice as much as what was on hand but they were beginning to learn that short rations would be something to look forward to for some time to come  having eaten what was allotted to him randy began to poke around with the pick while his uncle and earl still rested the cliff was divided into two sections and between was a lot of rotten stone dirt muck and rubbish striking the pick deeply into this randy loosened a portion of the stone and out it rolled into the gulch bringing the dirt and a good portion of the rubbish after it he began to scatter the stuff to the right and the left when something shiny caught his eye and stooping he picked it up while his heart leaped into his throat  uncle foster earl look at this he cried and ran to them holding up the object as he did so it was larger than an egg and quite heavy foster portney gave one glance and then leaped forward dropping what food still remained in his hand  where did you find it randy he exclaimed  over yonder was the hasty reply but is it gold uncle foster  yes randy its a nugget as sure as youre borna nugget worth at least two hundred dollars and whats better yet went on mr portney as randy began to dance with delight the chances are that there are more where this came from     chapter xxii  digging for gold   a nugget worth two hundred dollars randy could scarcely believe his eyes and ears he gazed at his uncle for a moment in openmouthed wonder  youre in luck and no mistake broke in earl as he also examined the yellowish lump say but thats a strike to start on isnt it  he had hoped to make the first find himself but he was too unselfish to begrudge his brother that pleasure leaving the lump in his uncles possession randy led the way back to where the find had been made and all three set to work without delay to empty the pocket as foster portney called it and examine the contents  heres another cried earl presently its not quite so large though  but its worth at least a hundred dollars earl answered his uncle and see here are a number of little fellows worth from ten dollars to fifty each randy has struck a bonanza beyond a doubt dont scatter that dirt too much for we must wash out every ounce of it for little nuggets and dust  and maybe there is a vein of gold back there said randy proudly if there is we can all work it cant we  yes unless the captain and the doctor have struck something equally good there that seems to be the last of the nuggets let us count them fourteen in all and worth at least four hundred dollars it paid to stay over in spite of what that miner said didnt it and foster portney laughed and the boys joined in readily for the discovery of so much gold had put all into the best of humor  the nuggets picked out they set to work to wash out the sand and dirt while foster portney filled the pan and washed the two boys took turns in bringing up water from the pool using for the purpose a rubber water bag the man had thoughtfully provided for just such an emergency the washings continued until it was quite dark and by that time half of the dirt had been gone over and something like two ounces of gold dust extracted  not so bad said mr portney perhaps tomorrow well do even better  i could keep on all night declared randy who was loath to quit the locality somebody may come in and take the claim away from us before morning  well leave the pick and the shovel in it and that will prevent them was the answer and this was done no miner dares to touch anothers prospect so long as any tools remain in it  when they got back to camp they found the doctor and the captain already there the two had tried half a dozen spots but only one had yielded sufficient gold dust to warrant their continuing to work it they listened with keen interest to the account of the find made by randy and were quite willing to take a hand at prospecting that locality the next day  eight oclock found all hard at work while the captain and earl washed the others went into the opening of the cliff and brought out all that remained of the dirt and loose stones there was not a great deal and shortly after noon every shovelful was heaped up close to the artificial pool of water dr barwaithe had constructed while the washing continued foster portney examined the sides and the bottom of the opening and then moved forward through a tangled mass of brushwood and tundra until he came to the bed of a second gulch a hundred feet distance from the first  there is nothing more in the pocket he declared and if there is any more gold it is either in that gulch or this and i am half inclined to think it is over there although we may as well prospect this gulch thoroughly first  by the morrow the washings from the pocket came to an end with four more ounces of gold to the credit of the prospectors making in all a find of about five hundred dollars previous to going into camp it had been decided that for the present everything found should be divided into five parts one to go to the captain one to the doctor and three to foster portney for himself and his nephews the portney share as we know was to be divided onehalf to mr portney and onequarter to each of the boys thus the boys received each threetwentieths of the entire amount found not a large portion but then they had nothing to pay out for expenses which were bound to be considerable and each was perfectly willing that his uncle should have the onetenth extra of the whole amount on that account  threetwentieths of five hundred dollars is seventyfive dollars said randy to earl when they were alone weve each earned that free and clear so far thats not bad  if only we can continue well make our fortunes replied earl earnestly but the pockets at an end and now weve got to prospect elsewhere  the days went by and they tried the first of the gulches from end to end sometimes working together and then each man and boy for himself but though they struck gold often it was never in paying quantities and the end of the week saw them somewhat discouraged  it wouldnt be so bad only we made such a fine start grumbled randy now theres no telling when we shall find gold again  thats the fortunes o prospectin said the captain it may be we wont git a smell o gold in the hull district agin  i move we try that other gulch on monday put in the doctor its full of loose sand isnt it he went on to foster portney  yes the sand and gravel are at least two feet thick was the answer i believe there is gold there as i said before but to clear off the brush and moss will be no easy task  we came out here for work said earl i didnt expect to sit around and sun myself and all laughed at this remark  it was sunday and late on saturday night a miner had been around announcing a religious meeting to be held over at the bottom at noon mr portney the boys and the doctor walked over nearly half a mile leaving the captain in charge of the camp they found about fifty miners collected around an improvised platform where an earnestlooking young man was reading a chapter from his bible a song by three of the women present followed and then came a short sermon on the brotherhood of man and the value of a faith which would carry a man above the temptation to do wrong even in that desolate region at the close of the service a collection was taken up for the preachers benefit some of the miners giving ordinary money and others pouring gold dust into the little chamois bag the preacher had provided for that purpose  at this meeting the portneys again met the wodley crowd who had located about a mile up gold bottom creek at a place called rosebud a name particularly inappropriate since no roses were to be found in the vicinity wodley and his companions were doing fairly well and thought the doctors flock might do worse than to locate just above them  well remember that said foster portney but first we are going to try again over where we are  wodley had heard again from tom roland and guardley he said the gang as he termed it which they had joined had gone up hunker creek and staked out three claims somewhere above discovery as the first claim on a creek or gulch is called the claims had overlapped some already staked out and the miners in that section had had several fights and had threatened to drive out all the newcomers if they did not do what was right  i was going over to hunker creek myself concluded wodley but i dont want to quarrel with anybody  monday morning found the entire portney crowd over to tangle gulch as mr portney christened it it was a name well chosen for the tangle of bushes vines and moss was simply out of sight so earl said although as a matter of fact it was very much in sightthat and nothing else no one could move forward more than a yard before having to stop to loosen himself either from the bushes and vines or the clinging moss and muck under the moss and to add to their discomfort they stirred up a legion of mosquitoes gnats and black flies which hovered over their heads like a cloud  let us burn the brush first of all said the doctor when at last the middle of the gulch was reached that will clear the surface and scatter those pests overhead oh my he broke off short as he went down into a concealed water hole which was several feet deep heres another of the pleasures of hunting gold in alaska and this was said so comically that everybody roared  axes and knives had been brought along and soon a large pile of the brush had been cut and piled in a heap and set on fire as it was green it burnt slowly and raised a large smoke which made the mosquitoes scatter immediately from that day until the end of the summer they kept a smudge fire for protection the brush cleared from the sides of the gulch which was very narrow they went at the tundra throwing the moss wherever it would be out of the way this took a long time and it was not until almost nightfall that they got down to the sand and gravel of the chokedup watercourse  now well see if there is anything in this gulch or not said the captain as he scooped up the first panful off the bedrock if there isnt then weve had most allfired hard work fer nuthin eh and he started in to wash up the sand gravel and dirt while the others looked on in breathless interest     chapter xxiii  good luck and bad   as the captain wanted to save every grain of gold in the pan he washed very carefully and it was fully five minutes before the last of the sand and dirt was disposed of and they could come to a calculation as to the value of the yellow metal left  for gold there was true enough shining brightly before their eyesand there was more than this too for some of it was of a blackish color the others could not believe in the value of this until foster portney assured them that he had frequently heard of black gold being turned up in the yukon district  half an ounce at least was the verdict arrived at by both the captain and mr portney and thats eight dollars  then we had better stay hadnt we said earl  why of course earl you didnt expect to do much better than that unless you struck nuggets  one fellow over to gold bottom said he was taking out a hundred dollars to the panful put in randy  fairy stories my lad answered the captain a claim as will turn out eight dollars to the pan is mighty goodas good as im alookin fer just now  and we havent gone very far into this gulch put in the doctor it may be better further up  and it may be worse said foster portney although im inclined to think it will be better we had best stake out our claims without delay  this was readily agreed to and before they went back to the tents they had staked out three claims one for each of the men earl might have taken up a claim too being just old enough but the three covered all the ground which the party thought of any account each claim was five hundred feet long and the upper one covered both gulches which was an excellent thing as it would give them a fair amount of water by which to do their washing the posts firmly planted and marked they walked slowly back to camp talking over the prospects and mapping out their future work  it was decided to move the tents to a more convenient locality and a spot was readily found at a point above where the two gulches joined or rather where the one gulch split into two the transfer to this new homespot was made the next day by earl randy and the doctor mr portney and the captain going back to uncover several other portions of the claims to ascertain if possible just what their values might be  the next week was a busy one the camp removed and put into comfortable shape the next work was to dam up the gulch where the pocket had been found so that all the water might flow through mosquito hollow as the doctor had facetiously dubbed the new diggingsa name that stuck to it this work was done by randy and dr barwaithe while earl joined the captain and his uncle in burning down the brush and getting rid of the tundra  before turning the water from prosper gulch into mosquito hollow foster portney advised sinking several holes along the latter gulch that any gold washed along by the flow would be caught the captain put these down and then came the long labor of cleaning the sand and dirt from the bedrock below as it would have taken all summer to clean out the entire bottom of the gulch only the deeper part was attacked and here a runway for the water was made a foot to two feet wide  the water had just been turned along mosquito hollow and washing begun when a party of prospectors from forty mile post came along and espied the claims they at once wished to know the particulars of the find made and assured that there was gold there one of the men lost no time in putting up his stakes below them while two others went above inside of a week after this the hollow boasted of eight claims and a little settlement sprung up at the fork as the miners named the spot where the portney crowd had located  well have a town here before the summer is over said earl but he was not sorry to have company especially as the newcomers were all hailfellowswellmet and apparently honest to the core among them was a young lawyer from dakota and he and dr barwaithe soon became the warmest of friends  the short alaska summer was now reaching its height and flowers and berries were growing everywhere in the wildest profusion while during the middle of the day the sun beat down so fiercely that they were often compelled to seek the shade for hours at a time  my gracious the hollow is like a pepper box said randy one day as he came into camp with his shirt wet through with perspiration not a breath of air stirring  and the hotter it is the worse the flies are added earl i declare they seem to bother me more than even the mosquitoes  usually it cooled off toward seven or eight oclock even though the sun still shone well up in the sky but this night proved as warm as the day had been and most of the party went to sleep outdoors unable to stand it inside of the close tents outside they had to wind their heads and necks in mosquito netting and cover up their hands to keep from being pestered to death it was the most uncomfortable twentyfour hours they had yet put in  the old harry take alaska burst out dr barwaithe finally one mosquito had alighted on his nose and two others on his neck its worth all the gold you can get and more too to stand these impudent pests oh and making half a dozen wild slashes he finally scrambled up and ran around the tents to throw his tormentors off  the captain was suffering from a slight attack of scurvy brought on by eating so much salt food the doctor had given him some medicine but this did little good and the captain was getting into a bad way when one of the old miners who had just come in came to his aid  eat tomatoes capn he said best thing on airth fer scurvy bill watson wuz down with it wust way an nuthin helped him but tomatoes he eat most a bushel o em an they made a new man o him eat tomatoes  tomatoes may be very good said the doctor they are a very strong green vegetable you know you might try them  and the captain did try them first using up some of the cans brought along and then buying a quart of fresh tomatoes at dawson city for two dollars sure enough the tomatoes helped wonderfully and about a week later the scurvy left him  nearly a month had now passed since the party had located at mosquito hollow and in that time they had taken out three small nuggets worth probably fifty dollars apiece and a little short of a hundred and fifty ounces of gold dust counting the gold dust as worth sixteen dollars an ounce this gave them in round figures twentyfive hundred dollars for their labor  twentyfive hundred dollars said earl thats a good deal more than we could earn at home  captain zoss gave a deep sigh and shook his head i aint satisfied he said i didnt come up to alaska to work fer no five hundred a month im goin elsewhar fer luck  you wont stay here asked randy quickly he had begun to like the captain very much  no lad im yere to make a fortune or nuthin i quit the hollow termorrow  well you have that right captain although im sorry to see you go said foster portney  which means thet you an the boys stay answered the captain quickly im sorry ye wont go with me i want ter try hunker creek  i think ill stay said foster portney quietly ill give the gulch a few weeks longer for the way i look at it were making wages and have the chance to make a strike what do you say boys  randy was in for following the captain but a look from earl made him change the words on the end of his tongue ill do as you think best uncle foster  and so will i said earl  then they looked at the doctor who was kicking the toe of his boot against the tent pole in speculative way it was several seconds before the medical man spoke  ii think ill go with the captain he said finally not but that i hate to part company he added hastily but i came up here to make a big hit and if i wanted to work for what weve been making here i could get it easier by going into dawson city and hanging out my shingleyou all know that i hope we part the best of friends  we will said foster portney well divide our gold as per agreement and also the outfits  and ill give you my share of this gulch free said the captain and the doctor said the same  of this however foster portney would not hear he insisted on paying each of them a hundred dollars and drawing up regular papers which were signed in the presence of two of the outside miners on the day following the doctor and the captain packed up their traps hired four indians to help them and set off first however giving mr portney and each of the boys a hearty handshake in a few minutes they were out of sight  and now to work the hollow for all it is worth said foster portney when they were left alone and remember from henceforth whatever we turn up belongs to us and to nobody else     chapter xxiv  an unlookedfor arrival   although the boys missed dr barwaithe and captain zoss greatly there was much of satisfaction in the thought that their uncle had expressed namely that henceforth whatever was taken out of the three claims on mosquito hollow gulch would belong to them and to nobody else  of course we cant expect to do as much work as was done before was the way earl reasoned but we are just as liable as ever to make a big strike  during the following week the weather turned off somewhat cooler and this made work easier and more rapid all three went at it with a will and the six days brought in six hundred dollars in dust  thats a hundred and fifty apiece for us earl said randy after figuring up it beats lumbering down in maine all hollow doesnt it  ill tell you better after weve gone through a winter up here randy from all accounts the weather is something awful and weve got to stand it for getting away is out of the question after the first of september  well lets not anticipate trouble i guess uncle will see that we are as well provided for as possible answered randy who could think of nothing but the gold dust brought in daily  so far they had done all their washing with hand pans foster portney had tried to obtain a cradle or a long tom but had failed now he announced his intention to go over to the sawmill at dawson and buy the necessary boards for several sluice boxes he left on friday stating he would probably not return before monday or tuesday  the week had brought a number of newcomers to the vicinity who had staked claims on other gulches within a radius of half a mile some of these late arrivals had come over the mountain pass while the majority had taken the longer route up the pacific ocean and the yukon the fork seemed to be a favorite camping ground and there were times when as many as a score of tents were pitched there  one of the newcomers was from hunker creek and he brought news of the doctor and the captain the pair had staked two claims some distance above discovery and were doing fairly well although they had by no means struck it as rich as anticipated  it was on saturday evening when randy and earl were busy washing out some of their underwearfor they of course had to play their own washerwomanthat news was brought to them that there was a young fellow down at a camp below who had expressed a desire that randy or earl come to see him  he aint give no name but hes a slimbuilt chap an dont look like he was cut out fer roughing it said the messenger hes half sick and he was grubstruck when me and my pard picked him up  a slimbuilt chap began randy when earl broke in its fred dobson the crazy fool  fred cried randy he turned to the messenger and asked the miner to give him a better description of the boy but this was not forthcoming and he hurried off with the man leaving earl in charge of the tent  the camp below was quarter of a mile away over a hill thick with blackberry bushes but something like a trail had been tramped down from the fork and it did not take the two long to cover the distance they had just come over the hill in sight of several tents when randy beheld somebody get up from a seat on a fallen log and totter toward him  randy portney it was fred dobsons voice but so thin and hollow randy scarcely recognized it oh how glad i am to see somebody i know  fred how in the world did you get up here burst out randy he took the hand of the squires son and led the way back to the seat how thin and pale you look i thought you had gone back to basco  fred heaved a deep sigh then he looked randy full in the face for a moment his eyes were moist and he tried in vain to keep back the tears but it was impossible and throwing his head on randys shoulder he wept like a child  the tears touched randy to the heart and he caught the thin hands and pressed them warmly never mind fred he said now you are up here ill do what i can for you so let up and tell me your story  it was several minutes before fred could do this i came up by the way of the chilkoot pass he said when he felt able to speak i joined a party i met in juneau a crowd of men from chicago and they promised to see me through if i would do my share of work but the work was too hard for me and they treated me like a dog and at bakers creek they kicked me out of camp and compelled me to shift for myself  how long ago was this  a week ago since that time ive been knocking around from pillar to post looking for something i could do so as to earn at least enough to eat i did get one job in dawson city washing dishes in the restaurant but even there the food the boss wanted me to eat was more than i could stand as it was nothing but leavings  and when did you hear of us  yesterday i struck a miner named wodley and he gave me your directions oh randy what a fool i was to come to alaska if only i had taken your advice and gone back to basco and it was only by an effort that fred dobson kept himself from crying anew he felt miserable weak and hungry had had scarcely a kind word for weeks and was on the point of giving up in despair  do your parents know where you are asked randy after another pause  yes i wrote to them just before leaving juneaui couldnt think of going so far away without doing that  well that was at least one sensible move fred randy thought for a moment our camp is about half a mile from here over that hill can you walk that far  oh yes randy i can walk a good way now ive found a friend fred arose as quickly as he could are you and your friends all together yet  no there are only my uncle earl and myself now  the two were soon on the journey over the hill fred was still rather shaky and randy gave him his arm to help him at the difficult places when they reached camp earl had all the washing out and everything tidied up  so it is you fred he said as he held out his hand i thought you back in basco by this time  i only wish i was i made the biggest mistake of my life when i ran away so there and i dont care who knows it and fred threw himself on a bench in front of the tent  if there is any of that bean soup left you had better give fred some said randy with a knowing glance which did not escape earl and im going to fry some of the fish i caught over in the river last night  half an hour later the wanderer was sitting down to as appetizing a supper as he had tasted since leaving the states while he ate he told his story in detail to which randy and earl listened with much interest that fred had had a hard time of it there could be no doubt and that he had learned a lesson he would never forget was also apparent  if there was only some way of getting home id start tomorrow he said but im up here now and ive got to do for myselfsomehow he looked wistfully at earl and randy do you think i could make some kind of a deal with your uncle to keep me i know i am not as strong and hardy as you but i can do something and i wont look for any pay  i dont know what uncle will say said earl he has gone to dawson and wont be back before monday or tuesday i guess you can stay here till that time  yes and if he wont take you in ill help you some added randy weve been more fortunate than you  fred was curious to know how they had made out and earl and randy told him he was amazed to think they had done so well and his face brightened a good deal when he remembered how randy had said he would help him  sunday was spent in camp fred who was completely tired out slept the greater part of the day although at meal times weak as he was he insisted on washing the dishes and the pots and kettles just to show that he was in earnest about working this made earl and randy smile to themselves  think of fred washing dishes like that at home whispered earl to his brother if only the squire could see him now i guess hed almost forgive him for running away  on monday the two brothers went to work as usual in the hollow fred followed them over and was much interested in their labors once he tried shovelling up the sand and dirt but earl told him he had better take it easy and get back his strength and then he walked back to the tent to spend the balance of the day in mending his clothing which was sadly in need of repairs when the boys came back he had supper ready for them and never had they had a meal in camp that was better cooked  cooking was the one thing i learned coming up here fred explained there was a negro in the party who had been a chef in a chicago hotel and he was the one soul in the crowd that treated me half decently  perhaps uncle will retain you as cook said randy mischievously and then he stopped short for he did not wish to hurt freds feelings the supper passed off pleasantly and fred announced that he felt a hundred times better than the day previous  it was around ten oclock and the sun had just set over the mountains to the westward leaving the hollow in an uncertain paleblue light which would last until sunrise at four when a messenger on muleback dashed along the trail from gold bottom thars a lynchin goin on down to smedleys he yelled as he sped by theyve caught a sneak thief by the name o guardley an theyre goin ter make him do er dance on nuthin better be gittin down thar if ye want ter see justice done     chapter xxv  more work in the gulches   they are going to lynch a fellow named guardley ejaculated earl i wonder if it can be jasper guardley  it must be its not likely there is another guardley up herethe name isnt as common as all that returned randy shall we go  earl hesitated there was something appalling in a lynching to his mind yet he was curious to know more of the crime for which the prisoner was about to suffer  yes we might as wellif fred will watch the camp he answered  ill watch it as well as i can answered fred the work he had been doing had tired him more than he would admit and he was glad enough to take it easy he knew guardley but took small interest in the man his father had sent up more than once for petty crimes  in less than five minutes earl and randy were off stalking over the hills and along gold bottom creek as rapidly as their tired limbs would carry them smedleys a settlement of twoscore of tents and one board cabin where a few odds and ends could be bought was nearly two miles distance yet they arrived there in less than half an hourfast time when the state of the trails they had travelled was taken into consideration  they found that the prisoner had been bound hands and feet and placed in the storeroom of the board cabin a little shed in the rear scarcely eight feet by twelve and hardly high enough for a man to stand in two roughlooking miners were on guard one with a gun and the other with an oldfashioned horsepistol over a foot long  what do you want demanded one of the miners of earl as the latter pushed his way forward through the fastgathering crowd this aint no place fer a young rooster like you  i would like to see the prisoner please answered earl i think i know him  you aint the fellers pard are ye demanded the second guard suspiciously  no i am from maine and i knew a guardley up there who came to these diggings i wanted to find out if it was the same man  say is that earl portney came from within and both earl and randy recognized jasper guardleys voice if it is id like to talk to him  yes guardley answered earl whats the trouble  illustration i would like to see the prisoner pleasepage 196  cant you come in and talk to me  ill come in if the guards will allow it and earl looked at the men  go on in but leave yer gun with me if yer got one was the reply from the man who had first addressed earl  i havent any pistol said the youth and passed into the shed randy was about to follow but the guard stopped him ones enough my lad you wait outside and randy fell back into the crowd which kept increasing every minute  from those around him randy learned that guardley was being held for the theft of eighty ounces of gold dust which had been buried by a miner named cozzins under the flooring of his tent cozzins had missed his gold that morning and three other miners had testified to seeing guardley sneaking around the place in company with another man presumably tom roland roland and the gold were both gone and guardley had been collared just as he was about to leave for dawson city the miners around smedleys had held a meeting and it was likely that guardleys crime would cost him his life  for you see we aint got no jails here explained one miner an to leave sech a measly critter run would be puttin a premium on crime  when earl came out of the shed his face was very pale and he was on the point of passing the guards without a word when they stopped him well wot did ye make out demanded one laconically  he says he didnt take the goldthat the robbery was planned and executed by his partner it is awful to think of taking his life  its his own fault ladhe should have thunk o those things afore he consented to help on the job  when will theythey  perform the ceremony i reckon some time between now an sunrise onless the crowd changes its mind theyre goin to talk it over agin ez soon as cozzins comes back hes huntin fer thet other rascal  after this earl joined randy who was anxious to hear what guardley had had to say the two walked some distance away  i believe tom roland stole the gold began earl but guardley was willing he should and he remained on guard around the tent while roland dug it up so hes just as guilty  but to take his life shuddered randy  i hope they change their minds about that and by the way we were right about that money in boston roland got that and he had that lost letter too guardley admitted it although he didnt give me any particulars he is trying to lay the blame of everything on roland  a shout interrupted the conversation at this point cozzins had come back after an exciting but fruitless chase at his appearance the scene took on a new activity and the wouldbe lynching party moved to the front of the socalled store where half a dozen flaring torches and two smoking kerosene lamps lit up the weird scene here cozzins told his story and then guardley was brought out trembling in every limb he begged over and over again to be let go and his earnestness had its effect even on the man who had been robbed a talk lasting a quarter of an hour followed and then guardley was given his choice of two sentencesthe one being that already pronounced and the other being a whiplashing on his bare back and a drumming out of the camp with the warning that if he ever showed up there again he was to be shot on sight with a long sigh of relief he chose the latter punishment and was ordered to strip while cozzins prepared for his part in the affair by hunting up the hardest and strongest rawhide dogwhip to be found  i dont want to see the whipping whispered randy let us go home poor guardley i guess cozzins will make him suffer as he has never suffered before  i hope it teaches him a lesson to turn over a new leaf answered earl but im afraid there isnt any reform to guardley he hasnt even enough manliness to shoulder his share of the blame but tries to put it all off on roland come on and they turned away without another word before they were out of hearing distance of the camp a shriek rent the air telling that guardleys punishment had already begun  the boys had expected their uncle to come back by tuesday as told but in the afternoon one of the miners working down mosquito hollow brought word from dawson city that mr portney could not get his lumber for two or three days and might be absent the remainder of the week in consequence so there was nothing to do but to keep on working at the claims with the hand pans and this randy and earl did fred helping them as far as he was able the boy who had been so illtreated and half starved was growing stronger rapidly and he showed a willingness to do even the most disagreeable things which was as astonishing as it was gratifying  friday found the trio working up along a little split in the rocks on the right bank of the gulch the split was not over two feet wide by twelve feet long and it was filled with gravel and muck with here and there the nest of a field mouse among the tundra earl had suggested clearing out the split and he had gone in first to loosen the gravel with his pick about three loads of soil had been removed and carted down to the gulch stream and now earl found the balance of the split blocked by a huge rock  doesnt seem to amount to much he said throwing down his tools to mop the perspiration from his brow  let me go in there suggested fred and caught up the pick swinging the tool over his shoulder he brought it down with all force at a spot where the rock showed a slight crack  look out or youll break that pick called out randy when the front half of the rock fell away and fred had to jump up to avoid having his feet crushed as he made the leap his eyes caught sight of a surface of yellow half hidden by muck and moss he struck at it with the pick and out came a nugget nearly as big as his fist he grabbed it up in a transport of delight  look look a nugget oh what a big fellow how much do you think its worth he cried and rubbed the muck off with his coat sleeve it looks as if it was solid  it is almost solid said earl weighing the find in his hand its worth two or three hundred dollars at least and then he added by way of a caution youll have to remember fred that this is my uncles claim  oh i know that but it ought to be worth something for finding it said fred wistfully  certainly well make it right  of course we will added randy let us see if there are any more nuggets in there this may be a pocket like the one i found on prosper gulch he went forward but earl was ahead of him and was using the pick with all the speed and skill at his command as the remainder of the rock came away a mass of sand gravel and dirt followed  here are four small nuggets said randy picking them up fiftydollar finds every one of them  earl said nothing although he heard the talk he had espied a gleam of dull yellow wedged in between the side of the split and a second rock he tried to force the second rock out and as it moved forward the gleam of yellow became larger and larger until his hand could not have covered it he worked on frantically hardly daring to breathe at last the rock fell and the face of the nugget lay revealed shaped very much like the sole and heel of a large mans shoe  what have you got asked randy and fred simultaneously seeing something was up but earl kept right on picking away below the find and to both sides it seemed to him the thing would never come out and as he realized how large the nugget was his hands trembled so he could scarcely hold the pick ive struck a fortune he muttered at last in a strangely hoarse voice see if anybody is looking randy and then the nugget came loose and he clutched it in both hands and held it upa dull dirty yellowish lump worth at least three thousand dollars     chapter xxvi  sluice boxes and preparations for winter   a nugget worth three thousand dollars was by far the largest find yet made in that district and the three young miners could scarcely believe it true as they surveyed the lump in earls hands  do you suppose its pure gold asked randy as he took it from his brother its heavy enough  i think its almost pure said earl weve struck it rich this time be sure and keep your mouth shut both of you or well have all of gold bottom up here he added weve got at least four thousand dollars worth of stuff out of there so far and goodness only knows how much more there is  here come a couple of miners now whispered fred happening to glance down the gulch he dropped some of the smaller nuggets into his pockets while randy took care of the rest earl let the large lump fall into the dirt and covered it up with tundra muck  well pards how air ye makin it asked one of the miners as he halted on the edge of the gulch  oh were doing fairly well answered earl as coolly as he could although still highly excited where are you bound  thought wed try it over to hunker creek some good reports from there this week  so ive heard said randy i wonder if it would pay us to go over  it mighteverybody has an equal chance ye know said the second miner say do ye calkerlate to git anything outer thet split he went on with a look of disdain on his face  i thought i would see what was in it said earl if a fellow dont try hell never find anything  ye wont git nuthin out o thar the split dont lay right better go up to the top end o your claim yell stand more chance thar and after a few words more the two miners moved off and the boys breathed easier  that shows what he knows about it said earl when he dared to broach the subject wouldnt he open his eyes if he knew the truth  and wouldnt he be in for squeezing a claim right on top of us added randy no we had best keep this find to ourselves at least until weve found just what is in the split and how far away from the gulch it runs  throw all the nuggets into the hole over yonder said earl and cover them up well take them to the tent tonight and bury them in some safe place im going ahead and he began to pick away as though his life depended upon it while randy and fred went over the sand gravel and dirt with their shovels and hands to pick out some small nuggets which they found to the number of fortythree some not larger than a grain of rice and others the size of coffee beans  here is another lump said earl presently and brought out a thin sheet of gold mixed with stone i shouldnt wonder if there is a layer of quartz rock somewhere along here although i dont see anything of it yet i guess this lump will produce thirty or forty dollars worth of gold more pretty good for five minutes work and he went at it again with renewed vigor scattering the sand and gravel behind him like a mother hen looking for worms  an hour later the split was cleaned out so far as it could be accomplished with the tools at hand there remained a small crack still running downward three feet as earl ascertained by testing it with a berrybush switch what there might be at the bottom of the crack there was no telling although it must contain some gold if only in dust three additional nuggets had been unearthed one as large as a pint measure and finer in appearance than any of the rest making sure they were not observed the first nuggets were again brought forth and each took a portion of them to carry home the largest was tied up in earls coat which he slung carelessly over his shoulder as he trudged along  worth five to six thousand dollars if they are worth a cent said earl as he surveyed the lot in the privacy of their tent and we havent begun to wash up yet nor tested that little crack this is the best luck yet  some of their findings had already been put down in a hole under the bedding in the tent the hole was now opened and the new findings added earl first making a list of the nuggets to give to his uncle the ground was pounded down hard after this so that if anybody wanted to dig the treasure up he would find it a days labor nearly all the miners buried their large finds it being the only protection to be had  on saturday mr portney came back bringing with him three indians loaded down with lumber and hardware he was much surprised to see fred and was on the point of giving the lad a good talking to when randy called him aside and explained the situation earl also put in a good word for fred and then when the indians were paid off and discharged the subject was dropped by both boys telling of the wonderful find which had been made of course foster portney was greatly interested and he smiled when randy particularly mentioned how fred had brought out the first nugget and caused earl to investigate further  you certainly deserve credit for that dobson he said you shall have your full share of whatever the nugget proves to be worth as for that little split the only thing we can do is to blow it open with dynamite and luckily i brought a can of the stuff from dawson for just such an emergency  foster portney had heard about guardley and had also heard that some canadian mounted police who had arrived at dawson city were on tom rolands trail guardley had turned up at forty mile post whipped half to death and it was doubtful whether he would get over his punishment  on sunday the question of whether fred dobson should remain as one of the party or not was fully discussed the lad offered to work for nothing if only given his board and such clothing as he needed and randy and earl said fred could certainly cook as well as any of them and was getting more used to using a pick and a shovel every day seeing that his nephews wanted the runaway to be taken in mr portney at last said he would let it go at that  ill feed you and clothe you he added and if we come out all right next spring ill pay your passage back to basco and give you a little extra in the bargain but youve got to hustle the same as the rest of us that is as far as your strength and health will permit and fred said he understood and was thankful for the chance and would do his level best and he did do his level best from that hour forth his experience had been a bitter one but at the same time it had been the best in the world for himexactly what he needed  the days which followed were busy ones with the lumber brought in foster portney and the boys constructed three sluice boxes which after completion were set up at convenient points in the gulch where the water might easily be turned on and off in them each box was fifteen feet long and a foot square open at each end and at the top the latter having a few braces across to keep the sides stiff at the bottom of the box small cleats about an inch high were placed at intervals of fifteen inches apart the last cleat at the lower end of the box being a trifle higher than the rest  a sluice box done it was carried to the spot selected for it and planted firmly with its lower end in the stream and its upper end elevated from one to two feet then the upper end of the stream was run into it by means of a water trough the box was now ready for use by shovelling dirt in at the upper end and allowing the water to run through the dirt was gradually washed down and out at the lower end leaving the heavy gold to settle to the bottom and pile up along the upper sides of the cleats previously mentioned at night the water was turned aside and the days accumulation of gold was scraped away from the cleats  we can do a good deal more with the boxes than we can with the pans said foster portney and what washing we want to do must be done before cold weather sets in and the gulch freezes up  it must not be supposed that the slit in the rocks had been forgotten to the contrary all hands had often spoken of it and as soon as the sluice boxes were finished every one in the claim turned to the place two sticks of dynamite were placed in the slit and set off and the rock blown into a thousand fragments  the blast revealed an opening beneath the slit which was a yard wide and twice as deep this opening was filled with loose sand and dirt and at the bottom of all was a thick layer of gold dust slightly mixed with silver they scraped the dust up with great care and found that it would very nearly fill a quart measure they hunted eagerly for nuggets but no more could be found and the quartz rock earl had hoped for failed to appear  never mind we cant expect too much luck said mr portney a heap of dust like this is find enough for one day let us scrape the hole thoroughly and cart the dirt down to the nearest sluice box this was done and they examined the vicinity carefully for another slit but none appeared this pocket like that on prosper gulch was now exhausted and with a sigh randy and earl turned away to the regular work of washing for dust each had one of the boxes allotted to him while foster portney took the third fred occupied his time between the three and in cooking the meals and thus the balance of the summer slipped by until the day came when mr portney announced that they must begin building a cabin and prepare for the long alaskan winter which would speedily close in around them     chapter xxvii  the end of the summer season   mr portney and the boys had long since decided where the cabin should be built up against the side of a cliff ten feet in height which overlooked the head of the gulch all the miners in the locality had agreed that this would be the best spot and six cabins were to be placed there for hospitalitys sake if for no other reason mr portney had already ordered the dressed lumber needed from the sawmill but as this was costly stuff and expensive to transport earl and randy had declared their intention to go into the timber back of the cliff and get out whatever of rough wood could be made to do  were not going in for style declared earl you can get the window frames and glass and the door and the finishing boards and well get out the rest wont we randy and his brother agreed with him  a week later found the party building in earnest over a hundred dollars worth of lumber had been purchased and it had cost as much again to bring it over in the meantime earl and randy aided by fred had brought out from the woods four sticks of timber for the corner posts of the cabin and had whipsawed twoscore of rough boards with this material they went to work and four pairs of willing hands soon caused the building to take definite shape seeing them at work the other miners also got at it and soon there was sawing and hammering all day long beneath the cliff  of necessity the cabin was a simple affair it was set partly on the flat rock and partly on the hard ground and was twenty feet wide by twelve feet deep the back resting almost against the cliff in the front was a door and a window and there was another window at the end nearest to the door inside a spare blanket divided the space into two compartments the first the one having the door being the general livingroom and the second being the sleepingroom in the livingroom was placed a cookingstove a rude table and four homemade chairs while the sleepingroom was provided with four bunks ranged along the rear and end walls later on a closet was built for the cookingutensils but for the present these were piled up in a corner  foster portney was very particular that all the cracks in the side walls of the cabin should be filled in with mud and the top which was nearly on a level with the cliff was also made water and wind tight excepting where a circular hole was left for the upper section of a stovepipe  as soon as the cabin was in habitable shape an account of all the provisions on hand was taken it was found that the canned vegetables had run low and that they also needed more flour a list of necessities was made out and earl and his uncle started away to dawson city to purchase them knowing that prices were advancing every day and that the goods on hand at the store were liable to give out long before the demand for them should cease  fred had asked to go out into the woods to see what he could shoot he being a fairly good shot and thoroughly familiar with the use of a gun it was thought best not to let him go alone and he and randy went together leaving the cabin in care of the miners who were building close at hand  the hunt in the woods was hardly a success after tramping around for two hours they brought down several birds of a species unknown to them and one small deer smaller than any randy had ever seen in maine otherwise the woods were bare of game and by the middle of the afternoon they gave it up  when earl comes back ill ask my uncle to let the three of us go over to the river said randy ive heard there are good chances there for wild goose snipe and plover  yes and we might put in a day fishing even salt and smoked fish wouldnt go bad during the winter added fred he was growing hardy and strong and took a deep interest in all that was going on  it was two days before mr portney and earl returned bringing with them all they and two indians could carry the provisions included an extra hundred pounds of flour for which they had paid fifty dollars some canned peas and tomatoes fifteen pounds of dried apples and california apricots and some coffee sugar salt and smoked bacon in an extra package earl also carried a beefsteak weighing two pounds and for which he had paid five dollars  its randys birthday tomorrow he said and were going to celebrate in a style i know youll all admire and every one laughed and agreed with him for they had not had any fresh beef since leaving the steamboat at dyea  foster portney was quite willing that the three boys should take a trip over to the yukon to see what could be found in the way of fish and game and it was arranged that they should be gone three days the start was made on monday morning  they travelled altogether by compass through the woods managing on the way to knock over enough birds to serve them for their meals on the morning of the second day they struck the yukon about midway between dawson city and ogilvie as they came in sight of the broad stream earl halted the crowd and pointed straight ahead  look at the snipe he said now is our chance let us all fire together  randy and fred had borrowed shotguns from their neighbors and at the signal three reports rang out and eight of the birds came down a second shot from randy whose gun had a double barrel brought down three more and from that hour on the sport began lasting until well into the evening when they had twenty snipe six plover and eight wild geese to their credit  as late as it was earl determined to try his hand at fishing and soon had his line out there were a few minutes of waiting then the bait was taken like a flash and there followed a lively struggle between the youth and a salmon which weighed over fifteen pounds several times earl thought he had lost his catch but each time he recovered and finally the salmon came in close enough to be swung on shore even then he flopped around so lively that fred had to quiet him by a blow from the stock of his gun  earls success had fired the others and soon they were fishing in the paleblue twilight of the night they kept it up until after twelve oclock when they turned in with a catch of three salmon several whitefish and a burbot which randy at first took for a codfish they slept soundly and early in the morning tried the sport again starting for home at about noon and arriving there with their burdens some time after midnight worn out but happy  it was found that foster portney had not been idle during their absence from time to time as the canned eatables were disposed of they had saved the tins and now he had cleaned them out and filled some with such berries as still remained on the bushes about the gulch to seal the cans up he had brought from dawson city a stick of lead and for an iron had used the end of a broken pick  that will give us some fresh berries he said and along with canned salmon and salted and smoked whitefish burbot and wild goose i reckon well get along fairly well unless the winter proves an extra long one  as much as they felt the necessity of preparing for winter randy and earl hated to lose the time when there was the chance to make so much money at the sluice boxes so as soon as they were able they got down to the gulch again and never did two lads work harder they were accompanied by fred and a day later their uncle also joined them  the dirt from the pocket had been cleaned up and it had yielded over twenty ounces of gold they were now working on the regular sand and gravel scraped from the bedrock of the gulch and though this did not pay so well yet it brought in enough to make them all satisfied there was a good deal of excitement too when it came to cleaning out the sluice boxes for almost every day one or another found a nugget sometimes small and then again as large as a walnut  how much do you think we are averaging asked randy one day and his uncle replied that he could not figure very closely but he would put it down as over a hundred dollars per day this meant twentyfive dollars a day as the boys share and he felt more content than ever to slave along in the gulch  for it was slaving along this constantly picking and digging and carting the dirt sand and gravel to the sluice boxes and throwing it in every night randys back ached and sometimes he would come in with feet that were sopping wet and covered up to his waist with mud and muck and then he took a touch of the chills and fever and was down on his back for a week with only fred to wait on him the chills and fever went the rounds and foster portney and earl were stricken at the same time fred was the last to catch it and by the time he had recovered winter was at hand  the first indication was a rawness in the air which made them shiver when they turned out in the morning then the bushes and the trees quickly lost their leaves and three days later ice formed in the marshes back of the gulch the sun came up as usual but it seemed to have lost its warmth and all were glad enough to keep on their coats even when working  two more weeks will fetch it observed foster portney we had better wash out as much dirt as possible before the water stops running  ten days later the thermometer went down with a rush dropping from fiftysix to but twenty above zero going down to the gulch they found the stream covered with ice which was half an inch thick by the next day there was no water to be found only ice and even the piles of sand gravel and dirt were frozen stiff a heavy dulness which oppressed them greatly hung in the air winter had come and gold washing for that season was a thing of the past     chapter xxviii  snowed in   although everything in the gulch was frozen up it must not be supposed that mining there came to an end while it was true no more washing could be done that season there was dirt gravel and sand to be heaped in convenient spots ready for the first run of water in the spring  at one end of the claims there was a bank which had been examined by foster portney and found to contain very rich pay dirt and this bank was now attacked by all hands and the dirt brought out to the nearest sluice box to thaw the ground a fire was built up against the bank every night and allowed to burn until morning even in extremely cold weather this thawed the bank to a depth of several feet and when they had scooped out a hole which resembled a bakers oven the thawingout process was still more effectual  but it was hard and bitter work at the best and as the cold increased fred found he could not stand it and had to remain in the cabin the greater part of the time coming out only during the middle of the day  this cold gets into the marrow of a fellows bones he said to randy i dont see how you can put up with it  earl and i were used to pretty tough weather up in the maine woods as you know replied randy i guess an outandout city chap would freeze stiff before he had been here a week the thermometer was down to six below zero this morning  the cold had cut off their water supply and every drop for drinking or cooking had to be obtained by melting ice on the stove to keep them in fuel all hands spent four days up in the woods cutting timber which was allowed to dry out for two weeks and was then hauled over to the edge of the cliff and tumbled down to a spot between their cabin and that of their nearest neighbor two hundred feet away  by foster portneys advice another trip was made by him and earl to the yukon river in search of fish for winter use for fish could now be kept by simply being frozen in a chunk of ice and laid away the two found the ice on the yukon over two feet thick and had to cut fishingholes with an axe they had brought along for that purpose they spent a day on the river fishing and spearing and were rewarded with a catch of over fifty pounds earl had brought the shotgun and to the fish were added a dozen small seafowl which were caught on the wing while flying southward  we had better be getting back observed foster portney early on the following morning unless i am greatly mistaken we shall have a heavy fall of snow by tonight  as they did not wish to be caught in a storm they started on the return to the gulch as rapidly as their loads would permit they were still in the woods when the first flakes began to fall with the coming of the snow the wind began to rise shaking the bare limbs above them savagely and causing a lively tumble of dead branches on every side not to become stormbound they increased their pace reaching the lower end of the gulch by six oclock in the evening they could hardly see before them so thickly did the flakes come down and both considered themselves fortunate in having struck familiar ground by the time the cabin was reached the snow was six inches deep  we thought youd be snowed under cried randy as he opened the door to let them in he had been watching anxiously since the snow began to fall its going to be an awful night  he was right it was an awful nightmore so than any of them had anticipated after a hot supper they retired to their bunks to sleep only to be aroused about midnight by the roar of the wind as it tore through the woods and along the gulch with the force of a hurricane the snow was coming down in chunks as randy put it and mingled with it were tree branches small brush and dried tundra in one corner of the cabin the wind had found a crack about six inches long and less than a sixteenth of an inch wide and through this crack the snow had sifted over the entire floor  jerusalem the roof is coming down cried earl when they had been up a few minutes and while his uncle was stuffing a piece of cloth in the crack mentioned there was a great noise overhead as the hurricane tore away the top joint of the stovepipe through the opening poured a lot of snow which falling on the hot stove sent up a cloud of steam to stop the snow from coming in foster portney climbed up on the top of the table and nailed a bit of a board over the hole  we cant have that stovepipe up there thats certain he said well have to stick it out of the side window it wont look very elegant but i reckon were not keeping house on looks up here and by their united efforts the stove was swung around in front of the little window and the upper end of what was left of the pipe was twisted around and pointed outside after one of the small window panes had been taken out around the pipe mr portney fitted a square sheet of tin obtained from an empty tomato can then the floor was cleared of snow and the fire started up afresh  the hurricane or blizzard lasted until six oclock in the morning and during that time nobody thought of going to sleep again the cabin shook and rocked and had it not been for the shelter of the cliff would have gone to pieces the snow kept piling higher and higher until it threatened to cut off the smokepipe again  perhaps well have to swing the stove around to the front said foster portney we can let the pipe out near the roof and build a little hood over it so that the snow from the cliff can blow right over into the gulch and later on this was done  this will stop work in the gulch said randy its too bad what on earth are we going to do with ourselves from now until next spring  well try to keep alive and well randy returned mr portney seriously remember from now on comes the tugofwar as the old saying goes  but work was not over as randy had surmised to be sure when the storm ceased at noon it was found the snow was nearly three feet deep on the level but a days labor sufficed to beat down a path to the bank in the gulch and once again the fires were started and the work of getting the dirt to the sluice boxes resumed the clearing of the storm had left it stinging cold and all were glad enough to hustle lively in order to keep warm they worked with their overcoats on and with their feet encased in several pairs of woollen socks and even then spent much time around the fire thawing out to use randys words  the work in the bank however paid them well four days after the fall of snow foster portney struck several rocks to one side of the rise and located another pocket of nuggets they were all small fellows the largest about the size of a hickory nut but the nuggets numbered nearly half a hundred and caused a good deal of excitement  its another fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars to our credit said mr portney and not only that but this dirt is as rich as that taken from the pocket over yonder we havent struck a million but we are doing remarkably well  i wonder how captain zoss and dr barwaithe are making out said earl they had not heard from their former partners for nearly a month when a miner had brought word to the effect that they had just located a claim on a gulch heading into hunker creek the third strike since leaving mosquito hollow  i imagine they are not doing any better than we are replied his uncle if they were we should have heard of it it may pay to strike around more or less but i believe in giving a claim a fair trial before abandoning it  less than a week later it began to snow again the sky was heavy and even at midday it did not brighten up they had gone down to the gulch directly after breakfast but now returned to the cabin to fix up the stovepipe as previously mentioned and to cut enough small wood to last for several weeks all were hard at work when they saw two white men and two indians approaching the latter driving before them two dog teams attached to a pair of alaskan sledges piled high with miners outfits the two men were dr barwaithe and captain zoss  its a sight good fer sore eyes to see ye agin exclaimed the captain as he shook hands with mr portney and the boys i couldnt keep away no longer how are ye all  we are very well said foster portney how have you been doing  only fairly well answered the doctor to tell the truth i dont think it paid to strike out we have a little dust but no more i imagine than we should have had had we remained with you  the pair had come over to see if they could not arrange to remain at the cabin through the winter fearing that they would find it very lonesome if they went off by themselves they had brought along all their things including a stock of provisions and were willing to pay whatever was fair in addition as their company would no doubt prove very acceptable during the long cheerless days to come they were taken in without question  we can put up two more bunks somewhere said foster portney and though we may be rather crowded i reckon well manage it he had taken a great fancy to the doctor and was pleased to think he would not have to depend altogether on the boys for companionship as for the boys randy declared that the presence of the jovial captain would make every day seem several hours shorter fred whose story had been told in secret also took to the newcomers and all together they formed a happy family  but the height of the winter was now on them and it was destined to keep its grip for many long weeks and months to come the storm that had started on the day the doctor and the captain arrived kept up with more or less vigor for a week and by that time they found themselves snowed in completely the thermometer kept going down steadily registering as low as fifteen degrees below zero and on more than one occasion the pail of water standing up against the side of the stove was frozen solid to keep thoroughly warm was impossible even though they wrapped themselves in all the clothing and blankets their outfits afforded     chapter xxix  waiting and watching for spring   perhaps it isnt cold i never felt so frozen up in my life  it was randy who uttered the words as he danced around the floor of the livingroom almost on top of the stove the fire had burned low during the night and he had just shoved in some fresh wood and opened the draughts going to the little window of the sleepingapartment he looked through the single pane of glass at the thermometer which hung on the casement outside the mercury registered twentytwo degrees below zero  twentytwo degrees below and this is christmas morning he went on with another shiver the best thing santa claus can bring us is warmer weather  merry christmas cried fred tumbling out of his bunk and his cry awoke the others and the greeting went the whole round the fire was now blazing with a vigor which threatened to crack the stove yet as they talked they could see each others breath every one was stamping around to get his blood in circulation  ill give ye some hot coffee and christmas flapjacks said the captain and soon a smell which was most appetizing was floating through the air and they sat down at the table which had been placed as close to the fire as possible indeed hugging the stove was a common trick all day long and fred often grumbled because he could not take the stove to bed with him the boys were waking up to the fact that an alaskan winter was two winters in one as earl said when compared with those experienced at home  it had been snowing again indeed it snowed about half the time now and even in the middle of the day it was so dark they could scarcely see excepting right in front of the windows some time previous several indians had appeared with fish oil and some dried fat fish to sell and they had purchased a quantity of both for lighting purposes the oil was used in a lamp made of a round tin having a homemade wick hanging over the side the fat fish dried very hard were slit in strips and set up to be lighted and burnt as tallow candles many of the indians and the esquimaux have no lights but these driedfish candles the smell from them is far from pleasant but they are certainly better than nothing  as it was a holiday the boys felt they must do something but what to do was the question until fred suggested they try their hand at making some candy they were allowed just a pound of sugar by the men and worked themselves half sick over the wood fire until noon when the candy was declared done it was a sort of taffy and although it would not have added to the reputation of a skilled confectioner all hands partook of their share of it and declared it excellent  just before being snowed in mr portney had become the possessor of two newspapers and a magazine and much of the time was spent by one or another over these the magazine was rather a heavy one yet the boys read it through from cover to cover including all the advertisements it contained among other stories one which was continued and to pass away the time they tried to invent a conclusion this selfimposed task amused the doctor also and he took a hand and finished the tale in a manner which took three evenings to tell  and so new years day came and went and still they found themselves housed up with the thermometer continually at fifteen to twenty degrees below once it went down to twentysix below and everything fairly cracked with the cold to keep from being frozen one and another stood guard during the night that the fire might not go down during that time they received but scant news from their neighbors although the cabins along the under side of the cliff were less than seventy yards apart nobody cared to venture out and even opening the door was something to be considered although the doctor insisted on having a little fresh air  providence help the poor chaps who are not well provided for this winter said mr portney one day i shouldnt wonder if some of them are found dead in the spring  to be sure answered the captain i looked ter somethin putty bad myself but i didnt expect nuthin like this why we might jest as well be asittin on the top o the north pole haint been a blessed streak o sunshine fer eight days an every time it snows the stuff piles up a foot or so more it must be nigh on to thirty feet deep in yonder gulch  well have to economize with our store before long put in the doctor flour is running pretty low captain youll have to give us less flapjackstheyre too toothsome  yes well have to come down to plain bread said foster portney and maybe eat it stale too he added  economizing began that day after mr portney had taken an account of the provisions still left to them whatever they had must be made to do for three months yet and three months meant ninety days a goodly number for which to provide  slowly the days wore on every one so much like the others that it seemed impossible to tell them apart sunday was the one day they observed through it all on the morning of that the doctor invariably read a chapter out of the bible he carried and one or another of the rest offered prayer its right an proper said the captain speaking of this we dont want ter live like no heathens even if we are cast away in an ocean o snow  february proved the worst month of all it snowed nearly the whole time and it was so dark that they kept the lights lit as long as they dared to consume the fish oil and the dried fish during that time they saw or heard nothing of their neighbors who might have died of starvation without their being any the wiser the snow against the door was five feet high and water was obtained by shovelling this into the pot instead of ice and melting it  well its a dogs life and thats the truth said earl one day in the middle of march its worth all the gold weve foundthats my opinion it was the first time earl had grumbled since winter set in but as he had not had what he called a square meal for a month he can well be pardoned for the speech  if i thought i could get there and back i would try for some extra provisions from dawson said foster portney but none of the others would hear of his attempting such a trip feeling certain he would lose his way and perish  well make out with what we have said the doctor divide the rations so theyll hold out until the middle of april i fancy by that time this winter siege will about end his advice was followed out and they waited with all the patience possible for the coming of spring  the fish and game had long since come to an end and they were now living on plain bread beans and bacon or pork and half a can of fresh vegetables per day with an occasional taste of stewed dried apples or apricots as a side dish they were all tired of the beans especially fred and the doctor who had been used to good living all their lives  theyre too much for me said fred one day as he pushed his small plateful back id rather eat a crust of bread and drink snow water and the beans remained untouched for two days when he was forced out of sheer hunger to go at them again  they had also reached the last half pound of coffee and by a general vote this was reserved for dinner each sunday as the amount on hand decreased they made the beverage weaker and weaker until the doctor laughingly declared that the snow flavored the water more than the coffee did the lack of coffee hit the captain more than the others for he loved his cupful strong black and without sugar  it was on the last day of march that they heard a noise outside and then came a faint hammering on their door all leaped up and ran to open the barrier when it had been forced back a distance of a foot they beheld two miners there so weak they could scarcely stand much less speak sumthin to eat whispered one of them hoarsely and the other echoed the word eat as being all he could say  the two were taken into the cabin and warmed up while earl prepared a thin vegetable soup for them that being best for their stomachs according to the doctor they could hardly swallow at first and it was not until the following morning that they were strong enough to sit up and tell their stories they had been wintering back of the woods but starvation had driven them forth in an attempt to reach dawson city for supplies their strength had failed them they had lost their way and here they were  take care of us and well pay you well said one of the miners weve got over a thousand dollars in gold dust with us and ten thousand in dust and nuggets hidden up at the camp  im afraid your money wont count up here replied foster portney sadly were almost as badly off ourselves yet i am willing to share what i have a vote was taken and the miners remained and that made two more mouths to feed out of their scanty store  the first week in april saw them reduced to next to nothing the flour was gone so was the bacon and the canned goods and it was pork and beans and stewed dried apples twice a day and nothing more every one looked haggard and all felt that something must happen soon would spring ever come  pork and beans enough to last about three days yet said foster portney as he surveyed the scanty store with the others standing around three days and after that he did not finish and a silence fell on the crowd were they to suffer the pangs of actual starvation after all     chapter xxx  last washings for gold   just one day before their provisions gave out the skies brightened as if by magic and the sun came out warmly they could scarcely believe their eyes so sudden was the change the snow was cleared away from the door and every one lost no time in rushing out into the fresh air  this is living again cried earl and then he added let us beat down a path to wompoles cottage and see how he is faring  the others agreed and soon they had a trail to the next cabin where an old alaskan gold hunter had gone into quarters all by himself wompole was also out and they shook hands when questioned he said he had run out of everything but beans dried peas and some smoked salmon and he agreed to let them have enough of his stores to last them three days longer  winter is broke up now he remarked an i reckon thar aint no doubt but wot ye kin git ter dawson an back if ye try  and i shall try said foster portney and an hour later he and captain zoss started off on snowshoes which they had made during their many idle hours randy and earl saw their uncle depart with much anxiety but did nothing to detain him for food they must have and that appeared the only manner in which to obtain it  if we could only bring down a bird or something with the gun said earl some time later and then he climbed the cliff and beat a path to the first belt of timber but though he thrashed around three hours not a sign of game was to be discovered anywhere  the night was cold but not nearly as much so as other nights had been and on the following day the mercury when held in the sun actually crawled up to ten degrees above zero and so it kept gradually becoming warmer until the snow started to melt and they knew for a certainty that the long and tedious winter was a thing of the past  it took foster portney and captain zoss five full days to find their way to dawson city and back again the return for the larger portion of the way was made on dog sledges driven by indians they had found provisions very scarce and high in price in dawson city but had brought back enough to last a month one of the indians had also brought provisions for the two miners this commission having been executed through mr portney and the next day the miners set off for their own cabin with many sincere thanks for the assistance which had been rendered them  on the day the provisions came in they celebrated by having what dr barwaithe called a round square meal to be sure there was nothing but the plainest kind of food but there was enough and that was of prime importance  after this they watched eagerly for the day to come when they might get to work again a bargain had been struck all around whereby the doctor and the captain were to work the single sluice box on the upper claim and have fourfifths of the findings the other fifth going to foster portney for keeping themthe contract to hold good so long as the pair were content to remain in the present camp  the water is running in the gulch was the welcome announcement made by earl one day and all went down to see the thin stream which soon became stronger the snow was almost gone now and the sand gravel and dirt which was exposed to the sun was quite free from frost the picks shovels and other tools were brought out and cleaned up and two days later found them at work as during the previous summer it was marvellous how the seasons changed when once there was a start  before the end of the month mr portney made another trip to dawson city and this time he took with him both randy and earl they had settled that they should remain in the gulch until the first of august and now they took back by indian carriers enough provisions to last the camp until that time  the stop in dawson lasted two days and the boys had a chance to walk about the town and see how it had improved there were now at least twoscore of buildings and several of them were quite pretentious at the dock were two steamboats both nearly free of the ice which had held them fast all winter  in the town there was much news to be heard of the many wonderful strikes which had been made several had taken out over a hundred thousand dollars in dust and nuggets and were waiting for navigation to open on the yukon that they might sail for home with their riches no one who had accumulated a pile cared to remain in that forsaken country  just before they were to start for the gulch mr portney brought news of tom roland the man had been captured at circle city two months before and the gold stolen from cozzins taken from him he had escaped from his temporary jail and fled to the mountains and now his dead body had been found at the foot of a lofty cañon down which he had most likely tumbled during the snowstorm which was then raging it was a sad ending to a misspent life and the boys could not help but shudder as they heard the story they wondered what had become of jasper guardley but nothing further was ever heard of that cowardly rascal  by the first of june the gulch was as active as it had ever been during the previous summer and the mosquitoes and flies were just as numerous and troublesome no more finds of nuggets of large size were made but the sluice boxes yielded heavy returns of dust and all were very well content and dr barwaithe and captain zoss gave up all thoughts of leaving  we know what we have here said the doctor and i am convinced that too much prospecting does not pay  an besides its something ter be in company which is congenial added the captain over to the other claim it was nuthin but fight the whole day long with yer neighbors about stake lines  by the end of july the sand and gravel taken from the bedrock of mosquito hollow gulch had been disposed of and now a month was given to a general clearing up of the dirt taken from half a dozen little hollows which lay on either side it was terribly hot again but the workers took their time over what they did and often rested during the middle of the day three days before the first of september they were done  there that settles it cried foster portney as he flung down his shovel no more work for me until i have paid a visit to the states  hurrah shouted randy and he gave his pick a whirl which sent it thirty feet off im just aching for a sight of civilization  and for an oldfashioned meal added earl  freds eyes glistened but he said nothing he was wondering what sort of a reception he would receive when he got home he had sent on two letters from the gulch but no answer had come back and there was no telling if the communications had reached their destination  the next day was spent in the delightful task of counting up the proceeds of their venture of course it was impossible to calculate closely yet they were conservative in their estimates and in the end when their nuggets and dust were turned over to the united states mint in san francisco they were not disappointed as to the check received in return  the upper claim during the time it was worked by dr barwaithe and captain zoss in the spring had yielded five thousand dollars of this as per agreement two thousand dollars went to the doctor a like sum to the captain and one thousand dollars to foster portney added to what they had made previously the doctor and the captain now held a matter of nine thousand dollars worth of gold between them not a fortune but still a tidy sum all things considered  the portneys of course had fared much better the total yield of gold to them from start to finish footed up to fiftytwo thousand dollars of this amount as we know onehalf went to earl and randy which gave the lads exactly thirteen thousand dollars apiece twentysix thousand dollars was foster portneys share but out of this he had been compelled to spend three thousand dollars in bringing the party up and keeping them and he would have to spend nearly another thousand in getting them home  during the early summer of the present year earl randy and foster portney had held a private talk concerning the amount to be granted to fred and it had been decided that he should have an even thousand dollars one half to come from the two boys share and the other from their uncle freds fare was also to be paid clear through to basco the lad when told of this decision said he was more than satisfied as the amount of work he had been able to do had really been very small on account of frequent attacks of sickness  i cant stand the climate he said and i shant attempt to come up here again if father will let me ill go to college and become a lawyer  the doctor was going on to dawson city to give up mining and establish himself in his profession having become satisfied that he could do better at this than he could in working a claim but the captain decided to remain where he was  im bound ter strike it rich some day he said an im goin ter rustle till i do  i certainly hope you strike it rich said randy for the pair were now greater friends than ever  it was a warm clear day when the party of five left the gulch with their faces set toward dawson city the portneys had decided to return to the states by the way of the yukon and the pacific ocean and a voyage of five thousand miles still lay before them they carried all their findings with them and now the question arosehaving found so much gold would they be able to get it out of this wild country in safety     chapter xxxi  down the yukon and home   foster portney knew that the regular terminus of travel on the yukon steamboats was fort cudahy which was situated fortyeight miles below dawson city but owing to the rush to the new gold fields which was now stronger than ever two small boats were making regular trips between these two points  when the party reached dawson city now the scene of great activity it was found they would have to wait a week before they could secure passage to fort cudahy as the tickets for the two following trips were all sold this wait when they were impatient to get home was not an agreeable one yet it gave them a chance to look around the settlement and become better acquainted with the various persons who were there  dawson is bound to grow said the doctor who had hired a room at the socalled hotel and hung out his sign on the day he arrived see there are actually three streets already two stores three saloons a barber shop and a reading and pool room and i understand that a fellow has just arrived who is going to open a clothing store and another is on his way with medicines for a drug store we are bound to boom  we is good said earl with a laugh i guess you had better strike up a partnership with that druggist when he arrives  not much earl ill put him in the way of getting the gold fever and when he is ready to strike out ill buy his outfit and run the whole thing myself im bound to make money and it looked as if the doctor was right for during their stay in dawson city he had eleven calls for his services for which he charged the fee of five dollars per call which was moderate for that place  at last came the day to part and with a hearty handshake from the doctor the portneys and fred boarded the little sidewheeler alice and the long homeward trip was begun the boat was crowded with returning miners and as nearly all of them had struck gold it was a happy congregation which spent the time in eating drinking smoking playing cards and swapping yarns swapping yarns went on continually and many were the wonderful stories told of great finds perilous climbs and escapes from starvation during the awful winter  ive made seventy thousand dollars boys said one elderly miner but i never did so much starving in my life an ten hosses couldnt drag me back to put in another such winterhear me  im with ye said another leaswise i think i am but thars no tellin wot i might do ef the gold fever struck me agin he added reflectively  fort cudahy was a small settlement on the yukon at the mouth of clinton creek just above the creek was another settlement called forty mile between the stores in the two settlements there was a fierce rivalry and consequently prices here were more reasonable than at dawson city  the party was fortunate in obtaining immediate passage to fort get there on st michaels island which is situated sixty miles above the entrance to the yukon an offer was also made by the agent of the transportation company to take charge of their gold from there right on through to san francisco but as the commission for doing this would be fifteen per cent this offer was declined  i think we can get it through said foster portney at any rate i am willing to risk it and the boys agreed with him  the next stop of importance was circle city of which the boys had heard through mr portney in former days circle city had been the banner mining town on the upper yukon but now its glory was departed for over threequarters of its inhabitants had pulled up stakes and moved on to the klondike district  from circle city the river already broad widened out to such an extent that it looked more like a lake than anything else it was dotted with numerous islands and the pilot of the boat had his head full with keeping track of the proper channel to pursue the run was north to the ruins of fort yukon the highest point gained by the mighty river upon which they were sailing  from fort yukon the run was mostly to the southwestward past the settlements of shamans we are nulato and a dozen similar places indian villages the home of fur traders missionaries and of fishers at many of the places the main things to be seen were the totem poles stuck up in front of the indian hutspoles of wood curiously carved with hideouslooking images and undecipherable hieroglyphics  at last st michaels island was gained and here they found themselves again in luck for an ocean steamer was in waiting to take the passengers from the river boat the transfer was made before nightfall and at dawn of the day following the steamer started on her long voyage down norton sound bering sea and the pacific ocean to seattle but one stop was made that at dutch harbor on one of the aleutian islands and then one glorious afternoon early in the fall they steamed through the straits of san juan de fuca and swept into the grand harbor at seattle  the united states at last cried randy oh my how good civilization does look  we dont know what we have at home until we miss it said fred but in such a low tone that nobody heard him  they stopped in seattle two days and then took steamer direct for san francisco the trip down the coast was an uneventful one they were impatient to finish it and a glad cry rang everywhere through the vessel when land was sighted and they ran through the golden gate  a crowd was at the wharf to receive the latest news from the gold fields how are the diggings up there is there any show for a fellow staking a good claim how much did you bring along is it true about provisions being scarce these and a hundred other questions went the rounds as the fortunate ones came ashore foster portney managed to keep the boys together and get them through the jam and quarter of an hour later found them on the way to the mint with their precious burdens here they were given receipts for their nuggets and dust and then they turned away with a big load lifted off their minds for they knew that their fortunes were now safe  and here properly ends the tale of the fortune hunters of the yukon how fred dobson returned home a penitent runaway and how he was readily forgiven and later on allowed to study for college i will leave my readers to imagine as for earl and randy there was nothing which called for their return to basco and they remained with their uncle in san francisco until their gold was reduced to coin and they received a check on the treasurer of the united states for its value then they paid a visit to colorado remaining there until the following spring during the winter a company was organized to work their claims by machinery and early spring found them again in the land of gold and there we will leave them wishing them all the success that their pluck and industry deserve
