      5  may it not leap and play as grown cats do  till its claws come prithee for this one time  content thee with a visionary rhyme   2  what hand would crush the silkenwinged fly  the youngest of inconstant aprils minions                   10  because it cannot climb the purest sky  where the swan sings amid the suns dominions  not thine thou knowest tis its doom to die  when day shall hide within her twilight pinions  the lucent eyes and the eternal smile                       15  serene as thine which lent it life awhile   3  to thy fair feet a winged vision came  whose date should have been longer than a day  and oer thy head did beat its wings for fame  and in thy sight its fading plumes display                   20  the watery bow burned in the evening flame  but the shower fell the swift sun went his way  and that is deado let me not believe  that anything of mine is fit to live   4  wordsworth informs us he was nineteen years                   25  considering and retouching peter bell  watering his laurels with the killing tears  of slow dull care so that their roots to hell  might pierce and their wide branches blot the spheres  of heaven with dewy leaves and flowers this well            30  may be for heaven and earth conspire to foil  the overbusy gardeners blundering toil   5  my witch indeed is not so sweet a creature  as ruth or lucy whom his graceful

shrive you of that sinif sin there be  in love when it becomes idolatry    the witch of atlas   1  before those cruel twins whom at one birth  incestuous change bore to her father time                    50  error and truth had hunted from the earth  all those bright natures which adorned its prime  and left us nothing to believe in worth  the pains of putting into learned rhyme  a ladywitch there lived on atlas mountain                   55  within a cavern by a secret fountain   2  her mother was one of the atlantides  the allbeholding sun had neer beholden  in his wide voyage oer continents and seas  so fair a creature as she lay enfolden                       60  in the warm shadow of her loveliness  he kissed her with his beams and made all golden  the chamber of gray rock in which she lay  she in that dream of joy dissolved away   3  tis said she first was changed into a vapour               65  and then into a cloud such clouds as flit  like splendourwinged moths about a taper  round the red west when the sun dies in it  and then into a meteor such as caper  on hilltops when the moon is in a fit                       70  then into one of those mysterious stars  which hide themselves between the earth and mars   4  ten times the mother of the months had bent  her bow beside the foldingstar and bidden  with that bright sign the billows to indent                   75  the seadeserted sandlike children chidden  at her command they ever came and went  since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden  took shape and motion with the living form  of this embodied power the cave grew warm                   80   5  a lovely lady garmented in light  from her own beautydeep her eyes as are  two openings of unfathomable night  seen through a temples cloven roofher hair  darkthe dim brain whirls dizzy with delight                85  picturing her form her soft smiles shone afar  and her low voice was heard like love and drew  all living things towards this wonder new   6  and first the spotted cameleopard came  and then the wise and fearless elephant                      90  then the sly serpent in the golden flame  of his own volumes intervolvedall gaunt  and sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame  they drank before her at her sacred fount  and every beast of beating heart grew bold                   95  such gentleness and power even to behold   7  the brinded lioness led forth her young  that she might teach them how they should forego  their inborn thirst of death the pard unstrung  his sinews at her feet and sought to know                    100  with looks whose motions spoke without a tongue  how he might be as gentle as the doe  the magic circle of her voice and eyes  all savage natures did imparadise   8  and old silenus shaking a green stick                        105  of lilies and the woodgods in a crew  came blithe as in the olive copses thick  cicadae are drunk with the noonday dew  and dryope and faunus followed quick  teasing the god to sing them something new                   110  till in this cave they found the lady lone  sitting upon a seat of emerald stone   9  and universal pan tis said was there  and though none saw himthrough the adamant  of the deep mountains through the trackless air             115  and through those living spirits like a want  he passed out of his everlasting lair  where the quick heart of the great world doth pant  and felt that wondrous lady all alone  and she felt him upon her emerald throne                    120   10  and every nymph of stream and spreading tree  and every shepherdess of oceans flocks  who drives her white waves over the green sea  and ocean with the brine on his gray locks  and quaint priapus with his company                          125  all came much wondering how the enwombed rocks  could have brought forth so beautiful a birth  her love subdued their wonder and their mirth   11  the herdsmen and the mountain maidens came  and the rude kings of pastoral garamant                     130  their spirits shook within them as a flame  stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt  pigmies and polyphemes by many a name  centaurs and satyrs and such shapes as haunt  wet cleftsand lumps neither alive nor dead                135  dogheaded bosomeyed and birdfooted   12  for she was beautifulher beauty made  the bright world dim and everything beside  seemed like the fleeting image of a shade  no thought of living spirit could abide                      140  which to her looks had ever been betrayed  on any object in the world so wide  on any hope within the circling skies  but on her form and in her inmost eyes   13  which when the lady knew she took her spindle                145  and twined three threads of fleecy mist and three  long lines of light such as the dawn may kindle  the clouds and waves and mountains with and she  as many starbeams ere their lamps could dwindle  in the belated moon wound skilfully                         150  and with these threads a subtle veil she wove  a shadow for the splendour of her love   14  the deep recesses of her odorous dwelling  were stored with magic treasuressounds of air  which had the power all spirits of compelling                155  folded in cells of crystal silence there  such as we hear in youth and think the feeling  will never dieyet ere we are aware  the feeling and the sound are fled and gone  and the regret they leave remains alone                      160   15  and there lay visions swift and sweet and quaint  each in its thin sheath like a chrysalis  some eager to burst forth some weak and faint  with the soft burthen of intensest bliss  it was its work to bear to many a saint                       165  whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is  even lovesand others white green gray and black  and of all shapesand each was at her beck   16  and odours in a kind of aviary  of everblooming edentrees she kept                         170  clipped in a floating net a lovesick fairy  had woven from dewbeams while the moon yet slept  as bats at the wired window of a dairy  they beat their vans and each was an adept  when loosed and missioned making wings of winds             175  to stir sweet thoughts or sad in destined minds   17  and liquors clear and sweet whose healthful might  could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep  and change eternal death into a night  of glorious dreamsor if eyes needs must weep               180  could make their tears all wonder and delight  she in her crystal vials did closely keep  if men could drink of those clear vials tis said  the living were not envied of the dead   18  her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device           185  the works of some saturnian archimage  which taught the expiations at whose price  men from the gods might win that happy age  too lightly lost redeeming native vice  and which might quench the earthconsuming rage               190  of gold and bloodtill men should live and move  harmonious as the sacred stars above   19  and how all things that seem untameable  not to be checked and not to be confined  obey the spells of wisdoms wizard skill                     195  time earth and firethe ocean and the wind  and all their shapesand mans imperial will  and other scrolls whose writings did unbind  the inmost lore of lovelet the profane  tremble to ask what secrets they contain                     200   20  and wondrous works of substances unknown  to which the enchantment of her fathers power  had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone  were heaped in the recesses of her bower  carved lamps and chalices and vials which shone              205  in their own golden beamseach like a flower  out of whose depth a firefly shakes his light  under a cypress in a starless night   21  at first she lived alone in this wild home  and her own thoughts were each a minister                    210  clothing themselves or with the ocean foam  or with the wind or with the speed of fire  to work whatever purposes might come  into her mind such power her mighty sire  had girt them with whether to fly or run                    215  through all the regions which he shines upon   22  the oceannymphs and hamadryades  oreads and naiads with long weedy locks  offered to do her bidding through the seas  under the earth and in the hollow rocks                     220  and far beneath the matted roots of trees  and in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks  so they might live for ever in the light  of her sweet presenceeach a satellite   23  this may not be the wizard maid replied                   225  the fountains where the naiades bedew  their shining hair at length are drained and dried  the solid oaks forget their strength and strew  their latest leaf upon the mountains wide  the boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        230  will be consumedthe stubborn centre must  be scattered like a cloud of summer dust   24  and ye with them will perish one by one  if i must sigh to think that this shall be  if i must weep when the surviving sun                         235  shall smile on your decayoh ask not me  to love

weptthe dark and azure well  sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears  and every little circlet where they fell  flung to the cavernroof inconstant spheres  and intertangled lines of lighta knell                     245  of sobbing voices came upon her ears  from those departing forms oer the serene  of the white streams and of the forest green   26  all day the wizard lady sate aloof  spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity                      250  under the caverns fountainlighted roof  or broidering the pictured poesy  of some high tale upon her growing woof  which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye  in hues outshining heavenand ever she                       255  added some grace to the wrought poesy   27  while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece  of sandal wood rare gums and cinnamon  men scarcely know how beautiful fire is  each flame of it is as a precious stone                       260  dissolved in evermoving light and this  belongs to each and all who gaze upon  the witch beheld it not for in her hand  she held a woof that dimmed the burning brand   28  this lady never slept but lay in trance                      265  all night within the fountainas in sleep  its emerald crags glowed in her beautys glance  through the green splendour of the water deep  she saw the constellations reel and dance  like firefliesand withal did ever keep                     270  the tenour of her contemplations calm  with open eyes closed feet and folded palm   29  and when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended  from the white pinnacles of that cold hill  she passed at dewfall to a space extended                    275  where in a lawn of flowering asphodel  amid a wood of pines and cedars blended  there yawned an inextinguishable well  of crimson firefull even to the brim  and overflowing all the margin trim                          280   30  within the which she lay when the fierce war  of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor  in many a mimic moon and bearded star  oer woods and lawnsthe serpent heard it flicker  in sleep and dreaming still he crept afar                 285  and when the windless snow descended thicker  than autumn leaves she watched it as it came  melt on the surface of the level flame   31  she had a boat which some say vulcan wrought  for venus as the chariot of her star                        290  but it was found too feeble to be fraught  with all the ardours in that sphere which are  and so she sold it and apollo bought  and gave it to this daughter from a car  changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  295  which ever upon mortal stream did float   32  and others say that when but three hours old  the firstborn love out of his cradle lept  and clove dun chaos with his wings of gold  and like a horticultural adept                               300  stole a strange seed and wrapped it up in mould  and sowed it in his mothers star and kept  watering it all the summer with sweet dew  and with his wings fanning it as it grew   33  the plant grew strong and green the snowy flower             305  fell and the long and gourdlike fruit began  to turn the light and dew by inward power  to its own substance woven tracery ran  of light firm texture ribbed and branching oer  the solid rind like a leafs veined fan                    310  of which love scooped this boatand with soft motion  piloted it round the circumfluous ocean   34  this boat she moored upon her fount and lit  a living spirit within all its frame  breathing the soul of swiftness into it                      315  couched on the fountain like a panther tame  one of the twain at evans feet that sit  or as on vestas sceptre a swift flame  or on blind homers heart a winged thought  in joyous expectation lay the boat                           320   35  then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow  together tempering the repugnant mass  with liquid loveall things together grow  through which the harmony of love can pass  and a fair shape out of her hands did flow                  325  a living image which did far surpass  in beauty that bright shape of vital stone  which drew the heart out of pygmalion   36  a sexless thing it was and in its growth  it seemed to have developed no defect                         330  of either sex yet all the grace of both  in gentleness and strength its limbs were decked  the bosom swelled lightly with its full youth  the countenance was such as might select  some artist that his skill should never die                  335  imaging forth such perfect purity   37  from its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings  fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere  tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings  dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere                        340  she led her creature to the boiling springs  where the light boat was moored and said sit here  and pointed to the prow and took her seat  beside the rudder with opposing feet   38  and down the streams which clove those mountains vast        345  around their inland islets and amid  the pantherpeopled forests whose shade cast  darkness and odours and a pleasure hid  in melancholy gloom the pinnace passed  by many a starsurrounded pyramid                             350  of icy crag cleaving the purple sky  and caverns yawning round unfathomably   39  the silver noon into that winding dell  with slanted gleam athwart the forest tops  tempered like golden evening feebly fell                    355  a green and glowing light like that which drops  from folded lilies in which glowworms dwell  when earth over her face nights mantle wraps  between the severed mountains lay on high  over the stream a narrow rift of sky                        360   40  and ever as she went the image lay  with folded wings and unawakened eyes  and oer its gentle countenance did play  the busy dreams as thick as summer flies  chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay                 365  and drinking the warm tears and the sweet sighs  inhaling which with busy murmur vain  they had aroused from that full heart and brain   41  and ever down the prone vale like a cloud  upon a stream of wind the pinnace went                      370  now lingering on the pools in which abode  the calm and darkness of the deep content  in which they paused now oer the shallow road  of white and dancing waters all besprent  with sand and polished pebblesmortal boat                  375  in such a shallow rapid could not float   42  and down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver  their snowlike waters into golden air  or under chasms unfathomable ever  sepulchre them till in their rage they tear                  380  a subterranean portal for the river  it fledthe circling sunbows did upbear  its fall down the hoar precipice of spray  lighting it far upon its lampless way   43  and when the wizard lady would ascend                         385  the labyrinths of some manywinding vale  which to the inmost mountain upward tend  she called hermaphroditusand the pale  and heavy hue which slumber could extend  over its lips and eyes as on the gale                        390  a rapid shadow from a slope of grass  into the darkness of the stream did pass   44  and it unfurled its heavencoloured pinions  with stars of fire spotting the stream below  and from above into the suns dominions                       395  flinging a glory like the golden glow  in which spring clothes her emeraldwinged minions  all interwoven with fine feathery snow  and moonlight splendour of intensest rime  with which frost paints the pines in winter time             400   45  and then it winnowed the elysian air  which ever hung about that lady bright  with its aethereal vansand speeding there  like a star up the torrent of the night  or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         405  breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight  the pinnace oared by those enchanted wings  clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs   46  the water flashed like sunlight by the prow  of a noonwandering meteor flung to heaven                   410  the still air seemed as if its waves did flow  in tempest down the mountains loosely driven  the ladys radiant hair streamed to and fro  beneath the billows having vainly striven  indignant and impetuous roared to feel                       415  the swift and steady motion of the keel   47  or when the weary moon was in the wane  or in the noon of interlunar night  the ladywitch in visions could not chain  her spirit but sailed forth under the light                  420  of shooting stars and bade extend amain  its stormoutspeeding wings the hermaphrodite  she to the austral waters took her way  beyond the fabulous thamondocana   48  where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven              425  which rain could never bend or whirlblast shake  with the antarctic constellations paven  canopus and his crew lay the austral lake  there she would build herself a windless haven  out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   430  the bastions of the storm when through the sky  the spirits of the tempest thundered by   49  a haven beneath whose translucent floor  the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably  and around which the solid vapours hoar                      435  based on the level waters to the sky  lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore  of wintry mountains inaccessibly  hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray  and hanging crags many a cove and bay                       440   50  and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash  of the winds scourge foamed like a wounded thing  and the incessant hail with stony clash  ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing  of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                445  looked like the wreck of some windwandering  fragment of inky thundersmokethis haven  was as a gem to copy heaven engraven   51  on which that lady played her many pranks  circling the image of a shooting star                        450  even as a tiger on hydaspes banks  outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are  in her light boat and many quips and cranks  she played upon the water till the car  of the late moon like a sick matron wan                     455  to journey from the misty east began   52  and then she called out of the hollow turrets  of those high clouds white golden and vermilion  the armies of her ministering spirits  in mighty legions million after million                     460  they came each troop emblazoning its merits  on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion  of the intertexture of the atmosphere  they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere   53  they framed the imperial tent of their great queen            465  of woven exhalations underlaid  with lambent lightningfire as may be seen  a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid  with crimson silkcressets from the serene  hung there and on the water for her tread                    470  a tapestry of fleecelike mist was strewn  dyed in the beams of the ascending moon   54  and on a throne oerlaid with starlight caught  upon those wandering isles of aery dew  which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not               475  she sate and heard all that had happened new  between the earth and moon since they had brought  the last intelligenceand now she grew  pale as that moon lost in the watery night  and now she wept and now she laughed outright               480   55  these were tame pleasures she would often climb  the steepest ladder of the crudded rack  up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime  and like arion on the dolphins back  ride singing through the shoreless airofttime             485  following the serpent lightnings winding track  she ran upon the platforms of the wind  and laughed to hear the fireballs roar behind   56  and sometimes to those streams of upper air  which whirl the earth in its diurnal round                   490  she would ascend and win the spirits there  to let her join their chorus mortals found  that on those days the sky was calm and fair  and mystic snatches of harmonious sound  wandered upon the earth whereer she passed                  495  and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last   57  but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep  to glide adown old nilus where he threads  egypt and aethiopia from the steep  of utmost axume until he spreads                            500  like a calm flock of silverfleeced sheep  his waters on the plain and crested heads  of cities and proud temples gleam amid  and many a vapourbelted pyramid   58  by moeris and the mareotid lakes                             505  strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors  where naked boys bridling tame watersnakes  or charioteering ghastly alligators  had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes  of those huge formswithin the brazen doors                  510  of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast  tired with the pomp of their osirian feast   59  and where within the surface of the river  the shadows of the massy temples lie  and never are erasedbut tremble ever                        515  like things which every cloud can doom to die  through lotuspaven canals and wheresoever  the works of man pierced that serenest sky  with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight  to wander in the shadow of the night                         520   60  with motion like the spirit of that wind  whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet  passed through the peopled haunts of humankind  scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet  through fane and palacecourt and labyrinth mined           525  with many a dark and subterranean street  under the nile through chambers high and deep  she passed observing mortals in their sleep   61  a pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see  mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep                   530  here lay two sister twins in infancy  there a lone youth who in his dreams did weep  within two lovers linked innocently  in their loose locks which over both did creep  like ivy from one stemand there lay calm                   535  old age with snowbright hair and folded palm   62  but other troubled forms of sleep she saw  not to be mirrored in a holy song  distortions foul of supernatural awe  and pale imaginings of visioned wrong                        540  and all the code of customs lawless law  written upon the brows of old and young  this said the wizard maiden is the strife  which stirs the liquid surface of mans life   63  and little did the sight disturb her soul                  545  we the weak mariners of that wide lake  whereer its shores extend or billows roll  our course unpiloted and starless make  oer its wild surface to an unknown goal  but she in the calm depths her way could take                550  where in bright bowers immortal forms abide  beneath the weltering of the restless tide   64  and she saw princes couched under the glow  of sunlike gems and round each templecourt  in dormitories ranged row after row                         555  she saw the priests asleepall of one sort  for all were educated to be so  the peasants in their huts and in the port  the sailors she saw cradled on the waves  and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves            560   65  and all the forms in which those spirits lay  were to her sight like the diaphanous  veils in which those sweet ladies oft array  their delicate limbs who would conceal from us  only their scorn of all concealment they                     565  move in the light of their own beauty thus  but these and all now lay with sleep upon them  and little thought a witch was looking on them   66  she all those human figures breathing there  beheld as living spiritsto her eyes                         570  the naked beauty of the soul lay bare  and often through a rude and worn disguise  she saw the inner form most bright and fair  and then she had a charm of strange device  which murmured on mute lips with tender tone                575  could make that spirit mingle with her own   67  alas aurora what wouldst thou have given  for such a charm when tithon became gray  or how much venus of thy silver heaven  wouldst thou have yielded ere proserpina                     580  had half oh why not all the debt forgiven  which dear adonis had been doomed to pay  to any witch who would have taught you it  the heliad doth not know its value yet   68  tis said in after times her spirit free                      585  knew what love was and felt itself alone  but holy dian could not chaster be  before she stooped to kiss endymion  than now this ladylike a sexless bee  tasting all blossoms and confined to none                   590  among those mortal forms the wizardmaiden  passed with an eye serene and heart unladen   69  to those she saw most beautiful she gave  strange panacea in a crystal bowl  they drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave            595  and lived thenceforward as if some control  mightier than life were in them and the grave  of such when death oppressed the weary soul  was as a green and overarching bower  lit by the gems of many a starry flower                      600   70  for on the night when they were buried she  restored the embalmers ruining and shook  the light out of the funeral lamps to be  a mimic day within that deathy nook  and she unwound the woven imagery                             605  of second childhoods swaddling bands and took  the coffin its last cradle from its niche  and threw it with contempt into a ditch   71  and there the body lay age after age  mute breathing beating warm and undecaying               610  like one asleep in a green hermitage  with gentle smiles about its eyelids playing  and living in its dreams beyond the rage  of death or life while they were still arraying  in liveries ever new the rapid blind                        615  and fleeting generations of mankind   72  and she would write strange dreams upon the brain  of those who were less beautiful and make  all harsh and crooked purposes more vain  than in the desert is the serpents wake                      620  which the sand coversall his evil gain  the miser in such dreams would rise and shake  into a beggars lapthe lying scribe  would his own lies betray without a bribe   73  the priests would write an explanation full                  625  translating hieroglyphics into greek  how the god apis really was a bull  and nothing more and bid the herald stick  the same against the temple doors and pull  the old cant down they licensed all to speak                 630  whateer they thought of hawks and cats and geese  by pastoral letters to each diocese   74  the king would dress an ape up in his crown  and robes and seat him on his glorious seat  and on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   635  would place a gaudy mockbird to repeat  the chatterings of the monkeyevery one  of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet  of their great emperor when the morning came  and kissedalas how many kiss the same                     640   75  the soldiers dreamed that they were blacksmiths and  walked out of quarters in somnambulism  round the red anvils you might see them stand  like cyclopses in vulcans sooty abysm  beating their swords to ploughsharesin a band              645  the gaolers sent those of the liberal schism  free through the streets of memphis much i wis  to the annoyance of king amasis   76  and timid lovers who had been so coy  they hardly knew whether they loved or not                   650  would rise out of their rest and take sweet joy  to the fulfilment of their inmost thought  and when next day the maiden and the boy  met one another both like sinners caught  blushed at the thing which each believed was done             655  only in fancytill the tenth moon shone   77  and then the witch would let them take no ill  of many thousand schemes which lovers find  the witch found oneand so they took their fill  of happiness in marriage

truth sincere   80  these were the pranks she played among the cities             665  of mortal men and what she did to sprites  and gods entangling them in her sweet ditties  to do her will and show their subtle sleights  i will declare another time for it is  a tale more fit for the weird winter nights                   670  than for these garish summer days when we  scarcely believe much more
