came in  now he said i wont let you fall  you was all she said  in another moment hawtrey sprang up on the platform and she felt his arms about her  then something seemed to crack and she saw the offside horse stumble and plunge  do you thinkthatwould have mattered  well she said we have driven over as we promised  agatha held her hands up  as the man leaned down and the next moment she was strongly lifted  i guess i neednt tell you where that is he said and pointed to the parallel of latitude that ran across  it seemed that he did not immediately notice her  are these things very much too big for you sally  it shambled forward in a curious manner  i thought you might save gregory if i told you  i was waiting for you she said simply     hawtreys deputy   chapter i  sally creighton  the frost outside was bitter and the prairie which rolled back from landers in long undulations to the far horizon gleamed white beneath the moon but there was warmth and brightness in stukelys wooden barn it stood at one end of the little desolate settlement where the trail that came up from the railroad thirty miles away forked off into two wavy ribands that melted into a waste of snow  landers consisted then of five or six frame houses and stores a hotel of the same material several sod stables and a few birchlog barns and its inhabitants considered it one of the most promising places in western canada that however is the land of promise a promise that is in due time usually fulfilled and the men of landers were for the most part shrewdly practical optimists  they made the most of a somewhat grim and frugal present and staked all they had to givethe few dollars they had brought in with them and their powers of enduring toilupon the roseate future  stukely had given them and their scattered neighbours who had driven there across several leagues of prairie a supper in his barn and a big rusty stove which had been brought in for the occasion stood in the midst of it  its pipe glowed in places a dull red and stukely now and then wondered uneasily whether it was charring a larger hole through the shingles of the roof  on one side of the stove the floor had been cleared on the other benches empty barrels and tables were huddled together and such of the guests as were not at the moment dancing sat upon them indiscriminately  a keg of hard ontario cider had been provided for their refreshment and it was open to anybody to ladle up what he wanted with a tin dipper while a haze of tobacco smoke drifted in thin blue wisps beneath the big nickelled lamps  in addition to the reek of it the place was filled with the smell of hot iron which an overdriven stove gives out and the subtle odours of old skin coats  the guests however were accustomed to an atmosphere of that kind and it did not trouble them  for the most part they were lean and spare bronzed by frost and snowblink and straight of limb for though scarcely half of them were canadian born the prairie as a rule swiftly sets its stamp upon the newcomer  there was also something in the way they held themselves and put their feet down that suggested health and vigour and in the case of most of them a certain alertness and decision of character  some hailed from english cities a few from those of canada and some from the bush of ontario but there was a similarity between them which the cut and tightness of their store clothing did not altogether account for  they lived well if plainly and toiled out in the open unusually hard  their eyes were steady their bronzed skin was clear and their laughter had a wholesome ring  a fieryhaired scot a highlander of the isles sat upon a barrelhead sawing at a fiddle and the shrill scream of it filled the barn  tone he did not aspire to but he played with caledonian verve and swing and kept the snapping time  it was mad harsh music of the kind that sets the blood tingling and the feet to move in rhythm though the exhilarating effect of it was rather spoiled by the efforts of the little french canadian who had another fiddle and threw in clanging chords upon the lower strings  they were dancing in the cleared space what was presumably a quadrille though it bore almost as great a resemblance to a scottish country dance or indeed to one of the measures of bretonne france which was however characteristic of the country  the englishman has set no distinguishable impress upon the prairie  it has absorbed him with his reserve and sturdy industry and the canadian from the cities is apparently lost in it too for theirs is the leaven that works through the mass slowly and unobtrusively and it is the scot and the habitant of french extraction who have given the life of it colour and individuality  extremes meet and fuse on the wide white levels of the west  it was however an englishman who was the life of that dance and he was physically a bigger man than most of the rest for as a rule at least the colonial born run to wiry hardness rather than solidity of frame  gregory hawtrey was tall and thick of shoulder though the rest of him was in fine modelling and he had a pleasant face of the english blueeyed type  just then it was suffused with almost boyish merriment and indeed an irresponsible gaiety was a salient characteristic of the man  one would have called him handsome though his mouth was a trifle slack and there was a certain assurance in his manner that just fell short of swagger  he was the kind of man one likes at first sight but for all that not the kind his hardbitten neighbours would have chosen to stand by them through the strain of drought and frost in adverse seasons  as it happened the grim hardfaced sager who had come there from michigan was just then talking to stukely about him  kind of tone about that manguess he once had the goldleaf on him quite thick and it hasnt all worn off yet he said  seen more englishmen like him and some folks from noo york too when i took parties bass fishing way back yonder  he waved his hand vaguely as though to indicate the american republic and stukely agreed with him  they were also right as far as they went for hawtrey undoubtedly possessed a grace of manner which however somehow failed to reach distinction  it was perhaps just a little too apparent and lacked the strengthening feature of restraint  i wonder said stukely reflectively what those kind of fellows done before they came out here  he had expressed a curiosity which is now and then to be met with on the prairie but sager the charitable grinned  oh he said i guess quite a few done no more than make their folks on the other side tired of them and thats why they sent them out to you  some of them get paid so much on condition that they dont come back again  sayand he glanced towards the dancersdick creightons sally seems quite stuck on hawtrey by the way shes looking at him  stukely assented  he was a somewhat primitive person as was sally creighton for that matter and he did not suppose she would have been greatly offended had she overheard his observations  well he said ive thought that too  if she wants him shell get him  shes a smart girlsally  there were not many women presentperhaps one to every two of the men which was however rather a large proportion in that country and none of their garments were particularly elegant  the fabric was for the most part the cheapest obtainable and they had fashioned it with their own fingers in the scanty interludes between washing and baking and mending their husbands or fathers clothes  their faces were a trifle sallow and had lost their freshness in the dry heat of the stove  their hands were hard and reddened and in figure most of them were thin and spare  one could have fancied that in a land where everybody toiled strenuously their burden was the heavier  one or two of them had clearly been accustomed to a smoother life but there was nothing to suggest that they looked back to it with regret  as a matter of fact they looked forward working for the future and there was patient courage in their smiling eyes  creightons sally who was then tripping through the measure on hawtreys arm was native born  she was young and straightstraighter in outline than the women of the citieswith a suppleness which was less suggestive of the willow than a rather highlytempered spring she moved with a large vigour which only just fell short of grace her eyes snapped when she smiled at hawtrey and her hair which was of a ruddy brown had fiery gleams in it  anyone would have called her comely and there was indeed no women in stukelys barn to compare with her in that respect which was a fact she recognised while every line and pose of her figure seemed expressive of an effervescent vitality  oh yes said sager reflectively shell get him sure if she sets her mind on it and theres no denying that they make a handsome pair ive nothing against hawtrey either a straight man a hustler and smart at handling a team  still its kind of curious that while the mans never been stuck for the stamps like the rest of us hes made nothing very much of his homestead yet  now theres bob and jake and jasper came in after he did with half the dollars and they thrash out four bushels of hard wheat for hawtreys three  stukely made a little gesture of concurrence for he dimly realised the significance of his companions speech  it is results which count in that country where the one thing demanded is practical efficiency and the man of simple steadfast purpose usually goes the farthest hawtrey had graces which won him friends boldness of conception and the power of application but he had somehow failed to accomplish as much as his neighbours did  after all there must be a good deal to be said for the man who raises four bushels of good wheat where his comrade with equal facilities raises three  in the meanwhile hawtrey was talking to sally and it was not astonishing that they talked of farming which is the standard topic on that strip of prairie  so youre not going to break that new piece this spring she said  no said hawtrey id want another team anyway and i cant raise the dollars theyre hard to get out here  plenty under the sod said sally who was essentially practical thats where we get ours but you have to put the breaker in and turn it over  youand she flashed a swift glance at himgot most of yours from england  wont they send you any more  hawtreys eyes twinkled as he shook his head  im afraid they wont he said  you see ive put the screw on them rather hard the last few years  how did you do that said sally  told them you were thinking of coming home again  there was a certain wryness in her companions smile for though hawtrey had cast no particular slur upon the familys credit he had signally failed to enhance it and he was quite aware that his english relatives did not greatly desire his presence in the old country  my dear he said you really shouldnt hit a fellow in the eye that way  as it happened he did not see the girls face just then or he might have noticed a momentary change in its expression  gregory hawtrey was a little casual in speech but so far most of the young women he bestowed an epithet of that kind upon had attached no significance to it  they had wisely decided that he did not mean anything  in another moment or two the scottish fiddlers voice broke in  can ye no watch the music  noo its paddybash he cried  his french canadian comrade waved his fiddlebow protestingly  paddybashy  vla la belle chose he said with ineffable contempt and broke in upon the ranting melody with a succession of harsh crashing chords  then it apparently became a contest as to which could drown the others instrument and the snapping time grew faster until the dancers gasped and men with long boots encouraged them with cries and stamped a staccato accompaniment upon the benches or on the floor  it was savage rasping music but one player infused into it the ebullient verve of france and the other was from the misty land where the fiddler learns the witchery of the clanging reel and the swing of the strathspey  it is doubtless not high art but there is probably no music in the world that fires the blood like this and turns the sober dance to rhythmic riot  perhaps too it gains something that gives it a closer compelling grip amidst the prairie snow  hawtrey at least was breathless when it ceased and sallys eyes flashed with the effulgence of the northern night when her partner found her a restingplace upon an upturned barrel  no she said i wont have any cider  she turned and glanced at him imperiously  youre not going for any more either  it was no doubt not the speech a welltrained english maiden would have made but though hawtrey smiled rather curiously it fell inoffensively from sallys lips  though it is not always set down to their credit the brownfaced hardhanded men as a rule live very abstemiously in that country and as it happened hawtrey who however certainly showed no sign of it had already consumed rather more cider than anybody else  he made a little sign of submission and sally resumed their conversation where it had broken off  we could let you have our oxteam to do that breaking with she said youve had sproatly living with you all winter  why dont you make him stay and work out his keep  hawtrey laughed  sally he said do you think anybody could make sproatly work  it would be hard the girl admitted and then looked up at him with a little glint in her eyes  still id put a move on him if you sent him along to me  she was a rather capable young woman but hawtrey was very dubious of her ability to accomplish as much as this  sproatly was an englishman of good education though his appearance seldom suggested it who drove about the prairie in a waggon vending cheap oleographs and patent medicines most of the summer and contrived to obtain free quarters from his bachelor acquaintances during the winter  it is a hospitable country but there were men round landers who when they went away to work in faroff lumber camps as they sometimes did nailed up their doors and windows to prevent sproatly getting in  does he never do anything sally added  no said hawtrey at least never when he can help it  he had however started something shortly before i left him  you see the house has wanted cleaning the last month or two and we tossed up for who should do it  it fell to sproatly who didnt seem quite pleased but he got as far as firing the chairs and tables out into the snow then he sat down for a smoke and he was looking at them through the window when i drove away  ah said his companion you want somebody to keep the house straight and look after you  didnt you know any nice girls back there in the old country  it was spoken naturally and there was nothing to show that the girls heart beat a little more rapidly than usual as she watched her companion  his face however grew a trifle graver for she had touched upon a rather momentous question to such men as him  there are a good many of them living in spartan simplicity upon the prairie welltrained wellconnected young englishmen and others like them from canadian cities  they naturally look for some grace of culture or refinement in the woman they would marry and there are few women of the station they once belonged to who could face the loneliness and unassisted drudgery that must be borne by the small wheatgrowers wife  there were also reasons why this question had been troubling hawtrey in particular of late  oh yes one or two he said  im not quite sure however that girls of that kind would find things even moderately comfortable here  there was a certain reflectiveness in his tone which since it seemed to indicate that he had already given the point some consideration jarred upon his companion  she had also an ample share of the western farmers pride which firmly declines to believe that there is any land to compare with the one the plough is slowly wresting from the wide white levels of the prairie  we make out well enough she said with a snap in her eyes  hawtrey made a little whimsical gesture  oh yes he admitted its in you  all you want to beat the wilderness and turn it into a garden is an axe a span of oxen and a breaker plough  you ought to be proud of it  still you see our folks back yonder arent quite the same as you  sally partly understood him  ah she said they want more and perhaps theyre used to having more than we have but isnt that in one way their misfortune  is it what folks want or what they can do that makes them of use to anybody else  there was a hard truth in her suggestion but hawtrey who seldom occupied himself with matters of that kind smiled  oh he said i dont know but after all it wouldnt be worth while our raising wheat here unless there were folks back east to eat it and if some of them only eat it in the shape of dainty cakes that doesnt affect the question  anyway theres only another dance or two and i was wondering whether i could drive you home ive got wyllards ontario sleigh  sally glanced at him rather sharply  she had halfexpected this offer and it is possible would have judiciously led him up to it if he had not made it  now as she saw that he really wished to drive her home she was glad that she had not done so  yes she said softly i think you could  then said hawtrey if youll wait ten minutes ill be back with the team     chapter ii  sally takes charge  the night was clear and bitterly cold when hawtrey and sally creighton drove away from stukelys barn  winter had lingered unusually long that year and the prairie gleamed dimly white with the sledge trail cutting athwart it a smear of bluegrey in the foreground  it wasfor landers lay behind them with the snow among the stubble belts that engirdled itan empty wilderness the mettlesome team swung across and during the first few minutes the cold struck through them with a sting like the thrust of steel  a halfmoon hung low above it coppery red with frost and there was no sound but the crunch beneath the runners and the beat of hoofs that rang dully through the silence like a roll of muffled drums  sleighs like the one that hawtrey drove are not common on the prairie where the farmer generally uses the humble bobsled when the snow lies unusually long  the one in question had however been made for use in montreal and bought back east by a friend of hawtreys who was as it happened possessed of some means which is a somewhat unusual thing in the case of a western wheatgrower  he had also bought the teamthe fastest he could obtainand when the warmth came back to them hawtrey and the girl became conscious of the exhilaration of the swift and easy motion  the sleigh was light and narrow and hawtrey who drew the thick driving robe higher about his companion did not immediately draw the mittened hand he had used back again  the girl did not resent the fact that it still rested behind her shoulder nor did hawtrey attach any particular significance to the matter  he was a man who usually acted on impulse with singularly easy manners  how far sally understood him did not appear but she came of folk who had waged a very stubborn battle with the wilderness and there was a vein of somewhat grim tenacity in her  she was however conscious that there was something beneath her feet which forced her if she was to sit comfortably rather close against her companion and it seemed expedient to point it out  cant you move a little  i cant get my feet fixed right she said  hawtrey looked down at her with a smile  im afraid i cant unless i get right outside  arent you happy there  it was the kind of speech he was in the habit of making but there was rather more colour in the girls face than the stinging night air brought there and she glanced at the bottom of the sleigh  its a sack of some kind isnt it she said  yes said hawtrey its a couple of threebushel bags  some special seed wheat lorton sent to winnipeg for  ormond brought them out from the railroad  i promised id take them along to him  you should have told me  its most a league round by lortons place said sally  that wont take long with this team  have you any great objections to another fifteen minutes drive with me  sally looked up at him and the moonlight was on her face which was a very comely one  no she admitted i havent any  she said it demurely but there was a just perceptible something in her voice which might have warned the man had he been addicted to taking warning from anything which was however not the case  it was in fact his trouble that he seldom thought about what he did until he was compelled to face the consequences and it was perhaps to his credit that he had after all done very little harm for there was hot blood in him  well he said im not going to grumble about those extra three miles but you were asking what land i meant to break this spring what put that into your mind  our folks said sally candidly  they were talking about you  this again was significant but hawtrey did not notice it  ive no doubt they said i ought to tackle the new quarter section he suggested  yes assented sally  why dont you do it  last fall you thrashed out quite a big harvest  i certainly did  there however didnt seem to be many dollars left over when id faced the bills  the girl made a little gesture of impatience  oh she said bob and jake and jasper sowed on less backsetting and theyre buying new teams and ploughs  cant you do what they do though i guess they dont go off for weeks to winnipeg  the man was silent  he had an incentive to work hard which she was not acquainted with and he had certainly done so but the long iron winter when there was nothing that could be done had proved too much for him  it was very dreary sitting alone evening after evening beside the stove and the company of the somnolent sproatly was not much more cheerful  now and then his pleasureloving nature had revolted from the barrenness of his lot when he drove home from an odd visit to a neighbour stiff with cold through the stinging frost and arriving in the dark found the stove had burned out and water frozen hard inside the house  these were things his neighbours patiently endured but hawtrey had fled for life and brightness to winnipeg  sally glanced up at him with a little nod  you take hold with a good grip  everybody allows that she said  the trouble is you let things go afterwards  you dont stay with it  yes assented hawtrey  i believe you have hit it sally  thats very much whats the matter with me  then said the girl with quiet insistence wont you try  a faint flush crept into hawtreys face  the girl was less than halftaught and unacquainted with anything beyond the simple strenuous life of the prairie  her greatest accomplishments consisted of some skill in bakery and the handling of halfbroken teams but she had once or twice given him what he recognised as excellent advice there was something incongruous in the situation but as usual he preferred to regard it whimsically  i suppose ill have to if you insist  if ever im the grasping owner of the biggest farm in this district ill blame you he said  sally said nothing further on that subject and some time later the sleigh went skimming down among the birches in a shallow ravine hawtrey pulled the horses up when they reached the bottom of it and glanced up at a shapeless cluster of buildings that showed black amidst the trees  lorton wont be back until tomorrow but i promised to pitch the bags into his granary he said  if i hump them up the trail here it will save us driving round through the bluff  he got down and though the bags were heavy he managed to hoist the first of them on to his shoulders with sallys assistance and then staggered up the steep foottrail that climbed the slope with it  he was more or less accustomed to carrying bags of grain between store and waggon but his mittened hands were numbed and his joints were stiff with frost just then and sally noticed that he floundered rather wildly  in another moment or two however he vanished into the gloom among the trees and she sat listening to the uneven crunch of his footsteps in the snow until there was a sudden crash of broken branches and a sound as of something falling heavily down a declivity then there was another crash and stillness again  sally gasped and clenched her mittened hands hard upon the reins as she remembered that lortons bye trail skirted the edge of a very steep bank but she lost neither her collectedness nor her nerve  presence of mind in the face of an emergency is probably as much a question of experience as of temperament and as it happened she had like other women in that country seen men struck down by halftrained horses crushed by collapsing strawpiles and once or twice gashed by a mower blade  this was no doubt why she remembered that the impatient team would probably move on if she left the sleigh and she drove them to the first of the birches before she got down  then she knotted the reins about a branch and called out sharply  no answer came out of the shadows and her heart beat unpleasantly fast as she plunged in among the trees keeping below the narrow trail that went slanting up the side of the declivity until she stopped with another gasp when she reached a spot where a ray of moonlight came filtering down  a limp figure in an old skin coat lay almost at her feet and she dropped on her knees beside it in the snow  hawtreys face showed an unpleasant greyishwhite in the faint silvery light  gregory she cried hoarsely  the man opened his eyes and blinked at her in a halfdazed manner fell down he said  think i felt my leg goand my sides stabbing me  go for somebody  sally glanced round and noticed that the grain bag lay burst open not far away  she fancied that he had clung to it after he lost his footing which explained why he had fallen so heavily but that was not a point of any consequence now  there was nobody who could help her within two leagues of the spot and it was evident that she could not leave him there to freeze  then she noticed that the trees grew rather farther apart just there and rising swiftly she ran back to bring the team  the ascent was steep and she had to urge them up it with sharp cries and blows with her mittened hand amidst the shadowy trunks and through snapping undergrowth before she reached the spot where hawtrey lay  he looked up at her when at last they stood snorting close beside him  you cant turn them here he said  sally was never sure how she managed it for the sleigh drove against the slender trunks and the fiery beasts terrified by the snapping of the undergrowth were almost unmanageable but at last they were facing the descent again and she stooped and twined her arms about the shoulders of her companion who now lay almost against the sleigh  its going to hurt gregory but i have got to get you in she said  then she gasped for hawtrey was a man of full stature and it was a heavy lift  she could not raise him wholly and he cried out once when his injured leg trailed in the snow  still with the most strenuous effort she had ever made she moved him a yard or so and then staggering fell with her side against the sleigh  she felt faint with the pain of it but with another desperate lift she drew him into the sleigh and let him sink down gently upon the bag that still lay there his eyes had shut again and he said nothing now  illustration she could not raise him wholly and he cried out once when his injured leg trailed in the snow  it took only another moment or two to wrap the thick driving robe about him and after that she glanced down with one hand still beneath his neck  it was clear that he was quite unconscious of her presence and stooping swiftly she kissed his grey face  then she settled herself in the driving seat with only a blanket coat to shelter her from the stinging frost and the horses went cautiously down the slope  she did not urge them until they reached the level for the trail that wound up out of the ravine was difficult but when the wide white expanse once more stretched away before them she laid the biting whip across their backs  that was quite sufficient  they were fiery beasts and when they broke into a furious gallop the rush of night wind that screamed by struck her tingling cheeks like a lash of wires  then all power of feeling went out of her hands her arms grew stiff and heavy and she was glad that the trail led smooth and straight to the horizon  hawtrey who had moved a little lay a shapeless figure across her feet but he answered nothing when she spoke to him  the team went far at the gallop and the beat of hoofs rose up dulled a little in a wild staccato drumming  there was an insistent crunching beneath the runners and a fine mist of snow beat against the sleigh but the girl leaning forward a tense figure with nerveless hands clenched upon the reins saw nothing but the bluegrey riband of trail that steadily unrolled itself before her  at length however a blurred mass which she knew to be a birch bluff grew out of the white waste and presently a cluster of darker smudges shot up into the shape of a loghouse sod stables and strawpile granary  a minute or two later she pulled the team up with an effort and a man who flung the door of the house open came out into the moonlight  he stopped and apparently gazed at her in astonishment  miss creighton he said  dont stand there said sally  take the near horses head and lead them right up to the door  whats the matter the man asked stupidly  lead the team up said sally  jump if you can  it was supposed on that part of the prairie that sproatly had never moved with much expedition in his life but that night he sprang towards the horses at a commanding wave of the girls hand  he started when he saw his comrade lying in the bottom of the sleigh but sally disregarded his hurried questions  help me to get him out she said when he stopped the team  keep his right leg as straight as you can  i dont want to lift him  we must slide him in  they did it somehow though the girl was breathless before their task which the snow made a little easier was finished and the perspiration started from the man  then sally turned to the latter  get into the sleigh and dont spare the team she said  drive over to watsons and bring him along  you can tell him your partners broke his leg and some of his ribs  start right now  sproatly did her bidding and when the door closed behind him she flung off her blanket coat and thrust fresh billets into the stove  then she looked for some coffee in the store cupboard and set on a kettle after which she sat down on the floor by hawtreys side  he lay still with the thick driving robe beneath him and though the colour was creeping back into his face his eyes were shut and he was apparently quite insensible of her presence  for the first time she was conscious of a distressful faintness which as she had come suddenly out of the stinging frost into the little overheated room which reeked with tobacco smoke and a stale smell of cooking was not astonishing  she mastered it however and presently seeing that hawtrey did not move glanced about her with some curiosity for this was the first time she had entered his house  the room was scantily furnished and though very few of the bachelor farmers in that country live luxuriously she fancied that sproatly who had evidently very rudimentary ideas on the subject of housecleaning had not brought back all the sundries he had thrown out into the snow  it then contained a table a carpenters bench and a couple of chairs and there were still smears of dust upon the uncovered floor  the birchlog walls had been rudely panelled with matchboarding halfway up which was a somewhat unusual luxury but the halfseasoned boards had rent with the heat and exuded streaks of resin to which the grime and dust had clung  a pail which apparently contained potato peelings stood amidst a litter of old long boots and broken harness against one wall and the floor was black and thick with grease all round the rusty stove  a pile of unwashed dishes and cooking utensils stood upon the table and the lamp above her head had blackened the boarded ceiling and diffused a subtle odour of kerosene  sally noticed it all with disgust and then seeing that hawtrey had opened his eyes she made a cup of coffee and got him to drink it after that he smiled at her  thanks he said feebly  wheres sproatly  my side stabs me  sally raised one hand  youre not to say a word  sproatlys gone for watson and hell soon fix you up  now lie quite still and shut your eyes again  the man obeyed her in so far as that he lay still but his eyes were not more than halfclosed and she could not resist the temptation to see what he would do if she went away  she had half risen when he stretched a hand out and felt for her dress and she sank down again with a curious softness in her face  then he let his eyes close altogether as if satisfied and by and bye she gently laid her hand on his  he did not appear to notice it and though she did not know whether he was asleep or unconscious she sat beside him with compassion in her eyes  there was no sound but the snapping of the birch billets in the rusty stove  she was anxious but not unduly so for she knew that men who live as the prairie farmers do usually recover from such injuries as had befallen him more or less readily  it would also not be very long before assistance arrived for it was understood that the man she had sent sproatly for had almost gone through a medical course in an eastern city before he set up as a prairie farmer  why he had suddenly changed his profession was a point he did not explain and as he had always shown himself willing to do what he could when any of his neighbours met with an accident nobody troubled him about the matter  by and bye sproatly brought him to the homestead and he was busy with hawtrey for some time  then they got him to bed and watson came back to the room where sally was anxiously waiting  his idea about his injuries is more or less correct but well have no great trouble in pulling him round he said  the one point thats worrying me is the looking after him  one couldnt expect him to thrive upon slabs of burnt salt pork and sproatlys bread  ill do what i can said sproatly indignantly  you said the other  it would be criminal to leave you in charge of a sick man  sally quietly put on her blanket coat  if you can stay that long ill be back soon after its light she said  then she turned to sproatly  you can wash up those dishes on the table and get a brush and sweep this room out  if its not quite smart tomorrow youll do it again  illustration then she turned to sproatly  you can wash up those dishes on the table  then while sproatly grinned she went out and drove away through the bitter frost     chapter iii  wyllard assents  sally who brought her mother with her spent a couple of weeks at hawtreys homestead before watson decided that his patient could be entrusted to sproatlys care but she came back afterwards twice a week or so with odd baskets of dainties to make sure that the latter in whom she had no confidence was discharging his duties satisfactorily she had driven over again one afternoon when hawtrey whose bones were knitting well lay talking to another man in his little sleeping room  there was no furniture in it whatever beyond the wooden bunk he lay in and a deerhide lounge chair he had made during the winter but the stovepipe from the kitchen led across part of it and then up again into the room beneath the roof above  it had been one of sproatlys duties during the past two weeks to rise and renew the fire when the cold awakened his comrade soon after midnight  at present he was outside the house whipsawing birchlogs and splitting them into billets which was an occupation he cherished a profound dislike for  spring had however come suddenly as it usually does on the prairie a few days earlier and the snow was melting fast under a brilliant sun  the bright rays that streamed in through the window struck athwart the glimmering dust motes in the little bare room and fell pleasantly warm upon the man who lay in the deerhide chair  he was a year or two older than hawtrey though he had scarcely reached thirty a man of tranquil manner with a rather lean and deeply bronzed face of average height and somewhat spare of figure  he held a pipe in his hand and was then looking at hawtrey with quiet contemplative eyes they were indeed his most noticeable feature though it was difficult to say whether their colour was grey or hazelbrown for they were singularly clear and there was something which suggested steadfastness in their unwavering gaze  he wore long boots trousers of old blue duck and a jacket of soft deerskin such as the blackfeet dress and there was nothing about him to suggest that he was a man of varied experience and of some importance in that country  harry wyllard was nativeborn and had in his young days assisted his father in the working of a little manitoban farm when that great grain province was still for the most part a wilderness  then a more prosperous relative on the pacific slope had sent him to toronto university where after a session or two he had become involved in a difference of opinion with the authorities  though the matter was never made quite clear it was generally believed that wyllard had quietly borne the blame of a comrades action for there was a vein of eccentric generosity in the lad  in any case he left toronto and the relative who was largely interested in the fur business next sent him north to the behring sea in one of his schooners  the business was then a remarkably hazardous one for the skin buyers and pelagic sealers had trouble all round with the alaskan representatives of american trading companies whose preserves they poached upon as well as with the commanders of the gunboats sent up there to protect the seals  mens lives were staked against the value of a fur edicts were lightly contravened and now and then a schooner barely escaped into the smothering fog with skins looted close aboard forbidden beaches  it was a perilous life and a strenuous one for they had every white mans hand against them as well as fog and gale and the reefs that lay in the tideways of almost uncharted waters but wyllard made the most of it  he kept the peace with jealous skippers who resented the presence of a man they might command as mate but whose views they were forced to listen to when he spoke as supercargo won the goodwill of seabred indians and drove a good trade with them and not infrequently brought his boat back first to the plunging schooner loaded with reeking skins  then he fell into trouble again when they were hanging off the eastern isles under double reefs watching for the russians seals  a boats crew from another schooner had been cast ashore and as they were in peril of falling into the russians hands wyllard led a reckless boat expedition to bring them off again  he succeeded in so far that the wrecked men were taken off the roaring beach through a tumult of breaking surf but as they pulled seaward the fog shut down on them and one boat manned by three men never reached the schooners  they blew horns all night standing off and on and crept along the smoking beach next day though the surf made landing impossible  then a sudden gale drove them off the shore and as it was evident that their comrades must have perished they reluctantly sailed for other fishing grounds  as one result of this wyllard broke with his prosperous relative when he came back to vancouver  after that he helped to strengthen railroad bridges among the mountains of british columbia worked in logging camps and shovelled in the mines and as it happened met hawtrey who tempted by high wages had spent a winter in the mountain province after a disastrous harvest in the meanwhile his father had sold out and taken up virgin soil in assiniboia  he died soon after wyllard went back to him and a few months later the relative in vancouver also died  somewhat to wyllards astonishment he bequeathed him a considerable property which the latter realised and sunk most of the proceeds in further acres of virgin prairie  willow range was already one of the largest farms between winnipeg and the rockies  the legs getting along satisfactorily he said at length  hawtrey who appeared unusually thoughtful admitted that it was  any way its singularly unfortunate that im broken up just now he added  theres the ploughing to commence in a week or two and besides that i was thinking of getting married  wyllard was somewhat astonished at this announcement  for one thing he was more or less acquainted with the state of his friends finances during the next moment or two he glanced meditatively through the open door into the adjoining room where sally creighton was busy beside the stove  the sleeves of her light bodice were rolled up well above the elbow and she had pretty round arms which were just then partly immersed in dough  i dont think theres a nicer or more capable girl in this part of assiniboia he said  oh yes said hawtrey  anybody would admit that  still since you seem so sure of it why dont you marry her yourself  wyllard looked at his comrade rather curiously  well he said there are one or two reasons that dont affect miss sally and only concern myself  besides its highly improbable that shed have me  he paused to light his pipe which had gone out before he looked up again  since it evidently isnt sally have i met the lady  you havent  shes in england  its four years isnt it since you were over there  hawtrey lay silent a minute and then made a little confidential gesture  id better tell you all about the thing he said  our folks were people of some little standing in the county  in fact as they were far from rich they had just standing enough to embarrass them  in most respects they were ultraconventional with oldfashioned ideas and though there was no open break im afraid i didnt get on with them quite as well as i should have done which is why i came out to canada  they started me on the land decently and twice when wed harvest frost and horsesickness they sent the draft i asked them for along  that is one reason why im not going to worry them though id very much like another now  you see there are two girls as well as reggie whos reading for the bar  i dont think you have mentioned the lady yet  shes a connection of some friends of ours  her mother so far as i understand it married beneath hera man her folks didnt like  he died and when by and bye his wife died agatha who was brought up by his relations was often at the grange  its a little oldfashioned halfruinous place a mile or two from where we live in the north of england  it belongs to her mothers folks but i think there was still a feud between them and her fathers people who brought her up to earn her living  we saw a good deal of each other and fell in love as boy and girl  well when i went back one winter after id been here two years agatha was at the grange again and we decided then that i was to bring her out as soon as i had a home she could live in to offer her  he broke off for a moment and there was a trace of embarrassment in his manner when he went on again  perhaps i ought to have managed it sooner he added  still things never seem to go quite as one would like with me and you can understand that a dainty delicate girl brought up in comfort in england would find it rough out here  wyllard glanced round the bare room in which he sat and into the other which was also furnished in a remarkably primitive manner  yes he assented i can quite realise that  well said his companion its a thing that has been worrying me a good deal of late because as a matter of fact im not much farther forward than i was four years ago  in the meanwhile agatha who has some talent for music was in a firstclass masters hands  afterwards she gave lessons and got odd singing engagements  a week ago i had a letter from her in which she said that her throat was giving out  he stopped again for a moment with trouble in his face and then fumbling under his pillow produced a letter which he carefully folded  were rather good friends he said  you can read that part of it  wyllard took the letter and a suggestion of quickening interest crept into his eyes as he read  then he looked up at hawtrey  its a brave letterthe kind a brave girl would write he said still its evident that shes anxious  there was silence for a moment or two which was only broken by sally clattering about the stove  dissimilar in character as they were the two were firm friends and there had been a day when as they worked upon a dizzy railroad trestle hawtrey had held his comrade fast when a plank slipped away  he had it was characteristic thought nothing of the matter but wyllard was one who remembered things of that kind  now said hawtrey you see my trouble  this place isnt fit for her and i couldnt even go across for some time yet but her fathers folks have died off and theres nothing to be expected from her mothers relatives  any way she cant be left to face the blow alone its unthinkable  well theres only one course open to me and thats to raise as many dollars on a mortgage as i can fit the place out with fixings brought from winnipeg and sow a double acreage with borrowed capital  ill send for her as soon as i can get the house made a little more comfortable  wyllard sat silent a moment or two and then leaned forward in his chair  no he said there are two other and wiser courses  tell the girl what things are like here and just how you stand  shed face it bravely  theres no doubt of that  hawtrey looked at him sharply  i believe she would but considering that you have never seen her i dont quite know why you should be sure of it  wyllard smiled  the girl who wrote that letter wouldnt flinch  well said hawtrey you can mention the second course  ill let you have 1000 at bank interestwhich is less than any landbroker would charge youwithout a mortgage  again hawtrey showed a certain embarrassment  no he said im afraid it cant be done  id a kind of claim upon my people though it must be admitted that ive worked it off but i cant quite bring myself to borrow money from my friends  wyllard who saw that he meant it made a gesture of resignation then you must let the girl make the most of it but keep out of the hands of the mortgage man  by the way i havent told you that ive decided to make a trip to the old country  wed a bonanza crop last season and martial could run the range for a month or two  after all my father was born yonder and i cant help feeling now and then that i should have made an effort to trace up that young englishmans relatives and tell them what became of him  the one you struck in british columbia  you have mentioned him but so far as i remember you never gave me any particulars about the thing  wyllard seemed to hesitate which was not a habit of his  there is he said not much to tell  i struck the lad sitting down played out upon a trail that led over a big divide  it was clear that he couldnt get any further and there wasnt a settlement within a good many leagues of the spot  we were up in the ranges prospecting then  well we made camp and gave him supperhe couldnt eat very muchand he told me what brought him there afterwards  it seemed to me hed always been weedy in the chest but hed been working waistdeep in an icy creek building a dam at a mine until his lungs had given out  the mining boss was a hard case and had no mercy on him but the lad who seemed to have had a rough time in the mountain province stayed with it until he played out altogether  wyllards face hardened a little as he mentioned the mining boss and a rather curious little sparkle crept into his eyes but after a pause he proceeded quietly  we did what we could for him  in fact it rather broke up the prospecting trip but he was too far through he added  he hung on for a week or two and one of us brought a doctor out from the settlements but the day before we broke camp jake and i buried him  hawtrey made a sign of comprehension  he was reasonably well acquainted with his comrades character and fancied he knew who had brought the doctor out  he also knew that wyllard had been earning his living as a railroad navvy or chopper then and in view of the cost of provisions brought by packhorse into the remoter bush the reason why he had abandoned his prospecting trip after spending a week or two taking care of the sick lad was clear enough  you never learned his name he asked  i didnt said wyllard  i went back to the mine but several things suggested that the name upon their payroll wasnt his real one  he commenced a broken message the night he died but the hemorrhage cut him off in the middle of it  the wish that i should tell his people somehow was in his eyes  he broke off for a moment with a deprecatory gesture which in connection with the story was very expressive  i have never done it but how could i  all i know is that he was a delicately brought up young englishman and the only clue i have is a watch with a london makers name on it and a girls photograph  ive a very curious notion that i shall meet that girl some day  hawtrey who made no comment lay still for a minute or two after this but his face suggested that he was considering something  harry he said presently i shall not be fit for a journey for quite a while yet and if i went over to england i couldnt get the ploughing done and the crop in which if im going to be married is absolutely necessary  there was no doubt about the latter point for the small western farmer has very seldom a balance in hand and for that matter is not infrequently in debt to the nearest storekeeper  he must as a rule secure a harvest or abandon his holding since as soon as the crop is thrashed the bills pour in  wyllard made a sign of assent  well said hawtrey if youre going to england you could go as my deputy  you could make agatha understand what things are like here and bring her out to me  ill arrange for the wedding to be soon as she arrives  his comrade was not a conventional person but he pointed out several objections  hawtrey overruled them however and eventually wyllard reluctantly assented  as it happens mrs hastings is going over too and if she comes back about the same time the thing might be managed he said  i believe shes in winnipeg just now but ill write her  by the way have you a photograph of agatha  i havent said hawtrey  she gave me one but somehow it got mislaid one housecleaning  thats rather an admission isnt it  it certainly occurred to wyllard that it was  in fact it struck him as a very curious thing that hawtrey should have lost the picture which the girl he was in love with had given him  he sat silent for a moment or two and then stood up  when i hear from mrs hastings ill drive round again  candidly the thing has somewhat astonished me  i always had a fancy it would be sally  hawtrey laughed  sally he said  were firstrate friends but i never had the faintest notion of marrying her  wyllard went out to harness his team and as it happened did not notice that sally who had approached the door with a tray in her hands a moment or two earlier drew back before him softly  when he had crossed the room she set down the tray and leaned upon the table with her cheeks burning  then feeling that she could not stay in the stoveheated room she went out and stood in the slushy snow  one of her hands was tightly closed and all the colour had vanished from her cheeks now  she however contrived to give hawtrey his supper by and bye and soon afterwards drove away     chapter iv  a crisis  while wyllard made arrangements for his journey and sally creighton went very quietly about her work on the lonely prairie farm it happened one evening that miss winifred rawlinson sat uneasily expectant far back under the gallery of a concert hall in an english manufacturing town  she could not hear very well there but it was the cheapest place she could obtain and economy was of some importance to her  besides by craning her neck a little to avoid the hat of the rather strikingly dressed young woman in front of her she could at least see the stage  the programme which she held in one hand announced that miss agatha ismay would sing a certain aria from a great composers oratorio and she leaned further forward in her chair when a girl of about her own age which was twentyfour slowly advanced to the centre of the stage  she was a tall wellmade brownhaired girl with a quiet grace of movement and a comely face attired in a long trailing dress of a shimmering cornstraw tint but when she stood looking at the audience miss rawlinson noticed a hint of tension in her expression  agatha ismay had sung at unimportant concerts with marked success but that evening there was something very like shrinking in her eyes  then a crash of chords from the piano melted into a rippling prelude and winifred breathed easier when her friend began to sing  her voice was sweet and excellently trained and there was a deep stillness of appreciation when the clear notes thrilled through the closepacked hall  no one could doubt that the first part of the aria was a success for halfsubdued applause broke out when the voice sank into silence and for a few moments the piano rippled on alone but it seemed to winifred that the look of tension was still in the singers face and once more she grew uneasy for she understood the cause for it  the last bit of the second parts rather trying said a young man behind her  theres an awkward jump of two full tones that was too much for our soprano when we tried it at the choral union  miss ismays very true in intonation but i dont suppose most of the rest would notice it if she shirked a little and left that high sharp out  winifred had little knowledge of music but she was sufficiently acquainted with her friends character to be certain that agatha would not attempt to leave the sharp in question out  this was one reason why she sat rigidly still when the clear voice rang out again  it rose from note to note full and even but she could see the singers face and there was no doubt whatever that she was making a strenuous effort nobody else however seemed to notice it for winifred flung a swift glance round and then fixed her eyes upon the dominant figure in the cornstraw dress that the glare of light fell shimmering on  the sweet voice was still rising and she longed that the accompanist would force the tone to cover it a little and put the loud pedal on  he however was gazing at his music and played on quietly until with startling suddenness the climax came  the voice sank a full tone jarring horribly on the theme rose and hoarsely trailed off into silence again  then the accompanist glanced over his shoulder and struck a ringing chord while he waited for a sign and there was a curious stirring among the audience  the girl in the shimmering dress stood quite still for a moment with a spot of crimson in her cheek and a halfdazed look in her eyes and then turning swiftly moved off the stage  then winifred rose with a gasp and turned upon the young man next her who looked up inquiringly  yes she said sharply cant you let me pass  im going out  it was about halfpast nine when she reached the wet and miry street a fine rain drove into her face and she had rather more than a mile to walk without an escort but that was a matter which caused her no concern  she was a selfreliant young woman and accustomed to going about unattended while she was also quite aware that the scene she had just witnessed would bring about a crisis in her and her friends affairs  for all that she was unpleasantly conscious of the leak in one rather shabby boot when she stepped down from the sidewalk to cross the street and when she opened her umbrella beneath a gas lamp she pursed up her mouth  there were a couple of holes in it near where the ribs ran into the ferrule which she had not noticed before  she however plodded on resolutely through the drizzle until three striplings who came with linked arms down the pavement of a quieter street barred her way  one wore his hat on one side the one nearest the kerb flourished a little cane and the third of them smiled at her fatuously  oh my he said  wheres dear jemima off in such a hurry  winifred drew herself up  she was little and determined and it must be admitted not quite unaccustomed to that kind of thing  will you let me pass she said  theres a policeman at the next turning  there really is said one of them  the dook has another engagement dream of me olivia  a beat of heavy feet drew nearer and the three roysterers disappeared in the direction of a flaming musichall where the second house was probably commencing while winifred who had stepped into the gutter to avoid the one with the cane turned as a stalwart bluecoated figure moved towards her  thank you officer she said theyve gone  the man merely raised a hand as if in comprehension and plodded back to his post  perhaps he felt sorry for young women who have to earn their living for he had at least appeared promptly when he was needed and perhaps he attached no great importance to the matter there is a good deal that the policeman knows and accepts with undisturbed equanimity which if plainly expressed would no doubt form a somewhat grim commentary on our complex civilisation  in the meanwhile winifred went on until she let herself into a house in a quiet street and ascending to the second floor entered a simply furnished room  it however contained a piano and a little table on which a typewriter stood amidst a litter of papers occupied the opposite side of it  the girl sloughed off her waterproof and rather flung than hung it on a peg behind the door after which she sat down in a low chair beside the little fire  she was not a handsome girl and it was evident that she did not trouble herself greatly about her attire  her face was too thin her figure too slight and spare but there was usually even when she was anxious as she certainly was that night a shrewdly whimsical twinkle in her eyes and though her lips were set her expression was compassionate  she was however not the person to sit still very long and in a minute or two she rose and placed a little kettle on the fire after which she took a few scones a coffeepot and a tin of condensed milk from a cupboard  when she had spread them out upon a table she discovered that there was some of the condensed milk upon her fingers and it must be admitted that she sucked them  they were little stubby fingers which somehow looked capable  it must have been four oclock when i had that bun and a cup of tea she said  she glanced at the table longingly for she occasionally found it necessary to place a certain check upon a healthy appetite  she was however not singular in this respect since the practice of such selfdenial is unfortunately not a very unusual thing in the case of a good many young women in our cities who work remarkably hard  then she resolutely shook her head  i must wait for agatha she said and crossing the room towards the typewriter table stopped to glance at a little framed photograph that stood upon the mantel  it was a portrait of gregory hawtrey taken some years ago and she apostrophied it with quiet scorn  now youre wanted youre naturally away out yonder she said youre like the rest of themdespicable  this seemed to relieve her feelings and she sat down before the machine which clicked and rattled for several minutes under her stubby fingers  then the clicking ceased with sudden abruptness and she prodded the mechanism viciously with a hairpin  as this appeared unavailing she used her forefinger and when at length the carriage slid along the rod with a clash there was a smear of grimy oil upon her cheek and her somewhat tilted nose  the machine however gave no further trouble and she endeavoured to make up some at least of the time she had spent at the concert  it was necessary that it should be made up but she was also conscious that she was putting off an evil moment  at length the door opened and agatha ismay wrapped in a long cloak came in  she permitted winifred to take it from her and then sank down into a chair  there was a strained look in her eyes and her face was very weary  illustration at length the door opened and agatha ismay wrapped in a long cloak came in  youre working late again she said  winifred nodded  its the men who loaf my dear she said  when you undertake the transcription of an authors scrawl at ninepence the thousand words you have to work unusually hard especially when as it is in this case the things practically unreadable  besides the woman in it makes me lose my temper  if id had a man of the kind described to deal with id have thrashed him  she was throwing words about partly to conceal her anxiety and partly with the charitable purpose of giving her companion time to approach the subject that must be mentioned as she thought best but she rather overdid it and agatha looked at her sharply  winny she said you know  youve been there  winifred turned towards her quietly for she could face a crisis  yes she said i have but youre not going to talk about it until you have had supper  dont move until i make the coffee  she was genuinely hungry but while she satisfied her own appetite she took care that her companion who did not seem inclined to eat made a simple meal  then she bundled the plates into a cupboard and sat down facing her  well she said you have broken down exactly as that throat specialist said you would  the first question is how long it will be before you can go on again  agatha laughed a little harsh laugh  i didnt tell you everything at the time ive broken down for good  there was a moment or twos tense silence after that and then agatha made a dejected gesture  he warned me that this might happen if i went on singing but what could i do  i couldnt cancel my engagements without telling people why  he said i must go to norway and give my throat and chest a rest  they looked at one another and there was in their eyes the halfbitter halfweary smile of those to whom the cure prescribed is ludicrously impossible  it was winifred who spoke first  then she said we have to face the situation and its not an encouraging one  our joint earnings just keep us here in decencywe wont say comfortand theyre evidently to be subject to a big reduction  it strikes me as a rather curious coincidence that a letter from that man in canada and one from your prosperous friends in the country arrived just before you went out  she saw the look in agathas eyes and spread her hands out  yes she admitted i hid them  it seemed to me that you had quite enough upon your mind this evening  i dont know if theyre likely to throw any fresh light upon the question what were going to do  she produced the letters from a drawer in her table and agatha straightened herself suddenly in her chair when she had opened the first of them  oh she cried he wants me to go out to him  winifreds face set hard for a moment but it relaxed again and she contrived to hide her dismay  then she suggested with a trace of dryness i suppose youll certainly go  after all hes probably not worse to live with than most of them  miss rawlinson was occasionally a little bitter but she had like others of her kind been compelled to compete in an overcrowded market with harddriven men  she was however sincerely attached to her friend and she smiled when she saw the flash in agathas eyes  oh she added you neednt try to wither me with your indignation no doubt hes precisely what he ought to be and i dare say it will ease your feelings if you talk about him again at least it will help you to formulate your reasons for going out to him  ill listen patiently and try not to be uncharitable  agatha fell in with the suggestion  it was a relief to talk and she had also a certain respect which she would not always admit for her companions shrewdness  she meant to go but she desired to ascertain how a less interested person would regard the course she had decided on  i have known gregory since i was a girl she said  winifred pursed her lips up  i understood you met him at the grange and you were only there for a few weeks once a year  after all that isnt a very great deal  it seems he fell in love with you which is perhaps comprehensible  what i dont quite know the reason for is why you fell in love with him  ah said agatha you have never seen gregory  i havent said winifred sourly i have however seen his picture and one must admit that hes reasonably goodlooking  in fact ive seen quite an assortment of them but its perhaps significant that the last was taken some years ago  agatha smiled  can a photograph show the clean sanguine temperament of a man his impulsive generosity and cheerful optimism  miss rawlinson rose and critically surveyed the photograph on the mantel  i dont want to be discouraging but after studying that one im compelled to admit that it cant  no doubt its the artists fault but im willing to admit that a young girl would be rather apt to credit a man with a face like that with qualities he didnt possess  then she sat down again with a thoughtful expression  the fact is you set him up on a pedestal and burned incense to him when you were not old enough to know any better and when he came home for a few weeks four years ago you promised to marry him  now it seems hes ready at last and wants you to go out  perhaps it doesnt affect the question but if id promised to marry a man in canada hed certainly have to come for me  isnt there a certain risk in the thing  a risk  winifred nodded  yes she said rather a serious one  four years is a long time and the man may have changed  in a new country where everythings different it must be a thing theyre rather apt to do  a faint halfcompassionate halftolerant smile crept into agathas eyes  the mere idea that the sunnytempered brilliant young man whom she had given her heart to could have changed or degenerated in any way seemed absurd to her  winifred however went on again  theres another point she said  if hes still the same which isnt likely there has certainly been a change in you  you have learned to see things more clearly and acquired a different standard from the one you had then  one cant help growing and as one grows one looks for more  one is no longer pleased with the same things its inevitable  she broke off for a moment and her voice grew gentler  well she added ive done my duty in trying to point this out to you and now theres only another thing to say since youre clearly bent on going im going out with you  agatha looked astonished but there was a suggestion of relief in her expression for the two had been firm friends and had faced a good deal together  oh she said that gets over the one difficulty  winifred made a little whimsical gesture  im not quite sure that it does  the difficulty will probably begin when i arrive in canada but im a rather capable person and i believe they dont pay one ninepence a thousand words in winnipeg  besides i could keep the books at a store or hotel and at the very worst gregory could perhaps find a husband for me  women one understands are after all held in some estimation in that country  perhaps theres a man out there who would treat even a little plain vixenishtempered person with a turnedup nose decently  crossing the room again she banged the cover down on the typewriter and then turned to agatha with a wide gesture and a suggestion of haziness in her eyes  anyway im very tired of this one  it would all be intolerable when you went away  agatha stretched out a hand and drew her down beside her  she at least no longer feared adverse fortune and loneliness and she was filled with a gentle compassion for she knew how hard a fight this girl had made and part at least of what she had borne  my dear she said we will go together  then she opened the second letter which she had forgotten in the meanwhile  they want me to stay at the grange for a few weeks she said and smiled  an hour ago i felt crushed and beatenand now though my voice has probably gone for good i dont seem to mind  isnt it almost bewilderingly curious that both these letters should have come to sweep my troubles away tonight  no said her companion its distinctly naturaljust what one would have expected  you wrote the man in canada soon after youd seen the specialist and his answer was bound to arrive in the next few days  but i certainly didnt write the folks at the grange  winifreds eyes twinkled  as it happens i did two days ago  i ventured to point out their duty to them and they were rather nice about it in another letter  agatha stretched herself out in the low chair with a little sigh of content  well she said it probably wouldnt have the least effect if i scolded you  i believe im horribly worn out winny and it will be a relief unspeakable to get away  if i can arrange to give up those pupils ill go tomorrow  winifred made no answer and kneeling with one elbow resting on the arm of her companions chair gazed straight in front of her  they were both of them very weary of the long grim struggle and now a change was close at hand     chapter v  the old country  it was a still clear evening of spring when wyllard unstrapping the ruchsack from his shoulders sat down beside a frothing stream in a dale of northern england  on arriving in london a week or two earlier he had found a letter from mrs hastings who was then in paris awaiting him in which she stated that she could not at the moment say when she would go home again but that she expected to advise him shortly  after answering it he started north and obtaining agathas address from miss rawlinson went on again to a certain little town which stands encircled by towering fells beside a lake in the north country  he had however already recognised that his mission was rather a delicate one and he decided that it would be advisable to wait until he heard from mrs hastings before calling upon miss ismay  there then remained the question what to do with the next few days  a conversation with some pedestrian tourists whom he met at his hotel and a glance at a map of the hilltracks decided him and remembering that he had on several occasions kept the trail in canada for close on forty miles on end he bought a swiss pattern ruchsack and set out on foot through the fells  incidentally he saw such scenery as gave him a new conception of the old country and nearly broke the hearts of his new friends the tourists who volunteered to show him the way over what they evidently considered to be a rather difficult pass  to their great astonishment the brownfaced stranger who wore ordinary tightfitting american attire and rather pointed american shoes went up it apparently without an effort and for the credit of the clubs they belonged to it seemed incumbent on them to keep pace with him  they naturally did not know that he had carried bags of flour and mining tools over very much higher passes close up to the limit of eternal snow but after two days climbing they were on the whole relieved to part company with him  a professional guide who overtook them however recognised the capabilities of the man when he noticed the way he lifted his feet and how he set them down  this he decided was one accustomed to walking among the heather but he was wrong for it was the trick the bushman learns when he plods through leagues of undergrowth and fallen branches or the tall grass of the swamps and it is a memorable experience to make a days journey with such a man  for the first hour the thing seems easy for the pace is never forced but it also never slackens down and as the hours go by the novice who flounders and stumbles grows horribly weary of trying to keep up with that steady persistent swing  wyllard had travelled since morning along a ridge of fells when he sat down beside the water and contentedly filled his pipe  on the one hand a wall of crags high above was growing black against the evening light and the stream came boiling down clear as crystal among great boulder stones but he had wandered through many a grander and more savage scene of rocky desolation and it impressed him less than the green valley in front of him  he had at least never seen anything like that either on the pacific slope or in western canada  early as it was in the season the meadows between rock and water were green as emerald and the hedgerows just flushed with verdure were clipped and trimmed as though their owner loved them  there was not a dead tree in the larch copse which dipped to the stream and all its feathery tassels were sprinkled with tiny flecks of crimson and wondrous green  great oaks dotted the meadows each one perfect in symmetry  it seemed that the men who held this land cared for single trees  the sleek tame cattle that rubbed their necks on the level hedgetop and gazed at him ruminatively were very different from the wild longhorned creatures whose furious stampede he had now and then headed off riding hard while the roar of hoofs rang through the dustcloud that floated like a sea fog across the sunscorched prairie here it seemed all went smoothly the whole vale was steeped in peace and tranquillity  then he noticed the pale primroses that pushed their yellow flowers up among the withered leaves and the faint blue sheen beneath the beech trunks not far away  there was a vein of artistic daintiness in this man and the elusive beauty of these things curiously appealed to him he had seen the riotous sensuous blaze of flowers kissed by pacific breezes and the burnished gold of wheat that rolled in milelong waves but it seemed to him that the wild things of the english north were after all more wonderful  they matched its deep peacefulness their beauty was chaste fairylike and ethereal  by and bye a wood pigeon cooed softly somewhere in the shadows and a brown thrush perched on a bare oak bough began to sing  the broken repeated melody went curiously well with the rippling murmur of sliding water and wyllard leaned back with a smile to listen though he could not remember ever having done anything of that kind before  his life had been a strenuous one spent for the most part in the drivingseat of great ploughs that rent their ample furrows through virgin prairie guiding the clinking binders through the wheat under a blazing sun or driving the plunging dories through the clammy fog over short slopping seas  now however the tranquillity of the english valley stole in on him and he began to understand how the love of that welltrimmed land clung to the men out west who spoke of it tenderly as the old country  then for he was in an unusually susceptible mood he took a little deerhide case artistically made by a blackfoot indian from his pocket and extracted from it the somewhat faded photograph of an english girl  he had got it from the lad he had buried among the ranges of the pacific slope and it had been his companion in many a desolate camp and on many a weary journey  the face was delicately modelled and there was a freshness in it which is perhaps seldom seen outside the old country but what pleased him more was the serenity in the clear innocent eyes  he was not in love with the picturehe would probably have smiled at the notionbut he had a curious feeling that he would meet the girl some day and that it would then be a privilege only to speak to her this was after all not so extravagant a fancy as it might appear for romance the mother of chivalry and many graces still finds shelter in the hearts of such men as him from the wide spaces of the newer lands shrewd as they are and practical they see visions now and then and what is more prove them to be realities with bleeding hands and toil incredible  by and bye he put the photograph back in his pocket and filled his pipe again while it was almost dark before he had smoked it out  the thrush had gone and only the ripple of the water broke the silence until he heard footsteps on the stones behind him  then looking round he saw a young woman moving towards the river and he watched her with a quiet interest for his perceptions were a little sharper than usual then and it seemed to him that she was very much in harmony with what he thought of as the keytone of the place  she was tall and shapely and she moved with a quiet grace  when she stopped a moment poised upon a shelf of rock as though considering the easiest way to the water her figure fell into reposeful lines but that was after all only what he had expected for he now remembered that he had halfconsciously studied the englishwomen he had met in the west  the western women usually moved and certainly spoke with an almost superfluous vivacity and alertness  there was in them a feverish activity which contrasted with the english deliberation  the latter had sometimes exasperated him but it was becoming comprehensible and taking on a more favourable aspect now  it was he felt born of the tranquillity of this welltrimmed land a steadfastness that progressed slowly by system and rule and he recognised that it would have troubled his sense of fitness if this girl had clattered down across the stones hurriedly and noisily  as yet he could not see her face but when she went on a little further it became evident that she desired to cross the river and was regarding the row of stepping stones that stretched across it somewhat dubiously  one or two had apparently fallen over or been washed away by a flood for there were several rather wide gaps between them through which the stream frothed whitely  as soon as wyllard noticed that he rose and moved towards her  you want to get across he said  she was still glancing at the water but although he did not think she had seen him or heard his approach she turned towards him quietly then a momentary sense of astonishment held him almost embarrassed for it was her picture he had gazed at scarcely half an hour ago and he would have recognised her anywhere  yes she said  it is rather a long way round by the bridge but some of the stones seem to have disappeared since i last came this way  she spoke as wyllard had expected softly and quietly but he was first of all a man of action and somewhat to her astonishment he forthwith waded into the river  then he turned and held out his hand to her  it isnt a very long step  you ought to manage it he said  the girl favoured him with a swift glance of scrutiny  at first she had supposed him to be one of the walking tourists or climbers who invaded those valleys at easter but they were for the most part young men from the cities and this strangers face was darkened by the sun  there was also an indefinite suggestion of strength in the pose of his lean symmetrical figure which though she did not recognise that fact could only have come from strenuous labour in the open air she however noticed that while the average englishman would have asked permission to help her or have deprecated the offer this stranger did nothing of the kind  he stood with the water frothing about his ankles holding out his hand  she had no hesitation about taking it and while he waded through the river she stepped lightly from stone to stone until she came to a rather wider gap where the stream was deeper  then she stopped a moment gazing at the sliding froth until the mans grasp tightened on her fingers and she felt his other hand rest upon her waist  now he said i wont let you fall  illustration now he said i wont let you fall  she was across the gap in another moment wondering somewhat uneasily why she had obeyed the compelling pressure but glad to see that his face was perfectly unmoved and that he was evidently quite unconscious of having done anything unusual  she crossed without mishap and when they stood on the shingle he dropped her hand  thank you she said  im afraid you got rather wet  the man laughed and he had a pleasant laugh  oh he said im used to it  isnt there a village with a hotel in it a mile or two from here  yes said the girl this is the way  the path goes up to the high road through the larch wood  she turned into it and though she had not expected this the man walked beside her  still she did not resent it  his manner was deferential and she liked his face while there was after all no reason why he should stay behind when he was going the same way  he accompanied her silently for several minutes as they went on through the gloom of the larches where a sweet resinous odour crept into the still evening air and then he looked up as they came to a towering pine  have you got many of those trees over here he asked  then a light dawned upon the girl for though he had spoken without perceptible accent she had been slightly puzzled by something in his speech and appearance  i believe theyre not uncommon  you are an american she said  wyllard laughed  no he said  i was born in western canada but i think im as english as you are in some respects though i never quite realised it until tonight  it isnt exactly because my father came from this country either  the girl was a trifle astonished at this answer and still more at the indefinite something in his manner which seemed to indicate that he expected her to understand as indeed she did  her only dowry had been an expensive education and she remembered that the influence of the isle she lived in had in turn fastened on saxons norsemen normans and made them englishmen  what was more so far as she had read those who had gone out south or westwards had carried that influence with them and under all their surface changes and sometimes their grievances against the motherland were in the great essentials wholly english still  but she said at random how can you be sure that im english  it was quite dark in among the trees but she fancied there was a smile in her companions eyes  oh he answered simply you couldnt be anything else  she accepted this as a compliment though she fancied that it had not been his direct intention to pay her one  his general attitude since she had met him scarcely suggested such a lack of sense  she was becoming mildly interested in this stranger but she possessed several essentially english characteristics and it did not appear advisable to encourage him too much  she said nothing further and it was he who spoke first  i wonder he said if you knew a young lad who went out to canada some few years ago  his name was pattinsonhenry pattinson  no said his companion i certainly did not  besides the name is not an uncommon one  there are a good many pattinsons in the north  wyllard was not astonished at this answer  he had reasons for believing that the name the lad he had befriended had enrolled himself under was not his correct one  it would of course have been easy to describe him but wyllard was shrewd and noticing that there was now a restraint in his companions manner he was not prepared to do that yet he was aware that most of the english are characterised by a certain reserve and apt to retire into their shells if pressed too hard  he did not however mean to let this girl elude him altogether  it really doesnt matter he said i shall no doubt get upon his trail in due time  they reached the high road a minute or two later and the girl turned to him  thank you again she said  if you go straight on you will come to the village in about a quarter of an hour  then she turned away and left him standing with his soft hat in his hand and as it happened he stood quite still for almost a minute after she had gone  in due time however he reached the inn he had inquired about and its oldworld simplicity delighted him  it was built feet thick of slate stone against the foot of the fell and roofed as he noticed with ponderous flags  in canada where the frost was arctic they used thin cedar shingles  the room his meal was brought him in was panelled with oak that had turned black with age great roughhewn beams of four times the size that anybody would have used for the purpose in the west supported the low ceiling andfor there was a fire on the wide hearththe ruddy gleam of burnished copper utensils pierced the shadows  the room was large and there was only a single candle upon the table but he felt that a garish light would somehow be out of harmony with the atmosphere of that interior  by and bye his hostess appeared to clear the things away and she was a little withered old woman immaculately neat with shrewd kindly eyes and a russet tinge in her cheeks  theres a good light and company in the sittingroom she said weve three young men staying with us  theyve been up the pike  id sooner stay here if i may said wyllard  i dont quite know yet if ill go on tomorrow  one can get through to langley dale by the hause as i think you call it  the wrinkled dame said that pedestrians often went that way and wyllard asked a question casually  there are some prosperous folkspeople of station living round here  theres the vicar  i dont know that hes what youd call prosperous then theres mr martindale of rushyholme and little of the ghyll  has any of them a daughter of about twentyfour years of age and wyllard described the girl he had met to the best of his ability  it was evident that the landlady did not recognise the description but she seemed to consider  no she said theres nobody like that but i did hear that theyd a young lady staying at the vicarage  then she changed the subject abruptly and wyllard once more decided that the english did not like questions  youre a stranger sir she said  i am said wyllard  ive some business to attend to further on but i came along on foot to see the fells and im glad i did  its a great and wonderful country youre living in  that is he added gravely when you get outside the towns  there are things in some of them that most make one ill  then he stood up  that trays too heavy for you  wont you let me carry it  the landlady seemed astonished but she made it clear that she desired no assistance and when she went out wyllard who sat down again took out the photograph  he gazed at it steadfastly and then put it back into his pocket  theres rather more than mere prettiness there but i dont know that i want to keep it now he said  its way behind the original  she has grown in the meanwhilejust as one would expect that girl to grow  then he lighted his pipe and smoked thoughtfully until he appeared to arrive at a decision  one cant force the running in this country  they dont like it he said  ill lie by a day or two and keep an eye on that vicarage  in the meanwhile his hostess was discussing him with a niece  im sure i dont know what that man is she informed the younger woman  he has got the manners of a gentleman but he walks like a fell shepherd and his hands are like a navvys  a mans hands now and then tell you a good deal about him  besides of all things he wanted to carry his tray away  said it was too heavy for me  oh said her niece hes an american  theres no accounting for them     chapter vi  her picture  wyllard stayed at the inn three days without seeing anything more of the girl he had met beside the stream though he diligently watched for her  for one thing he had long felt it was his duty to communicate with the relatives of the lad he had befriended and the fact that he had found her photograph in the young englishmans possession made it appear highly probable that she could assist him in tracing them apart from this he could not quite analyse his motives for desiring to see more of her though he was conscious of the desire  her picture had however been a companion to him in his wanderings and he had indeed now and then found a certain solace in gazing at it while now he had seen her in the flesh he was willing to admit that he had never met any woman who had made the same impression on him  what he meant by that he was not quite certain but it was in the meanwhile as far as he would go  it was of course open to him to call at the vicarage but though he meant to adopt that course as a last resort there were certain objections to it  he did not even know the girls name and there was nobody to say a word for him while so far as his experience went the english were rather apt to be reticent and reserved to an unknown stranger  it seemed to him that although she might give him the information he required their acquaintance would probably terminate then and there which was not what he desired  she would he decided be less likely to stand upon her guard if he could contrive to meet her casually without prearrangement  on the fourth day fortune favoured him for he came upon her endeavouring to open a tottering gate where a stony hill track led off from the smooth white road  as it happened he had received a letter from mrs hastings that morning fixing the date of her departure which rendered it necessary for him to discharge the duty hawtrey had saddled him with as soon as possible  the grange where he understood miss ismay was then staying lay thirty miles away across the fells and he had already decided to start early on the morrow  that being the case it was clear that he must make the most of this opportunity but he also realised that it would be advisable to proceed circumspectly  saying nothing he set his shoulder to the gate and lifting it on its decrepit hinges swung it open  thank you said the girl and then remembering that this was the last thing she had said to him she smiled as she added it is the second time you have turned up when i was in difficulties  in spite of his resolution to proceed cautiously a twinkle crept into wyllards eyes and suggested that the fact she had mentioned was not so much of a coincidence as it probably appeared  she saw it and was about to pass on when he stopped her with a gesture  he was after all usually a candid person  the fact is i have been looking out for you the last three days he said  he fancied the girl had taken alarm at this and spread his hands out deprecatingly  wont you hear me out he added  theres a matter i must put before you but i wont keep you long  his companion was a little puzzled and naturally curious  it struck her as somewhat strange that his rather startling admission should have roused in her very little indignation but she felt that it would be unreasonable to suspect this man of anything that savoured of impertinence  his manner was reassuring and she liked his face  well she said inquiringly  the man indicated a big oak trunk that lay just inside the gate  if youll sit down ill get through as quick as i can he said  in the first place i am as i told you a canadian come over partly to see the country and partly to carry out one or two duties  in regard to one of them i believe you can help me  his companions face was expressive of a very natural astonishment  i could help you  wyllard nodded  ill explain my reasons for believing it later on he said  in the meanwhile i asked you a question the other night which ill now try to make more explicit  were you ever acquainted with a young englishman who went to canada from this country several years ago  he would be about twenty then and had dark hair and eyes that of course isnt an unusual thing but there was a rather curious white mark on his left temple  if he was ever a friend of yours that scar ought to fix it  oh said the girl that must have been lance radcliffe  i was with him when the scar was madeever so long ago  but you said his name was pattinsonand we heard that he was dead  i did said wyllard gravely  still i wasnt quite sure of it and hes certainly dead  i buried him  his companion made a little abrupt movement and he saw the sudden softening of her eyes  there was however only a gentle pity in them and nothing in her manner suggested the deeper feeling he had halfexpected  that was also a relief to him  then she said i am sure that his father would like to meet you there was some trouble between themi dont know which was wrongand lance went out to canada and never wrote  by and bye major radcliffe tried to trace him through a vancouver banker and only found that he had died in the hands of a stranger who had done all that was possible for him  she turned to wyllard with a look which set his heart beating rather faster than usual  you are that man  yes said wyllard simply i did what i could for him  it didnt amount to very much  he was too far gone  then at her request he told her the story he had told to hawtrey and when he had finished her face was soft again for it had stirred her curiously  but she said he had no claim on you  wyllard lifted one hand as if in expostulation  he was dying in the bush  wasnt that enough  the girl made no answer for a moment or two  she had earned her living for several years and was because of it to some extent acquainted with the grim realities of life  she did not know that while there are certainly hard men in canada the small farmers and ranchers of the westand perhaps above all the fearless free lances who build railroads and grapple with giant trees in the forests of the pacific slopeare as a rule distinguished by a splendid charity  with them the sick or wornout stranger is very seldom turned away  still watching her companion covertly she understood that this man whom she had seen for the first time three days ago had done exactly what she would have expected of him  then she proceeded to give him the information she supposed he desired  i saw a good deal of lance radcliffewhen i was younger she said his people still live at garside scar close by dufton holme  i presume you will call on them  wyllard said that he proposed doing so as he had a watch and one or two other mementoes that they might like to have and when she told him how to reach dufton holme by a very roundabout railway journey he supposed it lay somewhere in the dale to which he already purposed going  then she turned to him again  there is one point that rather puzzles me she said  how did you know that i could tell you anything about him  the man thrust his hand into his pocket and took out a little leather case  you are by no means a stranger to me he said and quietly handed her the photograph  this is your picture i found it among the dead lads things  the girl who started visibly flashed a very keen glance at him there was however no doubt that he had not intended to produce any dramatic effect  then she flushed a little  i never knew he had it she said  perhaps he got it from his sister  she paused and then as though impelled to make the fact quite clear added i certainly never gave it him  wyllard smiled gravely for he recognised that while she was clearly grieved to hear of his death she could have had no particular tenderness for the unfortunate lad  he was however a little off his guard just then  well he said perhaps he took it in the first place for the mere beauty of it and it afterwards became a companionsomething that connected him with the old country  it appealed in one of those ways to me  again she flashed a sharp glance at him but he went on unheeding  when i found it i meant to keep it merely as a clue and so that it could be given up to his relatives some day he added  then i fell into the habit of looking at it in my lonely camp in the bush at night and when i sat beside the stove while the snow lay deep upon the prairie  there was something in your eyes that seemed to encourage me  to encourage you  yes wyllard assented gravely i think that expresses it  when i camped in the bush of the pacific slope we were either out on the gold trailand we generally came back ragged and unsuccessful after spending several months wages which we could badly spareor i was going from one wooden town to another without a dollar in my pocket and wondering how i was to obtain one when i got there  for a time it wasnt much more cheerful on the prairie twice in succession the harvest failed  perhaps lance radcliffe felt as i did  the girl cut him short  why didnt you mention the photograph at once  wyllard smiled at her  oh he said i didnt want to be precipitateyour folks dont seem to like that ive met them out west  i thinkand he seemed to consideri wanted to make sure you wouldnt be repelled by what might look like colonial brusquerie you see you have been over snowbarred divides and through great shadowy forests with me  weve camped among the boulders by lonely lakes and gone down frothing rapids  i felti cant tell you whythat i was bound to meet you some day  it was perhaps a trifle startling but the girl now showed neither astonishment nor resentment  she felt curiously certain that this stranger was not posing or speaking for effect  it did not occur to him that he might have gone too far and for a space he leaned against the gate saying nothing while she looked at him with what he thought of as her gracious english calm  pale sunshine fell upon them though the larches beside the road were rustling beneath a little cold wind and the song of the river came up brokenly out of the valley  an odour of fresh grass floated about them and the dry cold smell of the english spring was in the air across the valley dim ghosts of hills lighted by evanescent gleams rose out of the east wind greyness with shadowy grandeur  then wyllard seemed to rouse himself  i wonder if i ought to write major radcliffe and tell him what my object is before i call he said it would make the thing a little easier  the girl rose  yes she assented that would perhaps be wiser then she glanced at the photograph which was still in her hand  it has served its purpose  i scarcely think it would be of any great interest to major radcliffe  she saw his face change as she made it evident that she did not mean to give the portrait back to him but there was at least one excellent reason why she would not have her picture in a strange mans hands  thank you she said for the story  i am glad we have met but im afraid i have already kept my friends waiting for me  then she turned away and it occurred to wyllard that he had made a very indifferent use of the opportunity since she had neither asked his name nor told him hers  it was however evident that he could not well run after her and demand it and he decided that he could in all probability obtain it from major radcliffe when he called upon him still he regretted his lack of adroitness as he walked back to the inn where he wrote two letters when he had consulted a map and his landlady  dufton holme he discovered was a small village within a mile or two of the grange where as miss rawlinson had informed him agatha ismay was then staying  one letter was addressed to her and he formally asked permission to call upon her with a message from gregory hawtrey  the other was to major radcliffe and in both he said that an answer would reach him at the inn which his landlady had informed him was to be found not far from either of the houses he proposed to visit  he set out on foot next morning and after climbing a steep pass followed a winding track across a waste of empty moor until he struck a smooth white road which led past a rockgirt lake and into a deep valley  it was six oclock when he started and three when he reached the inn where he found an answer to one of his letters awaiting him it was from major radcliffe who desired an interview with him as soon as possible  within an hour he was on his way to the majors house where a greyhaired man whose yellow skin suggested long exposure to a tropical sun and a little withered lady were waiting for him  they received him graciously but there was an indefinite something in their manner and bearing which wyllard who had read a good deal recognised though he had never been brought into actual contact with it until then  he felt that he could not have expected to come across such people anywhere but in england unless it was at the headquarters of a british battalion in india  he told his story tersely softening unpleasant details and making little of what he had done and the greyhaired man listened gravely with an unmoved face though a trace of moisture crept into the little ladys eyes  there was silence for a moment or two when he had finished and then major radcliffe whose manner was very quiet turned to him  you have laid me under an obligation which i could never wipe out even if i wished it he said  it was my only son you buried out there in canada  he broke off for a moment and his quietness was more marked than ever when he went on again  as you have no doubt surmised we quarrelled he said  he was extravagant and carelessat least i thought that thenbut now it seems to me that i was unduly hard on him  his motherand he turned to the little lady with an inclination that pleased wyllard curiouslywas sure of it at the time  in any case i took the wrong way and he went out to canada  i made that at least easy for himand i have been sorry ever since  he paused again with a little expressive gesture  it seems due to him and you that i should tell you this  when no word reached us i had inquiries made through a banker he called upon who discovering that he had registered at a hotel as pattinson at length traced him to a british columbian silver mine  he had however left it shortly before my correspondent learned that he had been employed there and all the latter could tell me was that an unknown prospector had nursed him until he died  wyllard who said nothing took out a watch and the clasp of a workmans belt from his pocket and laid them gently on mrs radcliffes knee  he saw her eyes fill and turned his head away  i feel that you may blame me for not writing sooner but it was only a very little while ago that i was able to trace you and then it was only by a very curiouscoincidence he said presently  this was the most apposite word that occurred to him for he did not consider it advisable to mention the photograph  it seemed to him that the girl would not like it  nor though he was greatly tempted did he care to make inquiries concerning her just then  in another moment or two the major spoke again  if i can make your stay here pleasanter in any way i should be delighted he said  if you will take up your quarters with us i will send down to the inn for your things  wyllard excused himself but when the lady urged him at least to dine with them on the following evening he appeared to consider  the one difficulty is that i dont know yet whether i shall be engaged then he explained  as it happens ive a message for miss ismay and i wrote offering to call upon her at any convenient hour  so far i have heard nothing from her  shes away mrs radcliffe informed him  they have probably sent your letter on to her  i had a note from her yesterday however and expect her here tomorrow  you have met some friends of hers in canada  gregory hawtrey said wyllard  i have promised to call upon his people too  he saw major radcliffe glance at his wife and the faint gleam in the latters eyes  well she said if you will promise to come i will send word over to agatha  wyllard agreed to this and went away a few minutes later  he noticed the tact and consideration with which his new friends had refrained from expressing any sign of the curiosity he fancied they naturally felt for mrs radcliffes face had suggested that she understood the situation  the latter was however commencing to appear a little more difficult to him  it was it seemed his task to explain to a girl brought up among such people delicately what she must be prepared to face as a farmers wife in western canada  he was not sure that this would be easy in itself but it was rendered much more difficult by the fact that hawtrey would expect him to accomplish it without unduly daunting her  her letter had certainly suggested courage but after all it was as he reflected the courage of ignorance and he had now some notion of the life of ease and refinement her english friends led he was commencing to feel sorry for agatha ismay     chapter vii  agatha does not flinch  next evening wyllard sat with mrs radcliffe in a big lowceilinged room at garside scar looking about him with quiet interest  he had now and then spent a day or two in huge western hotels but he had never seen anything quite like that room  the sheer physical comfort of its arrangements appealed to him but after all he was not one who had ever studied his bodily ease very much and what he regarded as the chaste refinement of its adornment had a deeper effect  though he had lived for the most part in the bush and on the prairie he had been endued with or had somehow acquired an artistic susceptibility  the furniture was old and perhaps a trifle shabby but it was as he noticed of beautiful design  curtains carpets tinted walls formed it seemed to him a harmony of soft colouring and there were scattered here and there dainty works of art little statuettes from italy and wonderful indian ivory and silver work  then a row of low stoneribbed windows pierced the front of the room and looking out he saw the trim garden lying in the warm evening light  immediately beneath the windows ran a broad gravelled terrace which was apparently raked smooth every day with a row of urns in which hyacinths bloomed upon its pillared wall  from the middle of it a wide stairway led down to the wonderful velvet lawn which was dotted with clumps of cupressus with golden gleams in it and beyond that clipped yews rose smooth and solid as a rampart of stone  it all impressed him curiouslythe order and beauty of it the signs of loving care  it gave him a key he fancied to the lives the cultured english led for there was no sign of strain and fret and stress and hurry here  everything it seemed went smoothly with rhythmic regularity and though it is possible that a good many englishmen would have regarded garside scar as a very secondrate country house and seen in major radcliffe and his wife nothing more than a somewhat prosy old soldier and a withered lady oldfashioned in her dress and views this westerner had what was perhaps a clearer vision  he could imagine the major standing fast at any cost upon some minute point of honour and it seemed to him that his lady might have stepped down from some old picture with all the graces of an earlier age and the smell of the english lavender upon her garments  then he remembered that after all englishwomen lived somewhat coarsely in the georgian days and that he had met hardhanded men grimed with dust and sweat who could also stand fast by a point of honour in western canada though the latter fact did not occur to him he had for that matter done it more than once himself  then he recalled his wandering thoughts as his hostess smiled at him  you are interested in all you see she asked frankly  yes madam said wyllardand the word rose instinctively to his lips for it seemed to him the only fitting way to address her  in fact id like to spend some hours here and look at everything  id begin at the pictures and work right round  his companions smile suggested that she was not displeased  but you have been in london  i have said wyllard  i had one or two letters to folks there from big flour shippers and they did all they could to entertain me still their places were different they hadnt thecharmof yours its something which i think could only exist in these still valleys and in cathedral closes  it strikes me more because it is something ive never been accustomed to  the lady was interested and fancied that she partly understood his attitude  your life is necessarily different from ours she suggested  wyllard smiled  its so different that you couldnt realise it  its all strain and effort from early sunrise until after dusk at night bodily strain of aching muscles and mental stress in adverse seasons we scarcely think of comfort and never dream of artistic luxury  the dollars we raise are sunk again in seed and extra teams and ploughs  after all a good many people are driven rather hard by the love of money here  no said wyllard gravely thats not it exactly  at least not with most of us  its rather the pride of wresting another quartersection from the prairie takingour ownby labour breaking the wilderness youand he added this as though to explain that he could hardly expect her to quite grasp his viewshave never been out west  his hostess laughed  i have stayed down in the plains through the hot season in stifling cantonments and i have once or twice been in indian cholera camps  besides i have seen my husband sitting haggard and worn with fever in his saddle holding back a clamorous crowd that surged about him halfmad with religious fury  there were hindus and moslems to be kept from flying at each others throats and at a tactless word or sign of wavering either party would have pulled him down  youll have to forgive me madamand wyllards gesture was deprecatory though his eyes twinkled  the notion that were the only ones who really work or at least do anything worth while is rather a favourite one out west  no doubt its a delusion  i should have known that all of us are born like that  his hostess forgave him readily if only for the all of us which struck her as especially fortunate  a few minutes later there were voices in the hall and then the door opened and the girl he had met at the stepping stones came in  she was dressed differently in trailing garments which it seemed to him became her wonderfully and he noticed now the shapely delicacy of her hands and the fine ivory pallor of her skin  then his hostess turned to him  i had better present you formally to miss ismay she said  agatha this is mr wyllard who i understand has brought you a message from canada  there was no doubt that wyllard was blankly astonished and for a moment the girl was clearly startled too  you was all she said  illustration you was all she said  she however held her hand out before she turned to speak to mrs radcliffe but it was a slight relief to both when somebody announced that dinner was ready  wyllard sat next to his hostess and was not sorry that he was only called upon to take part in casual general conversation though he fancied once or twice that miss ismay was unobtrusively studying him it was also nearly an hour after the meal was over when mrs radcliffe left them alone in her little drawingroom  you have no doubt a good deal to talk about and you neednt join us until youre ready she said  the major always reads the london papers after dinner  agatha sat down in a low chair near the hearth and it first of all occurred to wyllard who took a place opposite her that she was although of full stature too delicate and dainty too overcultivated in fact to marry hawtrey  this was rather curious since he had hitherto regarded his comrade as a typical welleducated englishman but it now seemed to him that there was a certain streak of coarseness in gregory  the man it suddenly flashed upon him was selfindulgent and his careless ease of manner which he had once liked was rather too much in evidence  in a few moments however agatha turned to him  i understand that gregory is recovering rapidly she said  wyllard assured her that this was the case and agatha said quietly he wants me to go out to him  wyllard felt that if a girl of this kind had promised to marry him he would not have sent for her but have come in person if he had been compelled to pledge his last possessions or crawl to the tideway on his hands and knees  for all that he was ready to defend his friend  im afraid its necessary he said  gregory was quite unfit for such a journey when i left and he must be ready to commence the seasons campaign with the first of the spring  our summer is short you see and with our onecrop farming its indispensable to get the seed in early in fact he will be badly behind as it is  this was not particularly tactful since without intending it he made it evident that he felt his comrade had been to some extent remiss but agatha smiled  oh she said i understand  you neednt labour the excuse  but doesnt the same thing apply to you  it certainly did  now however things have become a little easier my holdings larger than gregorys and i have a foreman who can look after it for me  gregory said that you were a great friend of his  wyllard seized this opportunity  he is a great friend of mine and i like to think it means the same thing  in fact its reasonably certain that he saved my life for me  ah said agatha that is a thing he didnt mention  how did it come about  wyllard was glad to tell the story he was anxious to say all he honestly could in hawtreys favour  we were at work on a railroad trestlea towering wooden bridge in british columbia  it stretched across a deep ravine with great boulders and a stream in the bottom of it and we stood high up on a staging close beneath the metals  a fast freight a huge general produce train came down the track with one of the new big locomotives hauling it and when the cars went banging by above us we could hardly hold on to the bridge  still the construction foreman was a hustler and we had to get the spikes in  i was swinging the hammer when i felt the plank beneath me slip  the train it seems had jarred the bolt we had our lashings round loose  for a moment i felt that i was going down into the gorge and then gregory leaned out and grabbed me  he had only one free hand to do it with and when he felt my weight one foot swung out from the stringer he had sprung to  it seemed certain that i would pull him with me too  we hung like that for a spacei dont quite know how long  he paused for a moment apparently feeling the stress of it again and there was a faint thrill in his voice when he went on  it was then he said i knew just what kind of man gregory hawtrey was  anybody else would have let me go but he held on  then i got my hand on some of the framing and he swung me on to the stringer  he saw the gleam in agathas eyes  oh she said that is just what he must have done  he was like that alwaysimpulsive splendidly generous  wyllard felt that he had succeeded though he knew that there were men on the prairie who called his comrade slackly careless instead of impulsive  agatha however spoke again  but gregory wasnt a carpenter she said  in those days when dollars were scanty we had to be whatever we could there wasnt much specialisation of handicrafts out there then  the farmer whose crop was ruined took up the railroad shovel or borrowed a saw from somebody and set about building houses or anything else that was wanted  of course said agatha  besides he was always wonderfully quick he could learn any game by just watching it awhile  he did all he undertook brilliantly  it occurred to wyllard that gregory had at least made no great success of farming but that occupation as practised on the prairie demands a good deal more than quickness and what some call brilliancy from the man who undertakes it  he must as they say out there possess the capacity for staying with it the grim courage to hold fast the tighter under each crushing blow when his teams die or the grain shrivels under the harvest frost or ragged ice hurtling before a roaring blast does the reaping  it was however evident that this girl had an unquestioning faith in gregory hawtrey and once more wyllard felt compassionate towards her  he wondered if she would have retained it had the man spent those four years in england instead of canada for it was clear from the contrast between her and her picture that she had grown in many ways since she had given her promise to her lover  he had said what he could in hawtreys favour but now he felt that something was due to the girl  gregory told me to explain what things are like out there he said i think it is because they are so different from what you are accustomed to that he has waited as long as he has done  he wanted to make them as easy as possible for you and now he would like you to realise what is before you  he was almost astonished at the girls comprehension for she glanced round the luxurious room with a faint smile  you look on me as part ofthis  i mean it seems to you that i fit in with my surroundings and would only be in harmony with them  yes said wyllard gravely i think you fit in with them excellently  agatha laughed  well she said i was once to a certain extent accustomed to something similar though after all one could hardly compare the grange with garside scar  still that was some time ago and i have earned my living for several years now  that counts for something doesnt it  she glanced down at her dress  for instance this is the result of a good deal of selfdenial though the cost of it was partly worked off in music lessons and the stuff was almost the cheapest i could get  i sang at concertsand it was part of my stockintrade  after all why should you think me only capable of living in luxury  i didnt quite go that far  she laughed again  then is canada such a very dreadful place  i have heard of other englishwomen going out there as farmers wives  do they all live unhappily  no said wyllard at least they show no sign of it and some of them and the cityborn canadians are i think the salt of this earth probably its easy to be calm and gracious in such a place as thisthough i naturally dont know since ive never tried itbut when a woman who toils from sunrise to sunset most of the year keeps her sweetness and serenity its a very different and much finer thing but ill try to answer the other question  the prairie isnt dreadful its a land of sunshine and clear skies  heat and coldand we have them bothdont worry one there  theres optimism in the crystal air its not beautiful like these valleys but it has its beauty  its vast and silent and though our homesteads are crude and new once you pass the breaking its primevally old  that gets hold of one somehow its wonderful after sunset in the early spring when the little cold winds like wine and it runs white to the horizon with the smoky red on the rim of it melting into transcendental green  when the wheat rolls across the foreground in ochre and burnished copper waves its more wonderful still  one sees the fulfilment of the promise and takes courage  then said agatha who had scarcely suspected him of a capacity for such flights as this what is there to shrink from  in the case of a small farmers wife the constant neverslackening strain  theres no hired assistance she must clean the house and wash and cookthough its not unusual for the men to wash the plates  the girl was evidently not much impressed for she laughed  does gregory wash the plates she asked  wyllards eyes twinkled  when sproatly wont he said  still in a general way they only do it once a week  ah said agatha i can imagine gregory hating it  as a matter of fact i like him for it  then she must bake and mend her husbands clothes  indeed its not unusual for her to mend for the hired man too  besides that there are always odds and ends of tasks but the time when you feel the strain most is in the winter  then you sit at night shivering as a rule beside the stove in an almost empty logwalled room reading a book you have probably read three or four times before  outside the frost is arctic you can hear the roofing shingles crackle now and then and you wake up when the fire burns low  theres no life no company rarely a new face and if you go to a dance or supper somewhere perhaps once a month you ride back on a bobsled frozen almost stiff beneath the robes  still said agatha that does not last  the man understood her  oh he said one makes progressthat is if one can stand the strainbut as the one way of doing it is to sow for a larger harvest and break fresh sod every year there can be no slackening down in the meanwhile  every dollar must be guarded and ploughed into the soil again  he broke off feeling that he had done all that could reasonably be expected of him and agatha asked one question  a woman who didnt slacken could make the struggle easier for the man  yes said wyllard simply in every way  still she would have a great deal to bear  agathas face softened  ah she said she would not grudge the effort in the case of one she loved  then she looked up again with a smile  i wonder she added if you really thought i should flinch  when i first heard of it i thought it quite likely  then when i read your letter my doubts vanished  he saw he had not been judicious for there was for the first time a trace of hardness in the girls expression  he showed you that she asked  one small part of it said wyllard  i want to say that when i saw this house and how you seemed fitted to it my misgivings about gregorys decision troubled me once more  nowand he made a little impressive gesturethey have vanished altogether and theyll never come back again  he spoke as he felt  this girl he fancied would feel the strain but it seemed to him that she had strength enough to bear it cheerfully in spite of her daintiness she was one who in time of stress could be depended on  he often remembered afterwards how they had sat together in the little luxuriously furnished room she leaning back with the soft light on her delicately tinted face in her big low chair  in the meanwhile she said nothing and by and bye he looked up at her  its curious that i had your photograph ever so long and never thought of showing it gregory he said  agatha smiled  i suppose it is she admitted  after all except that it might have been a relief to major radcliffe if he had met you sooner the fact that you didnt show it gregory doesnt seem of any particular consequence  wyllard was not quite sure of this  he had thought about this girl often and had certainly been conscious of a curious thrill of satisfaction when he had met her at the steppingstones a few days earlier  that feeling had also suddenly disappeared when he had learned that she was his comrades promised wife  he had however during the last hour or two made up his mind to think no more of her  well he said the next thing is to arrange for mrs hastings to meet you in london or perhaps at the grange  her husband is a canadian a man of education who has quite a large homestead not far from gregorys  her folks are people of station in montreal and i feel sure that youll like her  they decided that he was to ask mrs hastings to stay a few days at the grange and then he looked at the girl somewhat diffidently  she suggests going in a fortnight he said  agatha smiled at him  then she said i must not keep her waiting  she rose and they went back together to join their hostess     chapter viii  the travelling companion  a grey haze thickened by the smoke of the city drove out across the water when the scarrowmania lay in the mersey with her cable hove short and the last of the flood tide gurgling against her bows  a trumpeting blast of steam swept high aloft from beside her squat funnel and the splash of the slowly turning paddles of the couple of steam tugs that lay alongside mingled with the din it made  a gangway from one of them led to the scarrowmanias forward deck and a stream of frowsy humanity that had just been released from overpacked emigrant boardinghouses poured up it  there were apparently representatives of all peoples and languages among that unkempt hordebritons scandinavians teutons italians russians polesand they moved on in forlorn apathy like cattle driven to the slaughter  one wondered from the look of them how they had raised their passage money and how many years bitter selfdenial it had cost them to provide for their transit to the land of promise  at the head of the gangway stood the steamboat doctors for the scarrowmania was taking out an unusual number of passengers and there were two of them  they were immaculate in blue uniform and looked very clean and english by contrast with the mass of frowsy aliens  beside them stood another official presumably acting on behalf of the dominion government though there were few restrictions imposed upon canadian immigration then nor for that matter did anybody trouble much about the comfort of the steerage passengers  though they have altered all that latterly each steamer in a general way carried as many as she could hold  as the stream poured out of the gangway the doctor glanced at each new comers face and then seizing him by the wrist uncovered it  since this took him two or three seconds one could have fancied that he either possessed peculiar powers or that the test was a somewhat inefficient one  then he looked at the official who made a sign and the man moved on  in the meanwhile a group of firstclass passengers leaning on the thwartship rails close by looked on with complacent satisfaction with the fact that they were born in a different station or halfcontemptuous pity as their temperament varied  among them stood mrs hastings miss winifred rawlinson and agatha  the latter noticed that wyllard sat on a hatch forward near the head of the gangway with a pipe in his hand  she drew mrs hastingss attention to it  whatever is mr wyllard doing there she asked  her companion who was wrapped in furs for there was a sting in the east wind smiled at her  that she said is more than i can tell you but harry wyllard seems to find an interest in what other folks would consider most unpromising things and whats more to the purpose hes rather addicted to taking a hand in  its a habit that costs him something now and then  agatha asked nothing further  she was interested in wyllard but she was at the moment more interested in the faces of those who swarmed on board  she wondered what they had endured in the lands that had cast them out and what they might still have to bear  it seemed to her that the murmur of their harsh voices went up in a great protest an inarticulate cry of sorrow  while she looked on the doctor held back a longhaired man who was following a haggard woman shuffling in broken boots  he drew him aside and when after he had apparently consulted with the other official two seamen hustled the man towards a second gangway that led to the tug the woman raised a wild despairing cry it however seemed that she blocked the passage and a quartermaster drove her expostulating in an agony of terror forward among the rest nobody appeared concerned about this aliens tragedy except one man but agatha was not astonished when wyllard rose and quietly laid his hand upon the officials shoulder  a parley appeared to follow somebody gave an order and when the alien was led back again the womans cries subsided  agatha looked at her companion and once more a smile crept into mrs hastingss eyes  yes she said i guessed he would feel he had to stand in  thats a man who cant see any one in trouble  then she added with a little whimsical sigh he had a bonanza harvest last fall any way  they moved aft soon afterwards and the scarrowmania was smoothly sliding seawards with the first of the ebb when agatha met wyllard  he glanced at the lancashire sandhills which were fading into a pale ochre gleam amidst the haze over the starboard hand and then at the long row of painted buoys that moved back to them ahead  youre off at last  the sad grey weather is dropping fast astern he said  out yonder the skies are clear  thank you said agatha im to apply that as i like  as a matter of fact however our days werent always grey  but what was the trouble when those steerage people came on board  wyllards manner as she noticed was free alike from the complacent selfsatisfaction which occasionally characterises the philanthropist and any affectation of diffidence  well he said there was something wrong with that womans husband nothing infectious i believe but they didnt seem to consider him a desirable citizen  they make a warning example of somebody with a physical infirmity now and then  the man they decided must be put ashore again  in the meanwhile somebody else had hustled the woman forward and it almost looked as if theyd have taken her on without him  the tug was almost ready to cast off  how dreadful said agatha  but what did you do  merely promised to guarantee the cost of his passage back if theyd refer his case to the immigration people at the other end  its scarcely likely that theyll make trouble  as a rule they only throw folks whore certain to become a charge on the community  but if he really had any infirmity mightnt it lead to that  no said wyllard drily  i would engage to give him a fair start if it was necessary  you wouldnt have had that woman landed in montreal helpless and alone while the man was sent back again to starve in poland  he saw a curious liquid gleam in agathas eyes and added in a deprecating manner you see ive now and then limped without a dollar into a british columbian mining town  the girl was a little stirred but there was another matter that must be mentioned though she felt that the time was somewhat inopportune  miss rawlinson who had only a secondclass ticket insists upon being told how it is that she has been transferred to the saloon  wyllards eyes twinkled but she noticed that he was wholly free from embarrassment which was not quite the case with her  well he said thats a matter i must leave you to handle  anyway she cant go secondclass now  one or two of the steerage exchanged when they saw their quarters for which i dont blame them and theyve filled every room right up  you havent answered the question  wyllard waved his hand  miss rawlinson is your bridesmaid and im gregorys best man  it seems to me its my business to do everything just as hed like it done  he left her a moment later and though she did not know how she was to explain the matter to miss rawlinson who was of an independent disposition it occurred to her that he at least had found a rather graceful way out of the difficulty  the more she saw of this western farmer the more she liked him  it was after dinner when she next met him and for the wind had changed the scarrowmania was steaming headon into a glorious northwest breeze  the shrouds sang chainguy and stanchion and whatever caught the wind set up a deeptoned throbbing and ranks of little whitetopped seas rolled out of the night ahead  a halfmoon hung low above them blurred now and then by wisps of flying cloud and odd spouts of spray that gleamed in the silvery light leapt up about the dipping bows  wyllard was leaning on the rails with a cigar in his hand when she stopped beside him and she glanced towards the lighted windows of the smokeroom not far away  how is it you are not in there she asked for something to say  i was said wyllard  its rather full up and it seemed they didnt want me  theyre busy playing cards and the stakes are rather high in a general way a steamboats smokeroom is less of a mens lounge than a gambling club  and you object to cards  oh no said wyllard  they merely make me tired and when i feel i want some excitement for my dollars i get it another way  that one seems tame to me  which is the one you like  the man laughed  there are a good many that appeal to me  once it was collecting sealskins off other peoples beaches and there was zest enough in that in view of the probability of the dory turning over or a gunboat dropping on to you  then there was a good deal of very genuine excitement to be got out of placermining in british columbia especially when there was frost in the ranges and you had to thaw out your giantpowder  shallow alluvial workings have a way of caving in when you least expect it of them  after all however i think i like the prairie farming best  is that exciting  yes said wyllard if you do it in one way  the golds therethat youre sure ofpiled up by nature during i dont know how many thousand years but you have to stake high if you want to get much of it out  one needs costly labour teamsno end of thembreakers and big gangplough  the farmer who has nerve enough drills his last dollar into the soil in spring but if he means to succeed it costs him more than that  he must give the sweat of his tensest effort the uttermost toil of his bodyall in fact that has been given him then he must shut his eyes tight to the hazards against him or and we cant all do that look at them without waveringthe drought the hail the harvest frost  if his teams fall sick or the season goes against him he must work double tides  still it now and then happens that things go right and the red wheat rolls ripe right back across the prairie  i dont know that any man could want a keener thrill than the one you feel when you drive the binders in  agatha had imagination and she could realise something of the toil the hazard and the clean thrill of that victory  you have felt it often she said  twice we helped to fill a big elevator up said wyllard quietly still ive been very near defeat  the girl looked at him thoughtfully  it seemed that he possessed the power of acquisition as well as a wide generosity that came into play when by strenuous effort success had been attained which so far as her experience went were things that did not invariably accompany each other  and when the harvest comes up to your expectations you give your dollars away she said  wyllard laughed  you shouldnt deduce too much from a single instance  besides that poles case hasnt cost me anything yet  mrs hastings joined them soon afterwards and when wyllard strolled away they spent some time leaning on the rails and looking at the groups of shadowy figures on the forward deck  their attitude was dejected and melancholy but one cluster had gathered round a man who stood upon the hatch  yes he said youll have no trouble  canadas a great country for a poor man  he can sleep beneath a bush all summer if he cant strike anything he likes  this did not appear particularly encouraging but the orator went on been over for a trip to the old country and im glad im going back again  went out with nothing except a good discharge and they made me sergeant of canadian militia after that armourer to a rifle club theres places a blame long way behind the dominion and i struck one of them when we went with roberts to afghanistan  it was on that trip i and a pathan rolled all down a hill him trying to get his knife arm loose and me jabbing his breastbone with my bayonet before i got it into him  i drove it through to the socket  you want to make quite sure of a pathan  miss rawlinson winced at this  oh she said what a horrible man  it was most as tough as when you went after kiel and stole the scotchmans furs suggested a canadian  the sergeant let the jibe go by  oh he said louiss bucks could shoot  we had them corralled in a pit and every time one of the boys from montreal broke cover he got a bullet into him  did any of you ever hear a dropped man squeal  agatha had heard sufficient and she and her companions turned away but as they moved across the deck the sergeants voice followed her  oh yes he said a grand country for a poolman  in the summer he can sleep beneath a bush  for some reason this eulogy haunted agatha when she retired to her room that night and she wondered what awaited all those aliens in the new land until it occurred to her that in some respects she was situated very much as they were  then for the first time vague misgivings crept into her mind as she realised that she had cut herself adrift from all that she had been accustomed to  she felt suddenly depressed and lonely  the depression had however almost vanished when awakening rather early next morning she went up on deck  a red sun hung over the tumbling seas that ran into the hazy east astern and they rolled up in crested phalanxes that gleamed green and incandescent white ahead  the scarrowmania plunged through them with a spray cloud flying about her dipping bows  she was a small oldfashioned boat andfor she had some 3000 tons of railway iron in the bottom of hershe rolled distressfully  her tall spars swayed athwart the vivid blueness of the morning sky with the rhythmic regularity of a pendulum  the girl however was troubled by no sense of sickness the keen northwester that sang amidst the shrouds was wonderfully fresh and when she met wyllard crossing the saloon deck her cheeks were glowing from the sting of the spray and her eyes were bright  where have you been she asked  down there said wyllard pointing to the black opening in the forehatch that led to the steerage quarters  an acquaintance of mine whos travelling forward asked me to take a look round and im rather glad i did  when ive had a word with the chief steward im going back again  you have a friend down there  i met the man for the first time yesterday and rather took to him one of your naval petty officers forcibly retired who cant live upon his pension which is why hes going out to canada  now youll excuse me  i wonder said agatha if you would let me go back with you  wyllard looked at her rather curiously  well he said with an air of reflection youll probably have to face a good deal that you dont like out yonder and in one way you wont suffer from a little preparatory training  this however is not a case where sentimental pity is likely to relieve anybody  its the real thing  i think i told you at garside scar that i havent lived altogether in luxury  wyllard who made no comment disappeared and merely signed to her when he came back  they reached the ladder that led down into the gloom beneath the hatch and agatha hesitated when a sour and musty odour floated up to her apparently out of the depths of the ship  she went down however and a few moments later stood halfnauseated gazing at the wildest scene of confusion her eyes had ever rested on a little light came down the hatchway and a smoky lamp or two swung above her head but half the steerage deck was wrapped in shadow and out of it there rose a manyvoiced complaining  flimsy unplaned fittings had wrenched away and men lay inert amidst the wreckage with the remains of their last meal scattered about them  there were unwashed tin plates and pannikins knives and spoons sliding up and down everywhere and the deck was foul with slops of tea and trodden bread and marmalade  now and then in a wilder roll than usual a frowsy huddled object slid groaning down the slant of slimy planking but in every case the helpless passenger was fully dressed  steerage passengers in fact seldom take off their clothes  for one thing all their worldly possessions are as a rule secreted among their attire and for another most of those hailing from beyond the danube have never been accustomed to disrobing  in the midst of the confusion two halfsick steward lads were making wholly ineffective efforts to straighten up the mess  then agatha made out that a swarm of urchins were huddled together in a helpless mass along one side of the horrible place  the sergeant was haranguing them while another man whom she supposed to be the petty officer pulled them to their feet one by one  a good deal of his labour was wasted for the scarrowmania was rolling viciously and as soon as he had got a few upright half of them collapsed again  wyllard glanced towards them compassionately  i believe most of them have had nothing to eat since they came on board though it isnt the companys fault he said  theres food enough served out but before we picked the breeze up the men laid hands upon it first and half of it was wasted in the scramble  then it seems they pitched these youngsters out of their berths  dont they belong to anybody agatha asked  is there no one to look after them  wyllard smiled drily  i believe one of your charitable institutions is sending them out and there seems to be a clergyman who has a curate and a lay assistant to help him in charge  the assistant wont be available while this rolling lasts and the other two very naturally prefer the saloon  in a way thats comprehensible  he left her and proceeded to help the man who was dragging the urchins to their feet  get up said the sergeant  get up and fall in  dress from the left and number off the ones who can stand  it appeared that the lads had been drilled for they scrambled into a line that bent and wavered each time the scarrowmanias bows went down  after that every other lad stepped forward at the word the order was left turn  march and fall in on deck and when they feebly clambered up the ladder wyllard who turned to agatha pointed to a door in a bulkhead of rough white wood  it should have been locked but i fancy you can get in that way and up through another hatch he said  the single women and women with children are in yonder and if you want to be useful theres a field for you  get as many as possible up on deck  agatha left him and her face was rather white when at last she came up into the open air with about a dozen forlorn draggled women trailing helplessly after her  the lads were now sitting down in a double line on deck each with a tin plate and a steaming pannikin in front of him there were she fancied at least a hundred of them and a man with a bronzed face and the stamp of command upon him was giving them the order of the voyage  he was the one she had already noticed  youll turn out at the whistle at halfpast six he said  shake mattresses roll up blankets and prepare for berth inspection  then at the next whistle youll fall in on deck stripped to the waist for washing parade  fourth files numbering even are orderlies in charge of the plates and pannikins  and said the sergeant any insubordination will be sharply dealt with  now when i was with roberts in afghanistan  wyllard who was standing close by turned to agatha  i dont think well be wanted  you have probably earned your breakfast  they went back to the saloon deck and the girl smiled when he looked at her inquiringly  it was a little horrible but i hadnt so many to deal with she said  do you and those others expect to bring any order out of that chaos  no said wyllard with a little encouragement theyll do it themselvesthat is the english danes and germans  one can trust them to evolve a workable system  its in their nature  you can trace most things that tend to wholesome efficiency back to the old teutonic leaven  by and bye theyll proceed to put some pressure on the latins slavs and jews  but is it your business to offer them that encouragement  wyllard laughed  strictly speaking it isnt in the least but unnecessary chaos is rather hateful and any way im not the only one who doesnt seem to like it  theres the petty officer and our friend the sergeant who was with roberts in afghanistan  agatha said nothing further  she was a little surprised to feel that she was anxious to keep this mans good opinion though that was not exactly why she had nerved herself for the venture into the single womens quarters  leaving him out altogether it seemed to her that there was something rather fine in the way the petty officer who was going out almost penniless to canada and the sergeant had saddled themselves with the task of looking after those helpless lads  it was wholly unpaid labour for which the men who preferred to remain within the safe limits of the saloon deck would presumably get the credit after all she decided there were no doubt men in every station who helped to keep the world sweet and clean and she fancied that her companion was to be counted among them  he certainly differed in many ways from gregory but then gregory was unapproachable  she did not remember that it was four years since she had seen the latter and that her ideas had been a little unformed then  during the evening mrs hastings with whom he was evidently a favourite happened to speak of wyllard and the efforts he was making in the steerage and agatha asked a question  does he often undertake this kind of thing  no said mrs hastings with a smile  any way not on so large a scale  hes very far from setting up as a professional philanthropist my dear  i dont ever remember him offering to point out their duty to other folks and i dont think he goes about in search of an opportunity of benefiting humanity  still as i suggested when an individual case thrusts itself beneath his nose he generallydoes what he can  ive heard people say that the individual method only perpetuates the trouble said agatha  her companion laughed  that she said is a subject im not well posted on but it seems to me that if other folks only adopted harry wyllards simple plan there would be considerably less need for organised charity     chapter ix  the fog  during the next two days the scarrowmania shouldered her way westwards through the big whitetopped combers that rolled down upon her under a lowering sky before a moderate gale  there were no luxurious steampropelled hotels in the canadian trade just then and loaded deep with railway metal as she was she slopped the green seas in everywhere and rolled her streaming sides out almost to her bilge she also shivered and rattled horribly when her single screw swung clear and the tricompound engines ran away  wyllard went down to the steerage every now and then and agatha who contrived to keep on her feet not infrequently accompanied him  she was glad of his society for mrs hastings was seldom in evidence and no efforts could get miss rawlinson out of her berth  the gale however blew itself out at length and the evening after it moderated agatha was sitting near the head of one fiddleguarded table in the saloon waiting for dinner which the stewards had still some difficulty in bringing in  wyllards place was next to hers but he had not appeared yet nor as it happened had the skipper who however did not invariably dine with the passengers  one of the two doors which led from the foot of the branching companion stairway into either side of the saloon stood open and presently she saw wyllard standing just outside it  he beckoned to the doctor who sat at the foot of her table and the latter merely raised his brows a trifle  he was a rather consequential person and it was evident to the girl that he resented being summoned by a gesture  she did not think anybody else had noticed wyllard and she waited with some curiosity to see what he would do  he made a sign with a lifted hand and she felt that the other would obey it as in fact he did though his manner was very far from conciliatory  by dint of listening closely she could hear their conversation  im sorry said wyllard to trouble you just now and i didnt come in because that would have set everybody wondering what you were wanted for but one of those boys forward has been thrown down the ladder and has cut his head  ah said the doctor  ill see to himafter dinner  its a nasty cut said wyllard  hes losing a good deal of blood  then i would suggest that you apply to my assistant  as i dont know where he is i have come to you  the doctor made a sign of impatience  well he said you have told me which i think is as far as your concern in the matter goes  i may add that im not accustomed to dictation on behalf of a steerage passenger  agatha saw wyllard quietly slip between him and the entrance to the saloon but she also saw as neither of the others apparently did the skipper appear a few paces behind them and glance at them sharply  he was usually a silent man at home in the ice and the clammy fog but not a great acquisition in the saloon  something wrong down forward mr wyllard  they were making a great row a little while ago he said  nothing very serious said wyllard  one of the boys however has cut his head  the skipper turned towards the doctor quietly but agatha fancied he had overheard part of the conversation  dont you think you had better goat once he said  the doctor evidently did for he disappeared and wyllard who entered the saloon with the skipper sat down at agathas side  how do you do it she asked  what asked wyllard attacking his dinner  well say persuade other folks to see things as you do  you evidently mean the skipper and i suppose you heard something of what was going on  in this case as it happens im indebted to his prejudices  hes one of the old typea seaman first of alland what we call bluff and you call bounce has only one effect upon men of his kind  it gets their backs up  agatha fancied that he did not like it either but she changed the subject  there really was a row forward she said  what was the trouble over  you were no doubt somewhere near the scene of it  wyllard laughed  i sat upon the steerage ladder and am afraid i cheered the combatants on  it was really a glorious row  they hammered each other with tin plates and some of them tried to use hoopiron knives which fortunately doubled up  they broke quite a few of the benches and wrecked the mess table but so far as i noticed the only one seriously hurt was a little chap who was quietly looking on  and you encouraged them  i certainly did  it was a protest against dirt disorder and the slothfulness thats a plague to the community  isnt physical force warranted when theres no other remedy  a greyhaired canadian looked up  yes he said i guess it is  the first man who pulled his gun in british columbia was hanged right away and theyve scarcely had to make an example of another ever since though its quite a while ago  he paused and smiled approvingly  a mess of any kind worries us and we dont take long to straighten it out  same feelings in the germans and scandinavians  ill say that for them any way  your friends swept up the steerage  they took the slavs and jews and pitched them down the second hatch on to the orlop deck  things will go smoothly now our crowd are on top  your crowd said agatha  the canadian nodded  thats what he meant he said  there are two kinds of folks you and the rest of them are dumping into canada  ones the kind that will get up and hustle break land and build new homeslog at first frame and stone afterwards  they go on from a quartersection and a team of oxen to the biggest farm they can handle and every fresh furrow they cut enriches all of us  the other kind want to sit down in the dirt and take life easily as theyve always done  the dirt worries everybody else and weve no use for them  by and bye our legislature will have to wake up and stop them getting in  he went on with his dinner after this but his observations left agatha thoughtful  she was for one thing beginning to understand one side of her companions character  he it seemed stood for practical efficiency  there was a driving force in him that made for progress and order  it was apparently his mission to straighten things out some folks of his kind she reflected now and then made a good deal of avoidable trouble but there was in this man at least a halfwhimsical toleration which rendered that an unlikely thing in his particular case  besides she had already recognised that she was in some respects fortunate in having such a man for her companion  her deck chair was always set out in the most sheltered and comfortable place  if there was anything to be seen a cargo boat plunging along forecastle under or a great iron sailing ship thrashing out to the westwards with the spray clouds flying about her hove up weather side he almost invariably appeared with a pair of powerful glasses  she was watched over her wishes anticipated and the man was seldom obtrusively present when she felt disposed to talk to somebody else it struck her that she had thought a good deal about him during the last few days and rather less than usual about gregory which was partly why she did not walk up and down the deck with him as usual after dinner that evening  three or four days later the scarrowmania ran into the bank fog and burrowed through it with whistle hooting dolefully at regular intervals  now and then an answering ringing of bells came out of the clammy vapour and the halfseen shape of an anchored schooner loomed up rolling wildly on grey slopes of sea  once too a tiny dory half filled with lines and buoys slid by plunging on the wash flung off by the scarrowmanias bows and agatha understood that the men in her had escaped death by a hairsbreadth  they were cod fishers wyllard told her and he added that there was a host of them at work somewhere in the sliding haze  she however fancied now and then that the fog had a depressing effect on him and that when the dory lay beneath the rail there had been a somewhat unusual look in his face  then a breeze came out of the northwest with the sting of the ice in it but the fog did not lift and the scarrowmania plunged on through it with spraywet decks and the grey seas smashing about her bows  it was bitterly cold and clammy the raw wind pierced to the bone but the voyage was at least rapidly shortening and one evening agatha paced the deck with wyllard in a somewhat curious mood  perhaps it was merely the gloom reacting upon her for she was looking forward to the landing with a certain halfconscious shrinking  they stopped by the rails presently looking out upon the tumbling seas that rolled out of the sliding haze tipped with livid froth and the dreariness of the surroundings intensified the girls depression there was something unpleasantly suggestive in the sight of the fog that hid everything for she had of late been troubled with a halfapprehensive longing to see what lay before her  in the meanwhile she noticed the lookout standing a lonely shapeless figure amidst the spray that whirled about the plunging bows  by and bye she saw him turn and wave an arm apparently towards the bridge behind her and she heard a hoarse windout cry  what it meant she could not tell but in another moment the scarrowmanias whistle shrieked again  then a grey shape burst out of the vapour and grew with astonishing swiftness into dim tiers of slanted sailcloth swaying above a strip of hull that moved amidst a broad white smear of foam  it was a brig under forecourse and topsails and as agatha watched her she sank to her tilted bowsprit and a big grey and white sea foamed about her bows  arent we dreadfully near she asked  wyllard did not answer  he was gazing up at the bridge and once more the whistle hurled out a great warning blast  it hardly seemed to her that the two vessels could pass clear of each other  then wyllard laid a hand upon her shoulder  the skippers starboarding  well go round her stern he said  his grasp was reassuring and she watched the straining curves of canvas and line of halfsubmerged hull  it rose with streaming bows swung high above the sea sank again and vanished with bewildering suddenness into a belt of driving fog  she was not sure that there had been any peril but it was certainly over now and she was rather puzzled by her sensations when wyllard had held her shoulder  for one thing she had felt instinctively that she was safe with him  she however decided not to trouble herself about the reason for this and by and bye she looked up at him  the expression she had already noticed was once more in his face  i dont think you like the fog any more than i do she said  no said wyllard with a quiet forcefulness that almost startled her i hate it  why do you go as far as that  it recalls something that still gives me a very bad few minutes every now and then  it has been worrying me again tonight  i wonder said agatha simply if you would care to tell me  the man looked down on her with a little wry smile  i havent told it often but you shall hear he said  its a tale of a black failure he stretched out a hand and pointed to the sliding fog and ranks of tumbling seas  it was very much this kind of night and we were lying reefed down off one of the russians beaches when i asked for volunteers  i got themtwo boats crews of the finest seamen that ever handled oar or sealing rifle  but what did you want them for  a boat from another schooner had been cast ashore  it was blowing tolerably hard as it usually does where the polar ice comes down into the behring sea  theyd been shooting seals from her  we meant to bring the men off if we could manage it  wouldnt one boat have been enough  no said wyllard drily we had three and i think that was one cause of the trouble  there was one from the other schooner  you see those seals belonged to the russians and we freelances could only shoot them clear off shore  im not sure that the men in the wrecked boat had been fishing outside the limit  agatha did not press for further particulars and he went on  we managed to make a landing though one boat went up bottom uppermost he said  i fancy they must have broken or lost an oar then  we also got the wrecked men but we had trouble while we were getting the boats off again  the surf was running in savagely and the fog shut down solid as a wall  any way we pulled off and went out with a foot of water in us while one of the rescued men took my oar when i let it go  why had you to let it go  wyllard laughed in a rather grim fashion  i got my head laid open with a sealing club he said  some of the rest had their scratches but they managed to row  for one thing they knew they had to  they had reasons for not wanting to fall into the russians hands  well we cleared the beach and once or twice as i tried to bale there was a shout somewhere near us and the loom of a vanishing boat  it was all we could make out for the sea was slopping into her and the spray was flying everywhere  if there had only been two boats wed probably have found out our misfortune and perhaps have set it straight  as it was we couldnt tell it was the same boat that had hailed us  he broke off for a moment and then added quietly two boats reached the schooners  there was a nasty sea running then and it blew viciously hard next day  there were three men in the other  ah said agatha they were drowned  wyllard made a little forceful gesture  im not quite sure  thats the trouble  at least the boat was nowhere on the beach next day and its difficult to see how they could have faced the sea that piled up when the gale came down  in all probability they had an oar short and she rolled them out when a comber broke upon her in the darkness the girl saw him close one hand tight as he added if one only knew  what would have befallen them if theyd got ashore  its difficult to say  in a general way theyd have been handed over to the russian authorities  still sealers poaching up there have simply disappeared  he stopped again and glanced out at the gathering darkness  now he added you see why i hate the fog  but you couldnt help it said agatha  well said wyllard i asked for volunteers and the money thats now mine came out of those schooners  its just possible those men are living stillsomewhere in northern asia  i only know they disappeared  then he abruptly commenced to talk of something else and by and bye agatha went down to the saloon where miss rawlinson who had not been much in evidence during the voyage presently made her appearance  arent you going into the musicroom to play for mr wyllardas usual she said  agatha was almost disconcerted  she had fallen into the habit of spending half an hour or longer in the little musicroom every evening with wyllard standing near the piano but now her companions question seemed to place a significance upon the fact  no she said i dont think i am  then the rest of them will wonder it you have fallen out with him  fallen out with him  winifred laughed  theyve naturally been watching both of you and in a general way theres only one decision they could have arrived at  agatha flushed a little but her companion went on  i dont mind admitting that if a man of that kind was to fall in love with me id black his boots for him she said  then she added with a whimsically rueful gesture still its most unlikely  agatha looked at her with a little glint in her eyes  he is merely gregorys deputy she said with a subconscious feeling that the epithet was not a remarkably fortunate one  in that connection i should like to point out that you can estimate a mans character by that of his friends  oh said winifred then if mr wyllards strong points are merely to heighten gregorys credit ive nothing more to say  anyway ill reserve my homage until ive seen him  perfection among men is scarce nowadays  she turned away and left agatha thoughtful  in the meanwhile mrs hastings came upon wyllard in the musicroom  there was just then nobody else in it  you look quite serious she said  ive been thinking about miss ismay and gregory said wyllard  in fact i feel a little anxious about them  in which way  without making any reflections upon gregory i somehow feel sorry for the girl  mrs hastings nodded  as a matter of fact thats very much what i felt from the first she said  still you see theres the important fact that shes fond of him and it should smooth out a good many difficulties  anyway what we can call the material ones wont count shes evidently rather a courageous person  the man sat silent a moment or two  i wasnt troubling about them he said  i was wondering if she really could be fond of him  its some years since she was much in his company  hawtrey is not a man to change  that said wyllard is just the trouble  ive no doubt hes much the same but one could fancy that miss ismay has changed a good deal since she last saw him  shell look for considerably more than she was probably content with then  in any case it isnt your affair  in one sense it certainly isnt but i cant help feeling a little troubled about the thing  you see gregory is quite an old friend  and the girl is going out to marry him said mrs hastings  wyllard rose  that he said is quite uncalled for  i would like to assure you of it  he went out and the lady sat still in a reflective mood  if she begins to compare him with hawtrey there can be only one result she said  the fog had almost gone next morning and pale sunshine streamed down upon a frothflecked sea  a bitter wind however still came out of the hazy north and the scarrowmanias plates were crusted with ice where the highest crests of the tumbling seas reached them  the spray also froze and the decks grew slippery until when darkness came nobody but the seamen faced the stinging cold  agatha felt the engines stop late that night and when she went out next morning the decks were white and she could see dim ghosts of sliding pines through a haze of falling snow  it grew bewilderingly thick at times but the steamer slid on through it with whistle hooting and when at last towards sunset the snow cleared away agatha stood shivering under a deckhouse looking about her with a curiously heavy heart  a grey haze stretched across the great river which was also dim and grey and odd wisps of pines rose raggedly beneath the white hills that cut against a gloomy lowering sky  deckhouse boat and stanchion dripped and every now and then the silence was broken by a doleful blast of the whistle  nothing moved on the still grey water there was no sign of life ashore and they seemed to be steaming into a great desolation  by and bye wyllard appeared from somewhere and after a glance at her face slipped his hand beneath her arm and led her down to the lighted saloon  then her heart grew a little lighter  once more she was conscious of an unreasoning feeling that she was safe with him     chapter x  disillusion  the long train was speeding smoothly across the vast white levels of assiniboia when agatha who sat by a window looked up as the conductor strode through the car  mrs hastings asked him a question and he stopped a moment  yes he said well be in clermont inside half an hour  then he went on and mrs hastings smiled at agatha  were a little late and gregory will be waiting for us in the depôt now she said  no doubt hes got the waggon fixed up right but id like to feel sure of it  theres a long drive before us and i want to reach the homestead before its dark  agatha said nothing but a faint tinge of colour crept into her cheeks and her companion was glad to see it for she had noticed that the girl was looking rather pale and haggard  this was partly due to the fact that the strain of the last few months she had spent in england was commencing to tell on her  she had borne it courageously but a reaction had afterwards set in and as it happened the scarrowmania had plunged along bows under against fresh northwesterly gales most of the way across the atlantic  there is very little comfort on board a small deeplyloaded steamer when she rolls her rails in and lurches with thudding screw swung clear over big steepsided combers  in addition to this agatha had scarcely slept during the few days and nights she had spent in the train  it takes some time to become accustomed to the atmosphere of a stoveheated sleeper car and since she had landed she had been in a state of not altogether unnatural nervous tension  indeed she had found it a little difficult to preserve an outward serenity the previous day and when at length the great train ran into the depôt at winnipeg where gregory had arranged to meet them it was with a thrill of expectancy and relief that she stood upon the car platform  there was however no sign of him and though wyllard handed her a telegram from him a few minutes later the fact that he had not arrived had a depressing effect on her  quiet as she usually was the girl was highly strung  it appeared that something had gone wrong with hawtreys waggon while he was driving in to the railroad and as the result of it he had missed the atlantic train  she could not blame him for this but for all that his absence had been an unpleasant shock  feeling that her companions eyes were upon her she turned and looking out of the window found no encouragement in what she saw  the snow had gone and a vast expanse of grass ran back to the horizon but it was a dingy greyishwhite and not green as it had been in england the sky was low and grey too and the only thing that broke the dreary monotony of lifeless colour was when the formless darker smear of a birch bluff rose out of the empty levels  her heart throbbed unpleasantly fast as the few remaining minutes slipped away and at length she started when a dingy mass of something that looked like buildings lifted itself above the prairie  the clermont elevators said mrs hastings  well be in directly  the mass separated itself into two or three tall component blocks  a huddle of little wooden houses grew into shape beneath them and a shrill whistle came ringing back above the slowing cars  then a willow bluff half filled with old cans and garbage flitted by a big bell commenced tolling and agatha rose when mrs hastings took up her furs from a seat close by  after that she found herself standing on the platform of the car though she did not quite know how she got there for she was sensible only of the fact that in another moment or two she would greet the lover she had last seen four years ago  in the meanwhile though she paid them no great attention the surroundings had a depressing effect on her  there was however very little to see the mass of the great elevators that cut against a lowering sky the little cluster of houses and the sea of churnedup mire between them and the track  there also appeared to be no station except a big water tank and a rather unsightly shed about which stood a group of blurred and shapeless figures  it seemed very cold and agatha shivered as she felt the raw wind strike through her  then one of the figures detached itself from the rest and grew clearer the man wore an old skin coat spattered with flakes of mire and his long boots were covered with clots of the same material  his fur cap looked greasy and the fur had been rubbed off it in patches but while she noticed these things it was his face that struck her most and she became conscious of an astonishment which was mixed with vague misgivings as she gazed at it for it had subtly changed since she had last seen it  the joyous sparkle she remembered had gone out of the eyes  they were harder bolder than they used to be  the mouth was slackit almost looked sensualand the mans whole personality seemed to have grown coarser  then as she thrust the disconcerting fancies from her the car stopped  in another moment hawtrey sprang up on the platform and she felt his arms about her  that brought the blood to her face but she felt none of the thrill she had expected  indeed she was subconsciously sensible of a certain shrinking from his embrace  then and she fancied he must have lifted her bodily down she stood beside the track with mrs hastings a man whom she supposed to be the latters husband winifred and wyllard about her  another man was also standing close by apparently waiting until they noticed him  he was flecked with mire all over his skin coat was very dilapidated and agatha fancied that his boots had never been cleaned  his hair which had evidently been very badly cut straggled out from under his old fur cap  illustration in another moment hawtrey sprang up on the platform and she felt his arms about her  in the meanwhile gregory was apparently explaining something to mrs hastings  no he said im sorry it cant be for another week horribly unfortunate  it seems theyve sent the methodist on down the line and well have to wait for the episcopalian  hell be at landers for a few days  then agathas cheeks flamed for she recognised that it was her wedding they were speaking of but it brought her a curious relief to hear that it had been deferred  a moment or two later gregory turned to her with questions about her throat and his people in england and winifred separated herself from the group  she was standing near her baggage which had been flung out beside the track a little lonely figure while the train went on when wyllard strode up to her  feeling rather out of it  i do any way he said  since we appear superfluous we may as well make the most of the opportunity especially as it will probably save you a long drive  theres a man here who wants to see you  winifred had felt very forlorn a few moments earlier but the announcement wyllard had just made was reassuring and she pulled herself together as he signed to a man standing a little further along the track  the latter wore rather neat store clothes and his manner was brisk and wholly businesslike  it was a certain relief to the girl to see that he evidently regarded her less as a personality than as a piece of commercial machinery which he had apparently been asked to make use of  she had found it easier to get on with men who confined themselves to that point of view  mr hamilton in charge of the elevator yonder said wyllard pointing to one of the huge buildings  this is miss rawlinson  the elevator man made her the curtest of inclinations and proceeded to arrange matters with a rapidity which almost took her breath away  typist and stenographer he said  know anything about accountkeeping  winifred admitted that she possessed these abilities and hamilton appeared to reflect for a moment or two  well he said in a fortnight well give you a show  you can start at and he mentioned terms which rather astonished winifred  if you can keep things straight we may raise you later  wont you want to see any testimonials she asked  no said hamilton  ive seen a good many and im inclined to fancy some of the folks who showed them me must have bought them  he waved his hand  mr wyllard assures me that youll do and in the meanwhile thats quite enough for me  it struck winifred as curious that while agatha had written to hawtrey on her behalf it was wyllard who had secured her the opportunity she had longed for but she thanked the elevator man before she turned to him  theres another matter she said hesitatingly  ill have to live here  wyllard smiled  ive seen to that though if you dont like my arrangements you can alter them afterwards  mrs sandberg will take you in and even if she isnt particularly amiable youll be in safe hands  hamilton laughed  oh yes he said  shes scotchold type calvinist at that  no frivolity about that woman  married a scandinavian and was just breaking him in when he was killed back east along the track  well consider it as fixed but in the meanwhile youre to stay with mrs hastings for the fortnight said wyllard  sproatlyand he signed to the man in the skin coatwill you get miss rawlinsons baggage into your waggon  the man took off his fur cap  if miss rawlinson would like to see mrs sandberg ill drive her round he suggested  well catch you up in a league or so  gregory has a bit of patching to do on his offside trace  he might have had things straight for once said wyllard halfaloud  winifred permitted sproatly to help her into his waggona high narrowbodied vehicle mounted on tall spidery wheels but she had to hold fast to it while they jolted across the track and through a sea of mire into the unpaved street of the little town  she liked her companions voice and manner though she was far from prepossessed by his appearance  two or three minutes later he drew up before a little wooden house where they were received by a tall hardfaced woman who frowned at sproatly  yell tak your patent medicines somewhere else  im wanting none she said  sproatly grinned  you neednt be afraid of them  they couldnt hurt you  i was talking to a winnipeg doctor whod a notion of coming out a day or two ago  i told him if he did hed have to bring an axe along  then he explained that wyllard had sent winifred there and the woman favoured her with a glance of careful scrutiny  weel she said ye look quiet anyway  then she added as though further satisfied ill make ye a cup of tea if ye can wait  sproatly assured her that this was not the case and in a few more minutes the girl who went into the house got into the waggon again with relief in her face  i think i owe mr wyllard a good deal she said  sproatly laughed  youre not exactly singular in that respect but you had better hold tight  these beasts are rather less than half broken  he flicked them with the whip and they went across the track at a gallop hurling great clods of mud left and right while the group of loungers who still stood about the station raised a shout  got any little pictures with nice motters on them asked one and another flung a piece of information after the jolting waggon  theres a swede down at brankers wants a bottle that will supple up a wooden leg he said  sproatly grinned and waved his hand to them before he turned to his companion  we have to get through before dark if possible or id stop and sell them something sure he said  parts of the trail further on are simply horrible  it occurred to winifred that it was far from excellent as it was for spouts of mud flew up beneath the sinking hoofs and wheels and she was already getting unpleasantly spattered  you think you would have succeeded she asked  oh yes said sproatly  if i couldnt plant something on to them when theyd given me a lead like that id be no use in this business at present my command of western phraseology is my fortune  you sell things then  sproatly pointed to a couple of big boxes in the bottom of the waggon anything from cough cure to hair restorer besides a general purpose elixir thats specially prepared for me  its adaptable to any complaint and season  all you have to doand he lowered his voice confidentiallyis to put on a different label  winifred who had not felt like it a little earlier laughed when she met his eyes  what happens to the people who buy it she asked  most of them are bachelors and tough  theyve stood their own cooking so long that they ought to be and if anybodys really sick i hold off and tell him to wait until he can get a doctor  a sensitive conscience he added reflectively is quite a handicap in this business  you have always been in it asked winifred who was amused at him  no said sproatly although you mightnt believe it i was raised with the idea that i should have my choice between the church and the bar  the idea however provedimpracticablewhich in some respects is rather a pity  it has seemed to me that a man who can work off cough cures and cosmetics on to healthy folks with a hide like leather and talk a scoffer off the field ought to have made his mark in either calling  he looked at her as if for confirmation of this view but winifred who laughed again glanced at the two waggons that moved on perhaps two miles away across the greywhite sweep of prairie  will we overtake them she asked  well probably come up with gregory  im not sure about wyllard  he drives faster horses  thats not quite the reason  gregory has patched up one trace with a bit of string and odd bolts are rather addicted to coming out of his waggon  sometimes it makes trouble  ive known the team leave him sitting on the prairie thinking of endearing names for them and come home with the pole  does he generally let things fall into that state  sproatly however was evidently on his guard  well he said its certainly that kind of waggon  then he flicked the team again and the jolting rendered it difficult for winifred to ask any more questions  the prairie sod was soft with the thaw and big lumps of it stuck to the wheels which every now and then plunged into ruts other vehicles had made  in the meanwhile agatha and hawtrey found it almost as impossible to sustain a conversation which was on the whole a relief to the girl the stringpatched trace still held and the waggon pole was a new one but where they were just then the white grass was tussocky and long and the trail they occasionally plunged into to avoid it had been churned into a quagmire  hawtrey had packed the thick driving robe high about his companion and slipped one arm about her waist beneath it but she was conscious that she rather suffered this than derived any satisfaction from it  she strove to assure herself that she was jaded with the journey which was in fact the case and that the lowering sky and the cheerless waste they were crossing had occasioned the dejection she felt which was also possible  there was not a tree upon the vast sweep of bleached grass which ran all round her to the horizon  it was inexpressibly lonely a lifeless desolation with only the ploughedup trail to show that man had ever traversed it and the raw wind which swept it set her shivering  she was however forced to admit that her weariness and the dreary surroundings did not quite explain everything  even her lovers first embrace had brought her no thrill and now the close pressure of his arm left her quite unmoved  this was almost disconcertingly curious but while she would admit no definite reason for it there was creeping upon her a vague consciousness that the man was not the one she had so often thought of in england  he seemed differentalmost in fact a strangerthough she could not exactly tell where the change in him began  his laughter jarred upon her  some of the things he said appeared almost inane and others were tinged with a selfconfidence that did not become him  it almost seemed to her that he was shallow lacking in comprehension and once she found herself comparing him with another man  she however broke off that train of thought abruptly and once more endeavoured to find the explanation in herself weariness had induced this captious hypercritical fit and by and bye she would become used to him she said  hawtrey was at least not effusive for which she was thankful but when they reached a somewhat smoother surface he commenced to talk of england  i suppose you saw a good deal of my folks when you were at the grange he said  no said agatha i saw them once or twice  ah said the man with a trace of sharpness then they were not particularly agreeable  it seemed to agatha that he was tactless in suggesting anything of the kind but she answered candidly  one could hardly go quite so far as that she said  still i couldnt help a feeling that it was rather an effort for them to be gracious to me  they did what they could to make things pleasant when they were first told of our engagement  agatha was too wornout to be altogether on her guard which was partly why she had admitted as much as she had done though his relatives attitude had wounded her and she answered without reflection  i have fancied that was because they never quite believed it would lead to anything  she knew this was the truth now though it was the first time the explanation had occurred to her  gregorys folks who were naturally acquainted with his character had it seemed not expected him to carry his promise out  she however felt that she had been injudicious when she heard his little harsh laugh  im afraid they never had a very great opinion of me he said  then said agatha looking up at him it will be our business to prove them wrong but i cant help feeling that you have undertaken a big responsibility gregory  there must be so much that i ought to do and i know so little about your work in this country  she turned and glanced with a shiver at the dim white prairie  it looks so forbidding and unyielding  it must be very hard to turn it into wheat fieldsto break it in  it was merely a hint of what she felt and it was rather a pity that hawtrey who lacked imagination usually contented himself with the most obvious meaning of the spoken word  things might have gone differently had he responded with comprehending sympathy  oh he said with a laugh that changed her mood youll learn and i dont suppose it will matter a great deal if you dont do it quickly somehow or other one worries through  she felt that this was insufficient though she remembered that his haphazard carelessness had once appealed to her  now however she realised that to undertake a thing lightheartedly was a very different matter from carrying it out successfully  then it once more occurred to her that she was becoming absurdly hypercritical and she strove to talk of other things  she did not find it easy nor though he made the effort did hawtrey there was a restraint that he chafed at upon him for he had when he first saw her been struck by the change in the girl  she was graver than he remembered her and it seemed very much more reserved  he had tried and failed as he thought of it to strike a spark out of her  she did not respond and he became uneasily conscious that he could not talk to her as he could for instance to sally creighton there was something wanting in him or her but he could not at the moment tell what it was  still he said things would be different next day for the girl was evidently very weary  in the meanwhile the creeping dusk settled down upon the wilderness the horizon narrowed in and the stretch of grass before them grew dim the trail they now drove into seemed to grow rapidly rougher and it was quite dark when they came to the brink of a declivity still at least a league from the hastingss homestead  it was one of the steep ravines that seam the prairie every here and there with a birch bluff on the sides of it and a little creek flowing through the hollow  hawtrey swung the whip when they reached the top and the team plunged furiously down the slope  he straightened himself in his seat with both hands on the reins and agatha held her breath when she felt the light vehicle tilt as the wheels on one side sank deep in a rut  then something seemed to crack and she saw the offside horse stumble and plunge  the other beast flung its head up hawtrey shouted something and there was a great smashing and snapping of undergrowth and fallen branches as they drove in among the birches  then the team stopped and hawtrey who sprang down floundered noisily among the undergrowth while another thud of hoofs and rattle of wheels grew louder behind them up the trail  in a minute or two he came back and lifted agatha down  illustration then something seemed to crack and she saw the offside horse stumble and plunge  its the trace broken  i had to make the holes with my knife and the strings torn through he said  voltigeur got it round his feet and as usual tried to bolt  anyway well make the others pull up and take you in  they went back to the trail together and reached it just as hastings reined in his team  he got down and walked back with hawtrey to the latters waggon  it was a minute or two before they reappeared again and mrs hastings who had got down in the meanwhile drew hawtrey aside  i almost think it would be better if you didnt come any further tonight she said  why the man asked sharply  i cant help thinking that agatha would prefer it  for one thing shes rather jaded and wants quietness  you feel sure of that  there was something in the mans voice which suggested that he was not quite satisfied and his companion was silent a moment  its good advice gregory she said  shell be better able to face the situation after a nights rest  does it require much facing hawtrey asked drily  mrs hastings turned from him with a sign of impatience  of course it does  anyway if youre wise youll do what i suggest and ask no more questions  then she got into the waggon and hawtrey stood still beside the trail feeling unusually thoughtful when they drove away     chapter xi  agathas decision  it was with an expectancy which was slightly toned down by misgivings that hawtrey drove over to the homestead where agatha was staying the next afternoon  the misgivings were perhaps not unnatural for he had been chilled by the girls reception of him on the previous day and her manner afterwards had he felt left something to be desired indeed when she drove away with mrs hastings he had felt himself a somewhat injured man  his efforts to mend the harness and extricate the waggon in the dark which occupied him for an hour had however partly helped to drive the matter from his mind and when he reached his homestead rather late that night he went to sleep and slept soundly until sunrise which was significant  hawtrey was at least a man who never brooded over his troubles beforehand and this was perhaps one reason why he did not always cope with them successfully when they could no longer be avoided  when he had made his breakfast he however became sensible of a certain pique against both mrs hastings and the girl which led him to remember that he had no hired man and that there was a good deal to be done  he decided that it might be well to wait until the afternoon before he called on them and for several hours he drove his team through the crackling stubble  his doubts and irritation grew weaker as he did so and when at length he drove into sight of hastingss homestead his buoyant temperament was commencing to reassert itself clear sunshine streamed down upon the prairie out of a vault of cloudless blue and he felt that after all any faint shadow that might have arisen between him and the girl could be readily swept away  he was however a little less sure of this when he saw her  agatha sat near an open window in a scantily furnished matchboarded room and she at least as it happened had not slept at all  her eyes were heavy but there was a look of resolution in them which seemed out of place just then and it struck him that she had lost the freshness which had characterised her in england  she rose when he came in and then to his astonishment drew back a pace or two when he moved impulsively towards her  no she said with a hand raised restrainingly you must hear what i have to say and try to bear with me  it is a little difficult gregory but it must be said at once  the man stood still almost awkwardly looking at her with consternation in his face and for a moment she looked steadily at him it was a painful moment for she was just then gifted with a clearness of vision which she almost longed to be delivered from  she saw that the impression which had brought her a vague sense of dismay on the previous afternoon was wrong  the trouble was that he had not changed at all  he was what he had always been and she had merely deceived herself when she had permitted her girlish fancy to endue him with qualities and graces which he had it seemed never possessed  there was however no doubt that she had still a duty towards him  he spoke first with a trace of hardness in his voice  then he said wont you sit down  this is naturally a littleembarrassingbut ill try to listen  agatha sank into a seat by the open window for she felt physically wornout and there was a task she shrank from before her  gregory she said i feel that we have come near making what might prove to be a horrible mistake  we said hawtrey while the blood rose into his weatherdarkened face  that means both of us  yes said agatha with a quietness that cost her an effort  hawtrey spread his hands out forcibly  do you want me to admit that ive made one  are you quite sure you havent  she flung the question at him sharply in tense apprehension for after all if the man was sure of himself there was only one course open to her  he leaned upon the table gazing at her and as he did so his indignation melted and doubts commenced to creep into his mind  she looked weary and grave and almost haggard and it was a fresh lighthearted girl he had fallen in love with in england  the mark of the last two years of struggle was just then plain on her though while he did not recognise this it would pass away again  he tried to realise what he had looked for when he had asked her to marry him and could not do so clearly but there was in the back of his mind a halfformulated notion that it had been a cheerful companion somebody to amuse him  she scarcely seemed likely to do the latter now  he was however not one of the men who can face a crisis collectedly and his thoughts became confused until one idea emerged from them  he had pledged himself to her and the fact laid a certain obligation upon him  it was his part to overrule any fancies she might be disposed to indulge in  well he said stoutly im not going to admit anything of that kind the journey has been too much for you  you havent got over it yet he lowered his voice and his face softened  aggy dear ive waited four years for you  that stirred her for it was certainly true and his gentleness had also its effect  the situation was becoming more and more difficult for it seemed impossible to make him understand that he would in all probability speedily tire of her  she now recognised that but to make it clear that she could never be satisfied with him was a thing she shrank from  how have you passed those four years she asked to gain time  for a moment his conscience smote him  he remembered the trips to winnipeg and the dances to which he had attended sally creighton  it was however evident that agatha could have heard nothing of sally  i spent them in hard work  i wanted to make the place more comfortable for you he said  it is trueand he added this with a twinge of uneasiness as he remembered that his neighbours had done much more with less incentivethat its still very far from what i would like but things have been against me  the speech had a far stronger effect than he could have expected for agatha remembered wyllards description of what the prairie farmer had to face  those four years of determined effort and patient endurance which was how she pictured them counted heavily against her in the mans favour  it flashed upon her that after all there might have been some warrant for the view she had held of gregorys character when he had fallen in love with her  he was younger then there must have been latent possibilities in him but the years of toil had killed them and hardened him  it was for her sake he had made the struggle and now it seemed unthinkable that she should renounce him because he came to her with the dust and stain of it upon him  for all that she was possessed with a curious subconscious feeling that she would involve them both in disaster if she yielded  something warned her that she must stand fast  gregory she said i seem to know that we should both be sorry afterwards if i kept my promise  hawtrey straightened himself with a smile she recognised  she had liked him for it once for it had then suggested the joyous courage of untainted youth  now however it struck her as only hinting at empty complacent assurance  she hated herself for the fancy but it would not be driven away  well he said im quite willing to face that hazard  i suppose this diffidence is only natural aggy but its a little hard on me  no said the girl sharply with a strained look in her eyes its horribly unnatural and thats why im afraid  i should have come to you gladly without a misgiving feeling that nothing could hurt me if i was with you  i wanted to do that gregoryi meant tobut i cant  then her voice fell to a tone that had vibrant regret in it you should have made suremarried me when you last came home  but id nowhere to take you  the farm was only halfbroken prairie the homestead almost unhabitable  agatha winced at this  it was no doubt true but it seemed horribly petty and commonplace  his comprehension stopped at such details as these and he had given her no credit for the courage which would have made light of bodily discomfort  do you thinkthatwould have mattered  we were both very young then and we could have faced our troubles and grown up together  now were not the same  you let me grow up alone  illustration do you thinkthatwould have mattered  hawtrey spread his hands out  i havent changed  he contented himself with that and agatha grew more resolute  there was no spark of imagination in him scarcely even a spark of the passion which if it had been strong enough might have swept her away in spite of her shrinking  he was a man of comely presence whimsical and quick as she remembered at light badinage but when there was a crisis to be grappled with he somehow failed  his graces were on the surface  there was no depth in him  aggy he added humbly when he should have been dominantly forceful it is only a question of a little time  you will get used to me  then and the girl clutched at the chance of respite give me six months from today  it isnt very much to ask gregory  the man wrinkled his brows  its a great deal he answered slowly i seem to feel that we shall drift further and further apart if once i let you go  then you feel that we have drifted a little already  i dont know what has come over you aggy but there has been a change  im what i was and i want to keep you  agatha rose and turned towards him rather white in face  then if you are wise you will not urge me now  hawtrey met her gaze for a moment and then made a sign of acquiescence as he turned his eyes away  he recognised that this was a new agatha one whose will was stronger than his  yet he was halfastonished that he had yielded so readily  well he said if it must be i can only give way to you but i must be free to come over here whenever i wish  then a thought seemed to strike him  but you may have to go away he added with sudden concern  if i am to wait six months what are you to do in the meanwhile  the girl smiled wearily  now the respite had been granted her the question he had raised was not one that caused her any great concern  oh she said we can think of that later i have borne enough today  this has been a little hard upon me gregory  i dont think it has been particularly easy for either of us said hawtrey with a trace of grimness  anyway it seems that im only distressing you  he smiled wryly  its naturally not what i had expected to do  ill come back when i feel ive quite grasped the situation  he moved a pace or two nearer and taking one of her hands swiftly stooped and kissed her cheek  my dear he said i only want to make it as easy as i can  youll try to think of me favourably  then he went out and left her sitting with a troubled face beside the open window  a little warm breeze swept into the almost empty room and outside a blaze of sunshine rested on the prairie  it was torn up with wheel ruts about the house for the wooden building rose abruptly without fence or garden from the waste of whitened grass  close to it there stood a birchlog barn or stables its sides curiously ridged and furrowed where the trunks were laid on one another roofed with wooden shingles that had warped into hollows here and there  further away there rose another long building apparently of sod and a great shapeless yellow mound with a domed top towered behind the latter  it was most unlike a trim english rick besides being bigger and agatha wondered what it could be  as a matter of fact it was a not uncommon form of granary the straw from the last thrashing flung over a birchpole framing  behind that there ran a great breadth of kneehigh stubble blazing ochre and cadmium in the sunlight  it had evidently extended further than it did for a blackened space showed where a fire had been lighted to destroy it  here hastings clad in blue duck with long boots was ploughing plodding behind his horses which stopped now and then when the share jarred against a patch of still frozen soil  further on two other men silhouetted in blue against the whitened grass drove spans of slowly moving oxen that hauled big breaker ploughs and the lines of clods that lengthened behind them gleamed in the sunlight a rich chocolatebrown  beyond them the wilderness ran unbroken to the horizon  agatha gazed at it all vacantly but the newness and strangeness of it reacted upon her  she felt very desolate and lonely and by and bye remembered that she had still to grapple with a practical difficulty she could not stay with mrs hastings indefinitely and she had not the least notion where to go or what she was to do  she was leaning back in her chair wearily with halfclosed eyes when her hostess came in and looked at her with a smile that suggested comprehension  mrs hastings was thin and seemed a trifle worn but she had shrewd kindly eyes just then she wore a plain print dress which was dusted here and there with flour  so you have sent him away she said  it was borne in upon agatha that she could be candid with this woman who she fancied had already guessed the truth  yes she said for six months  that is we are not to decide on anything until they have expired  i felt we must get used to each other  it seemed best  to you  did it seem best to gregory  a flush crept into agathas face  though his acquiescence had been a relief to her she felt that after all he might have made a more vigorous protest  he gave in to me she said  mrs hastings looked thoughtful  well she said i believe you were wise but that opens up another question  what are you going to do in the meanwhile  i dont know said agatha wearily  i suppose i shall have to go awayto winnipeg most probably  i could teach i think  how are you and gregory to get used to each other if you go away  agatha made a little helpless gesture  i hadnt looked at it in that light  are you very anxious to get used to him  agatha shrank from the question but there was a constraining kindliness in her companions eyes  i darent quite think about it yet  i mean to try  i must try  i seem to be playing an utterly contemptible selfish part but i could not marry himnow  her hostess quietly crossed the room and sat down by her side  my dear she said as i told you i think you are doing right and in some respects i believe i know how you feel  everybody prophesied disaster when i came out to join allen from a sheltered home in montreal and at the beginning my life here was not easy to me  it was all so different and there were times when i was afraid and my heart was horribly heavy  if it hadnt been for allen i think i should have given in and broken down  he understood however  he never failed me  agathas eyes grew misty and she turned her head away  yes she said that would make it wonderfully easier  you must forgive me said her companion  it was tactless but i didnt mean to hurt you  well one difficulty shouldnt give us very much trouble  why shouldnt you stay here with me  agatha turned towards her abruptly with a relief in her face from which it however faded again  she liked this woman and she liked her husband but she remembered that she had no claim on them  oh she said it is out of the question  wait a little  im proposing to give you quite as much as you will probably care to do  there are my two little girls to teach and i think they have rather taken to you  i can scarcely find a minute to do it myself and as you have seen there is a piano which has after all only a few of the notes broken  besides we have only one scandinavian maid who smashes everything that isnt made of indurated fibre and im afraid shell marry one of the boys in a month or two it was only by sending the kiddies to brandon and getting mrs creighton a neighbour of ours to look after allen who insisted on me going that i was able to get to paris with some montreal friends  in any case youd have no end of duties  you are doing this out ofcharity  mrs hastings laughed  allen wrote some friends of his in winnipeg to send me anybody out a week or two ago  the girls eyes shone mistily  oh she said you have lifted one weight off my mind  i think said mrs hastings the others will also be removed in due time  then she talked cheerfully of other matters and agatha listened to her with a vague wonder which was however not altogether justified at her good fortune in falling in with such a friend for there are in that country a good many men and women who resemble this farmers wife in one respect  unfettered by conventions they stretch out an open hand to the stranger and the outcast  toil has brought them charity in place of hardness and still retaining as some of them do the culture of the cities they have outgrown all the petty bonds of caste  the wheatgrower and the hired man eat together his wife or daughter mends the latters clothes and he as the natural result of it not infrequently makes the farmers cause his own  rights are goodhumouredly conceded in place of being fought for and the sense of grievance and halfveiled suspicion are exchanged for an efficient cooperation  it must however be admitted that there are also farmers of another kind from whom the hired man has occasionally some difficulty in extracting his covenanted wages by personal violence that too fails now and then  by and bye a team and a jolting waggon swept into sight and mrs hastings rose when the man who drove it pulled his horses up  its sproatly i wonder what has brought him here she said and as the man who sprang down walked towards the house she gazed at him almost incredulously  hes quite smart she added  i dont see a single patch on that jacket and he has positively got his hair cut  is that an unusual thing in mr sproatlys case agatha asked  yes said mrs hastings  its very unusual indeed  what is stranger still he has taken the old greasespotted band off his hat after clinging to it affectionately for the last twelve months  agatha fancied that the soft hat which fell shapelessly over part of sproatlys face needed something to replace the discarded band but in another moment or two he entered the room  he shook hands with them both and then sat down and smiled  you are looking remarkably fresh but appearances are not invariably to be depended on and its advisable to keep the system up to par he said  i suppose you dont want a tonic of any kind  i dont said mrs hastings resolutely allen doesnt either besides didnt you get into some trouble over that tonic  it was the cough cure said sproatly with a grin  i sold a man at landers one of the largesized bottles and when he had taken some he felt a good deal better  then he seems to have argued the thing out like this if one dose had relieved the cough a dozen should drive it out of him altogether and he took the lot  he slept for fortyeight hours afterwards and when i came across him at the settlement he attacked me with a club  the fault i may point out was in his logic perhaps you would like some pictures  ive a rather striking oleograph of the deutcher kaiser  it must be like him for two of his subjects recognised it  one hung it up in his shanty  the other asked me to hold it out and then pitched a stove billet through the middle of it he however produced his dollar said he felt so much better after what hed done that he didnt grudge it  im afraid were not worth powder and shot said mrs hastings  do you ever remember our buying any tonics or pictures from you  i dont though i have felt that you ought to have done it and sproatly who paused a moment turned towards agatha with a little whimsical inclination  the professional badinage of an unlicensed dealer in patent medicines may now and then mercifully cover a good deal of embarrassment  miss ismay has brought something pleasantly characteristic of the old country along with her  his hostess disregarded the last remark  then if you didnt expect to sell us anything what did you come for  for supper said sproatly cheerfully  besides that to take miss rawlinson a drive  i told her last night it would afford me considerable pleasure to show her the prairie  we could go round by landers and back  then you will probably come across her somewhere about the strawpile with the kiddies  sproatly took the hint and when he went out mrs hastings laughed  you would hardly suppose that was a young man of excellent education she said  so its on winifreds account he has driven over at first i fancied it was on yours  agatha was astonished but she smiled  if winifred favours him with her views about young men he will probably be rather sorry for himself he lives near you  no said mrs hastings in the summer he lives in his waggon or under it i dont know which  of course if hes really taken with winifred he will have to alter that  but he has only seen her onceyou cant mean that he is serious  i really cant speak for sproatly but it would be quite in keeping with the customs of the country if he was  a minute or two later agatha saw winifred in the waggon when it reappeared from behind the strawpile and mrs hastings turned towards the window  she has gone with him she said significantly  unfortunately he has taken my kiddies too  if he brings them back with no bones broken it will be a relief to me     chapter xii  wanderers  agatha had spent a month with mrs hastings when the latter who was driving over to wyllards homestead with her one afternoon pulled up her team while they were still some little distance away from it and looked about her with evident interest  on the one hand a vast breadth of tornup loam ran back across the prairie which was now faintly flecked with green  on the other ploughing teams were scattered here and there across the tussocky sod and long lines of clods that flashed where the sunlight struck their facets trailed out behind them  the great sweep of grasses that rustled joyously before a glorious warm wind gleamed almost luminous and overhead hung a vault of blue without a cloud in it  trailing out across it skeins and wisps of birds moved up from the south  harry is sowing a very big crop this year and most of it on fall backset she said  he has however horses enough to do that kind of thing and of course he does it thoroughly  then she glanced towards where the teams were hauling unusually heavy ploughs through the grassy sod  this is virgin prairie that hes breaking and hell probably put oats on it  they ripen quicker  he ought to be a rich man after harvest unless the frost comes or the market goes against him  some of his neighbours including my husband would have sown a little less and held a reserve in hand  agatha remembered what wyllard had told her one night on board the scarrowmania and smiled for she fancied that she understood the man  he was not one to hedge as she had heard it called or cautiously hold his hand  he staked boldly but she felt that this was not only for the sake of the dollars that he might stand to gain  it was part of his naturethe result of an optimistic faith or courage that appealed to her and sheer love of effort  she also fancied that his was no spasmodic impulsive activity  she could imagine him holding on as steadfastly with everything against him exacting all that men and teams and machines could do  it struck her as curious that she should feel so sure of this but she admitted that it was the case  in the meanwhile he was approaching them sitting in the drivingseat of a big machine that ripped broad furrows through the crackling sod four horses plodded wearily in front of it until he thrust one hand over and there was a rattle and clanking as he swung them and the machine round beside the waggon  then he got down and stood smiling up at agatha with his soft hat in his hand and the sunlight falling full upon his weatherdarkened face  it was not a particularly striking face but there was something in it a hint of restrained force and steadfastness she thought which gregorys did not possess and for a moment or two she watched him unobtrusively  she felt she could not help it  he wore an old blue shirt open at the throat and belted into trousers of blue duck at the waist and she noticed the fine symmetry of his somewhat spare figure  the absence of any superfluous fleshiness struck her as in keeping with her view of his character  the man was wellendued physically but apart from the strong vitality that was expressed in every line of his pose he looked clean as she vaguely described it to herself  there was at least an indefinable something about him that was apparently born of a simple healthful life spent in determined labour in the open air  it became plainer as she remembered other men she had met upon whom the mark of the beast was unmistakably set  then mrs hastings broke the silence  well she said we have driven over as we promised  ive no doubt you will give us supper but well go on and sit down with mrs nansen in the meanwhile  i expect youre too busy to talk to us  illustration well she said we have driven over as we promised  wyllard laughed and it occurred to agatha that his laugh was wholesome as well as pleasant  i generally am busy he admitted  these beasts have however been at it since sunup and theyre rather played out now  ill talk to you as long as you like after supper which will soon be ready  its bad economy to ask too much from them  agatha noticed that though the near horses coat was foul with dust and sweat he laid his brown hand upon it and she supposed she must be fanciful for it seemed to her that the gentleness with which he did it was very suggestive  i wonder if thats the only reason that influences you she said  a twinkle crept into wyllards eyes  it seems to me a good one as far as it goes anyway ive been driven rather hard myself now and then and i didnt like it  doesnt that usually result in making one drive somebody else harder to make up for it when one has the opportunity  if it does it certainly isnt logical  logics rather a fine thing when its sound  then mrs hastings broke in ill suggest a proposition whats to be the result of all this ploughing if we have harvest frost or the market goes against you  quite a big deficit said wyllard cheerfully  and that doesnt cause you any anxiety  ill have had some amusement for my money  mrs hastings turned to agatha  he calls working from sunrise until its dark and afterwards now and then amusement  then she looked back at wyllard  i believe it isnt quite easy for you to hold your back as straight as you are doing and that offhorse certainly looks as if it wanted to lie down  wyllard laughed  it wont until after supper anyway  there are two more rows of furrows still to do  i suppose that is a hint and mrs hastings glanced at agatha when the waggon jolted on  that man she said is a great favourite of mine  for one thing hes fastidious though hes fortunately very far from perfect in some respects  he has a redhot temper which now and then runs away with him  what do you mean by fastidious  its a little difficult to define but i certainly dont mean pernicketty  of course there is a fastidiousness which makes one shrink from unpleasant things but harrys is the other kind  it impels him to do them every now and then  agatha made no answer  she was uneasily conscious that it might not be advisable to think too much about this man and in another minute or two they reached the homestead  the house was a plain frame building that had apparently grown out of an older and smaller one of logs part of which remained  it was much the same with the barns and stables for while they were stoutly built of framed timber or logs one end of most of them was lower than the rest and in some cases consisted of poles and sods  even to her untrained eyes all she saw suggested order neatness and efficiency  the whole was flanked and sheltered by a big birch bluff in which trunks and branches showed up through a thin green haze of tiny opening leaves though here and there uncovered twigs still cut in lacelike tracery against the blue of the sky  a man whom wyllard had sent after them took the horses and when she got down agatha commented on what she called the addedto look of the buildings  the range said mrs hastings has grown rapidly since harry took hold  the old part represents the highwater mark of his fathers efforts  of course she added reflectively harry has had command of some capital since a relative of his died but i never thought that explained everything  then they entered the house and a greyhaired swedish woman led them through several matchboarded rooms into a big cool hall  she left them there for awhile and agatha was busy for a minute or two with her impressions of the house  it was singularly empty by comparison with the few english homesteads she had seen  there were neither curtains nor carpets nor hangings of any kind but it was commodious and comfortable  what can a bachelor want with a place like this she asked  i dont know said mrs hastings perhaps its harrys idea of having every thing proportionate  the range is quite a big and generally a prosperous farm  besides its likely that he doesnt contemplate remaining a bachelor for ever  indeed allen and i sometimes wonder how he has escaped so long  is that the right word agatha asked  it is said her companion with a laugh  you see hes highly eligible from our point of view but at the same time hes apparently invulnerable  i believe she added drily thats the right word too  then the swedish housekeeper appeared again and they talked with her until she retired to bring the six oclock supper  soon after it was laid out wyllard and the men came in  he was attired as when agatha had last seen him except that he had evidently brushed himself and put on a store jacket  he led his guests to the head of the long table but the menand there were a number of themsat below and had evidently no diffidence about addressing question or comment to their employer  they ate with a somewhat voracious haste but that appeared to be the custom of the country and agatha could find no great fault with their manners or conversation  the latter was for the most part quaintly witty and some of them used what struck her as remarkably fitting and original similes  indeed as the meal proceeded she became curiously interested in the men and their surroundings  the windows were open wide and a sweet warm air swept into the barely furnished room  the spaciousness of the latter impressed her and she was pleased with the evident unity between these brownfaced strongarmed toilers and their leader  he sat selfcontained but courteous and responsive to all alike at the head of his table and though that is as she had discovered in most respects an essentially democratic country she felt that there was something almost feudal in the relations between him and his men  she could not imagine them being confined to the mere exaction of so much labour and the expectation of payment of wages due  she was also pleased that he had not changed his dress which would she felt have been a singularly unfitting action  in fact so strong was her interest that she was almost astonished when the meal was over though it must be admitted that most of the men rose and went out in fifteen minutes  afterwards she and mrs hastings talked with the housekeeper for awhile and an hour had slipped away when wyllard suggested that he should show her the sloo beyond the bluff  its the nearest approach to a lake we have until you get to the alkali tract he said  agatha went with him through the shadow of the wood and when at length they came out of it he found her a seat upon a fallen birch  the house and ploughing were hidden now and they were alone on the slope to a slight hollow in which half a mile of gleaming water lay  its surface was broken here and there by tussocks of grass and reeds and beyond it the prairie ran back unbroken a dim grey waste to the horizon the sun had dipped behind the bluff and the sky had become a vast green transparency  there was no wind now but a wonderful exhilarating freshness crept into the cooling air and the stillness was only broken by the clamour of startled wildfowl which presently sank again  agatha could see them paddling in clusters about the gleaming sloo  those are duckswild ones she asked  yes said wyllard duck of various kinds  most of them the same as your english ones  do you shoot them  agatha was not greatly interested but he seemed disposed to silence and she felt for no very clear reason that it was advisable to talk of something  no he said not often anyway  if mrs nansen wants a couple i crawl down to the long grass with the rifle and get them for her  the rifle  doesnt the big bullet destroy them  no said wyllard  you have to shoot their head off or cut their neck in two  you can do thatwhen theyre right out in the sloo asked agatha who had learned that it is much more difficult to shoot with a rifle than a shotgun which spreads its charge  wyllard smiled  generally that is if i havent been doing much just before  it depends upon ones hands  we have our game laws but as a rule nobody worries about them and anyway those birds wont nest until they reach the tundra by the polar sea  still as i said we never shoot them unless mrs nansen wants one or two for the pot  why  i dont quite know  for one thing theyre worn out they just stop here to rest  his answer appealed to the girl  it did not seem strange to her that the love of the lower creation should be strong in this man who had no hesitation in admitting that the game laws were no restraint to him for the most part at least when these lesser brethren sailed down out of the blue heavens worn with their journey he gave them right of sanctuary  they have come a long way she asked  wyllard pointed towards the south  from florida cuba yucatan further than that perhaps  in a day or two theyll push on again towards the pole and others will take their places  theres a further detachment arriving now  looking up agatha saw a straggling wedge of birds dotted in dusky specks against the vault of transcendental green  it coalesced drew out again and dropped swiftly and the air was filled with the rush of wings then there was a harsh crying and splashing and she heard the troubled water lap among the reeds until deep silence closed in upon the sloo again  i wonder she said why they do it  a rather curious smile crept into wyllards eyes  its their destiny theyre wanderers and strangers without a habitation theres unrest in them  after a few months on the tundra mosses to gather strength and teach the young to fly theyll unfold their wings to beat another passage before the icy gales  some of us i think are like them  agatha could not avoid the personal application  it would have appeared less admissible among her friends at the grange but she felt that the constraints of english reticence were out of place in the wilderness  you surely dont apply that to yourself she said  you certainly have a habitationthe finest isnt it on this part of the prairie  yes said wyllard slowly i suppose it is  ive now had a little rest and quietness too  this did not appear to call for an answer and agatha sat silent  still he said i have a feeling that some day the call will come and i shall have to take the trail again  he paused and looked at her before he added it would be easier if one hadnt to go alone or since that would be necessary if one had at least something to come back to when the journey was done  it would be necessary said agatha who was rather puzzled by his steady gaze  yes he said with a somewhat impressive gravity the call will come from the icy north if it ever comes at all  there was another brief silence and agatha wondered what he was thinking of until he went on again  i remember how i last came back from there  we were rather late that season and out of our usual beat when the gale broke upon us between alaska and asia in the gateway of the pole  we ran before it with a strip of the boomforesail on her and a jib that blew to ribands every now and then  she was a little schooner of ninety tons or so and for most of a week she scudded with the grey seas tumbling after her whitetopped out of the snow and spume  they ranged high above her taffrail curling horribly but one did not want to look at them  the one man on deck had a line about him and he looked ahead watching her screwing round with hoveup bows as she climbed the seas  if hed let her fall off or claw up the next one would have made an end of her he was knee deep half the time in icy brine and his hands had split and opened with the frost but the sweat dripped from him as he clung to the jarring wheel  one of those helmsmenperhaps twohad another trouble which preyed on them  they were thinking of the three men they had left behind  well he added we ran out of the gale and i had bitter words to face when we reached vancouver  as one result of it i walked out of the city with four or five dollars in my pocketthough there was a share due to me  then i rode up into the ranges in an open car to mend railroad bridges in the frost and snow  it was not the kind of homecoming one would care to look forward to  ah said agatha it must have been horribly dreary  the man met her eyes  yes he said youknow  you came here from far away i think a little weary too and something failed you  then you felt yourself adrift  there wereit seemedonly strangers round you but you were wrong in one respect you were by no means a stranger to me  he had been leaning against a birch trunk but now he moved a little nearer and stood gravely looking down on her  you have sent gregory away he said  yes said agatha and startled as she was it did not strike her that the mere admission was misleading  wyllard stretched his hands out  then wont you come to me  the blood swept into the girls face  for the moment she forgot gregory and was only conscious of an unreasoning impulse which prompted her to take the hands held out to her  then she rose and faced the man with burning cheeks  you know nothing of me she said  can you think that i would let you take meout of charity  again youre wrongon both points  as i once told you i have sat for hours beside the fire beneath the pines or among the boulders with your picture for company  when i was wornout and despondent you encouraged me  you have been with me high up in the snow on the ranges and through leagues of shadowy bush  that is not all however though its difficult to speak of such things to you  there were times when as we drove the branch line up the gorge beneath the big divide all ones physical nature shrank from the monotony of brutal labour the paydays came round and opportunities were made for usto forget what we had borne and had still to bear in the snow and the icy water  then you laid a restraining hand on me  i could not take your picture where you could not go  is all that to count for nothing  then he spread his hands out forcibly  as to the other question cant you get beyond the narrow point of view  were in a big new country where the old barriers are down  were merely flesh and bloodred bloodand we speak as we feel  admitting that i was sorry for youi amhow does that tell against meor you  theres one thing only that counts at all i want you  agatha was stirred and almost dismayed at the effect his words had on her  he had spoken with a force and passion that had nearly swept her away with it  the vigour of the new land throbbed in his voice and flinging aside all cramping restraints and conventions he had as he had said claimed her as flesh and blood  there was no doubt that her nature responded and it was significant that gregory had faded altogether out of her mind but there was after all pride in her and she could not quite bring herself to look at things from his standpoint  all her prejudices and her sense of fitness were opposed to it  for one thing he had taken the wrong way when he had admitted that he was sorry for her  she did not want his compassion and she shrank from the shadow of the thought that she would marry himfor shelter  it brought her a sudden shameful confusion as she remembered the haste with which marriages were it seemed arranged on the prairie  then as the first unreasoning impulse which had almost compelled her to yield to him passed away she remembered that it was scarcely two months since she had met him in england  it was intolerable that he should think she would be willing to fall into his arms merely because he had held them out to her  its a little difficult to get beyond ones sense of what is fit she said  youi must say it againcant know anything about me  you have woven fancies about that photograph but you must recognise that im not the girl you have it seems created out of them  in all probability shes wholly unreal unnatural visionary  she contrived to smile for she was recovering her composure  perhaps its easy when one has imagination to endow a person with qualities and graces that could never belong to them  it must be easyand though she was unconscious of it there was a trace of bitterness in her voicebecause i know i could do it myself  again the man held his hands out  then he said simply wont you try  if you can only feel sure that the person has them its possible that he could acquire one or two  agatha drew back disregarding this  then ive changed ever so much since that photograph was taken  wyllard admitted it  yes he said i recognised that you were a little immature then  i know that nowbut all the graciousness and sweetness in you has grown and ripened  what is more it has grown just as i seemed to know it would do  i saw that clearly the day we met beside the steppingstones  i would have asked you to marry me in england only gregory stood in the way  then the colour ebbed suddenly out of the girls face as she remembered  gregory she said in a strained voice stands in the way still  i didnt send him away altogether  im not sure i made that clear  wyllard started but he stood very still again for a moment or two  i wonder he said if theres anything significant in the fact that you gave me that reason last  he failed you in some way  im not sure that i havent failed him but i cant go into that  again wyllard stood silent awhile  then he turned to her with the signs of a strong restraint in his face  gregory he said is a friend of mine there is at least one very good reason why i should remember it but it seems that somehow he hadnt the wit to keep you  well i can only wait in the meanwhile but when the time seems ripe i shall ask you again  until then you have my promise that i will not say another word that could distress you  perhaps i had better take you back to mrs hastings now  agatha turned away and they walked back together silently through the bluff     chapter xiii  the summons  mrs hastings was standing beside her waggon in the gathering dusk when agatha and wyllard joined her and when the latter had helped them up she looked down at him severely as she gathered up the reins  by this time allen will have had to put the kiddies to bed she said christina as you might have borne in mind goes over to branstocks every evening  anyway youll drive across and see him about that team as soon as you can come to supper  ill try said wyllard with a certain hesitation and mrs hastings turned to her companion as they drove away  why did he look at you before he answered me she asked and laughed for there was just light enough left to show the colour in agathas cheek  well she added i told allen he was sure to be the first  agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment but she nodded  yes she said of course i knew it would come  everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with gregory  but as i told you i havent fallen out with him  then you certainly havent married him and if you have said no to harry wyllard because you would sooner take gregory after all youre a singularly unwise young woman  anyway youll have to meet him when he comes to supper  allens fond of a talk with harry i cant have him kept away  i was a little afraid of that said agatha quietly  what makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again  mrs hastings appeared thoughtful  in that case he will in all probability do it but i dont think you need feel diffident about meeting him especially as you cant help it  hell wait and say nothing until he considers it advisable  she changed the subject and talked about other matters until they reached the homestead but as the weeks went by agatha found that what she had told her was warranted  wyllard drove over every now and then but she was reassured by his attitude  he greeted her with the quiet cordiality which had hitherto characterised him and it went a long way towards allaying the embarrassment she was conscious of at first  by and bye however she felt no embarrassment at all in spite of the disturbing possibility that he might at some future time once more adopt the rôle of lover in the meanwhile she realised that in face of the efforts she made to think of him tenderly she was drifting further apart from gregory and she had as it happened two further offers of marriage before the wheat had shot up a hands breadth above the rich black loam  this was a matter of regret to her and though mrs hastings assured her that the boys would get over it she was rather shocked to hear that one of them had shortly afterwards involved himself in difficulties by creating a disturbance in winnipeg  the wheat however was growing tall when at mrs hastingss request she drove over with her again to willow range  wyllard was out when they reached it and leaving mrs hastings and his housekeeper together she wandered out into the open air  she went through the birch bluff and towards the sloo which had almost dried up now and it was with a curious stirring of confused feelings that she remembered what wyllard had said to her there  through them all there ran a regret that she had not met him four years earlier  that however was a train of thought she did not care to indulge in and in order to get rid of it she walked more briskly up a low rise where the grass was already turning white again over the crest of it and down the side of another hollow  the prairie rolled just there in wide undulations as the sea does when the swell of a distant gale underruns a glassy calm  she had grown fond of the prairie and its clear skies and fresh breezes had brought the colour to her cheeks and given her composure though there were times when the knowledge that she was no nearer a decision in regard to gregory weighed upon her like a chill depressing shadow  she had seen very little of him and he had not been effusive then  what he felt she could not tell but it had been a relief to her when he had ridden away again  then for a while he faded to an unsubstantial shadowy figure in the back of her mind  that afternoon the prairie stretched away before her gleaming in the sunlight tinder a vast sweep of cloudless blue  she was halfway down the long slope when a clash and tinkle reached her and for the first time she noticed that a cloud of dust hung about the hollow at the foot of it where there had been another sloo  it had however evidently dried up weeks ago and as there were men and horses moving amidst the dust she supposed that they were cutting prairie hay which grows longer in such places than it does upon the levels  she went on another halfmile and then sat down some distance off for she had already walked further than she had intended  she could now see the men more clearly and though it was fiercely hot they were evidently working at high pressure  their blue duck clothing and bare brown arms appeared among the white and ochre tinting of the grass that seemed charged with brightness and the sounds of their activity came up to her  she could distinguish the clashing tinkle of the mowers the crackle of the harsh stems and the rattle of waggon wheels  by and bye a great mound of gleaming grass overhanging two halfseen horses moved out of the sloo and she watched it draw nearer until she made out wyllard sitting in a depression in the front of it  she sat still until he pulled the team up close beside her and looked down with a smile  its most two miles to the homestead  if you could manage to climb up i could make you a comfortable place he said  agatha held her hands up with one foot upon a spoke of the wheel as the man leaned down and next moment she was strongly lifted and felt his supporting hand upon her waist  then she found herself standing upon a narrow ledge clutching at the hay while he tore out several big armfuls of it and flung it back upon the rest  illustration agatha held her hands up  as the man leaned down and the next moment she was strongly lifted  now he said i guess youll find that a snug enough nest  she sank into it with at least a certain sense of physical satisfaction  the grass was soft and warm scented with the aromatic odours of wild peppermint and it yielded like a downy cushion beneath her limbs  still she was just a little uneasy in mind for she fancied she had seen a sudden sign of tension in the mans face when he had for a moment held her on the edge of the waggon  unobtrusively she flashed a glance at him and was reassured  he was looking straight before him with unwavering eyes and his face was as quiet as it usually was again  neither of them said anything until the team moved on  then he turned to her  you wont get jolted much he said  theyve been at it since four oclock this morning  that said agatha must have meant that you rose at three  wyllard smiled  as a matter of fact it was halfpast two  there was no dew last night and we started early  ive several extra teams this year and theres a good deal of hay to cut  of course we have to get it in the sloos or any damp place where its long  we dont sow grass and we have no meadows like those there are in england  agatha understood that he meant to talk about matters of no particular consequence as he usually did  there was as she had noticed a vein of almost poetic imagination in this man and his idea that she had been with him through the snow of the lonely ranges and the gloom of the great forests of the pacific slope appealed to her merely as a pretty fancy in particular  he had however of late very seldom given it rein and sitting close beside him among the yielding hay she decided that it was wiser to let him talk about his farm  but you have a foreman who could see the teams turned out havent you she said  i had but he left me three or four days ago  its a pity in several ways since ive taken up rather more than i can handle this year  then why didnt you keep him  there was a certain grimness in wyllards laugh  martial was a little muleish and im afraid im troubled with a shortness of temper now and then  we had a difference of opinion as to the best way to drive the mower into the sloo and he didnt seem to recognise that he should have deferred to me  unfortunately as the boys were standing by i had to insist upon him getting out of the saddle  he had turned a little further towards her and agatha noticed that there was a bruise upon one side of his face  after what he had just told her the sight of it jarred upon her though she would not admit that there was any reason why it should do so  she could not deny that on the prairie a resort to physical force might be warranted by the lack of any other remedy but it hurt her to think of him descending to an open brawl with one of his men  then it occurred to her that the other man had in all probability suffered more and this brought her a certain sense of satisfaction which she admitted was more or less barbarous  she had made it clear that wyllard was nothing to her but she could not help watching him as he lay among the hay  his wide hat set off his bronzed face which though not exactly handsome was pleasant and reassuringshe felt that was the best wordto look at  the dusty shirt and old blue trousers as she had already noticed accentuated the long clean lines of his figure and she realised with a faint sense of anger that his mere physical perfection his strength and suppleness appealed to her this was she recognised an almost repugnant thing a feeling to be judiciously checked but it would obtrude itself  after all in spite of her fastidiousness she was endued with most of the characteristics of flesh and blood  you must have a good deal to look after alone she said  oh yes said wyllard im making my biggest effort this year  weve sown at least a third more than ive ever done before and ive bought a big bunch of horses too  if all goes satisfactorily we should reap a record harvest but in the meanwhile the things rather a pull  one cant let up a minute theres always something to be done and a constant need for supervision  suppose you neglected the latter  wyllard smiled  then im most afraid thered be the biggest kind of smash  after that they talked of other matters of no great consequence for both of them were conscious of the necessity for a certain reticence and when they reached the homestead agatha joined mrs hastings while wyllard pitched the hay off the waggon  he however came in to supper presently with about half of the others and they all sat down together in the long barely furnished room  wyllard seemed unusually animated and drew mrs hastings into a bout of whimsical badinage but he looked up sharply when by and bye a beat of hoofs rose from the prairie  somebodys riding in i wonder what he wants he said  i certainly dont expect anybody  the drumming of hoofs rang more sharply through the open windows for the sod was hard and dry  then it broke off and agatha saw wyllard start as a man came into the room  he was a little thickset man with a weatherdarkened face dressed in rather old blue serge and he looked and walked like a seaman  in another moment or two he stood still looking about him and wyllards lips set tight  a little thrill of disconcertion ran through agatha for she felt she knew what this strangers errand must be  then wyllard rose and walked towards the man with outstretched hand  sit right down and get some supper  youll want it if you have ridden in from the railroad he said  well talk afterwards  the stranger nodded  im from vancouver he said had quite a lot of trouble tracing you  he sat down and wyllard who sent a man out to take his horse went back to his seat but he was rather silent during the rest of the meal when it was over he asked mrs hastings to excuse him and leading the stranger into a smaller room pulled out two chairs and laid a cigar box on the table  now you can get ahead he said  the seaman fumbled in his pocket and taking out a slip of wood handed it to his companion  thats what i came to bring you he said quietly  wyllards eyes grew very grave as he gazed at the thing  it was a slip of willow which will grow close up to the limits of the eternal ice and it bore a rude representation of the british ensign union down which signifies in distress  besides this there were one or two indecipherable words scratched on it and three common names rather more clearly cut  wyllard recognised every one of them  how did you get it he asked in tense suspense  the sailorman once more felt in his pocket and took out a piece of paper cut from a chart  he flattened it out on the table and it showed as wyllard had expected a strip of the kamtchatkan coast  i guess i neednt tell you where that is he said and pointed to the parallel of latitude that ran across it  dunton gave it me  he was up there late last season well over on the western side  a northeasterly gale fell on them and took most of the foremast out of her  i understand they tried to lash on a boom or something as a jury mast but it hadnt height enough to set much forward canvas and that being the case she wouldnt bear more than a threereefed mainsail anyway they couldnt do anything with her on the wind and as it kept heading them from the east she sidled away down south through the kuriles into the yellow sea  they got icebound somewhere which explains why dunton only fetched vancouver a week ago  illustration i guess i neednt tell you where that is he said and pointed to the parallel of latitude that ran across  but the message  when they were in the thick of their troubles they hove her to not far off the beach with ice about and a husky came down on them in some kind of boat  a husky said wyllard who knew he meant an esquimaux  thats what dunton called him but i guess he must have been a kamtchadale or a koriak  anyway he brought this strip of willow and he had tom lewsons watch  dunton traded him something for it  they couldnt make much of what he said except that hed got the message from three white men somewhere along the beach  they couldnt make out how long ago  dunton tried for them  how could he  shed hardly look at the wind and the ice was piling up on the coast close to lee of him  he hung on a week or two with the floes driving in all the while and then it freshened hard and blew him out  he had told his story and wyllard who rose stood leaning on his chairback very grim in face  that he said must have been eight or nine months ago  it was  theyve been up there since the night we couldnt pick up the boat  its unthinkable said wyllard  the thing cant be true  his companion gravely produced a little common metal watch made in connecticut and worth some five or six dollars  opening it he pointed to a name scratched inside it  you cant get over that he said simply  wyllard strode up and down the room and when he sat down again with a clenched hand laid upon the table he and the sailorman looked at each other steadily for a moment or two  then the stranger made a little gesture  you sent them he said what are you going to do  im going for them  the sailorman smiled  i knew it would be that  youll have to start right away if its to be done this year  ive my eye upon a schooner  he lighted a cigar and settled himself more comfortably in his chair well he said im coming with you but youll have to buy my ticket to vancouver  it cleaned me out to get here  wed a difficulty with a blame gunboat last season and the boss went back on me  sealings not what it used to be  anyway we can fix the thing up later  i wont keep you from your friends  wyllard went out and left him and though he did not see mrs hastings just then he came upon agatha sitting outside the house  she glanced at his face when he sat down beside her  ah she said you have had the summons  wyllard nodded  yes he said that man was the skipper of a schooner i once sailed in  he has come to tell me where those three men are  then he told her quietly what he had heard and the girl was conscious of a very curious thrill  you are going up there to search for them she said  wont it cost you a great deal  she saw his face harden as he gazed at the tall wheat but his expression was very resolute  yes he admitted thats a sure thing  most of my dollars are locked up in this crop and theres need of constant watchfulness and effort until the last bushels hauled in to the elevators  it probably sounds egotistical but now ive got rid of martial i cant put my hand on any one as fit to see the thing through as i am  still i have to go for them  what else could i do  wouldnt the provincial government of british columbia or your authorities at ottawa take the matter up  wyllards smile was somewhat grim  it wouldnt be wise to give them an opportunity  for one thing theyve had enough of sealing cases and that isnt astonishing  well say they applied for the persons of three british subjects who are supposed to be living somewhere in russian asiaand for that matter i couldnt be sure that two of them arent americansthe russians naturally enquire what the men were doing there  the answer is that they were poaching the russians seals  then the affair on the beach comes up and theres a big claim for compensation and trouble all round  it seems to me the last thing those mentheyre practically outlawswould desire would be to have a russian expedition sent up on their trail  they would want to lie hidden until they could somehow get off again  but how have they lived up there  the whole lands frozen isnt it most of the year  theyd sealing rifles and the koriaks make out farther north in their roofedin pits  one can live on seal and walrus meat and blubber  agatha shivered  but theyd no tents or furs or blankets  its horrible to imagine it  yes said wyllard gravely thats why im going for them  agatha sat still a moment  she could realise the magnitude of the sacrifice he was making and in some degree the hazards that he must face  it appealed to her with an overwhelming force but she was also conscious of a strange dismay  then she turned to him with a flush of colour in her cheeks and her eyes shining  oh she said its splendid  wyllard smiled  what could i do he said i sent them  then somewhat to agathas relief mrs hastings came out of the house and wyllard moved away towards the stable to bring out her team     chapter xiv  agatha proves obdurate  it was two days later when agatha coming back from a stroll across the prairie with the two little girls found mrs hastings awaiting her at the homestead door  ill take the kiddies  harry wyllards here and he seems quite anxious to see you though i dont know what he wants she said  she flashed a searching glance at the girl whose face however remained expressionless  it was at least not often that agathas composure broke down  anyway she added you had better go in  allen has been arguing with him the last halfhour and cant get any sense into him  it seems to me the mans crazy but he might perhaps listen to you  i think thats scarcely likely said agatha quietly  her companion made a sign of impatience  then she said its a pity  anyway if he speaks to you about his project you can tell him that its altogether unreasonable  she drew aside and agatha walked into the room in which she had had one painful interview with gregory  wyllard who was sitting there rose as she came in and halfconsciously she contrasted him with her lover  then what mrs hastings had once predicted came about for gregory did not bear that comparison favourably  indeed it seemed to her that he grew coarser and meaner in person and character  then she turned to wyllard who stood quietly watching her  nellie hastings or her husband has been telling you what they think of my idea he said  agatha admitted it  yes she said  their opinion evidently hasnt much weight with you  i wouldnt go quite so far as that but you might have gone a little further than you did  havent you a message for me  then he smiled before he added you were sent to denounce my follyand you cant do it  if you trusted your own impulses you would give me your benediction instead  agatha who was troubled with a sense of regret noticed that there was a suggestive wistfulness in his face  no she said slowly i cant denounce it  for one reason i have no right of any kind to force my views on you  you told nellie hastings that  it seemed an unwarranted question but the girl admitted it candidly  in one sense i did  i suggested that there was no reason why you should listen to me  wyllard smiled again  nellie and her husband are good friends of mine but sometimes our friends are a little too officious  anyway it doesnt count  if you had had that right you would have told me to go  agatha felt the warm blood rise to her cheeks  it seemed to her that he had paid her a great and sincere compliment in taking it for granted that if she had loved him she would still have bidden him undertake his perilous duty  ah she said i dont know  perhaps i should not have been brave enough  it was not a judicious answer  she quite realised that but she felt that she must speak with unhesitating candour  after all she added can you be quite sure that this thing is your duty  the man laughed in a rather grim fashion  no he said i cant  in fact when i sit down to think i can see at least a dozen reasons why it doesnt concern me  in a case of this kind thats always easy its just borne in upon mei dont know howthat i have to go  agatha crossed to the window and sat down  she knew there was more to follow and it seemed advisable to secure whatever there might be in her favour in a pose of physical ease  besides where she stood the glare of light flung back by the white and dusty grass outside struck full upon her face and she did not want the man to read every varying expression  he leaned upon a chairback looking at her gravely  well he said well go on a little further  it seems better that i should make whats in my mind quite clear to you  you see i and captain dampier start in a week  agatha was certainly conscious of a thrill of dismay but the man proceeded quietly  we may be back before the winter but its also quite likely that we may be icenipped before our work is through and in that case it would be a year at least before we reach vancouver  in fact theres a certain probability that all of us may leave our bones up there  now theres a thing i must ask you  is it only a passing trouble that stands between you and gregory  are you still fond of him  the girl felt her heart beating unpleasantly fast  it would have been a relief to assure herself that she was as fond of gregory as she had been but she could not do it  that she said is a point on which i cannot answer you  well let it go at that  the fact that gregory sent me over for you implied a certain obligation  how far events have cleared me of it i dont knowand you dont seem willing to tell me  but i fancy there is now less cause than there was for me to thrust my own wishes into the background and as i start in another week the situation has forced my hand  i cant wait as i had meant to do and it would be a vast relief to know that i had made your future safer than it is before i go  will you marry me at the settlement the morning i start  halfconscious as she was of the unselfishness which had prompted this suggestion agatha turned and faced him in hot anger  can you suppose for a moment that i would agree to that she asked  wait said the man gravely  try to look at it quietly  first of all i want you  you know thatthough you have never shown me any tenderness you cant doubt itbut i cant stay to win your liking  i must go away  then as things stand your future is uncertain and as my wife it would at least be safer  however badly the man i leave in charge of the range may manage there would be something saved out of the wreck and i would like to make that something yours  as i said i may be away a year perhaps eighteen months and i may never come back if i dont the fact that you would bear my name could cause you no great trouble  it would lay no restraint on you in any way  agatha looked him steadily in the eyes and spoke as she felt  we cant contemplate your not coming back  its unthinkable  thank you said wyllard still with the grave quietness she wondered at  then im not sure that my turning up again would greatly complicate the thing  there would at least be one way out of the difficulty  you wouldnt find the situation intolerable if i could make you fond of me  the girl broke into a little highstrung laugh that had a tinge of bitterness in it  oh she said arent you taking too much for granted  am i really to believe you are making this fantastic offer seriously  do you suppose i would marry youfor your possessions  it sounds bloodless  perhaps it is in one way but you wouldnt always find me that  just now because my hand is forced i am only anticipating things  if i live you will some day have to choose between me and gregory  in this case he must hold his own if he can  against what you have offered me  she flung the question at him  he looked at her with his face set and the signs of restraint very plain on it  i expect i deserved that  i wanted to make you safe  its the most pressing difficulty  the bitterness was still in the girls eyes  so far as i am concerned you seem to believe it is the only one then her anger seemed to carry her away  oh she said do you imagine that an offer of the kind you have made me made as you have made it would lead anyone to love you  wyllard smiled  when i first saw your picture and when i saw you afterwards i loved your gracious quietness  now you seem to have got rid of it i love you better as you are  there is however one thing i must ask again and its your clear duty to tell me  are you fonder of gregory than you feel you ever could be of me  agathas eyes fell  she felt she could not look at him just then nor could she answer his question honestly as she almost wished to  at least i am bound to him until he releases me  ah said wyllard that is what i was most afraid of  all along it hampered me and in it you have the reason for my bloodlessness  it is another reason why i should go away  for fear that you should tempt me from my duty  the mans expression changed and there crept into his eyes a gleam of the passion that she knew he was capable of  my dear he said i seem to know that i could make you break faith with that man  you belong to me  for three years you have been everywhere with me but we will let that go  i must go away and gregory will have a clear field but the probability is in favour of me coming back again and then if he has failed to make the most of it ill enforce my claim  he turned and seized one of her hands holding it strongly against her will  that is my last word  at least you will let me think that when i go up yonder into the mists and snow i shall take your good wishes for my success away with me  she lifted her face which was flushed and once more looked him steadily in the eyes  they are yours most fervently she said  it would be intolerable that you should fail  he smiled very gravely and let her hand fall  after all he said one can only do what one can  then he went out without another glance at her and not long afterwards mrs hastings who was endued with a reasonable measure of curiosity found occasion to enter the room  you have said something to trouble harry she began  agatha contrived to smile  im not sure hes greatly troubled  in any case i told him i would not marry himfor the second time  he has given up his crazy notion thee  he never suggested doing that  mrs hastings made a little sign of compassionate astonishment  oh she said hes mad  i believe i told him he was bloodless  at least that was how he interpreted what i said  mrs hastings laughed  harry wyllard bloodless  my dear cant you see that the restraint he now and then practises is the sign of a tremendous vitality  still the mans mad  did he tell you that he means to leave gregory in charge of willow range  agatha was certainly astonished at this but mrs hastings nodded its a fact she said  he asked him to meet him here to save time andshe turned towards the windowtheres his waggon now  she moved towards the door and then turned again  is there any bloodred blood we will call itor even commonsense in you  you could have kept that man here if you had wanted  no said agatha i dont think i could  im not even sure that if id had the right i would have done it  he recognised that  mrs hastings looked at her very curiously  then she said you have either a somewhat extraordinary character or are in love with him in a way that is beyond most of us  in any case i cant help feeling that you will be sorry for what you have done some day  next moment the door closed with a bang and agatha was left alone endeavouring to analyse her sensations during her interview with wyllard which was difficult for they had been confused and fragmentary  she had certainly been angry with him but the cause for this was much less apparent though there were one or two halfsufficient explanations  for one thing it was almost intolerable to feel that he had evidently taken it for granted that the greater security she would enjoy as his wife would appeal to her though there was a certain satisfaction in the reflection that to leave her dependent upon mrs hastings caused him concern  for another thing his reserve had been at least perplexing and it was borne in upon her that it would have cost her a more determined effort to withstand him had he spoken with fire and passion  the restraint however had been evident and he could not have practised it unless there had been something to hold in check and then it became apparent that it was more important to ascertain his motives than her own  if the man had been fervently in love with her why had he not insisted on that fact she asked  could it have been because he had with the fantastic generosity which he was evidently capable of been willing to leave his comrade unhandicapped with an open field  that however seemed too much to expect from any man  then there was the other explanation that he preferred to leave the choice wholly to her lest he should tempt her too strongly to break faith with gregory which brought the blood to her face as it had done already since it suggested that he fancied he had only to urge her sufficiently and she would yield  there was it seemed no satisfactory explanation at all only the fact remained that he had made her a somewhat dispassionate offer of marriage and had left her to decide which she had done  as it happened wyllard could not just then at least have made the matter very much clearer  shrewdly practical as he was in some respects there were times when he acted blindly merely doing without reasoning what he subconsciously felt was right  this had more than once involved him in disaster but it is perhaps fortunate that there are others like him for after all in the long run the failures of such men now and then prove better than the dictates of calculating wisdom  in any case agatha found a momentary relief from her thoughts as she watched hawtrey get down from his waggon and approach the house  the change in him was plainer than it had ever been which may have been because she had now a standard of comparison  he was tall and wellfavoured and he moved with a jaunty and yet not ungraceful swing but it almost seemed to her that this was merely the result of an empty selfsufficiency  there was she felt no force behind it which when the strain came would prove that jaunty bearing warranted  he was smiling and for some reason his smile appeared a trifle inane while there was certainly a hint of sensuousness in his face  it suggested that the man might sink into selfindulgent coarseness  she however remembered that she was still pledged to him and determinedly brushed these thoughts aside until she heard his footsteps inside the house when she became possessed of a burning curiosity as to what wyllard had to say to him which however remained unsatisfied  in the meanwhile hawtrey entered a room where wyllard sat awaiting him with a paper in his hand  i asked you to drive over here because it would save time he said i have to go in to the railroad at once  heres a draft of the scheme i suggested  you had better tell me if theres anything youre not quite satisfied with  he threw the paper on the table and hawtrey who took it up perused it  im to farm and generally manage the range on your behalf he said my percentage to be deducted after harvest  im empowered to sell out grain or horses as appears advisable and to have the use of teams and implements for my own place when occasion requires it  he looked up  ive no fault to find with the thing harry  its generous  then you had better sign it and well get hastings to witness it in a minute or two  in the meanwhile theres a thing i have to ask you how do you stand in regard to miss ismay  hawtrey pushed his chair back noisily  that he said is a subject on which im naturally not disposed to give you any information  how does it concern you  in this way  believing that your engagement must be broken off i asked miss ismay to marry me  hawtrey was clearly startled but in a moment or two he smiled  of course he said she wouldnt  as a matter of fact our engagement isnt broken off  its merely extended  they looked at each other in silence for a moment or two and there was a curious hardness in wyllards eyes  then hawtrey spoke again  in view of what you have just told me why did you want to put me of all people in charge of the range he said  ill be candid said wyllard  for one thing you held on when i was slipping off the trestle that day in british columbia  for another youll make nothing of your own holding and if you run the range as it ought to be run it will put a good many dollars into your pocket besides relieving me of a big anxiety  if youre to marry miss ismay id sooner she was made reasonably comfortable  hawtrey looked up with a flush in his face  harry he said this is extravagantly generous  wait said wyllard theres a little more to be said  i cant be back before the frost and i may be away eighteen months  while i am away you will have a clear fieldand you must make the most of it  if you are not married when i come back i shall ask miss ismay again nowand he glanced at his comrade steadilydoes this stand in the way of your going on with the arrangement we have arrived at  there was a rather tense silence for a moment or two and then hawtrey broke it  no he said after all there is no reason why it should do so  it has no practical bearing upon the other question  wyllard rose  well he said if you will call allen hastings in well get this thing fixed up  the document was duly signed and a few minutes later wyllard drove away but mrs hastings contrived to have a few words with hawtrey before he did the same  ive no doubt that harry took you into his confidence on a certain point she said  yes admitted hawtrey he did  i was a little astonished besides feeling rather sorry for him  there is however reason to believe that hell soon get over it  you feel sure of that and mrs hastings smiled  isnt it evident  if he had cared much about her he certainly wouldnt have gone away  you mean you wouldnt  no said hawtrey theres no doubt of that  his companion smiled again  well she said drily i would like to think you were right about harry it would be a relief to me  hawtrey who said nothing further presently drove away and soon after he did so agatha approached mrs hastings  theres something i must ask you she said  has gregory consented to take charge of wyllards farm  he has said her companion in her dryest tone  agathas face flushed and there was a flash in her eyes  oh she said its almost insufferable  then she turned and left mrs hastings without another word  she only saw wyllard once again and that was when he called at the homestead early one morning  he got down from the waggon where dampier sat and shook hands with her and allen and mrs hastings  very few words were spoken and she could not remember what she said but when he swung himself up again and the waggon jolted away into the white prairie she went back to the house with her heart beating unpleasantly fast and a very curious feeling of depression     chapter xv  the beach  for a fortnight after they reached vancouver wyllard and dampier were very busy  they had various difficulties to contend with for while they would have preferred to slip away to sea as quietly as possible a british vessels movements are fenced about with many formalities and they did not wish to ship a white man who could be dispensed with wyllard fancied there were sailormen and sealers in vancouver and down puget sound who would have gone with him but there was a certain probability of their discussing their exploits afterwards in the saloons ashore which was about the last thing that he desired  it appeared essential that he should avoid notoriety as much as possible  he had further trouble about obtaining provisions and general necessaries for considerably more attention than the freelance sealers cared about was being bestowed upon the north just then and he did not desire to rouse the curiosity of the dealers as to why he was filling his lazaret up with arctic stores  he obviated that difficulty by dividing his orders among the whole of them and buying as little as possible  dampier however proved an adept at the difficult business and eventually the schooner selache crept out from the narrows at dusk one evening under all plain sail painted a pale green with her big mainboom raking at least a fathom beyond her taffrail  there were then wyllard dampier and two other white men on board her  a week later she sailed into a deep rockwalled inlet on the western coast of vancouver island with a settlement at the top of it where the storekeeper made no difficulty about selling wyllard all his flour and canned goods at higher figures than there was any probability of his obtaining from the local ranchers  then the selache slid down the inlet again and lay for several days in a forestshrouded arm near the mouth of it while when she once more dropped her anchor off a siwash rancherie far up on the wild west coast she was painted a dingy grey and her sawnoff boom just topped her stern  one does not want a great mainboom in the northern seas and a big mainsail needs men to handle it  wyllard however shipped several seabred indians who had made wonderful perilous voyages on the trail of the seal and halibut in open canoes  all of them had as it happened also sailed in sealing schooners  their comrades sold him furs and filled part of the hold up with redwood billets and bark for the stove for he had not considered it advisable to load too much wellington coal  then he pushed out into the waste pacific and when once a beautiful big white mail boat reeled by him driving with streaming bows into an easterly gale he sent back a message to his friends upon the prairie  it duly reached them for some three weeks afterwards allen hastings opening the colonist which he had ordered from victoria as soon as wyllard sailed read out to his wife and agatha a paragraph in the shipping news  empress of india from yokohama reports having passed small grey british schooner flying  there followed several code letters the latitude and longitude and a line apparently by the waterfront reporter no schooner belonging to this city allotted the signal in question  hastings smiled as he laid down the paper  no he said that signals wyllards private code  agatha wont you reach me down my map of the pacific  its just behind you  then he looked round and noticed the significant smile in his wifes eyes for the girl had already turned towards the shelf where he kept the lately purchased map  the easterly gale however did not last for the wind came out of the west and north and sank to foggy calms when it did not blow wickedly hard  this meant that the selaches course was all to windward and though they drove her at it unmercifully under reefed boomforesail main trysail and a streaming jib or two with the brine going over her solid forward she had made little when each arduous day was done they were drenched to the skin continuously and lashed by stinging spray  cooking except of the crudest kind was out of the question and sleep would have been impossible to any but wornout sailormen  even then they were often roused in the blackness of the night when she lay with her lee rail under and would not lift it out to get another reef in or crawl out on plunging bowsprit washed by icy seas to haul a burst jib down  it was even more trying glad as they were of the respite in some respects to lie rolling wildly on the big smooth undulations that hove out of the windless calm while everything in her banged to and fro and when the breeze came screaming through the fog or rain they sprang to make sail again  fate seemed dead against them as it was certain that if their purpose was suspected the hand of every white man they might come across would be but they held on over leagues of empty ocean while the season wore away until once more the wind freshened easterly and they ran for a week under boomforesail and a jib with the big grey combers curling as they foamed by high above her rail  then the wind fell and dampier who got an observation armed his deepsea lead and finding shells and shoal water came aft to talk to wyllard with the strip of duntons chart  wyllard who was clad in oilskins stood a shapeless figure by the wheel with his face darkened and roughened by cold and stinging brine there was an open sore upon one of his elbows and both his wrists were raw  forward a white man and two siwash were standing about the windlass and when the bows went up a dreary stretch of slategrey sea opened up beyond them beneath the dripping jibs  then the bows would go down again and all that was visible was the foreshortened slope of deck and the breast of the big undulation that hove itself up ahead the selache was carrying everything and lurching over the steep swell at some four knots an hour  dampier stopped near the wheel and glanced at wyllards oilskins  youll have to take them off  its stuffed boots and those indian sealgut things or furs from now on he said  that leather cuffs chewing up your hand  well cut that out said wyllard its not to the point  cant you get on  dampier grinned  were on soundings and they and duntons longitude most agree  with this wind we should pick the beach up in the next two days  next question is where those men were  where they are said wyllard  if theyve pushed on its probably a different thing though if theyd food yonder i dont quite see why theyd want to push on anywhere  it wouldnt be south anyway  theyd run up against the russians there  weve decided that already  im admitting it said the skipper  theres the other choice that theyve gone up north  its narrower across to alaska there and its quite likely they might have a notion of looking out for one of the steam whalers  the koriaks up yonder will have boats of some kind  if theyre skin ones like those the huskies have they might sledge them on the ice  it was a suggestion that had been made several times already but both the men realised that there was in all probability very little to warrant it  wyllard had wasted no time endeavouring to learn what was known about the desolation on the western shore of the behring sea  he had bought a schooner and set out at once  it however appeared almost impossible to him that any three men could haul the skin boats and supplies they would need far over hummocky ice  the point is that well have to fix on some course in the next few days added his companion  say we run in to make inquiriesand a gleam of grim amusement crept into his eyeswhat are we going to find  a beach with a roaring surf on it and if we get a boat through a desolate halffrozen swamp behind it  its quite likely there are people in the country koriaks or kamtchadales but if there are theyll probably move up and down after what they get to eat like the huskies do and we cant hang on and wait for them  most any time next month well have the ice closing in  wyllard said nothing for another minute and as he stood with hands clenched on the wheel a little puff of bitter spray splashed upon his oilskins  they had been over it all often before weighing conjecture after conjecture and had found nothing in any that might serve to guide them  now when winter was close at hand they had leagues of surfswept beach to search for three men who might have perished twelve months earlier  well stand in until we pick up the beach he said at length then if theres no sign of them well push north as long as we can find open water  now if youll call charly ill let up at the wheel  another white man walked aft and wyllard entering the little stern cabin the top of which rose some feet above the deck sloughed off his wet oilskins and crawled dressed as he was into his bunk  evening was closing in and for awhile he lay blinking at the swinging lamp and wondering what the end of that search would be  the selache was a little fore and aft schooner of some ninetyodd tons wholly unprotected against icechafe or nip and he knew that prudence dictated their driving her south under every rag of canvas now  there was however the possibility of finding some sheltered inlet where she could lie out the winter frozen in and he had at least blind confidence in his men  the white men were sealers who had already borne the lash of snowladen gales the wash of icy seas and tremendous labour at the oar while the indians had been born to an unending struggle with the waters  all of them had times and times again looked the king of terrors squarely in the face  what was as much to the purpose they had been promised a tempting bonus if the selache came home successful  while wyllard pondered upon these things he went to sleep and slept soundly as he did the next night though dampier expected to raise the beach some time next morning  his expectation also proved warranted and when wyllard turned out it lay before them a dingy smear on a slategreen sea that was cut off from it by a wavy line of livid whiteness which he knew to be a fringe of spouting surf  it had cost him in several ways more than he cared to contemplate to reach that beach and now there was nothing that could excite any feeling except shrinking in the dreary spectacle  there was little light in the heavy sky or on the sullen heave of sea the air was raw the schooners decks were sloppy and she rolled viciously as she crept shorewards with her mainsail peak eased down  what wind there was blew dead onshore which was not as he would have had it  he heard the splash of the lead as he and the white man charly made their breakfast in the little stern cabin  then there was a clatter of blocks and on coming out again he found the others swinging a boat over  charly and he and two of the indians dropped into her and dampier who had hove the schooner to looked down on them over her rail  if you knock the bottom out of her put a jacket on an oar and ill try to bring you off he said  if you dont signal ill stand off and on with a thimbleheader topsail over the mainsail  youll start back right away if you see us haul it down  when she wont stand that therell be more surf than youll have any use for with the wind dead on the beach  wyllard made a sign of comprehension and they slid away on the back of a long sea  others rolled up behind them cutting off the schooners hull so that only her grey canvas showed above dim slopes of water but there was no curl on any and the beach rose fast  it looked very forbidding with the sprayhaze drifting over it and the long wash of the pacific weltering among its hammered stones and when they drew a little nearer wyllard stood up with the big sculling oar in his hand there was no point to offer shelter and in only one place could he see a strip of surflapped sand  its a little softer than the boulders anyway well try it there he said  the oars dipped again and in another minute or two the sea that came up behind them hove them high and broke into a little spout of foam the next had a hissing crest part of which splashed on board and they went shorewards like a toboggan down an icy slide on the shoulders of the third  to keep her straight while it seethed about them was all that they could do but it was also essentially necessary and for a moment their hearts were in their mouths when it left them to sink with a dizzy swing into the hollow  then they pulled desperately as another whitetopped ridge came on astern and went up with it amidst a chaotic frothing and splashing and a haze of spray  after that there was a shock and a crash and they sprang out kneedeep and held fast to the boat while the foam boiled into her floundering and stumbling over sliding sand  still before the next sea came in they had run her up beyond its reach and there did not seem to be much the matter with her when they hove her over  wyllard however looked back at the tumbling surf  dampier was right about that topsail it wont be quite as easy getting off he said  youll stand by charly and watch the schooner  if the surf gets steeper you can make some sign  ill leave one of the siwash on the rise yonder  then he walked up the beach and stopped awhile on the crest of the low rise a mile or two behind it gazing out at what seemed to be an empty desolation  there were willows in the hollow beneath him and upon the slope a few little stunted trees which he fancied resembled the juniper he had seen among the ranges of british columbia but he could see no sign of any kind of life  what was more portentous the mossy sod he stood upon was frozen and there were smears of snow among the straggling firs upon a rather higher ridge  inland the little breeze seemed to have fallen dead away and there was an oppressive silence which the rumble of the surf accentuated  he left an indian on the rise and going on with the other scrambled through a halffrozen swamp in the hollow but when they came back hours afterwards as the narrow horizon was drawing further in they had found nothing to show that any man had ever entered that grim silent land  the surf seemed a little smoother and they reeled out through it with no more than a few inches of very cold water splashing about their boots and pulled across a long stretch of darkening sea towards the rolling schooner  wyllard was a little weary and more depressed but it was not until he sat in the stern cabin with its cheerful twinkling stove and swinging lamp that he understood how he had shrunk from that forbidding wilderness  his consultation with dampier who came in by and bye was very brief  well head north for a couple of days and try again he said  he crawled into his berth early and it was some time after midnight when he was awakened by being rudely flung out of it  that fact and the slant of deck and sounds above suggested that the schooner had been hove down by a sudden gale  he had however grown more or less accustomed to occurrences of this kind and to sleeping fully dressed and in another moment or two he was out of the deckhouse  then a wind that seemed sharp as steel drove stinging flakes of snow into his face it was very dark but he fancied that the schooners rail was in the sea which was washing over her to weather and that some of the others were struggling to get the mainsail off her  then a man whom he supposed to be charly ran into him  better come forard  got to haul outer jib down before it blows away he said  wyllard staggered after him up to his knees in water and made out by the mad banging that some of them had already cast the peak of the boomforesail loose  then he reached the windlass and clutched it as a sea that took him to the waist frothed in over the weather rail  the bows lurched out of it viciously hurling another icy flood back on him and he could see a dim white chaos about and beneath them  over it rose the black wedge of the jibs  he did not want to get out along the bowsprit to stop one of them down indeed his whole physical nature shrank from it but there are many things flesh and blood shrink from which must be faced at sea  then he made out that a siwash was fumbling at the downhaul made fast near his side and when his companions shadowy figure rose up against the whiteness of the foam he made a jump forward  then he was on the bowsprit lying upon it while he felt for the footrope slung beneath he found it and was cautiously lowering himself when the man in front of him called out harshly and he saw a white sea range up ahead  it broke short over with a rush and roar and he clung with hands and feet for his life as the schooners dipping bows rammed the seething mass  she went into it to the windlass  he was smothered in an icy flood that seemed bent on wrenching him from his hold but that was only for a moment or two and then he was swung gasping and streaming with water high above the sea again  it was bad enough merely to hold on but that was a very small share of his task for the big black sail that cut the higher darkness came rattling down its stay and fell upon him and his companion bodily  as it dropped the wind took hold of the folds of it and buffeted them cruelly  this was a thing he had once been accustomed to but as he clutched at the canvas it seemed to him incredible that he had not already been flung off headlong from the reeling spar  still that banging thrashing canvas must be mastered somehow though it was snowsoaked and almost unyielding and he clawed at it furiously with bleeding hands while twice the bowsprit raked a sea and dipped him waistdeep in  at length the other man flung him the end of the gasket and they worked back carefully leaving the sail lashed down and scrambled aft to help the others who were making the big mainboom fast  when this was done wyllard fell against dampier and clutched at him  hows the wind he roared  northeast said the skipper  they could scarcely hear each other though the schooner was lurching over it more easily now with shortened canvas and wyllard only made dampier understand that he wished to speak to him by thrusting him towards the deckhouse door  they went in together and stood clutching at the table with the lamplight on their tense wet faces and the brine that ran from them making pools upon the deck  its hauled round said the skipper the wrong way  wyllard made a savage gesture  weve had it from the last quarter we wanted ever since we sailed and we sailed nearly three months too late  were too close in to the beach for you to heave her to  a sure thing said the other  i was driving her to work off it with the sea getting up when the breeze burst on us  she put her rail right under and we had to let go most everything before shed pick it up shes pointing somewhere north jammed right up on the starboard tack just now but i cant stand on  this was evident to wyllard and he closed one hand tight  he wanted to stand on as long as possible before the ice closed in but he realised that to do so would put the schooner ashore  well he said sharply  dampier made a grimace  im going out to heave her round  if wed any sense in us wed square off the boom then and leg it away across the pacific for vancouver  in that case said wyllard somebody would lose his bonus  dampier swung round on him with a flash in his eyes  the bonus he said  who was it came for you with two dollars in his pocket after hed bought his ticket from vancouver  wyllard smiled at him  if you took that up the wrong way im sorry she ought to work off on the port tack and when weve open water to leeward you can heave her to  when it moderates we can pick up the beach again  thats just what i mean to do  then dampier went out on deck while wyllard flinging off his dripping clothing crawled into his bunk and went quietly to sleep     chapter xvi  the first ice  daylight broke on a frothing sea across which there scudded wisps of smokelike drift and thin showers of snow before they hove her to then with two little wet rags of canvas set she lay almost head on to the big combers and met their onslaught with a hoveup weather bow having little way upon her she lurched over instead of ramming them and though now and then one curled on board across her rail it was not often that there was much heavy water upon her slanted deck  all round the narrow circle a leaden sky met the sea  to weather the combers were bitten into it in cleancut serrations but to leeward the dim horizon was blurred by flying spray save when the snow whirled down in thicker wisps and blotted it out altogether  it was bitterly cold and the spray stung the skin like halfspent pellets from a gun there was however only one man exposed to it in turn and he had little to do but brace himself against the savage buffeting of the wind as he clutched the wheel  the selache for the most part steered herself lifting buoyantly while the froth came sluicing aft from her tilted bows falling off a little with a vicious leeward roll when a comber bigger than usual smote her to weather and coming up again streaming to meet the next  sometimes she forged ahead in what is called at sea by courtesy a smooth and all the time shroud and stay to weather gave out tumultuous harmonies and the slack of every rope to leeward blew out in unyielding curves  in the meanwhile three of the white men lay sleeping or smoking in the little cabin which was partly raised above and partly sunk beneath the afterdeck  it was a reasonably strong structure but it worked and sweated as they say at sea and the heat of the stove had further opened up the seams of it  moisture dripped from the beams overhead moisture trickled up and down the slanting deck there were great globules of it on the bulkheading and everything including the mens clothes and blankets was wet  they lay in their bunks from necessity because it was a somewhat laborious matter to sit and said very little since it was difficult to hear anything amidst the cataclysm of elemental sound  indeed it became at length almost a relief to turn out into inky darkness or misty daylight dimmed by flying spray to take a trick at the jarring wheel  for three days this continued and then when the gale broke and a little pale sunshine streamed down on the tumbling sea changing the grey combers to flashing white and green they gave her a doublereefed mainsail part of the boomforesail and a jib or two and thrashed her slowly back to the northwards on the starboard tack  still more than one of them glanced over the taffrail longingly as she gathered way she was fast and with a little driving and that breeze over her quarter she would bear them south towards warmth and ease at some two hundred miles a day while the way they were going it would be a fight for every fathom with bitter charging seas and there lay ahead of them only cold and peril and toil incredible  there are times at sea when human nature revolts from the strain the overtaxed body must bear the leaden weariness of wornout limbs and the subconscious effort to retain warmth and vitality in spite of the ceaseless lashing of the icy gale  then as aching muscles grow lax the nervous tension becomes more insupportable unless indeed utter weariness breeds indifference to the personal peril each time the decks are swept by a frothing flood or a slippery spar must be clung to with frostnumbed and often bleeding hands  that is at least on board the sailing ships where man must still with almost brutal valour pit all the feeble powers of flesh and blood against the forces of the elements  they knew this and it was to their credit that they obeyed when dampier gave the word to put the helm up and trim the sheets over their leader however stood a little apart with a hardset face and he looked forward over the plunging bows for he was troubled by a sense of responsibility such as he had not felt since he had one night several years ago asked for volunteers  he realised that an account of these mens lives might be demanded from him  it was a fortnight later and they had twice made a perilous landing without finding any sign of life on or behind the hammered beach when they ran into the first of the ice  the grey day was almost over and the long heave ran sluggishly after them faintly wrinkled here and there when creeping through a belt of haze they came into sight of several blurrs of greyish white that swung with the dim green swell the selache was slowly lurching over it with everything aloft to the topsails then  dampier glanced at the ice disgustedly  earlier than i expected he said  anyway its a sure thing theres plenty more where that came from  big patch away to starboard cried a man in the foremast shrouds  dampier turned to wyllard  what are you going to do  whats most advisable  the skipper laughed grimly  well he said thats quite simple get out of this and head her south just as soon as we can but i guess thats not quite what you mean  no admitted wyllard  i meant for the next few hours or so  in a general way were still pushing on  then im not worrying much about pushing her through  that ice is light and scattered and as shes going it wont hurt her much if she plugs some in the dark  its what were going to do the next two weeks im not sure about  if theres ice we maynt fetch the creek the chart shows where wed figured on laying her up in  its still most a hundred miles to the north of us  the other inlet id fixed on is way further south  this brought them back to the difficulty they had grappled with at many a council  the men they were in search of might have gone either north or south or they might though this seemed less likely have gone inland if indeed any of them survived  if we only knew how theyd headed said wyllard quietly  still right or not im for pushing on  then charly who held the wheel broke in  i guess its north he said  theyd have no use for fetching up among the russians and theres nobody else until you get to japan  no white men any way  besides from the behring sea to the kuriles is quite a long way  if you were dumped down ashore there which way would you go dampier asked  if id a wallet full of papers certifying me as a harmless traveller it would be south just as hard as i could hit the trail  guess id strike somebody out prospecting or surveying and theyd set me along to the kuriles  still if id been sealing i wouldnt head that way no sir  thats dead sure  there was a reason for this certainty right or wrong in the minds of the sealermen  how many of the skins they brought home were obtained in open water where they could fish without molestation they alone knew but they were regarded in certain quarters as poachers and outlaws who deserved no mercy  they had their differences with the americans who owned the prbyloffs but the latter it was admitted had bought the islands and might reasonably be considered to have some claim upon the seals which frequented them  the freelances bore their execrations and reprisals more or less resignedly though that did not prevent them occasionally exchanging compliments with oar butts or sealing clubs but the muscovite was a grim mysterious figure they feared and hated  then youd have tried up north wyllard suggested  sure said the helmsman  if id a boat and a rifle and it was summer id have pushed across for alaska  you can eat birds and walrus and a man might eat a furseal if hed had nothing else for a week though ive struck nothing that has more smell than the holluschack blubber  if it was winter id have tried the ice  the huskies make out on it for weeks together and quite a few of the steam whaler men have trailed an odd hundred or two miles over it one time or another  they hadnt tents and dogteams either  wyllards face grew grave  he had naturally considered both courses and had decided that they were out of the question  seas do not freeze up solid and that three men should transport a boat supposing that they had one over leagues of ice appeared impossible  an attempt to cross the narrow sea which is either wrapped in mist or swept by sudden gales in any open craft would clearly only result in disaster but admitting that he felt that had he been in those mens place he would have headed north  there was one question which had all along remained unanswered and that was how they had reached the coast from which they had sent their message  anyway he said well stand on and run into the creek weve fixed on if its necessary  in the meanwhile dusk had closed down on them and it had grown perceptibly colder  the haze crystallised on the rigging the rail was white with rime and the deck grew slippery but they left everything on her to the topsails and she crept on erratically through the darkness avoiding the faint spectral glimmer of the scattered ice the breeze abeam propelled her with gently leaning canvas at some four knots to the hour and now and then wyllard who hung about the deck that night fancied he could hear a thin sharp crackle beneath the slowly lifting bows  next day the haze thickened and there seemed to be more ice about but the breeze was fresher and there was at least no skin upon the ruffled sea  they took the topsails off her and proceeded cautiously with two men with loggers pikepoles forward and another in the eyes of the foremast rigging  as it happened they struck nothing and when night came the selache lay rolling in a heavy portentous calm dampier and one or two of the others declared their certainty that there was ice near them but at least they could not see it though there was now no doubt about the crackling beneath the schooners side it was a somewhat anxious night for most of them but a breeze that drove the haze aside got up with the sun and dampier expected to reach the creek before darkness fell  he might have done it but for the glistening streak on the horizon which presently crept in on them and resolved itself into detached greywhite masses with openings of various sizes in and out between them  the breeze was freshening and the selache going through it at some six knots when dampier came aft to wyllard who was standing rather grim in face at the wheel  there was a moderately wide opening in the floating barrier close ahead of him  the rest of the crew stood silent watching the skipper for they were by this time more or less acquainted with wyllards temperament  you cant get through that said dampier pointing to the ice  wyllard looked at him sourly and the white men at least understood what he was feeling  so far he had had everything against himcalm and fog and sudden galeand now when he was almost within sight of the end of the first stage of his journey they had met the ice  youre sure of that he said  dampier smiled  it would cost too much or id let you try  he called to the man perched high in the foremast shrouds and the answer came down  packed right solid a couple of miles ahead  wyllard lifted one hand and let it suddenly fall again  lee oh  well have her round he said and spun the wheel  the rest of them breathed more easily as they jumped for the sheets and with a great banging and thrashing of sailcloth she shot up to windward and turned as on a pivot  then as she gathered way on the other tack they glanced at their leader for her bows were pointing to the southeast again  they felt that was not the way he was going  in the meanwhile wyllard turned to  dampier with a little wry smile  baulked again he said  it would have been a relief to have rammed her in  with this breeze wed have picked that creek up in the next six hours  sure said dampier who glanced at the swirling wake  then if we cant get through it we can work her round  stand by to flatten all sheets in boys  they did it cheerfully though they knew it meant a thrash to windward along the perilous edge of the ice and for the sea was getting up she flung the spray all over her forward half as she smashed the growing combers with her bows  soon the windlass was caked with glistening ice and long spikes of it hung from her rail while the slippery crystals gathered thick on deck  then lumps and floes of ice detached themselves from the parent mass and sailed out to meet her crashing on one another while it seemed to the men who watched him that wyllard tried how closely he could shave them before he ran the schooner off with a vicious drag at the wheel  none of them however cared to say a word to him  they brought her round when she had stretched out on the one tack a couple of miles and standing in again closehauled found the ice thicker than ever  then she came round once more and until the early dusk fell wyllard stood at the jarring helm or high up in the forward shrouds  then he called dampier aside  we cant work along the edge in the dark he said  well said dampier drily it wouldnt be wise  we could stand on as shes lying until half through the night and then come round and pick up the ice again a little before sunup  wyllard made a sign of acquiescence  then he said dont call me until youre in sight of it  a day of this kind takes it out of one  he moved aft heavily towards the deckhouse and dampier watched him with a smile of comprehension for he was a man who had also in his time made many fruitless efforts and quietly faced defeat  after all it is possible that when the final reckoning comes some failures will count  for several hours the selache stretched out closehauled into what they supposed to be open water and they certainly saw no ice  then they hove her to and when the wind fell light brought her round and crept back slowly upon the opposite tack  wyllard had gone to sleep in the meanwhile and daylight was just breaking when he next went out on deck  there was scarcely an air of wind and the heavy calm seemed portentous and unnatural  the schooner lay lurching on a sluggish swell with the frost wool thick on her rigging and a belt of haze ahead of her  on the edge of it the ice glimmered in the growing light but in one or two places stretches of bluegrey water seemed to penetrate it and dampier who strode aft when he saw wyllard said he fancied there must be an opening somewhere  by the thickness of it that ice has formed some time and as weve seen nothing but a skin it must have come from further north he added  it gathered up under a point or in a bay most likely until a shift of wind broke it out and the stream or breeze set it down this way  that seems to indicate that there cant be a great deal of it but a few days calm and frost would freeze it solid  well said wyllard impatiently  it lies between us and the inlet and its quite clear that we cant stay where we are  once we got nipped thered probably be an end of her  we have got to get into that inlet at once or make for the other further south  wyllard smiled  it all leads back to the same point  we must get through the ice  the one question ishows it to be done  with a working breeze id stand into the biggest opening but as theres none well wait until it clears a little and then send a boat in  the sun may bring the wind  they made breakfast in the meanwhile but the wind did not come and it was some hours later when a pale coppery disc became visible and the haze grew thinner  then they swung a boat out hastily for it would not be very long before the light died away again and two white men and an indian dropped into her  they pulled across half a mile of sluggishly heaving water crept up an opening and presently vanished among the ice  soon afterwards the low sun went out and wisps of ragged cloud crept up from the westwards while smears of vapour blurred the horizon and the swell grew steeper  there was no wind at all but blocks and canvas banged and thrashed furiously at every roll until they lowered the mainsail and lashed its heavy boom to the big iron crutch astern  the boat remained invisible but its crew had been given instructions to push on as far as possible if they found clear water and dampier who did not seem uneasy about her paced up and down the deck while the afternoon wore away     chapter xvii  defeat  a grey dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when a little bitter breeze sprang up from westwards and dampier bade them get the mainsail on to her  i dont like the look of the weather and im beginning to feel that id like to see that boat he said  anyhow well get way on her  it was a relief to hoist the mainsail  the work put a little warmth into them and the white men at least had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat  the breeze had however freshened before they set it and there were white caps on the water when the selache headed for the ice  it had somewhat changed its formation when they approached it for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the open water while the opening had become perceptibly narrower  the light was now fading rapidly and wyllard took the wheel when dampier sent the man there forward  get the cover off the second boat and see everything clear for hoisting out he said to him and then called to wyllard  were close enough  youd better heave her round  she came round with a thrashing of canvas stretched out seawards and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her weather rail for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast  then dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds and looked at wyllard afterwards  id heave a couple of reefs down if i wasnt so anxious about that blamed boat he said  as it is i want to be ready to pick her up just as soon as we see her and its quite likely shed turn up when wed got way off the schooner and the peak eased down  wyllard fancied that he was right as he glanced over the rail at the dimness that was creeping in on them  it was blowing almost fresh now and the selache was driving very fast through the swell which commenced to froth here and there  it is as he knew from experience always hard work and often impossible to pull a boat to windward in any weight of breeze which rendered it advisable to keep the schooner under way  if the boat drove by them while they were reefing it might be difficult to pick her up afterwards in the dark  he was now distinctly anxious about her  at length just as the light was dying out the man in the shrouds sent down a cry  i see them sir he said  dampier turned to wyllard with a gesture of relief  thats a weight off my mind  i wish we had a reef in butand he glanced up at the canvasshell have to stand it  anyway ill leave you there  we want to get that second boat lashed down again  this as wyllard recognised was necessary though he would sooner have had somebody by him and the rest of them ready to let the mainsheet run for he was a little to windward of the opening and surmised that he would have to run the schooner down upon the boat  it was a few moments later when he saw her emerge from among the ice and the men in her appeared to be pulling strenuously  they were perhaps half a mile off and the schooner was sailing very fast and heading for the ice  then he lost sight of her again for a thin shower of whirling snow suddenly obscured the light  dampier called to him  youll have to run her off he said  boys slack out your sheets  there was a clatter of blocks and when wyllard pulled his helm up it taxed all his strength  the selache swung round and he gasped with the effort to control her as she drove away furiously into the thickening snow  she was carrying far too much canvas but they could not heave her to and take it off her now  the boat must be picked up first and the veins rose swollen to wyllards forehead as he struggled with the wheel  there is always a certain possibility of bringing a foreandaft rigged vessels mainboom over when she is running hard and this is rather apt to result in disaster to her spars  so fast was she travelling that the sea piled up in a big white wave beneath her quarter and cold as it was the sweat of tense effort dripped from wyllard as he forecasted what he had to do  first of all he must hold her straight before the wind without letting her fall off to leeward which would bring the booms crashing over then he must run past the boat which he could no longer see and round the schooner up with forestaysail aback to leeward of her to wait until she drove down on them  this would not have been difficult in a moderate breeze but the wind was freshening furiously and the schooner was horribly pressed with sail  he thought of calling the others to lower the mainsail peak but with the weight of wind there was in the canvas he was not sure that they could haul the gaff down  besides they were busy securing the boat which must be made fast again before they hove the other in and it was almost dark now  in view of what had happened in the same waters one night four years ago the desire to pick the boat up while there was a little light left became an obsession  in the meanwhile the swell was rapidly whitening and getting steeper the selache hove herself out of it forward as she swung up with streaming bows  it almost seemed to wyllard that he must overrun the boat before he noticed her but at length he saw dampier swing himself on to the rail  he stood there clutching at a shroud and presently turned towards wyllard swinging up an arm  right ahead he shouted  let her come up a few points before you run over them  wyllard put his helm down a spoke or two which was easy and then as the bows swung high again there was a harsh cry from the man who stood above dampier in the shrouds  ice he roared  big pack of it right under your weather bow  dampier shouted something but wyllard did not hear what he said  he was only conscious that he had to decide what he must do in the next few seconds  if he let the selache come up to avoid the boat there was the ice ahead and at the speed she was travelling it would infallibly crush her bows in while if he held her straight there was the boat close in front of her  to swing her clear of both by going to leeward he must bring the mainsail and boomforesail over with a tremendous shock but that seemed preferable and with his heart in his mouth he pulled his helm up  he fancied he cried out in warning but was never sure of it though three men came running to seize the mainsheet  the schooner fell off a little swinging until the boomforesail came over with a thunderous bang and crash  she rolled down heaving a wide strip of wet planking out of the sea and now for a moment or two there were great breadths of canvas swung out on either hand  then the ponderous mainboom went up high above his head and he saw three shadowy figures dragged aft as they tried in vain to steady it  the big mainsail was bunched up a vast portentous shape above him and then he set his lips and pulled up the helm another spoke as it swung  he never quite knew what happened after that  there was a horrible crash and the schooner appeared to be rolling over bodily  the spokes he clung to desperately reft themselves from his grasp the deck slanted until one could not stand upon it and something heavy struck him on the head  he dropped and dampier flung himself upon the wheel above his senseless body  then there was mad confusion and a frantic banging of canvas as the schooner came up beam to the wind with her rent mainsail flogging itself to tatters  its ponderous boom was broken and the mainmasthead had gone but it was not the first time the sealermen had grappled with somewhat similar difficulties and dampier kept his head he had the boat to think of and she was somewhere to windward hidden in the sudden darkness and the turmoil of the quickly rising sea but in the meanwhile the schooner counted most of all  his crew could scarcely hear him through the uproar the thundering canvas made and the screaming of the wind but the orders were given and from habit and the custom of their calling they knew what they must be  they hauled a jib down backed the forestaysail and got the boomforesail sheeted in but they let the rent mainsail bang for it could do no more damage than it had already done  then a man sprang up on the rail with a blue light in his hand and as the weird radiance flared in a long streak to leeward a cry rose from the water  in another few moments a blurred object half hidden in flying spray drove down upon the schooner furiously on the top of a sea and then there was sudden darkness as the man flung down the flare  another harsh and halfheard cry rose out of the obscurity  an indistinguishable object plunged past the schooners stern there was a crash to leeward as she rolled and a man standing up in the boat clutched her rail  he was swung out of it as she rolled back again but he crawled on to the rail with a rope in one hand and after jamming it fast round something sprang down with the hooks of the lifting tackles which one of the rest had given him  then while two more men scrambled up there was a clatter of blocks but a shattered sea struck the boat as they hove her dear and when she swung in the brine poured out through the rents in her  dampier waved an arm as they dropped her on the deck and they heard him faintly  boys he said you have got to cut that mainsail down  they did it somehow hanging on to the masthoops buffeted and now and then enveloped by the madly flogging canvas floundering below amidst a raffle of fallen gear while the bitter spray lashed them and the broken boom held up by the clew ring banged savagely to and fro  after that they trimmed her forestaysail over and there was by contrast a curious quietness as dampier jammed his helm up and the schooner swung off before the sea  then somebody lighted a lantern and charly stooped over wyllard who lay limp and still beside the wheel  his face showed grey in the feeble light save where a broad red stain had spread across it  dampier cast a glance at him  get him below and into his bunk two of you he said  they did it with difficulty for the selache lurched viciously each time a whitetopped sea came up upon her quarter and as soon as it seemed advisable to leave the deck dampier went down  wyllard lay in his bunk with his eyes halfopen but there was no expression in them and his face was almost colourless except for the broad smear of blood it was oozing fast from a laceration in his scalp but dampier who noticed his chilliness did not in the meanwhile trouble about that he stripped off the senseless mans long boots and unshipping a hot fender iron from the stove laid it against his feet  afterwards he contrived to get some whisky down his throat and then set to work to wash the scalp wound dropping into the water a little of the permanganate of potash which is freely used at sea  when that was done he applied a rag dipped in the same fluid and seeing no result of his efforts went back on deck  he was anxious about his patient but not unduly so for he had discovered long ago that men of his description are apt to recover from more serious injuries  by and bye he said wyllards brain which had evidently been rudely jarred by the shock would resume its functions  it was blowing very hard when he stood near the wheel  a steep sea was already tumbling after the schooner but she was at least heading out from where they supposed the ice to be and he let her go keeping her away before it and heading a little south of east  when morning came the sea was very high and the faint light further dimmed by snow but it seemed to him just safe and no more to run and they held on while the big combers came up astern and forged by ridged with foam high above her rail  she was travelling very fast to the eastwards under boomforesail and one little jib with her mainmast broken short off where the bolts of the halliard blocks had traversed it and dampier realised that because of that every knot she made then could not by any means be recovered that season  he wondered with a little uneasiness what wyllard would say when he came to himself again  in the meanwhile he said nothing but lay like a log in his bunk only that there was now a little warmth in him  next day the breeze moderated somewhat and they let her come up a little heading further south while on the morning after that wyllard showed signs of returning consciousness  dampier however kept away from him partly to allow his senses to readjust themselves and partly because he rather shrank from the coming interview  at length when dusk was falling charly came up to say that wyllard who seemed quite sensible insisted on seeing him and dampier went down with some misgivings into the little cabin  the lamp was lighted and when he sat down wyllard who raised himself feebly on his pillow turned a pallid face to him  charly tells me you picked the boat up he said  we did said dampier  she had three or four planks on one side ripped out of her  wyllards faint grimace implied that this did not matter and dampier braced himself for the question he dreaded  he had to face it in another moment  hows she heading  a little south of east  wyllards face hardened  it was still blowing moderately fresh and by the heave of the vessel and the wash of water outside he could guess how fast she was travelling  except for the latter sound however there was for a moment or two an almost oppressive silence in the little cabin  then wyllard spoke again  you have been running to the eastwards since i was struck down he said  dampier nodded  three days he said  just now the breeze is on her quarter  he winced under wyllards gaze and spread his hands out deprecatingly  now he added what else was there i could do  she wrung her masthead off when you jibed her and theres not stick enough left to set any canvas that would shove her to windward i might have hove her to but the first time the breeze hauled easterly shed have gone up on the beach or among the ice with us  i had to run  wyllard closed a feeble hand  dunton was crippled too  its almost incredible  in one way it looks like that but after all a jibes quite a common thing with a foreandafter  if you run her off to lee when shes going before it her mainbooms bound to come over  of course nobody would run her off in a wicked breeze unless he had to but youd no choice with the ice in front of you  wyllard lay very still for almost a minute  it was clear to him that his project must be abandoned for that season which meant that at least six months must elapse before he could even approach the kamtchatkan coast again  well he said at length what do you mean to do  if the breeze holds we could pick up one of the aleutians in a few days but im keeping south of them  therell probably be ugly ice along the beaches and ive no fancy for being cast ashore by a strong tide when the fog lies on the land  with westerly winds id sooner hold on for alaska  we could lie snug in an inlet there and its quite likely get a cedar that would make a spar  i cant head right away for vancouver with no mainsail  this was clear to wyllard who made a feeble gesture  if the wind comes easterly  dampier pursed his face up  then unless i could fetch one of the kuriles wed sure be jammed  she wont beat to windward and thered be all kamtchatka to lee of us  the ice is packing up along the north of it now and the russians have two or three settlements to the south we dont want to run in and tell them what were after  a faint smile crept into wyllards eyes  no he said not after that little affair on the beach  since its very probable that the vessel they send up to the seal islands would deliver stores along the coast the folks in authority would have a record of it  theyd call the thing piracyand in a sense theyd be justified  he said nothing more for a little and then looked up again wearily  i wonder he said how that boats crew ever got across to kamtchatka  it was north of the islands where the man brought dunton the message  dampier understood that he desired to change the subject for this was a question they had often discussed already  well he said i still hold by my first notion  they were blown ashore on the beach wed just left and made prisoners  then a supply schooner or perhaps a steamer came along and they sent them off in her to be handed over to the authorities  the vessel put in somewhere well say she was lying in an inlet with a boat astern and somehow they cut that boat loose in the dark and got away in her  he broke off for a moment and then looked at his companion significantly  you can find quite a few points where that idea seems to fail he added  they were in kamtchatka but im beginning to feel that we shall never know any more than that  wyllard made a little weary gesture of concurrence but before he closed them dampier saw no sign that he meant to abandon his project in his eyes  in another few minutes he seemed to sink into sleep and dampier who went up on deck paced to and fro awhile before he stopped by the wheel and turned to the helmsman  you can let her come up a couple of points  we may as well make a little southing while we can he said  charly who was steering looked up with suggestive eagerness  then hes not going for the aleutians  no said dampier drily  i was kind of afraid of that but i choked him off  anyway this year wont see us back in vancouver  he paused with a little jarring laugh  were going to stay up here until we find out where those men left their bones  the man who has this thing in hand isnt the kind that lets up  charly made no answer but his face hardened as he put his helm down a spoke or two  next day the wind fell lighter but for a week it still held westerly and after that it blew moderately fresh from the south  crippled as she was the selache would lie a point or two south of east when they had set an old cut down forestaysail on what was left of her mainmast and the hearts of her crew grew a little lighter as she crawled on across the pacific  they had no wish to be blown back to the frozen north  the days were however growing shorter rapidly and the sun hung low in the southern sky when at length she crept into one of the many inlets that indent the coast of southern alaska  there was just wind enough to carry her in round a long foamlapped point and soon afterwards they let the anchor go in four fathoms in a sheltered arm with a river mouth not far away  there was no sign of life anywhere about it and the ragged cedars that crept close down to the beach stood out in sombre spires against the gleaming snow  the cold was not particularly severe when she crept in but when dampier went ashore next morning to pick a log that they could hew a mast out of the temperature suddenly fell and that night the drift ice from the river mouth closed in on them  when the late daylight broke she was frozen fast and they knew it would be several months before she moved again  it was then before the gold rush and in winter alaska was practically cut off from all communication with the south no man would have attempted to traverse the tremendous snowwrapped desolation of almost impassable hills and trackless forests that lay between them and the nearest of the commercial factories on the north or the canneries on the other hand  besides the canneries were shut up in winter time  they were prisoners and could only wait with what patience they could muster until the thaw set them free again     chapter xviii  a delicate errand  there was sharp frost outside and the prairie was white with a thin sprinkle of snow when a little party sat down to supper in the hastings homestead one saturday evening  hastings sat at the head of the table his wife at the foot with her little daughters agatha sproatly and winifred between them  the latter two had just driven over from the railroad settlement as they did now and then which explained why the meal which is usually served early in the evening had been delayed an hour or so  the two hired men whom mrs hastings had not kept waiting had gone out to some task in the barn or stables  by and bye sproatly took a bundle of papers out of his pocket and laid them on the table  there had been a remarkable change in his appearance of late for he now wore store clothes and the skin coat he had taken off when he came in was as his hostess had noticed a new one  it occurred to her that there was a certain significance in this though sproatly had changed his occupation some little time ago and now drove about the prairie on behalf of certain makers of agricultural implements  i called for your mail and gregorys before we left he said  i had to go round to see him which is partly what made us so late though winifred couldnt get away as soon as she expected  theyve floods of wheat coming in to the elevators and i understand that the milling people cant take another bushel in  mrs hastings glanced at agatha who understood what she meant for sproatly had hitherto spoken of winifred circumspectly as miss rawlinson  hastings however took the papers which agatha handed him and laid them aside  well let them wait until suppers over  i dont expect any news thats particularly good he said  the bottoms apparently dropping out of the wheat market  hamilton cant get cars enough and well have to shut down in another day or two unless they turn up said winifred  its much the same all along the line  the winnipeg traffic people wired us they havent an empty car in the yards  why do you rush the grain in that way its bound to break the market  hastings smiled rather drily  well he said a good many of us have bills to meet  for another thing theyve had a heavy crop in manitoba dakota and minnesota and i suppose some folks have an idea theyll get in first before the other people swamp the eastern markets i think theyre foolish  its a temporary scare  prices will stiffen by and bye  thats what hamilton says but i suppose the thing is natural  men are very like sheep arent they  hastings laughed  well he admitted we are in some respects when prices break a little we generally rush to sell  one or two of my neighbours are however holding on and its hardly likely that very much of my wheat will be flung on to a falling market  we have been getting a good deal from the range  there was displeasure in hastingss face  gregorys selling largely on harrys account  theyve been hauling wheat in to us for the last few weeks said winifred  hastings as agatha noticed glanced at his wife significantly but she interposed and forbade any further conversation of the kind until supper was over while when the table had been cleared hastings opened his papers  the rest sat expectantly silent while he turned them over one after another  no he said theres no news of harry and im afraid its scarcely possible that well hear anything of him this winter  agatha was conscious that mrs hastingss eyes were upon her and she sat very still though her heart was beating a little faster than usual  hastings however went on again  the colonist has a line or two about a barque from alaska which put into victoria short of stores he said  she was sent up to an acc factory and had to clear out before she was ready  the ice it seems was closing in unusually early  a steam whaler at portland reports the same thing and from the news brought by a steamer from japan all communication with northeastern asia is already cut off  none of the others said anything for a moment or two and agatha leaning back in her chair glanced round the room  there was not much furniture in it but though this was unusual on the prairie door and double casements were guarded by heavy hangings  the big brass lamp overhead shed down a cheerful light the birch billets in the stove snapped and crackled noisily and its pipe which was far too hot to touch diffused a drowsy heat  one could lounge beside it contentedly knowing that the stinging frost was drying the snow to dusty powder outside  that heightened the contrast for agatha pictured the little schooner bound fast in the northern ice and then two or three travelworn men crouching in a tiny tent buffeted by an arctic gale she could see the poles bend and the tricings strain  after that with a sudden transition her thoughts went back to the early morning when wyllard had driven away and every detail of the scene rose up clearly in her mind  she saw him and the stolid dampier sitting in the waggon with nothing in their manner to suggest that they were setting out upon a very perilous venture and she felt his hand close tight upon her fingers as it had done just before the waggon jolted away from the homestead  she could once more see it growing smaller and smaller on the white prairie until it dipped behind the crest of a low rise and the sinking beat of hoofs died away  then at least she had realised that he had started on the first stage of a journey which might lead him through the icebound gates of the north to the rest that awaits the souls of the sailormen she could not however imagine him shrinking  gripping helm or hauling in the sled traces he would gaze with quiet eyes steadfastly ahead even if they saw only the passage from this world to the next once more as it had done that morning a curious thrill ran through her and there was pride as well as regret in it  then she became conscious that hastings was speaking  what took you round by the range jim he asked  collecting said sproatly  i sold gregory a couple of binders earlier in the season but as it happened i couldnt get a dollar out of him  he laughed  of course if it had been anybody else id have stayed until he handed over but i couldnt press gregory too hard after quartering myself upon him as i did last winter though im rather afraid my employers wouldnt appreciate that kind of delicacy  mrs hastings looked thoughtful  gregory should have been able to pay  he thrashed out a moderately good crop  about twothirds of what it should have been and ive reason for believing that he has been putting up a mortgage  interests heavy theres another matter  i wonder if youve heard that hes getting rid of two of harrys hands  i mean pat and tom moran  youre sure of that hastings asked somewhat sharply  tom told me  mrs hastings leaned forward suddenly in her chair  then she said im going to drive across on monday and have a few words with gregory  did moran tell you that harry had decided to keep the two of them on throughout the year  he wasnt very explicit but he seemed to feel he had a grievance against gregory  of course in a way you cant blame gregory  hes in charge and it isnt in him to carry out harrys policy  this fall in wheat is getting on his nerves and in any case hed probably have held his hand and cut down the crop next year  i do blame him and mrs hastings turned to agatha  you will understand that in a general way theres not much that can be done when the snows upon the ground and as one result of it the hired man prefers to engage himself for the year  to secure himself from being turned adrift when harvests over he will frequently make a concession in wages  now i know harry intended to keep those two men on and tom moran who has a little halfcleared ranch back somewhere in the bush of ontario came out here tempted by higher wages  i understand he had to raise a few dollars or give the place up and he left his wife behind  a good many of the little men cant live upon their holdings all the while  well im going over on monday to tell gregory he has got to keep them and youre coming with me  agatha said nothing  in the first place she knew that if mrs hastings had made her mind up she would gain nothing by objecting and in addition to this she was conscious of a certain desire to go  it appeared in some respects an unreasonable wish but she felt deep down in her that if wyllard had let the men understand that he would not dismiss them the promise implied or explicit must be redeemed  he would not have attempted to release himself from itshe was sure of thatand it appeared intolerable to her that another should be permitted to do anything that would unfavourably reflect on him  then somewhat to her relief hastings started another topic  you have sold quite a few binders and harrows one way or another havent you jim he said  sproatly laughed  i have he said  as i told the companys western representative some time ago a man who could sell patent medicine to the folks round here could do a good trade in anything  he admitted that my contention sounded reasonable but i didnt wear store clothes then and he seemed very far from sure of me  anyway he gave me a show and now ive got two or three quite complimentary letters from the company  theyve added a few dollars to my salary and hint that its possible they may put me in charge of an implement store  and youre satisfied  well said sproatly with an air of reflection in some respects i suppose i am  in others the things galling  you have to report who youve called upon and if you couldnt do business why they bought somebody elses machines  if you cant get a farmer to take you in you have to put up at a hotel  theres no more camping in a birch bluff under your waggon  besides you have to wear store clothes  hastings glanced at winifred and agatha fancied she understood what was in his mind  some folks would sooner sleep in a hotel he said with a twinkle in his eyes  then said sproatly decisively they dont know very much  theyre the kind of men whod spend an hour every morning putting their clothes on and they havent found out that theres no comfort in any garment until youve had to sew two or three flour bag patches on to it  then think of the splendid freeness of the other thing  you make your supper when you want and just how you like it when you put up in a bluff and no tea tastes as good as the kind you drink with the wood smoke in it out of a blackened can  you can hear the little birch leaves and the grasses whispering about you when you lie down at night and you drive on in the glorious freshnessjust when it pleases youwhen morning comes  now the company have the whole route and programme plotted out for me  they write me letters demanding most indelicately why i havent done this and that  winifred looked at him sharply  civilisation she said implies responsibility  you cant live just how you like without it being detrimental to the community  oh yes said sproatly with a rueful gesture it implies no end of giving up  you have to fall into line and thats why i kept outside it just as long as i could  i dont like standing in a rank and he glanced down at his clothing ive an inborn objection to wearing uniform  agatha laughed as she caught hastingss eye  she fancied that sproatly would be sorry for his candour afterwards but she understood what he was feeling to some extent  it was a revolt against cramping customs and conventionalities and she partly sympathised with it though she knew that such revolts are dangerous  even in the west those who cannot lead must march in column with the rank and file or bear the consequences of their futile mutiny  it is a hard truth that no man can live as he pleases  restraint said winifred is a wholesome thing but its one most of the men i have met are singularly deficient in  thats why they cant be left alone but must be driven as they are in companies  its their own fault if they now and then find it a little humiliating  there was a faint gleam in her eyes at which sproatly apparently took warning for he said no more upon that subject and they talked about other matters until he took his departure an hour or two later  it was next afternoon when he appeared again and mrs hastings smiled at agatha as he and winifred drove away together  thirty miles is a long way to drive in the frost  i suppose you have noticed that she calls him jim she said  anyway theres a good deal of very genuine ability in that young man  he isnt altogether wild  his appearance rather suggested it when i first met him said agatha with a laugh  was it a pose  no said her companion reflectively  i think one could call it a reaction and its probable that some very worthy people in the old country are to blame for it  sproatly is not the only young man who has suffered from having too many rules and conventions crammed down his throat  in fact theyre rather plentiful  agatha said nothing further for the little girls appeared just then and it was not until the next afternoon that she and mrs hastings were alone together again  then as they drove across the prairie wrapped in the heavy waggon robes her companion spoke of the business they had in hand  gregory must keep those men she said  theres no doubt that harry meant to do it and it would be horribly unfair to turn them loose now when theres absolutely nothing going on  besides tom moran is a man im specially sorry for  as i told you he left a young wife and a very little child behind him when he came out here  one would wonder why he did it said agatha  he had to  there seems to be a notion in the old country that we earn our dollars easily but its very wrong  well take that mans case as an example he has a little desolate holding up in the bush of ontario a hole chopped out of the forest studded all over with sawnoff firstumps with a little tworoomed log shack on it  in all probability there isnt a settlement within two or three leagues of the spot  now as a rule a place of that kind wont produce enough to keep a man for several years after he has partially cleared it and unless he can earn something in the meanwhile he must give it up  moran it seems got heavily into debt with the nearest storekeeper and had to choose between selling the place up or coming out here where wages are higher well you can probably imagine what it must be to the woman who stayed behind in the desolate bush seeing nobody for weeks together though ive no doubt that shed bear it uncomplainingly believing that her husband would come back with enough to clear the debt  agatha could imagine it and a certain indignation against gregory crept into her heart  she had once liked to think of him as pitiful and chivalrous and now it seemed he was quite willing that this woman should make her sacrifice in vain  but why have you taken the trouble to impress this onme she asked  her companion smiled  i want you to plead that womans cause gregory may do what you ask him gracefully  that would be much the nicest way out of it  the nicest way  yes said mrs hastings with a trace of dryness there is another one  gregory is going to keep tom moran anyway  harry has one or two friends in this neighbourhood who feel it more or less of an obligation on them to maintain his credit  agatha felt the blood rise to her face but it was not her companion she was angry with  it was an unpleasant thing to admit but she fancied that gregory might yield to judicious pressure when he would not be influenced by either compassion or a sense of equity  it also flashed upon her that had mrs hastings believed that she still retained any tenderness for the man she would not have spoken as she had done  the whole situation was horribly embarrassing but there was courage in her  well she said simply i will speak to him  they said nothing more until they approached the range and as they drove by the outbuildings agatha glanced about her curiously  it occurred to her that the homestead did not look quite the same as it had done when wyllard had been there  a waggon stood near the strawpile without one wheel  a door of the barn hung awkwardly open in a manner which suggested that it needed mending and the snow had blown inside the building  there was a gap in the side of one sod and pole structure which should evidently have been repaired and all this and several other things she noticed jarred upon her  they suggested slackness and indifference  then she saw mrs hastings purse her lips up  there is a change in the place already she said  they got down in another minute or two and when they entered the house the greyhaired swedish woman greeted them moodily  she seemed to notice the glance mrs hastings cast around her and her manner became deprecatory  i cant keep things straight now  it is not the same she said  mrs hastings asked if hawtrey was in and hearing that he was turned to agatha  go along and talk to him  ive something to say to mrs nansen she said     chapter xix  the prior claim  it was with confused feelings among which a sense of repugnance predominated that agatha walked towards hawtreys room  she was not one of the women who take pleasure in pointing out another persons duty for while she had discovered that this task is apparently an easy one to some people she was quite aware that a duty usually looks much more burdensome when it is laid upon ones self  indeed she was conscious just then that one might be shortly thrust upon her which she would find it very hard to bear and she became troubled with a certain compunction as she remembered how she had of late persistently driven all thought of it out of her mind  there was no doubt that she was still pledged to gregory and that she had loved him once  both facts must be admitted and it seemed to her that if he insisted she must marry him  deep down in her there was an innate sense of right and honesty and she realised that the fact that he was not the man she had once imagined him to be did not release her in the meanwhile it was clear that if he was about to commit a cruel and unjustifiable action she was the one person of all others whose part it was to restrain him  the colour was a little plainer in her face than usual when she quietly entered the room where he lay pipe in hand in a lounge chair and for it seemed that he did not immediately notice her his attitude of languid ease irritated her  there were as she had seen several things which should evidently have had some claim on his attention outside  a litter of letters and papers lay upon a little table at his side but the fact that he could not reach them as he lay was suggestive  then he rose and came forward with outstretched hand  illustration it seemed that he did not immediately notice her  i didnt hear you he said  this is a pleasure i scarcely anticipated  agatha sat down in the chair he drew out for her near the stove and he seemed to notice that she glanced at the papers on the table for he laughed  bills and things of that kind  theyve been worrying me for a week or two he said  then he seized the litter and bundling it together flung it into an open drawer which he shut with a snap  anyway thats the last of them for today  im awfully glad you drove over  agatha smiled  the action was so characteristic of the man  she had once found no fault with gregorys careless habits and his way of thrusting a difficulty into the background and making light of it had appealed to her  it had suggested his ability to straighten out the trouble when it appeared advisable  now she said she would not be absurdly hypercritical and he had as it happened given her the lead that she desired  i should have fancied that you would have had to give them more attention as wheat is going down she said  hawtrey looked at her with an air of reproach  it must be nearly three weeks since i have seen you and now you expect me to talk of farming  he made a whimsically rueful gesture  if you quite realised the situation it would be about the last thing you would ask me to do  agatha was a little astonished to remember that three weeks had actually elapsed since she had last met him and they had only exchanged a word or two then  he had certainly not obtruded himself upon her for which she was grateful  nobody is talking about anything except the fall in prices just now she persisted  i suppose it affects you too  the man who seemed to accept this as a rebuff looked at her rather curiously and then laughed  it must be admitted that it does  in fact ive been acquiring parsimonious habits and worrying myself about expenses lately  they have to be kept down somehow and thats a kind of thing i never took kindly to  you feel it a greater responsibility when youre managing somebody elses affairs suggested agatha who was still waiting her opportunity  well said hawtrey in whom there was after all a certain honesty thats not quite the only thing that has some weight with me  you see im not altogether disinterested  i get a certain percentageon the marginafter everything is paid and i want it to be a big one things are rather tight just now and the wretched mortgage on my place is crippling me  it had slipped out before he quite realised what he was saying and he saw the girls look of astonishment and concern  she now realised what sproatly had meant  you are in debt gregory  i thought you had at least kept clear of that she said  so i didfor a while  in any case if wyllard stays away and i can run this place on the right lines i shall no doubt get out of it again  she was vexed that he had said this for it was clear to her that if wyllard did not return until another crop was gathered in it would be because he was held fast among the northern ice in peril of his life then another thought struck her  she had never quite understood why gregory had been willing to undertake the management of the range in view of the probability of wyllard having plainly told him what he had said to her but he had made that point clear by admitting that he had been burdened with a load of debt which suggested the question why he had incurred the latter  the answer appeared in another moment or two as she remembered having heard mrs hastings or somebody else say that he had spent a good many dollars upon his house and furnishings for it it brought her a sudden sense of confusion for as one result of that expenditure he had been forced into doing what she fancied must have been a very repugnant thing and she had never even crossed his threshold  when did you borrow that money she asked sharply  there was no doubt that the man was embarrassed and her heart softened towards him for his hesitation  it was to further her comfort he had laid that load upon himself and he was clearly unwilling that she should recognise it  that counted for a good deal in his favour  was it just before i came out she asked again  hawtrey made a little sign of expostulation  you really mustnt worry me about these matters aggy  a good many of us are in the storekeepers or mortgagejobbers hands and theres no doubt that if i have another good year at the range i shall clear off the debt  agatha turned her face away from him for a moment or two  the thing the man had done laid a heavy obligation on her and she remembered that she had only found fault with him  even then however stirred as she was she was conscious that all the tenderness she had once felt for him had gone  the duty however remained and with a little effort she turned to him again  oh she said im so sorry  hawtrey smiled  i really dont think i deserve a very great deal of pity  as i have said ill probably come out all right next year if i can only keep expenses down  then agatha remembered the task she had in hand  it was a very inauspicious moment to set about it but that could not be helped and even for the mans own sake she felt that she must win him over  there is one way gregory in which i dont think it ought to be done she said  yon took over wyllards obligations when you took the farm and i think you should keep the two morans on  hawtrey started  ah he said mrs hastings has been setting you on i partly expected it  she told me agatha admitted  unless you will look at the thing as i do i could almost wish she hadnt  the thought of that woman shut up in the woods all winter only to find that what she must have to bear has all been thrown away troubles me  wyllard promised to keep those men on didnt he  there was no regular engagement so far as i can make out  still moran seems to have understood that he was to be kept on  yes admitted hawtrey he evidently does  if the market had gone with us id have fallen in with his views  as it hasnt every mans wages count  agatha was conscious of a little thrill of repugnance  of late gregorys ideas had rather frequently jarred on hers  does that release you  hawtrey did not answer this  ill keep those men on if you want me to he said  agatha winced at this  she had discovered that she must not look for too much from gregory but to realise that he had practically no sense of moral obligation and could only be influenced to do justice by the expectation of obtaining her favour positively hurt her  i want them kept on but i dont want you to do it for that reason she said  cant you grasp the distinction gregory  a trace of darker colour crept into hawtreys face but while she was a little astonished at this he looked at her steadily  he had not thought much about her during the last month but now the faint scorn in her voice had stirred him  now he said there are just three reasons aggy why you should have troubled yourself about this thing  you are perhaps a little sorry for morans wife but as you havent even seen her that can hardly count for much  the next is that you dont care to see me doing what you regard as a shabby thing perhaps it is a shabby thing in some respects but i feel its justifiable  of course if thats your reason theres a sense in which while not exactly complimentaryits consoling  he broke off and looked at her with a question in his eyes and it cost agatha an effort to meet them  she was not prudish or over conscious of her own righteousness but once or twice after the shock of her disillusionment in regard to him had lessened she had dreamed of the possibility of enduing him little by little with some of the qualities she had once fancied he possessed and as she vaguely thought of it rehabilitating him  now however the thing seemed impossible and what was more the desire to bring it about had gone hateful as the situation was becoming she was honest and she could not let him credit her with a motive that had not influenced her  in the meanwhile her very coldness and aloofness stirred desire in the man and she shrank as she saw a spark of passion kindling in his eyes it was merely passion she felt for she recognised that there was a strain of grossness in him  no she said that reason was not one which had any weight with me  hawtreys face hardened  then he said grimly well get on to the third  wyllards credit is a precious thing to you sooner than anything should cast a stain on it you would beg a favour fromme you have set him up on a pedestal and it would hurt you if he came down  considering everything its a remarkably curious situation  agatha grew a trifle pale  gregory was horribly right for she had no doubt now that he had merely thrust upon her a somewhat distressing truth  it was to save wyllards credit and for that alone she had undertaken this most unpalatable task  she did not answer and hawtrey stood up  wyllard has his faults but theres this in his favourhe keeps a promise he said  one has a certain respect for a person who never goes back upon his word  well because i really think he would like it ill keep those men  he paused for a moment as if to let her grasp the drift of this and then turned to her with something that startled her in his voice and manner  the question isare you willing to emulate his example  agatha shrank from the glow in his eyes  oh she broke out you cannot urge me nowafter what you said  hawtrey laughed harshly  well he said ill come for my answer very shortly  it seems that you and wyllard attach a good deal of importance to a moral obligationand i must remind you that the time agreed upon is almost up  agatha sat very still for perhaps half a minute while a sense of dismay crept over her  there was no doubt that gregorys retort was fully warranted  she had as she admitted insisted upon him carrying out an obligation which would cost him something not because she took pleasure in seeing him do what was honourable but to preserve the credit of another man and now it was with intense repugnance she recognised that there was apparently no escaping from the one she had incurred  the mans attitude was perfectly natural and logical  she had promised to marry him and he had saddled himself with a load of debt on her account but the slight pity and tenderness she had felt for him a few minutes earlier had utterly gone  indeed she felt she almost hated him  his face had grown hard and almost brutal and there was a look she shrank from in his eyes  then she rose  do you wish to speak to mrs hastings she asked  hawtrey smiled rather grimly  no he said if shell excuse me i dont think i do  if you tell her you have been successful shell probably be quite content  agatha went out without another word and hawtrey lighted his pipe and stretched himself out in his chair when he heard the waggon drive away a few minutes later  he did not like mrs hastings and had a suspicion that she had no great regard for him but he was conscious of a somewhat grim satisfaction  there was though it seldom came to the surface a taint of crude brutality in his nature and it was active now  when agatha had first come out the change in her had been a shock to him and it would not have cost him very much to let her go  since then however her coldness and halfperceived disdain had angered him and the interview which was just over had left him in an unpleasant mood  though this was perhaps the last thing he would have expected it had stirred him to desire  it was consoling to feel that he could exact the fulfilment of her promise from the girl  his face grew coarser as he assured himself of it but he had as it happened never realised the shiftiness and instability of his own character  it was his misfortune that the impulses which swayed him one day had generally changed the next  this became apparent when having occasion to drive in to the elevators on the railroad a week later he called at a store to make one or two purchases  the man who kept it laid a package on the counter  i wonder if youd take this along to miss creighton as a favour he said  she wrote for the things and elliot was to take them out but i guess he forgot anyway he didnt call  hawtrey told the clerk to put the package in his waggon  he had scarcely seen sally since his recovery and he suddenly remembered that after all he owed her a good deal and that she was very pretty besides one could talk to sally without feeling the restraint that agathas manner usually laid on him  then the storekeeper laid an open box upon the counter  i guess youre going to be married by and bye he said  hawtrey was thinking of sally then and the question irritated him  i dont know that it concerns you but in a general way its probable he said  well said the storekeeper goodhumouredly a pair of these mittens would make quite a nice present for a lady  smartest thing of the kind ive ever seen here choicest alaska fur  hawtrey bought a pair and the storekeeper took a fur cap out of another box  now he said this is just the thing shed like to go with the mittens  theres style about that cap feel the gloss of it  hawtrey bought the cap and smiled as he swung himself up into his waggon  gloves are not much use in the prairie frost and mittens which are not divided into fingerstalls will within limits fit almost anybody  this he felt was fortunate for he was not quite sure that he meant to give them to agatha  it was bitterly cold and the pace the team made was slow for the snow was loose and too thin for a sled of any kind which after all is not very generally used upon the prairie  as the result of this night had closed down and hawtrey was frozen almost stiff when at last a birch bluff rose out of the waste in front of him  it cut black against the cold blueness of the sky and the spectral gleam of snow but when he had driven a little further a stream of ruddy orange light appeared in the midst of it  a few minutes later he pulled his team up in front of a little logbuilt house and getting down with difficulty saw the door open as he approached it  sally stood in the entrance silhouetted against a blaze of cheerful light  oh she said  gregory  hawtrey recognised the thrill in her voice and took both her hands as he had once been in the habit of doing  will you let me in he asked  the girl laughed in a rather strained fashion  she had been a little startled and was not quite sure yet as to how she should receive him but in the meanwhile hawtrey drew her in  the old folks are out she said  theyve gone over to elliots for supper  hes bringing us a package  hawtrey who explained that he had got it let her hands go and sat down somewhat limply  he had come suddenly out of the bitter frost into the little brightlylighted stovewarmed room  in another few moments however the comfort and cheeriness of it appealed to him  this looks very cosy after my desolate room at the range he said  then if youll stay ill make you supper  i suppose theres nothing to take you home  no said hawtrey with a significant glance at her there certainly isnt sally  as a matter of fact i often wish there was  he saw her sudden uncertainty which was however not tinged with embarrassment and feeling that he had gone far enough in the meanwhile he went out to put up his team  when he came back there was a cloth on the table and sally was busy about the stove  he sat down and watched her attentively  in some respects he thought she compared favourably with agatha  she had a nicely moulded figure and a curious lithe gracefulness of carriage which was suggestive of a strong vitality while agathas bearing was usually characterised by a certain rather frigid repose  this and the latters general manner had a somewhat inciting effect on him when he was in her presence but he now and then remembered it afterwards with resentment  then sallys face was at least as comely in a different way and there was no reserve in it she was what he thought of as human frankly flesh and blood  her quick smile was as a rule provocative and never chilled one as agathas quiet glances sometimes did  sally he said youve grown prettier than ever  the girl turned partly round towards him with a slow sinuous movement that he found seductively graceful  now she said you oughtnt to say those things to me  hawtrey laughed he was usually sure of his ground with sally  why shouldnt i when its just what you are  for one thing miss ismay wouldnt like it  the mans face hardened  im not sure shed mind  anyway miss ismay doesnt like a good many things im in the habit of doing  sally who had watched him closely turned away again but a little thrill of exultation ran through her  it had been with dismay she had first heard him speak of his marriage which was perhaps not altogether astonishing and she had fled home in an agony of anger and humiliation  that state of mind had however not lasted long and when it became evident that the wedding was at least postponed indefinitely she commenced to wonder whether it was quite impossible that hawtrey should come back to her  she felt that he belonged to her although he had never given her any very definite claim in him  she was a trifle primitive and passionate but she was determined and now he had done what she had almost expected him to do she meant to keep him  you have fallen out she said and contrived to keep the anxiety she was conscious of out of her voice  the question and more particularly the form of it rather jarred upon hawtrey but he answered it  oh no he said  as a matter of fact sally you cant fall out nicely with everybody  now when we fell out you got delightfully angryi dont know if you were more delightful then or when you graciously agreed to make it up again  he laughed  i almost wish i could make you a little angry now  sally had moved a little nearer to take a kettle off the stove and she looked down on him with her eyes shining in the lamplight  she realised that she would have to fight miss ismay for this man but there was this in her favour that she appealed directly to one side of his nature as agatha even if she had loved him would not have done  would you she said  dare you try  i might if i was tempted sufficiently  she leaned upon the table still looking at him mockingly and she was probably aware that her pose and expression were wholly provocative indeed she could not have failed to recognise the meaning of the sudden tightening of his lips though she did not in the least shrink from it  she had not the faintest doubt of her ability to keep him at a due distance if it appeared necessary  oh she said you only say things  hawtrey laughed and stooping down picked up a package he had brought from the store  well he said after all i think id rather try if i can please you  he opened the package  are these things very much too big for you sally  illustration are these things very much too big for you sally  the girls eyes glistened at the sight of the mittens he held out they were very different from the kind she had hitherto been in the habit of wearing and when he carelessly took out the fur cap she broke into a little cry of delight  in the meanwhile hawtrey watched her with a rather curious expression  he was not quite sure he had meant sally to have the things when he had purchased them but he was quite contented now  the one gift he had somewhat diffidently offered agatha since her arrival in canada had been almost coldly laid aside  in another few minutes sally laid out supper and as she waited upon him daintily or filled his cup hawtrey thrust the misgivings he had felt further behind him  sally he thought with a little dry smile could certainly cook  when the meal was over he sat talking about nothing in particular for almost an hour and then stood up  it occurred to him that sallys mother would be back before very long and she was a person he had no great liking for  well he said i must be getting home  wont you let me see you with that cap on  sally who betrayed no diffidence put on the cap and stood before a little dingy mirror with both hands raised while she pressed it down upon her gleaming hair  then she flashed a smiling glance at him  it was quite sufficient and as she turned again hawtrey slipped forward as softly as he could  she swung round however with a flush in her face and a forceful restraining gesture  dont spoil it all gregory she said sharply  hawtrey who saw that she meant itwhich was a cause of some astonishment to himdropped his hand  oh he said if you look at it in that way im sorry  goodnight sally  she let him go but she smiled when he drove away and half an hour later she showed the cap and mittens to her mother with significant candour  mrs creighton who was a severely practical person nodded  well she said he only wants a little managing if he bought you these and nobody could say you ran after him  i wouldnt anyway some of them dont like it     chapter xx  the first stake  a fortnight had slipped by since the evening hawtrey had spent with sally when winifred and sproatly once more arrived at the hastings homestead  the girl was looking a trifle jaded and it appeared that the manager of the elevator who had all along treated her with a good deal of consideration had insisted upon her going away for a few days now the pressure of business which had followed the harvest had slackened  sproatly as usual had driven her in from the settlement  when the evening meal was over they drew their chairs close up about the stove and hastings thrust fresh birch billets into it for there was a bitter frost  mrs hastings installed winifred in a canvas lounge and wrapped a shawl about her  you havent got warm yet and youre looking quite worn out she said  i suppose hamilton has still been keeping you at work until late at night  we have been very busy since i was last here winifred admitted and then turned to hastings  until the last week or so there has been no slackening in the rush to sell  everybody seems to have been throwing wheat on to the market  hastings looked thoughtful  a good many of the smaller men have been doing so but i think theyre foolish  theyre only helping to break down prices and i shouldnt wonder if one or two of the big longheaded buyers saw their opportunity in the temporary panic  in fact if id a pile of dollars lying in the bank im not sure that i wouldnt send along a buying order and operate for a rise  his wife shook her head at him  no she said you certainly wouldnt while i had any say in the matter  youre rather a good farmer but i havent met one yet who made a successful speculator some of our friends have tried itand you know where it landed them i expect those broker and mortgage men must lick their lips when a nice fat woolly farmer comes along  it must be quite delightful to shear him  hastings laughed  i should like to point out that most of the farmers in this country are decidedly thin and have uncommonly little wool on them  then he turned to the rest  i feel inclined to tell you how mrs hastings made the expenses of her paris trip its an example of feminine consistency  she went round the neighbourhood and bought all the wheat anybody had left on hand up or at least she made me do it  his wife who had as it happened means of her own nodded  that was different she said anyway i had the wheat and iknewit would go up  then why shouldnt other folks sell forward for instance when they know it will go down  thats not what i suggested doing but the points the same  they havent got the wheat  of course they wouldnt operate for a fall if they had  on the other hand if their anticipations proved correct they could buy it for less than they sold at before they had to deliver  that said mrs hastings severely is pure gambling  its sure to land one in the hands of the mortgage jobber  hastings smiled at the others  as a matter of fact it not infrequently does but i want you to note the subtle distinction  the things quite legitimate if youve only got the wheat in a bag  in such a case you must naturally operate for a rise  theres a good deal to be said for that point of view observed sproatly  you can keep the wheat if youre not satisfied but when you try the other plan the margin that may vanish at any moment is the danger  i suppose gregory has still been selling the range wheat winifred  i believe we have sent on every bushel  sproatly exchanged a significant glance with hastings whose face once more grew thoughtful  then said the latter drily if hes wise hell stop at that  mrs hastings changed the subject and drew her chair closer in to the stove which snapped and crackled cheerfully  it must be a good deal colder where harry is she said with a shiver  she flashed a swift glance at agatha and saw her expression change but sproatly broke in again  it was bad enough driving in from the railroad this afternoon he said  winifred was almost frozen which is why i didnt go round by creightons for the pattern mati think thats what he said it wasmrs creighton borrowed from you  i met him at the settlement a day or two ago  mrs hastings said that he could bring it another time and while the rest talked of something else winifred turned to agatha  it really was horribly cold and i almost fancied one of my hands was frostnipped she said  as it happens i cant buy mittens like your new ones  my new ones said agatha  the ones gregory bought you  agatha laughed  my dear he never gave me any  winifred pursed her face up  well she persisted he certainly bought them and a fur cap too  i was in the store when he did it though i dont think he noticed me  they were lovely mittenssuch a pretty brown fur  just then mrs hastings unobserved by either of them looked up and caught sproatlys eye  his face became suddenly expressionless and he looked away  when was that asked agatha  a fortnight ago anyway  agatha sat silent and was rather glad when mrs hastings asked winifred a question  she desired no gifts from gregory but since he had bought the cap and mittens she wondered what he could have done with them  it was rather disconcerting to feel that while he evidently meant to hold her to her promise he must have given them to somebody else  she had as it happened never heard of his acquaintance with sally creighton but it struck her as curious that although the six months delay he had granted her had lately expired he had neither sent her any word nor called at the homestead  a few minutes later mrs hastings took up a basket of sewing she had been engaged in and moved towards the door  sproatly who rose as she approached him drew aside his chair and she handed the basket to him  you can carry it if you like she said  sproatly took the basket and followed her into another room where he sat it down  well he said with a twinkle in his eyes  mrs hastings regarded him thoughtfully  i wonder if you know what gregory did with those mittens  im rather pleased that i can assure that i dont  do you imagine that he kept them  im afraid i havent an opinion on that point  still if i said that i felt certain he had given them to somebody you would have some idea as to who it would probably be  well said sproatly reluctantly if you insist upon it i must admit that i could make a guess  mrs hastings smiled in a manner which suggested comprehension  so could i she said  i shouldnt wonder if we both guessed right  now you may as well go back to the others  sproatly who made no answer turned away and he was talking to agatha when half an hour later a waggon drew up outside the door  in another minute or two he leaned forward in amused expectation as sally walked into the room  im going on to landers and just called to bring back the mat you lent us she said to mrs hastings  sproatly was to have come for it but he didnt  sproatly who said he was sorry fixed his eyes on her  it was clear to him that agatha did not understand the situation but he rather fancied from her expression that sally was filled with an almost belligerent satisfaction  she was then wearing a very smart fur cap and she carried a pair of new fur mittens which she had just stripped off in one hand  sproatly who glanced at them noticed that winifred did the same  then mrs hastings spoke  i dont think you have met miss ismay sally she said  sally merely said that she had not and sproatly became more sure that the situation was an interesting one when mrs hastings formally presented her  it was clear to him that agatha was somewhat puzzled by sallys attitude  as a matter of fact agatha who said that she must have had a cold drive was regarding the new arrival with a curiosity she had not expected to feel when she first came in  miss creighton she admitted was comely though she was clearly somewhat primitive and crude  the long skin coat she wore hid her figure but her pose was too virile and there was a look which puzzled agatha in her eyes  it was almost openly hostile and there was a suggestion of triumph in it  agatha who could find no possible reason for this resented it  in the meanwhile sally remained standing and as she said nothing further there was a somewhat awkward silence  she was the dominant figure in the room and the others became sensible of a certain slight constraint and embarrassment as she gazed at agatha with unwavering eyes  in fact it was rather a relief to them when at length she turned to mrs hastings  i cant stop  it wouldnt do to leave the team in this frost she said  this was so evident that they let her go and mrs hastings who went with her to the door afterwards sat down beside sproatly a little apart from the rest  ive no doubt you noticed those mittens she said softly  i did sproatly admitted  i think you can rely upon my discretion if you hadnt wanted this assurance i dont suppose youd have said anything upon the subject  it however seems very probable that winifred noticed them too  does that mean youre not sure that winifreds discretion is equal to your own  sproatlys eyes twinkled  in this particular case the trouble is that shes animated by a sincere attachment to miss ismay and has i understand a rather poor opinion of gregory  of course i dont know how far your views on that point coincide with hers  do you expect me to explain them to you  no said sproatly im only anxious to keep out of the thing gregory as it happens is a friend of mine and after all he has his strong points  i should however like to mention that winifreds expression suggests that shes thinking of something  his companion smiled  then i must endeavour to have a word or two with her  she left him with this and not long afterwards she and winifred went out together while when the others were retiring she detained agatha for a minute or two in the empty room  havent the six months gregory gave you run out yet she asked  agatha said they had but it was evident that she had attached no particular significance to the fact that sally had worn a new fur cap  he hasnt been over to see you since  the girl who admitted it looked troubled and mrs hastings laid a hand upon her shoulder  my dear she said if he does come you must put him off  why agatha asked in a low strained voice  for one thing because we want to keep you and mrs hastings looked at her with a very friendly smile  are you very anxious to make it up with gregory  a little shiver ran through the girl  oh she said i cant answer you that  i must do what is right  then somewhat to her astonishment her companion drew her a little nearer stooped and kissed her  most of us i believe have that wish but the thing is often horribly complex she said  anyway you must put gregory off again if its only for another month or two  i fancy you will not find it remarkably difficult  she turned away with that but her manner had been so significant that agatha who did not sleep very well that night decided that if it was possible she would act on her advice  in the meanwhile it happened that a little very dapper gentleman who was largely interested in the landagency and general mortgage business was spending the evening with hawtrey in wyllards room at the range he had driven round by hawtreys homestead earlier in the afternoon and had deduced a good deal from the state of it though this was a point he kept to himself  now he lay in a lounge chair beside the stove smoking one of wyllards cigars and unobtrusively watching his companion  there was a roll of bills in his pocket which the latter had very reluctantly parted with  in view of the fall in wheat it must have been rather a pull for you to pay me that interest he said  it certainly was hawtrey admitted with a somewhat rueful smile im sorry it had to be done  i dont quite see how you made it persisted the other man  what you got for your wheat couldnt have done much more than cover working expenses  hawtrey laughed  he was quite aware that his companions profession was not one that was regarded with any great favour by the prairie farmers but he was never particularly cautious and he rather liked the man  as a matter of fact it didnt edmonds he said  you see i practically paid you out of what i get for running this place  the red wheat wyllard raises generally commands a cent or two a bushel more from the big milling people than anything put on the market round here  edmonds made a sign of agreement  he had without directly requesting him to do so led hawtrey into showing him round the range that afternoon and having of necessity a practical knowledge of farming he had been impressed by all that he had noticed  the farm which was a big one had evidently been ably managed until a little while ago and he felt the strongest desire to get his hands on it  this as he admitted would have been out of the question had wyllard been at home but with hawtrey upon whom he had a certain hold in charge the thing appeared by no means impossible  oh yes he said  i suppose he was reasonably liberal over your salary  i dont get one  i take a share of the margin after everything is paid  edmonds carefully noted this  he was not sure that such an arrangement would warrant one in regarding hawtrey as wyllards partner but he meant to gather a little more information upon that point by and bye  if wheat keeps on dropping there wont be any margin at all next year and thats what im inclined to figure on he said  there are however ways a man with nerve could turn it to account  you mean by selling wheat down  yes said edmonds thats just what i mean  of course there is a certain hazard in the thing  you can never be quite sure how the market will go but the signs everywhere point to still cheaper wheat next year  thats your view  edmonds smiled and took out of his pocket a little bundle of market reports  other folks seem to share it in winnipeg chicago new york and liverpool  you cant get behind these stock statistics though of course dead low prices are apt to cut the output  hawtrey read the reports with evident interest and as it happened they were all in the same pessimistic strain though he was not aware that his companion had carefully selected them with a view to the effect he fancied they would produce  edmonds who saw the interest in his eyes leaned towards him confidentially when he spoke again  i dont mind admitting that im taking a hand in a big bear operation he said  its rather outside my usual business but the thing looks almost certain  hawtrey glanced at him with a gleam in his eyes  there was no doubt that the prospect of acquiring dollars by an easier method than toiling in the rain and wind appealed to him  if its good enough for you it should be safe he said  the trouble is that ive nothing to put in  then youre not empowered to lay out wyllards money  if that was the case it shouldnt be difficult to pile up a bigger margin than youre likely to do by farming  hawtrey started for the idea had already crept into his mind  in a way i am but im not sure that im warranted in operating on the market with it  have you the arrangement you made with him in writing  hawtrey opened a drawer and edmonds betrayed no sign of the satisfaction he felt when he was handed a somewhat informally worded document  he perused it carefully and it seemed to him that it constituted his companion a partner in the range which was satisfactory  then he looked up thoughtfully  now he said while i naturally cant tell what wyllard contemplated this paper certainly gives you power to do anything you think advisable with his money  in any case i understand that he cant be back until well on in next year  i shouldnt expect him until late in the summer anyway  there was silence for a moment or two and during it hawtreys face grew a trifle hard  it was unpleasant to look forward to the time when he would be required to relinquish the charge of the range and of late he had been wondering how he could make the most of the situation in the meanwhile  then his companion spoke again  its almost certain that the operation i suggested can only result one way and it appears most unlikely that wyllard would raise any trouble if you handed him several thousand dollars over and above what you had made by farming  i cant imagine a man objecting to that kind of thing  hawtrey sat still with indecision in his eyes for half a minute and edmonds who was too wise to say anything leaned back in his chair then hawtrey turned to the drawer again with an air of sudden resolution  ill give you a cheque for a couple of thousand dollars which is as far as i care to go just now he said  he took a pen and edmonds watched him with quiet amusement as he wrote  as a matter of fact hawtrey was in one respect at least perfectly safe in entrusting the money to him  edmonds had deprived a good many prairie farmers of their possessions in his time but he never stooped to any crude trickery  he left that to the smaller fry just then he was playing a deep and cleverly thoughtout game  he pocketed the cheque hawtrey gave him and then discussed other subjects for half an hour or so until he rose  you might ask them to get my team out  ive some business at landers and have ordered a room there he said  ill send you a line when theres any change in the market     chapter xxi  gregory makes up his mind  wheat was still being flung on to a lifeless market when hawtrey walked out of the mortgage jobbers place of business in the railroad settlement one bitter afternoon  he had a big roll of paper money in his pocket and was feeling particularly pleased with himself for prices had steadily fallen since he had joined in the bear operation edmonds had suggested and the result of it had proved eminently satisfactory  this was why he had just given the latter a further draft on wyllards bank with instructions to sell wheat down on a considerably more extensive scale  he meant to operate in earnest now which was exactly what the broker had anticipated but in this case he had decided to let hawtrey operate alone  indeed being an astute and farseeing man he had gone so far as to hint that caution might be advisable though he had at the same time been careful to show hawtrey only those market reports which had a distinctly pessimistic tone edmonds was rather disposed to agree with the men who looked forward to a reaction before very long  hawtrey glanced about him as he strode down the street  it was wholly unpaved and rutted deep but the drifted snow had partly filled the hollows up and it did not look very much rougher than it would have done if somebody had recently driven a plough through it  a rude plank sidewalk ran along both sides of it raised a foot or two above the ground that footpassengers might escape the mire of the thaw in spring and immediately behind the sidewalk squat weatherbeaten frame houses all of much the same pattern rose abruptly  in some of them however the fronts were carried up as high as the ridge of the shingled roof giving them an unpleasantly square appearance  here and there a dilapidated waggon stood with lowered pole before a store but it was a particularly bitter afternoon and there was nobody in the street  the place looked desolate and forlorn with a leaden sky hanging over it and an icy wind sweeping through the streets  hawtrey however was used to that and strode along briskly until he reached the open space which divided the little wooden town from the unfenced railroad track  it was strewn with fine dusty snow and the huge bulk of the grain elevators towered high above it against the lowering sky  as it happened a freight locomotive was just hauling a long string of wheat cars out of a sidetrack amidst a discordant tolling of its bell  it stopped presently and though hawtrey could not see anything beyond the big cars he fancied by the shouts which broke out that something unusual was going on  he was expecting sally who was going east to brandon by a train due in an hour or two  when the shouts grew a little louder he walked round in front of the locomotive which stood still with the steam blowing noisily from a valve and as soon as he had done so he saw the cause of the commotion a pair of vicious halfbroken bronchos were backing a light waggon away from the locomotive on the other side of the track and a furwrapped figure sat stiffly on the driving seat  hawtrey called out and ran suddenly forward as he saw that it was sally  just then one of the horses lifted its fore hoofs off the ground and being jerked back by the pole plunged and kicked furiously until its companion flung up its head and the waggon went backwards with a run then they stopped and there was a further series of resounding crashes against the front of the vehicle  hawtrey was within a pace or two of it when sally recognised him  keep off she said you cant lead them  they dont want to cross the track but theyve got to if i pull the jaws off them  this was more forcible than elegant and the shrill harshness of the girls voice jarred upon hawtrey though he was getting accustomed to sallys phraseology  he however recognised that she would not have his help even if it would have been of much avail which was doubtful and he reluctantly moved back towards the group of loungers who were watching her  i guess youve no call to worry about her said one of them  shes holding them on the lowest notch and its a mighty powerful bit fixing  besides that girl could drive anything that goes on four legs  sure said one of the others  shes a daisy  hawtrey was a little annoyed to notice that in place of being embarrassed by it sally evidently rather enjoyed the situation though several of the freight train and station hands had now joined the group of loungers and were cheering her on  he had already satisfied himself that she had not a trace of fear  in another moment or two however he forgot his slight sense of disconcertion for sally sitting tense and strung up on the driving seat with a glow in her cheeks and a snap in her eyes was wholly admirable  there was lithe grace virility and resolution in every line of her furwrapped figure  it is possible that her appearance would have been less effective in a drawing room but in the waggon she was in her place and in harmony with her surroundings  lowering sky gleaming snow furclad men and even the big dingy locomotive all fitted curiously into the scene and she made an imposing central figure as she contended with the halftamed team  hawtrey was conscious of a stirring of his physical nature as he watched her  the struggle lasted for several minutes during which the horses plunged and kicked again until sally stood boldly erect a moment while the waggon rocked to and fro a tall straight figure with a tress of loosened hair streaming out beneath her fur cap as she swung the stinging whip  then it seemed that the team had had enough for as she dropped lightly back into the seat they broke into a gallop and in another moment the waggon jolting horribly as it bounced across the track vanished behind the locomotive  gregory heard a shout of acclamation as he turned and hurried after it  sally however drove right through the settlement and back outside it before she could check the horses and she had just pulled them up in front of the wooden hotel when hawtrey reached it  he stood beside the waggon holding up his hand to her and sally who laughed dropped bodily into his arms which was as he recognised a thing that agatha certainly would not have done  he set her down upon the sidewalk and when a man came out to take the team they went into the hotel together  it was the locomotive that did it she explained  they were most too scared for anything but i hate to be beaten by a team  ours know too much to try but i got haslem to drive me in  i dropped him at nortons wholl bring him on  he oughtnt to have left you with them said hawtrey severely  sally laughed  well she said id quit driving if i couldnt handle any team you or haslem could put the harness on  in a general way the hotels in the smaller prairie settlements offer one very little comfort or privacy  as a rule they contain two general rooms in one of which the three daily meals are served with a punctuality which is as unvarying as the menu  the traveller who arrives a few minutes too late for one must wait until the next is ready  the second room usually contains a rusty stove and a few uncomfortable benches and there are not infrequently a couple of rows of very small matchboarded cubicles on the floor overhead  the occident was however a notable exception  for one thing the building was unusually large and its proprietor had condescended to study the requirements of his guests who came for the most part from the outlying settlements  there were two rooms above the general lounge one of which was reserved for the wives or daughters of the farmers who drove in long distances to purchase stores or clothing  in the other drygoods travellers were permitted to display their wares and though this was very unusual in that country any privileged customer who wished to leave by a train the departure of which did not synchronize with the hotel arrangements was occasionally supplied with a meal  it was getting dusk when hawtrey and sally entered the first of the two rooms where the proprietors wife was just lighting the big lamp  she smiled at the man who was as it happened a favourite of hers  go right along and ill bring your supper up in a minute or two she said  i guess youll want it after your drive  hawtrey strode on down a short corridor towards the second room but sally stopped behind him a moment  is hastings in town she asked  i thought i saw his new waggon outside  his wife is said the other woman  she and miss ismay drove in to buy some things  sally asked no further questions  it was evident that mrs hastings would not start home until after supper and as the regular hotel meal would be ready in about half an hour it seemed certain that she would come back to the hotel very shortly  that left sally very little time for she had no desire that hawtrey should meet either mrs hastings or agatha until she had carried out the purpose she had in hand  it was at gregorys special request she had permitted him to drive in to see her off and she meant to make the most of the opportunity  she had long ago regretted her folly in running away from his homestead when he lay helpless but things had changed considerably since then  she said nothing about what she had heard to hawtrey when she entered the second room  it was cosily warm and brightly lighted and the little table was laid out for two with a daintiness very uncommon on the prairie  it was a change for sally to be waited on and have a meal set before her which she had not made with her own fingers and she sank into a chair with a smile of appreciation  its real nice gregory she said  suppers never quite the same when youve had to stand over the stove ever so long getting it ready she sighed whimsically  when i have to do that after working hard all day i dont want to eat it  the man felt compassionate  sally as he was aware had to work unusually hard at the little desolate homestead where she and her mother perforce undertook a good many duties that do not generally fall to a womans share  creighton who was getting an old man was of grasping nature and only hired assistance when it was indispensibly necessary  well he said im not particularly fond of cooking either  sally glanced at him with a provocative smile for he had given her a lead  then she said why dont you get somebody else to do it for you  this was as the man recognised almost painfully direct but there was no doubt that sally looked very pretty with the faint flush of colour in her cheeks and the tantalising light in her eyes  as a matter of fact thats a thing ive been thinking over rather often the last few months he said and laughed  its rather a pity you dont seem to like cooking sally  sally appeared to consider this  oh she said it depends a good deal on who its for  hawtrey became suddenly serious for a moment or two  there was no doubt that he would at one time have considered it impossible that he should marry a girl of sallys description and even now he had misgivings  he had however almost made up his mind and he was not exactly pleased that the proprietors wife came in with the meal just then and stayed to talk awhile  when she went out he watched sally with close and what he fancied was unobtrusive attention while she ate and though he was sensible of the indelicacy of this he was once more relieved to find that she did nothing that was actually repugnant to him  after all there was a certain daintiness about the girl and her frank appreciation of the good things set before her only amused him  she was certainly much more amusing than agatha had been since she came out to canada and her cheerful laughter had a pleasant ring  when at length the meal was over she bade him draw her chair up to the stove  now she said and pointed to another chair across the room you can sit yonder and smoke  i know you want to  hawtrey remembered that agatha did not like tobacco smoke and had always been inclined to exact a certain conventional deference which he had grown to regard as rather out of place upon the prairie  thats a very long way off he objected  sally showed no sign of conceding the point as he had expected and he took out his pipe  he wanted to think for once more instincts deep down in him stirred in faint protest against what he almost meant to do  there were also several points that required practical consideration and among them were his financial difficulties though these did not trouble him so much as they had done a few months earlier  for a minute or two neither of them said anything and then sally spoke again  youre worrying about something gregory she said  hawtrey admitted it  yes he said i am  my place is a poor one and when wyllard comes home i shall have to go back to it again things would be so much easier for me just now if i had the range  the girl looked at him steadily with reproach in her eyes  oh she said your place is quite big enough if youd only take hold and run it as it ought to be run  you could surely do it gregory if you tried  the mans resistance grew feebler as it usually did when his prudence was at variance with his desires  sallys words were in this case wholly guileless as he recognised and they stirred him  he said nothing however and she spoke again  isnt it worth while though there are things you would have to give up she said  you couldnt go away and waste your dollars in winnipeg every now and then  hawtrey laughed  no he admitted i suppose if i meant to make anything of the place that couldnt be done  still you see its horribly lonely sitting by oneself beside the stove in the long winter nights  i wouldnt want to go to winnipeg if i had only somebody to keep me company  he turned towards her suddenly with decision in his face and sally lowered her eyes  dont you think you could get anybody if you tried she asked  the trouble said hawtrey gravely is that i have so little to offer them  its a poor place and im almost afraid sally that im rather a poor farmer  as you have once or twice pointed out i dont stay with things  still it might be different if there was any particular reason why i should  he rose and crossing the room stood close beside her chair  sally he added would you be afraid to take hold and see what you could make of the place and me  perhaps you could make something though it would probably be very hard work my dear  the blood surged into the girls face and she looked up at him with open triumph in her eyes  it was her hour and sally as it happened was not afraid of anything  oh she said you really want me  yes said hawtrey quietly i think i have wanted you for ever so long though i did not know it until lately  then she said ill do what i can gregory  hawtrey bent his head and kissed her with a deference he had not expected to feel for there was something in the girls simplicity and the completeness of her surrender which though the thing seemed astonishing laid a restraint on him  then as he sat down on the arm of her chair with a hand upon her shoulder he was more astonished still for she quietly made it clear that she expected a good deal from him  for one thing he realised that she meant him to take and keep a foremost place among his neighbours and though sally had not the gift of clear and imaginative expression it became apparent that this was less for her own sake than his  she was with somewhat crude forcefulness trying to rouse a sense of responsibility in the man to incite him to resolute action and wholesome restraint and as he remembered what he had hitherto thought of her a salutary sense of confusion crept upon him  she seemed to recognise it for at length she glanced up at him sharply  what is it gregory  why do you look at me like that she asked  hawtrey smiled in a rather curious fashion  hitherto she had made her appeal through his senses to one side of his nature only  there was no doubt on that point but now it seemed there were in her qualities he had never suspected  she had desired him as a husband but it was becoming clear that she would not be content with the mere possession of him  sally it seemed had wider ideas in her mind and though the thing seemed almost ludicrous she wanted to be proud of him  my dear he said i cant quite tell youbut you have made me rather badly ashamed  in some respects im afraid its a very rash thing you are going to do  she looked at him with candid perplexity and then appeared to dismiss the subject with a smile  there is so much i want to say and it maynt be so easyafterwards she said  its a pity the train starts so soon  we can get over that difficulty anyway said hawtrey  ill come on as far as i can with you and get back from one of the way stations by the pacific express  sally made no objections and drawing a little closer to him she talked on in a low voice earnestly     chapter xxii  a painful revelation  a sprinkle of snow was driving down the unpaved street before the bitter wind when mrs hastings came out of a store in the settlement and handed sproatly who was waiting close by several big packages  you can put them into the waggon and tell jake well want the team as soon as suppers over she said  were going to stay with mrs ormond tonight and i dont want to get there too late  sproatly took the parcels and mrs hastings turned to agatha who stood a pace or two behind her with winifred  now she said if theres nothing else you want to buy well go across to the hotel  they reached it a few minutes later and were standing in a big and rather comfortless room when sproatly rejoined them  this place is quite shivery said mrs hastings  they generally have the stove lighted in the little room along the corridor  go and see jim  sproatly went out and as it happened he was wearing gumboots which make very little noise  he proceeded along a dark corridor and then stopped abruptly when he had almost reached a partlyopen door for he could see into a lighted room  hawtrey was sitting near the stove inside it on the arm of sallys chair  then though he was not greatly astonished sproatly drew back a pace or two into the shadow for it became evident that there were only two courses open to him  he could judiciously announce his presence by making the door rattle and then go in and mention as casually as possible that mrs hastings and agatha were in the hotel  he felt that he ought to do it but there was the difficulty that he could not warn hawtrey without embarrassing sally  sproatly pursed his face up in honest perplexity as it became evident that the situation was a delicate one and then decided on the alternative  he would go back quietly and keep mrs hastings out of the room if it could be done  i think you would be just as comfortable where you are he informed her when he joined the others  im rather doubtful  said mrs hastings  wasnt the stove lighted  yes said sproatly i fancy it was  but i sent you to make sure  the fact is i didnt go in said sproatly uneasily  theres somebody in the room already  any of the boys would go out if they knew we wanted it  oh yes said sproatly  still you see its only a small room and one of them has been smoking  mrs hastings flashed a keen glance at him and then smiled in a manner he did not like  it suggested that while she yielded to his objections in the meanwhile she had by no means abandoned the subject  well she said what shall we do until supper  this stove wont draw properly and i dont feel inclined to sit shivering here  then sproatly was seized by what proved to be a singularly unfortunate inspiration  its really not snowing much and well go down to the depôt and watch the atlantic express come in he suggested  its one of the things everybody does  this was as a matter of fact correct  there are not many amusements open to the inhabitants of the smaller settlements along the railroad track and the arrival of the infrequent trains is a source of unflagging interest to most of them  mrs hastings fell in with the suggestion and sproatly was congratulating himself upon his diplomacy when agatha stopped as they reached the door of the hotel  oh she said ive only brought one of my mittens  ill go back for the other said sproatly promptly  you dont know where i left it  then ill lend you one of mine  it will certainly go on the man persisted  agatha objected to this and sproatly who fancied that mrs hastings was watching him let her go after which he and the others moved out into the street  agatha in the meanwhile ran back to the room they had left and finding the mitten had reached the head of the stairway when she heard voices behind her in the corridor  she recognised them and turned in sudden astonishment standing as it happened in the shadow though not far away a stream of light from the door of the room shone out into the corridor  next moment hawtrey and sally approached the door and as the light fell upon them the blood surged into agathas face for she remembered the embarrassment in sproatlys manner and that he had done all he could to prevent her going back for the mitten  then hawtrey spoke to sally and there was no doubt whatever that he called her my dear  agatha stood still a moment filled with burning indignation and they were almost upon her before she turned and fled precipitately down the stairway  she felt that this was horribly undignified but she could not stay and face them  when she overtook the others she had however at least recovered her outward composure and they went on together towards the track  as yet she was only sensible of anger at the mans treachery  it possessed her too completely for her to be conscious of anything else  cold as it was there were a good many loungers in the station and sproatly who spoke to one or two of them led his party away from the little shed they hung about and walked briskly up and down beside the track until a speck of blinking light rose out of the white wilderness it grew rapidly larger until they could make out a trail of smoke behind it and the roar of wheels rose in a long crescendo  then a bell commenced to toll and the blaze of a big lamp beat into their faces as the great locomotive came clanking into the station  it stopped and the light from the long car windows fell upon the groups of watching furclad men while here and there a shadowy object that showed black against it leaned out from a platform  there was however no sign of any passengers for the train until at the last moment two figures appeared hurrying along beneath the cars  they drew nearer and agatha set her lips tight as she recognised them for the light from a vestibule shone into hawtreys face as he half lifted sally on to one of the platforms and sprang up after her  then the bell tolled again and the train slid slowly out of the station with its lights flashing upon the snow  agatha turned away abruptly and walked a little apart from the rest the thing she felt only admitted of one explanation and she did not wish her companions to see her face for the next minute or two sproatlys diplomacy had had a most unfortunate result and she was sensible of an almost intolerable disgust  she had kept faith with gregory at least as far as it was possible to her and he had utterly humiliated her  the affront he had put upon her was almost unbearable  in the meanwhile mrs hastings walked up to sproatly who feeling distinctly uncomfortable had drawn back judiciously into the shadow  now she said i understand  you of course anticipated this  i didnt said sproatly with a decision which carried conviction with it  i certainly saw them at the hotel but how could i imagine that they had anything of the kind in view  he broke off for a moment and waved his hand  after all he added what right have you to think it now  mrs hastings laughed somewhat harshly  unfortunately i have my eyes but ill admit that theres a certain obligation on me to make quite certain before going any further  thats why i want you to ascertain where he checked his baggage to  im afraid thats more than im willing to undertake  do you consider it advisable to set the station agent wondering about the thing besides once or twice in my career appearances have been rather badly against me and im not altogether convinced yet  mrs hastings let the matter drop and they went back rather silently to the hotel while as soon as supper was over she bade sproatly get their waggon out and drove away with agatha  she said very little to the girl during the long cold journey and they had no opportunity of private conversation when they reached the homestead where they were to spend the night which was as it happened a relief to agatha  she hated herself for the thought in her mind but everything seemed to warrant it and it would not be driven out  she had heard what gregory had called sally at the hotel and the fact that he must have bought his ticket and checked his baggage earlier in the afternoon when there was nobody about and then had run down with sally at the last moment evidently in order to escape observation was very significant  she drove home next day and on the following morning a man who was driving in to landers brought mrs hastings a note from sproatly  it was very brief and ran  gregory arrived same night by pacific train  it is evident he must have got off at the next station down the line  mrs hastings showed it to her husband  im afraid we have been too hasty  what am i to do with this she said  hastings smiled  since you ask my advice id put it into the stove  but it clears the man  isnt it my duty to show it to agatha  well said hastings reflectively im not sure that it is your duty to put ideas into her mind when you cant be quite certain that she has entertained them  i should be greatly astonished if she hadnt said the lady drily  hastings made a little whimsical gesture  oh he said youll no doubt do what you think wisest  in a general way when you come to me for advice you have made your mind up and only expect me to tell you that youre right  mrs hastings thought over the matter for another hour or two  for one thing agathas quiet manner puzzled her and she did not know that the girl had spent one night in an agony of anger and humiliation and had then become sensible of a relief that she was ashamed of  there was however no doubt that while she blamed herself for it and in some degree for what had happened she did feel relief  she was sitting alone for the time being beside the stove in a shadowy room while the light died off the snowy prairie outside when mrs hastings came softly in and sat down beside her  my dear she said its rather difficult to speak of but that little scene at the station must have hurt you  agatha looked at her quietly and searchingly but there was only sympathy in her face and she leaned forward impulsively  oh she said it hurt me horribly because i feel it was my fault i was the cause of it  how could that be  if i had only been kinder to him he would perhaps never have thought of her  i must have made it clear that he jarred upon me  i drove himand agatha turned her face away while her voice grew a trifle strainedinto that womans arms  no doubt she was ready to make the most of the opportunity  mrs hastings decided that the girls scorn and disgust which had prompted the last outbreak were perfectly natural but they were as it happened not quite warranted  in the first place she said i think you had better read this note  agatha took it from her and there was light enough left to show that the blood had crept into her face when she laid it down again  for almost a minute she sat very still  it is a great relief to know that i was wrongin one respect but you must not think i hated this girl because gregory had preferred her to me she said at length  when the first shock had passed there was an almost horrible satisfaction in feeling that he had released meat any cost  i suppose i shall always be ashamed of that  she broke off a moment and her voice was very quiet when she went on again  still she added what sproatly says does not alter the case so very much after all  it cant free me of my responsibility  if i hadnt driven him gregory would not have gone to her  you consider that in itself a very dreadful thing  agatha looked at her with suddenly lifted head  of course she said can you doubt it  her companion laughed though there was a little gleam in her eyes for this was an opportunity she had been waiting for  then she said you spoke like an englishwomanof stationjust out from the old countrybut im going to try to disabuse you of one impression  sally to put it crudely is quite good enough for gregory  in fact if she had been my daughter id have kept him away from her  to begin with once you strip gregory of his little surface graces and his clean english intonation how does he compare with the men you meet out here  what does his superiority consist of  is he truer or kinder than you have found most of them to be  has he a finer courage or a more resolute endurancea greater capacity for labour or a clearer knowledge of the calling by which he makes his living  agatha did not answer  she could not protest that gregory possessed any of these qualities and her companion went on again  has he even a more handsome person  i could point to a dozen men between here and the railroad whose clean selfdenying life has set a stamp on them that gregory will never wear  to descend to perhaps the lowest point of all has he more money  we know he wasted what he hadprobably in indulgenceand there is a mortgage on his farm  has he any sense of honour  he let sally believe he was in love with her before you even came out here and of late while he still claimed you he has gone back to her  cant you get away from your point of view and realise what kind of man he is  agatha turned her head away  ah she said i realised himseveral months ago  they were rather painful months to me  but you are quite sure he was in love with sally before i came out  well said mrs hastings his conduct suggested it  then she laid a caressing hand on the girls shoulder  you tried to keep faith with him  tried desperately i think  did you succeed  agatha contrived to meet her companions eyes  at least i would have married him  then said mrs hastings i can forgive gregory even his treachery and you have no cause to pity him  sallys simpleprimitive you would call herbut shes clever and capable in all practical things she will bear with gregory when you would turn from him in dismay and when its necessary she will not shrink from putting a little judicious pressure on him in a way you could not have done  it may sound incomprehensible but that girl will lead or drive gregory very much further than he could have gone with you  she doesnt regard him as perfection but she loves him  she broke off and there was for several minutes a tense silence in the little shadowy room  it had grown almost dark and the square of the window glimmered faintly with the dim light flung up by the snow  then agatha turned slowly in her chair  thank you she said in a low voice  you have taken a heavy weight off my mind  she paused a moment and then added you have been a good friend all along  it was supreme good fortune that placed me in your hands  mrs hastings patted her shoulder and then went out quietly and agatha lay still in her chair beside the stove  it snapped and crackled cheerfully but save for that there was a restful quietness and the room was cosily warm though she could hear a little icy wind wail about the building  it swept her thoughts away to the frozen north and she realised what it had cost her to keep faith with gregory as she pictured a little snowsheeted schooner hemmed in among the floes and two or three wornout men hauling a sled painfully over the ridged and furrowed ice  the man who had gone up into that great desolation had been endued with an almost fantastic sense of honour and now he might never even know that she loved him  she admitted that she had loved him several months ago     chapter xxiii  through the snow  next morning the mailcarrier who drove up to the homestead halffrozen and white all over out of a haze of falling snow brought agatha a note from gregory  it was brief and she read it with a smile of halfamused contempt though she admitted that considering everything he had handled the somewhat embarrassing situation gracefully  this however was only what she had expected of him and she recognised that it was equally characteristic of the man that he had written releasing her from her engagement instead of coming himself  gregory as she realised now had always taken the easiest way and it was evident that he had not even the courage to face her she quietly dropped his noteit did not seem worth while to fling itinto the stove  she could forgive him for choosing sally  though she was very human in most respects that scarcely troubled her but she could not forgive him for persisting in his claim to her while he was philanderingand this seemed the most fitting termwith her rival  had he only been honest she would not have let wyllard go away without some assurance of her regard which would have cheered him on his perilous journey and it was clear to her that he might never come back again  her face grew hard when she thought of it and she had thought of it of late very frequently  for that at least she felt she almost hated gregory  a month passed drearily with arctic frost outside on the prairie and little to do inside the homestead except to cook and gorge the stove and endeavour to keep warmth in one  water froze solid inside the building stinging draughts crept in through the double windows and there were evenings when mrs hastings and agatha shivering close beside the stove waited anxiously for the first sign of hastings and the hired man who were bringing back a sled loaded with birch logs from a neighbouring bluff  it was only a couple of miles away but men sent out to cut fuel in the awful cold snaps in that country have now and then sunk down in the snow with the life frozen out of them  there were other days when the wooden building seemed to rock beneath the buffeting of the icy hurricane and it was a perilous matter to cross the narrow open space between it and the stables through the haze of shirling snow  the weather however moderated a little by and bye and one afternoon soon after it did so mrs hastings drove off to landers with the one hired man they kept through the winter  her husband who insisted upon her taking him had set out earlier for the bluff and as the scandinavian maid had recently been married agatha was left in the house with the little girls  it was bitterly cold even inside the dwelling but agatha was busy baking and she failed to notice that the frost had once more become almost arctic until she stood beside a window as evening was closing in  a low dingy sky hung over the narrowing sweep of prairie which stretched back gleaming lividly into the creeping dusk but a few minutes later a haze of snow whirled across it and cut the dreary scene in half  then the light died out suddenly and she and the little girls drew their chairs close up to the stove  the house was very quiet but she could hear the mournful wailing of the wind about it and now and then the soft swish of driven snow upon the walls and roofing shingles  the table was laid for supper and a kettle was singing cheerfully upon the stove but there was no sign of the others and by and bye agatha commenced to feel a little anxious  mrs hastings she fancied would stay the night at landers if there was any unfavourable change in the weather which seemed to be the case but she wondered what could be detaining hastings  it was not very far to the bluff and as he could not have continued chopping in the darkness it seemed to her that he should have reached the homestead already  he did not come however and she grew more uneasy as the time slipped by while the wail of the wind grew louder and the stove crackled more noisily until at last one of the little girls rose with a cry and she fancied she heard a dull beat of hoofs  it grew plainer until she was sure of it but soon after that the sound ceased abruptly and she could not hear the rattle of flung down logs which she had expected this struck her as curious since she knew that hastings generally unloaded the sled before he led the team to the stable  she waited a moment or two but except for the doleful wind nothing broke the silence now and when it became oppressive she moved towards the door  the wind tore it from her grasp when she opened it and flung it against the wall with a jarring crash while a fine powder that stung the skin unbearably drove into her face  for a few moments she could see nothing but a filmy whirling haze and then as her eyes became accustomed to the change of light she dimly made out the blurred white figures of the horses standing still with the load of birch logs rising a shapeless mass behind them  there seemed to be nobody with them and though she twice called sharply no answer came out of the sliding snow  then she recognised the significant fact that the team had come home alone  it was difficult to close the door and before she accomplished it her hands had stiffened and grown almost useless and the hall was strewn with snow but it was very evident that there was something for her to do  it cost her three or four minutes to slip on a blanket skirt and soft hide moccasins with gum boots over them and then muffled shapeless in her furs she reassured the little girls and opened the door again  when she had contrived to close it the cold struck through her to the bone as she floundered towards the team  there was nobody she could look to for assistance but that could not be helped and it was evident to her that some misfortune had befallen hastings  the first thing necessary was to unload the sled and though the birches seldom grow to any size in a prairie bluff some of the logs were heavy  she was gasping with the effort when she had flung a few of them down after which she discovered that the rest were held up by one or two stout poles let into sockets  try as she would she could not get them out and then she remembered that hastings kept a whipsaw in a shed close by  she contrived to find it and attacked the poles in breathless haste working clumsily with mittened hands until there was a crash and rattle as she sprang clear  then she started the team and the rest of the logs rolled off into the snow  that was one difficulty overcome but the next appeared more serious she must find the bluff as soon as possible and in the snowfilled darkness she could not tell where it lay  even if she could have seen anything of the kind there was no landmark on the desolate level waste between it and the homestead  she however remembered that she had one guide  hastings and his hired man had of late hauled a good many loads of birch logs in and as this had made a wornout trail it seemed to her just possible that she might trace it back to the bluff  no great weight of snow had fallen as yet  before she set out she had a struggle with the team for the beasts had evidently no intention of making another journey if they could help it but at length she swung them into the narrow riband of trail and plodded away into the darkness at their heads  it was then she first clearly realised what she had undertaken  very little of her face was left bare between her furcap and collar but every inch of uncovered skin tingled as though it had been lashed with thorns or stabbed with innumerable needles  the air was thick with a fine powder that filled her eyes and nostrils the wind buffeted her and there was an awful coldthe cold that taxes the utmost strength of mind and body of those who are forced to face it on the shelterless prairie  still she struggled on feeling with halffrozen feet for the depression of the trail and grappling with a horrible dismay when she failed to find it for moments together  indeed she was never sure to what extent she guided the team and how far they headed for the bluff from mere force of habit but as the time went by and there was nothing before her but the whirling snow she grew feverishly apprehensive  the trail was becoming fainter and fainter and now and then she could find no trace of it for several minutes  the horses however floundered on blurred shapes as white as the haze they crept through and at length she felt that they were dipping into a hollow  then a faint sense of comfort crept into her heart as she remembered that a shallow ravine which seamed the prairie ran through the bluff  she called out and started at the faintness of her voice it seemed such a pitifully feeble thing  there was no answer nothing but the soft fall of the horses hoofs and the wail of the wind but the latter was reassuring for the volume of sound suggested that it was driving through a bluff close by  a few minutes later she cried out again and this time she felt the throbbing of her heart for a faint sound came out of the whirling haze  she pulled the horses up and as she stood still listening a blurred object appeared almost in front of them  it shambled forward in a curious manner stopped and moved again and in another moment or two hastings lurched by her with a stagger and sank down into a huddled white heap on the sled  she turned back towards him and he seemed to look up at her  illustration it shambled forward in a curious manner  turn the team he said  agatha did it and sat down beside him when the horses moved on again  a small birch i was chopping fell on me he said  i dont know if it smashed my ankle or if i twisted it wriggling clearthe thing pinned me down  its badly nipped any way  he spoke disconnectedly and hoarsely as if in pain and agatha who noticed that one of his gum boots was almost ripped to pieces realised part of what he must have felt  she knew that nobody held fast helpless could have withstood that cold for more than a very little while  oh she said it must have been dreadful  i found a branch hastings added  it helped me but i fell over every now and then  headed for the homestead  dont think i could have made it if you hadnt come for me  he broke off abruptly and turned to her  you mustnt sit down  walkkeep warmbut dont try to lead the team  agatha struggled forward as far as the near horses shoulder  the beasts slightly sheltered her and it was a little easier walking with a hand upon a trace  it was a relief to cling to something for the wind that flung the snow into her face drove her garments against her limbs so that now and then she could scarcely move  indeed when her strength commenced to flag every yard of that journey was made with infinite pain and difficulty  at times she could scarcely see the horses and again she stumbled along beside them for minutes blinded breathless and halfdazed  she did not know how hastings was faring but she halfconsciously recognised that if once she let the trace go the sled would slip away from her and she would sink down to freeze  at length however a dim mass crept out of the white haze ahead and a moment later a man laid hold of her  he told her that mrs hastings was with him and that the homestead was close at hand  agatha learned afterwards that they had reached it a little earlier and had immediately set out in search of her and hastings  in the meanwhile she floundered on beside the horses with another team dimly visible in front of her until a faint ray of light streamed out into the snow then the teams stopped and she had only a hazy recollection of staggering into a lighted room in the homestead and sinking into a chair  what they did with hastings she did not know but by and bye his wife who went with her to her room kissed her before she went out again  nobody could have faced the snow next morning and it was some days later when watson who had attended hawtrey after his accident was brought over  he did what he could but it was several weeks before hastings could use his injured foot again  before he recovered news was sent him of some difficulty in the affairs of a small creamery at a settlement further along the line in which he and his wife held an interest and mrs hastings went east to make inquiries respecting it she took agatha with her and one evening after she had finished the business she had in hand they left a little way station by the pacific train  the car they entered was empty except for two people who sat close together near the middle of it  a big lamp overhead shed down a brilliant light and agatha started when one of the two looked round as she approached them  in another moment she stood face to face with hawtrey who had risen while sally gazed up at her with a rather curious expression in her eyes  agatha however was perfectly composed now and felt no sympathy with hawtrey who was visibly confused  she was not astonished that he found the situation a somewhat difficult one  you have been to winnipeg she said  no said hawtrey with evident relief that she had chosen a safe topic only to brandon  sally has some friends there and she spends a day or two with them once or twice each winter  brandons quite a lively place after the prairie  i went in last night to bring her back  he turned to his companion  i think you have met miss ismay  agatha was conscious that sallys eyes were fixed upon her and that mrs hastings was watching them all with quiet amusement but she was a little astonished when the girl suggestively moved some wraps from the seat opposite her  yes she said i have  if miss ismay doesnt mind i should like to talk to her  hawtreys relief was evident and agatha glanced at him with a smile that was halfcontemptuous  he had carefully kept out of her way since he had written her the note and now it seemed only natural that if there was anything to be said he should leave it to sally  i think ill go along for a smoke he said and retired precipitately  mrs hastings looked after him and laughed in a manner at which sally seemed to wince  he doesnt seem anxious to talk to me she said  you can come along to the next car by and bye agatha  then she moved away and agatha who sat down opposite sally looked at her quietly  well she said  sally made a little deprecatory gesture ive something to say but its hard  to begin with are you very angry with me  no said agatha  i think i really am a little angry with gregory but not altogether because he chose you  sally seemed to consider this for a moment or two before she looked up again  well she said not long ago i wanted to hate you and i guess i most succeeded  it made things easier  still i want to say that i dont hate you now she hesitated a moment  id like you to forgive me  agatha smiled  in most respects i can do that willingly  sally seemed disconcerted by her quiet ease of manner and perfect candour  it was evidently not quite what she had looked for  then you were never very fond of him she suggested  no said agatha reflectively since you have compelled me to say it i dont think now that i ever was really fond of him though i dont know how i can make that quite clear to you  it was only when i came out here irealisedgregory  it was not the actual man i fell in love with in england  sally turned her face away for agatha had as it happened made her meaning perfectly plain  somewhat to the latters astonishment she showed no sign of resentment when she looked round again  then she said it is way better that you didnt marry him  she paused and seemed to search for words to express herself with  i knew all along all there was to know about gregoryexcept that he was going to marry you and it was some time before i heard thatand i was ready to take him  i was fond of him  agathas heart went out to her  yes she said simply it is a very good thing that i let him go  then she smiled  that however doesnt quite describe it sally  her companion flushed  i couldnt have said that but you dont quite understand yet  i said i knew all there was to know about himand you never did  you made too much of him in england and when you came out here you only saw the things you didnt like in him  still they werent the only ones  agatha started at this for she realised that part of it was certainly true and she could admit the possibility of the rest being equally correct  after all gregory might possess a few good qualities that she had never discovered  perhaps i did she admitted  i dont think it matters now  theyre all of them mixed persisted sally  one cant expect too much but you can bear with a good deal when youre fond of any one  agatha sat silent awhile for she was troubled by a certain sense of probably wholesome confusion  it seemed to her that sally had the clearer vision  love had given her discernment as well as charity and not expecting perfection it was the mans strong points she fixed her eyes upon  yes she said at length i am glad you look at it that way sally  the girl laughed  oh she said ive only seen one man on the prairie who was quite white all through and i had a kind of notion that he was fond of you  agatha sat very still but it cost her an effort  you mean she said at length  harry wyllard  agatha made no answer and sally changed the subject well she said after all i want you to be friends with me  i think you can count on that said agatha with a smile and in another minute or two she rose to rejoin mrs hastings     chapter xxiv  the landing  the ice among the inlets on the american side of the north pacific broke up unusually early when spring came round again and several weeks before wyllard had expected it the selache floated clear  her crew had suffered little during the bitter winter for dampier had kept them busy splicing gear and patching sails and they had fitted her with a new mainmast hewn out of a small cedar  none of them had been trained as carpenters but men who keep the sea for months in small vessels are necessarily handy at repairs and they had all used axe and saw to some purpose in their time  in any case wyllard was satisfied when they thrashed the selache out of the inlet under whole mainsail in a fresh breeze and when evening came he sat smoking near the wheel in a contemplative mood as the climbing forests and snowclad heights dropped back astern  he wondered what his friends were doing upon the prairie and whether agatha had married gregory yet  it seemed to him that this was at least possible for she was one to keep a promise and it was difficult to believe that gregory would fail to press his claim  his face grew grim as he thought of it though this was a thing he had done more or less constantly during the winter  he fancied that he might have ousted gregory if he had remained at the range for agatha had perhaps unconsciously shown him that she was at least not quite indifferent to him but that would have been to involve her in a breach of faith which she would probably have always looked back on with regret and in any case he could not have stayed  he knew he would never forget her but it was he admitted not impossible that she might forget him  he also realised though this was not by comparison a matter of great consequence that the range was scarcely likely to prosper under gregorys management but that could not be helped and after all he owed gregory something  it never occurred to him that he was doing an extravagant thing in setting out upon the search he had undertaken  he only felt that the obligation was laid upon him and being what he was he could not shrink from it  a puff of spray that blew into his face disturbed his meditations and when by and bye a little tumbling sea splashed in over the weather bow he rose and helped the others to haul a reef in the mainsail down that accomplished he went below and lugged out a wellworn chart while the selache drove away to the westwards over a whiteflecked sea  this time she carried fresh southerly breezes with her most of the way across the pacific and plunged along hove down under the last rag they dare set upon her with the big combers surging up abeam until at length they ran into the clammy fog close in with the kamtchatkan beaches  then the wind dropped and they were baffled by light and fitful airs while it became evident that there was ice about  the day they saw the first big mass of it gleaming broad across their course on a raw green sea dampier got an observation and they held a brief council in the little cabin that evening  the schooner was hove to then and lay rolling with banging blocks and thrashing canvas on a sluggish heave of sea  thirty miles off shore said dampier  if it had been clear enough wed have seen the top of the big range quite a way further out to sea now its drift ice ahead of us but its quite likely theres a solid block along the beach  winter holds on a long while in this country i guess youre for pushing on as fast as you can  wyllard nodded  of course he said youll look for an opening and work her in as far as possible  then if its necessary charly and i and another man will take the sled and head for the beach across the ice  if theres a lane anywhere i would however probably take the smallest boat  we might haul her a league or two anyway on the sled if the ice wasnt very rough  he looked at charly who made a little sign  well he said simply i guess ill have to see you through  now weve made a sled for her id take the boat anyway  were quite likely to strike a big streak of water when the ice is breaking up  theres one other course said dampier the sensible one and thats to wait until it has gone altogether  seems to me i ought to mention it though its not likely to appeal to you  wyllard laughed  from all appearances we might wait a month  i dont want to stay up here any longer than is strictly necessary  youll head north  thats my intention  then said dampier pointing to the chart before them as you should make the beach in the next day or two ill head for the inlet here  as its not very far you wont have to pack so many provisions along and ill give you say three weeks to turn up in  if you dont ill figure that theres something wrong and do what seems advisable  they agreed to that and when next morning a little breeze came out of the creeping haze they sailed her slowly shorewards among the drifting ice until at nightfall an apparently impenetrable barrier stretched gleaming faintly ahead of them  wyllard retired soon afterwards and slept soundly  all his preparations had been made during the winter and when at length morning broke he breakfasted before he went out on deck  the boat was already packed with provisions sleepingbags a tent and two light sled frames on one of which it seemed possible that they might haul her a few miles  she was very light and small and had been built for such a purpose as they had in view  in the meanwhile the schooner lay to with backed forestaysail tumbling wildly on a dim grey sea  half a mile away the ice ran back into a dingy haze and there was a low grey sky to weather  now and then a fine sprinkle of snow slid across the water before a nipping breeze as wyllard glanced to windward dampier strode up to him  i guess youd better put it off he said  i dont like the weather well have wind before long  wyllard only smiled and dampier made a little gesture  then he said id get on to the ice just as soon as you can youre still quite a way off the beach  wyllard shook hands with him  we should make the inlet in about nine days and if i dont turn up in three weeks youll know theres something wrong  if theres no sign of me in another week you can take her home again  then dampier who said nothing further bade them swing the boat over and when she lay heaving beneath the rail wyllard and charly and one indian dropped into her  it was only a preliminary search they were about to engage in for they had decided that if they found nothing they would afterwards push further north or inland when they had supplied themselves with fresh stores from the schooner  they gazed at her with somewhat grim faces as they pulled away and wyllard who loosed his oar a moment to wave his fur cap when dampier stood upon her rail was glad when a fresher rush of the bitter breeze forced him to fix his attention on his task  the boat was heavily loaded and the tops of the grey seas splashed unpleasantly close about her gunwale  she was running before them rising sharply and dropping down out of sight of all but the schooners canvas into the hollows and though this made rowing easier he was apprehensive of difficulties when he reached the ice  his misgivings proved warranted as they closed with it for it presented an almost unbroken wall against the face of which the sea spouted and fell in frothy wisps  there was no doubt as to what would happen if the frail craft was hurled upon that frozen mass and wyllard who was sculling fancied that before she could even reach it there was a probability of her being swamped in the upheaval where the backwash met the oncoming sea  charly looked at him dubiously  its a sure thing we cant get out there he said  wyllard nodded  then he said well pull along the edge of it until we find an opening or something to make a lee  the seas higher than it seemed to be from the schooner  weve got to do it soon said charly  theres more wind not far away  wyllard dipped his oar again and they pulled along the edge of the ice for an hour cautiously for there were now little frothing white tops on the seas  it was evident that the wind was freshening and at times a deluge of icy water slopped in over the gunwale  the men were further hampered by their furs and the stores among their feet and the perspiration dripped from wyllard when they approached a ragged jutting point  it did not seem advisable to attempt a landing on that side of it and when a little snow commenced to fall he looked at his companions  i guess weve got to pull her out said charly  dampiers heaving a reef down he sees whats working up to windward  wyllard could just make out the schooner which had apparently followed them a blurr of dusky canvas against a bank of haze and then as the boat slid down into a hollow there was nothing but the lowhung lowering sky  it was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly  well pull round the point first anyway he said  a shower of fine snow that blotted out the schooner broke upon them as they did it and the work was arduous  they were pulling to windward now and it was necessary to watch the seas that ranged up ahead and handle her circumspectly while the freshening breeze blew the spray all over them  they had to fight for every fathom and once or twice she nearly rolled over with them while the icy water grew steadily deeper inside her  then it became apparent by degrees that as they could not have reached the schooner had they attempted it they were pulling for their lives and that the one way of escape open to them was to find an opening of some kind round the point  its ragged tongue was horribly close to lee of them lapped in a foaming wash when the snow cleared for a minute or two and they saw that dampier had driven the selache further off the ice  she was hove to now and there was a black figure high up in her shrouds  just then however a bitter rush of wind hurled the spray about them and the boat fell off almost beam on to the sea in spite of all that they could do  the icy brine washed into her and it seemed almost certain that she would swamp or roll over before they could get way on her  still pulling desperately they drove her round the point then as gasping and dripping they made their last effort a sea rolled up ahead and wyllard had a momentary glimpse of an opening not far away as she swung up with it  he shouted to his companions but could not tell whether they heard and understood him for after that he was only conscious of sculling savagely until another sea broke into her and she struck  there was a crash and she swung clear with the backwash with all one side smashed in  then she swung in again just beyond a tongue of ice over which the froth was pouring tumultuously and the indian jumped from the bow  he had the painter with him and for half a minute he held her somehow standing in the foam while they hurled a few of the carefully madeup packages in her as far on to the ice as possible  then as wyllard who seized one sled frame jumped she rolled over  he landed on his hands and knees but in another moment he was on his feet and he and the indian clutched at charly who drove towards them amidst a long wash of foam  they dragged him clear and as he stood up dripping without his cap a sudden haze of snow whirled about them  there was no sign of the schooner and they could scarcely see the broken ice some sixty yards away  they had made the landing wet through with about half their stores and it was evident that their boat would not carry them across the narrowest lane of water even if they could have recovered her which it scarcely seemed worth while to attempt  the sea rumbled along the edge of the ice and they could not tell if the latter extended as far as the beach  they looked at one another until wyllard spoke  we have got the handsled and some at least of the things he said  the sooner we start for the beach the sooner well get there  it was a relief to load the sled and when that was done they set off in the hide traces across the ice with the snow whirling about them it was arduous work apart from the hauling of the load for the ice was rough and broken and covered for the most part with softening snow they had only gumboots with soft hide moccasins under them for snowshoes are only used in eastern canada and it takes one a long while to learn to walk on them  sometimes they sank almost kneedeep sometimes they slipped and scrambled on uncovered ledges but they pushed on with the sled bouncing and sliding unevenly behind them until the afternoon had almost gone  then they set up the saturated tent behind a hummock and crouched inside it upon a ground sheet while charly boiled a kettle on the little oil blast stove and the wind that screamed about it hurled the snow upon the straining canvas  it however stood the buffeting and when they had eaten a very simple meal charly put the stove out and the darkness was only broken down when one of them struck a match to light his pipe  they had only a strip of rubber sheeting between them and the snow for the water had got into the sleeping bags and their clothes dried upon them with the heat of their bodies  they said nothing for awhile and wyllard was halfasleep when charly spoke  ive been thinking about that boat he said  though i dont know that we could have done it we ought to have tried to pull her out  why asked wyllard  shed have been all to pieces anyway  im figuring it out like this  if dampier wasnt up in the shrouds when we made the landing hed sent somebody  we could see him up against the sky but wed be much less clear to him low down with the ice and the surf about us  besides it was snowing quite fast then well i dont know what dampier saw but i guess hed have made out that we hadnt hauled the boat up anyway  the trouble is that with the wind freshening and it getting thick hed have to thrash the schooner out and lie to until it cleared  when he runs in again its quite likely that hell find the boat and an oar or two  seems to me thats going to worry him considerable  wyllard drowsy as he was getting agreed with this view of the matter he realised that it would have been quite impossible for dampier to have sent them any assistance and it was merely a question whether they should retrace their steps to the edge of the ice next morning and make him some signal  against this there was the strong probability that he would not run in if the gale and snow continued and the fact that it was desirable to make the beach as soon as possible in case the ice broke up before they reached it  what was rather more to the purpose he was quietly determined on pushing on  it cant be helped he said simply  well start for the beach as soon as its daylight  charly made no answer and the brawny darkskinned siwash who spoke english reasonably well only grunted  unless it seemed necessary he seldom said anything at all  bred to the sea and living on the seal and salmon as he had done an additional hazard or two or an extra strain on his tough body did not count for much with him  he had been accustomed to sleep wet through with icy water and crouch for hours with numbed hands clenched on the steeringpaddle while the long sea canoe scudded furiously over the big combers before bitter gale or driving snow  wyllard who rolled over pulled a wet sleepingbag across him and after that there was silence in the little rocking tent  in the meanwhile charlys deductions had been proved correct for when the breeze freshened dampier climbed into the shrouds  he had noticed the ominous blackness to windward and knew what it meant which was why he had hauled a reef in the schooners mainsail down and now kept her out a little from the ice  as the light faded he found it very difficult to see the boat against the white wash of the seas that recoiled from the ice but when the snow was whirling about him he decided that she was in some peril unless her crew could pull her round the point  it was evident that this would be a difficult matter though he had only an occasional glimpse of her now  he waved an arm to the helmsman who understood that he was to run the schooner in there was a rattle of blocks as the booms swung out and as the selache sped away before the rapidly freshening breeze it seemed to dampier that he saw the boat hurled upon the ice  then a blinding haze of snow shut out everything and he came down with a run  he stood for several minutes gazing forward grim in face beside the wheel but he could see nothing except the filmy whiteness and the tops of the seas that had steadily been getting steeper  the schooner was driving furiously down upon the ice but it was evident to him that to send wyllard any assistance was utterly beyond his power  he could have hove the schooner to while he got the bigger boat over and two men might have pulled her towards the ice with the breeze astern of them but it was perfectly clear that they could neither have made a landing nor have pulled her back again  it was also though this appeared of less consequence uncertain whether he and the other man could have brought the schooner round or have got more sail off her which would as he recognised very soon have to be done  still he stood on while the snow grew thicker until they heard the wash of the sea upon the ice close to lee of them and then it was a hardclenched hand he raised in sign to the helmsman  on the wind  haul lee sheets he said  she came round a little heading off the ice and when she drove away with the foam seething white beneath one depressed rail and the spray whirling high about her plunging bows there was a curious tense look in the white mens faces as they gazed into the thickening white haze to lee of her  they thrashed her out until dampier decided that there was sufficient water between him and the ice and then stripped most of the sail off her and she lay to until next morning when they once more got sail on her and ran in again  the breeze had fallen a little it was rather clearer and they picked up the point though it had somewhat changed its shape  then they got a boat over and the two men who went off in her found a few broken planks a couple of oars and charlys cap washing up and down in the surf  they had very little doubt as to what that meant     chapter xxv  news of disaster  when the boat reached the schooner dampier went off with one of the men and contrived to make a landing on the ice with difficulty only to find it covered with a trackless sheet of slushy snow  though he floundered shorewards a mile or two there was nothing except the shattered boat to suggest what had befallen wyllard and his companions but the skipper who retraced his steps with a heavy heart had little doubt in his mind  after that he waited two days until a strong breeze blew him off the ice which was rapidly breaking up and then stood out for open water where he hove the selache to for a week or so  then he proceeded northwards to the inlet fixed upon  he was convinced that this was useless but as the opening was almost clear of ice he sailed the schooner in and spent a week or two scouring the surrounding country  he found it a desolation still partly covered with slushy snow out of which ridges of volcanic rock rose here and there  on two of these spots a couple of days march from the schooner he made a depôt of provisions and raised a beacon of piledup stones beside them  at times when it was clear he could see the top of a great range high up against the western sky but those times were rare  for the most part the wilderness was swept by rain or wrapped in clammy fog  there was however no sign of wyllard and at length dampier coming back jaded and dejected from another fruitless search after the time agreed upon had expired shut himself up alone for a couple of hours in the little cabin  he was certain now that wyllard and his companions had been drowned while attempting to make a landing on the ice since they would have joined him at the inlet as arranged had this not been the case  the distance was by no means great and there were no russian settlements on that part of the coast  he sat very still with a clenched hand upon the little table and a set face balancing conjecture against conjecture and then regretfully decided that there was only one course open to him  it was dark when he went up on deck again but the men were sitting smoking about the windlass forward  you can heave some of that cable in boys he said  well clear out for vancouver at sunup  they said nothing but they shipped the levers and dampier went back to the cabin for the clank of the windlass and the ringing of the cable jarred upon him  early next morning the selache stood out to sea and once they had left the fog and rain which hung about the coast behind she carried fine weather with her across the pacific  on reaching vancouver dampier had some trouble with the authorities to whom it was necessary to report the drowning of three of his crew but he was more fortunate than he expected and after placing the schooner in the hands of a broker for sale he left the city one evening on the atlantic train three days later he was driving across the prairie towards the hastings homestead and as it happened its inmates were sitting together in the big general room after supper when the waggon he had hired swung into sight over the crest of a rise  it was a still hot evening and as the windows were open wide a faint beat of hoofs came up across the tall wheat and dusty prairie before the waggon topped the rise  hastings who lay in a cane chair near the window with his pipe in his hand looked up as he heard it  somebody driving in he said  i shouldnt be astonished if its gregory  he talked about coming over the last time i saw him  if he wants to talk about a deal in wheat he can stay away said mrs hastings with a certain dryness  if all one hears is true he has lost quite a few of harrys dollars on the market lately  hastings looked somewhat troubled at this  id sooner think it was his own dollars hed thrown away  thats quite out of the question  he hasnt any  well said hastings with an air of reflection ill get sproatly to make inquiries  hell probably be along with winifred this evening and if he finds that gregory is getting in rather deep ill have a word or two with him  anyway i cant have him wasting harrys money and i have some right to protest as one of the executors  agatha started at the last word  it had an ominous ring and she fancied that hastings had noticed the effect it had on her for he seemed to glance at her curiously  turning from him she rose and walked quietly towards the window  the wheat stretched across the foreground tall and darkly green and beyond it the white grass ran back to the rise which cut sharp against a red and smoky glow  the sun had dipped some little time ago and already there was a wonderful exhilarating coolness in the air somehow the sight reminded her of another evening when she had looked out across the prairie from a seat at wyllards table almost a year ago  in the meanwhile a waggon was drawing nearer down the long slope of the rise and the beat of hoofs which grew steadily louder in a sharp staccato made the memories clearer  she had heard dampier riding in the night wyllard had received his summons and now she wondered who the approaching stranger was and what his business could be  she did not know why but she scarcely thought it was gregory  presently hastings looked round again  its the team bramfield hires out at the settlement he said  none of our friends would get him to drive them in  there seems to be two men in the waggon  bramfield will be one  i cant make out the other  mrs hastings who was evidently becoming curious about the unexpected guest walked forward in turn and they stood watching the waggon until agatha made a little abrupt movement  its captain dampier she said  then she stood tensely still with lips slightly parted and a strained look in her eyes while hastings gazed at the waggon for another moment or two  yes he said and his voice was harsh its dampier  the other mans surely bramfield  harrys not with him  once more he glanced at agatha who turned away and sat down in the nearest chair  she said nothing and there was an oppressive silence through which the beat of hoofs and rattle of wheels rang more distinctly  in another few minutes dampier came in while his companion drove off to the stables  he shook hands with agatha and mrs hastings diffidently  you remember me he said  of course said mrs hastings with a trace of sharpness  wheres harry  the skipper spread a hard hand out and sat down heavily  that he said is what i have to tell you  he asked me to  he asked you to said agatha and though her voice was strained there was relief in it  the skipper made a little gesture which seemed to beseech her patience  yes he said ifanything went wronghe told me i was to come here to mrs hastings  agatha turned her head away but mrs hastings saw the laces which hung beneath her neck sharply rise and fall  then she said something has gone wrong  about as wrong as it could and dampier quietly met her gaze wyllard and two other men are drowned  he broke off abruptly and mrs hastings fancied she saw agatha shiver but in another moment or two the girl turned slowly round with a drawn white face  it was however hastings who spoke almost sternly  go on he said  im to tell you all  this time it was agatha who broke in  yes she said with a curious quietness that struck the rest as being strained and unnatural you must tell us all  dampier who appeared to shrink from his task commenced awkwardly but he gained coherence and force of expression as he proceeded  at least he made them understand something of the grim resolution which had animated wyllard  he pictured in terse seamans words the little schooner plunging to windward over long phalanxes of icy seas or crawling white with snow through the blinding fog  his companions saw the big combers tumbling ready to break short upon the dipping bows out of the dark and halffrozen men struggling for dear life with folds of madly thrashing sail  the pictures were however necessarily somewhat blurred and hazy for after all only an epic poet could fittingly describe the things that must be done and borne at sea and epic poetsit is perhaps a pityare not bred in the forecastle  when he reached the last scene he gained almost dramatic power and agathas face grew strangely white and tense  she saw the dim figures pulling in the flying spray beneath the wall of ice  we ran her in he added with the snow blinding us  it was working up for a heavy blow and as wed have to beat her out we couldnt take sail off her  we stood on until we heard the sea along the edge of the ice and then there was nothing to do but jam her on the wind and thrash her clear  there was only a plank or two of the boat an oar and charlys cap when we came back again  after all though the boat was smashed they might have got out hastings suggested  well said dampier simply it didnt seem likely  the ice was sharp and ragged and there was a long wash of sea  a mans not tough enough to stand much of that kind of hammering  agathas face grew a little whiter but dampier who had paused went on again  anyway he said they didnt turn up at the inlet as wed fixed and that decided the thing  if wyllard had been alive he surely would have done  isnt it just possible that he might have fallen into the hands of the russians asked hastings  i naturally thought of that but so far as the chart shows there isnt a settlement within leagues of the spot  besides supposing the russians had got him how could i have helped him  theyd have sent him off in the first place to one of the bigger settlements in the south and if the authorities couldnt have connected him with any illegal sealing theyd no doubt have managed to send him across to japan by and bye  in that case hed have got home without any trouble  he paused and it was significant that he turned to agatha with a little deprecatory gesture  no he added there was nothing i could do  it was evident that agatha acquitted him but she asked a question  captain dampier she said had you any expectation of finding those three men when you sailed the second time  no said the bronzed sailorman with an impressive quietness i hadnt any and i dont think wyllard had either  still he meant to make quite certain  he spread a hard hand out forcibly  he felt he had to  he gazed at agatha and saw comprehension in her eyes  yes she said and when you have said that as you have done you could have said very little more of any man  then she turned her head away from them and once more there was for a few moments a heavy silence in the room  it cost the girl a painful effort to sit still apparently unmoved but there was strength in her and she would not betray her distress  she felt that the latter must be quietly grappled with  it was almost overwhelming horribly acute but there was mingled with it a faint consolatory thrill of pride for it was clear that the man who had loved her had done a splendid thing he had given all that had been given himand she knew she would never forget that phrase of hiswillingly and it seemed to her that the gifts he had been entrusted with were rare and precious onessteadfast unflinching courage compassion and the fine sense of honour which had sent him out on that forlorn hope  he had gone down unyielding and undismayedshe felt curiously sure of thatamidst the blinding snow but this was his vindication which had crowned him with immortal laurels  then mrs hastings rose and set food before dampier while by and bye sproatly and winifred arrived and were told the story  after that dampier who seemed to be a man of tact stood up  he had already when asked by mrs hastings promised to stay with them a day or two  well he said it seems to me youll naturally want to talk over things  if youll excuse me ill take a stroll across the prairie  he went out and hastings who lighted his pipe lay back in his chair and looked at the rest  harrys friends are numerous but were perhaps the nearest and as dampier said we have to consider things he said  to begin  with theres a certain possibility that he has escaped after all  he saw the little abrupt movement that agatha made and went on rather more quickly  gregory of course has control at the range until we have proof of harrys death though the latter made a proviso that if there was no word of the party within eighteen months after he had sailed or within six months of the time dampier had landed him we could assume it after which the will he handed me would take effect he added  this it is evident leaves gregory in charge for some months yet but it seems to me its our duty to see he doesnt fling away harrys property  ive reasons for believing that he has been doing it lately  he looked at sproatly who sat silent a moment or two  im rather awkwardly placed the latter said at length  you see theres no doubt that im indebted to gregory  winifred turned to him with impatience in her eyes  then she said severely you certainly shouldnt have been and it ought to be quite clear that nobody wishes you to do anything that would hurt him  she looked at hastings  in case the will takes effect who does the property go to  hastings appeared embarrassed  that he objected is a thing im not warranted in telling you in the meanwhile  a suggestive gleam crept into winifreds eyes but it vanished and her manner became authoritative when she turned back to sproatly  jim she said you will tell mr hastings all you know  sproatly made a gesture of resignation  after all he admitted i think its necessary  gregory as ive told you already put up a big mortgage on his place and in view of the price of wheat and the state of his crop its evident that he must have had some difficulty in meeting the interest unlessand one or two things suggest thishe paid it with harrys money  of course as harry gave him a share theres no reason why he shouldnt do this so long as he does not overdraw that share  theres no doubt however that he has lost a good deal of money on the wheat market  has he lost any of harrys mrs hastings asked  sproatly hesitated  im afraid its practically certain  then winifred broke in  yes she said he has lost a great deal hamilton knows almost everything thats going on and i got it out of him  hes a friend of wyllards and seems very vexed with gregory  the others said nothing for a moment or two and then mrs hastings spoke again  in a general way she said most of us dont keep much in the bank and that expedition must have cost harry a good deal  how would gregory get hold of the money before harvest  edmonds who holds his mortgage would let him have it said sproatly  but wouldnt he be afraid of gregory not being able to pay if the market went against him  sproatly looked very thoughtful  the arrangement wyllard made with gregory would perhaps give edmonds a claim upon the range if gregory borrowed any money in his name  i almost think thats what hes scheming for  the mans cunning enough for anything  i dont like him  then hastings stood up with an air of resolution  yes he said im most afraid youre quite correct  anyway ill drive over in a day or two and have a talk with gregory  after that they separated for hastings strolled away to join dampier and sproatly and winifred walked out on to the prairie  when they had left the house the man turned to his companion  why did you insist upon me telling them what i did he asked  oh said winifred i had several reasons  for one thing when i first came out feeling very forlorn and friendless it was wyllard who sent me to the elevator and they really treat me very decently  they said sproatly with resentment in his face  if you mean hamilton it seems to me that he treats you with an excess of decency that theres no occasion for  winifred laughed  in any case he doesnt drive me out here every two or three weeks thoughand she glanced at her companion provocativelyhe once or twice suggested that he would like to  i suppose you pointed out his presumption  no said winifred with an air of reflection i didnt go quite so far as that  after all the man is my employer i had to handle him tactfully  he wont be your employer a week after the implement people open their new depôt said sproatly resolutely  anyway were getting away from the subject  have you any more reasons for concerning yourself about what gregory does with wyllards property  ive one i suppose you dont know who he has left at least a part of it to  sproatly started as an idea crept into his mind  i wonder if youre right he said  i feel reasonably sure of it and winifred smiled  in fact thats partly why i dont want gregory to throw any more of wyllards money away  in the meanwhile you have done all i expect from you  then hastings is to go on with the thing  hastings winifred assured him will failjust as you would  this is a matter which requires to be handled delicatelyand effectively  then who is going to undertake it  winifred laughed  oh she said a woman naturally  im going back by and bye to have a word or two with mrs hastings     chapter xxvi  the rescue  winifreds views were shortly proved correct for hastings who drove over to the range a day or two after her visit came back rather disturbed in temper after what he described as a very unsatisfactory interview with hawtrey  i couldnt make the man hear reason he informed his wife  in fact he practically told me that the thing was no concern of mine  i assured him that it concerned me directly as one of the executors of harrys will and im afraid i afterwards indulged in a few personalities  i expect that blamed mortgage broker has got a very strong hold on him  mrs hastings looked reflective  you have never told me anything about the will  if i havent it wasnt for want of prompting said hastings drily still the will was sealed and handed me by harry on the express understanding that it was not to be opened until we had proof that he was dead or the six months mentioned had expired  if he turned up it would of course be handed back to him  he made me promise solemnly that i would not offer the least hint as to its provisions to anybody  mrs hastings made a gesture of resignation  in that case i suppose i must be content but he might have made an exception ofme  anyway i think i see how we can put what appears to be a little necessary pressure upon gregory  then she turned again to her husband rather abruptly  after all is it worth while for me to trouble about the thing  hastings was taken off his guard  yes he said decidedly if you can put any pressure on gregory i guess it would be very desirable to do it as soon as possible  then you think that harry may turn up after all  i do said hastings gravely i dont know why  in any case its highly desirablefor several reasonsthat gregory shouldnt fling his property away  mrs hastings smiled  well she said ill think over it  ill probably get agatha to see what she can do in the first place  she saw a trace of uncertainty in her husbands face which was however what she had expected  as you like he said  something must be done but on the whole id rather you didnt trouble agatha about the matter it would be wiser  mrs hastings asked no more questions  she fancied she understood the situation and she had agathas interests at heart for she had grown very fond of the girl  there was certainly one slight difficulty in the way of what she meant to do but she determined to disregard it though she admitted that it might cause agatha some embarrassment afterwards  during the afternoon she found the latter alone and sat down beside her  my dear she said i wonder if i may ask whether you are quite convinced that harrys dead  she felt that the question was necessary though it seemed rather a cruel one and she saw signs of tension in the girls expression  no said the latter very quietly i cant quite bring myself to believe it  then since you heard what sproatly said you would be willing to do anything that appeared possible to prevent gregory throwing harrys dollars away  yes said agatha i have been thinking about it  a little sparkle of disdainful anger crept into her eyes  gregory seems to have been acting shamefully  then as he wont listen to allen we must get sally to impress that fact on him  sally said agatha in evident astonishment  mrs hastings smiled  i dont think you understand sally as well as i do  of course like the rest of us she falls a long way short of perfection andthough its a difficult subjecttheres no doubt that her conduct in leading gregory on while he was still engaged to you was hardly quite correct  after all however you owe her something for that  it isnt very hard to forgive her for it said agatha quietly  well i want you to realise sally  right or wrong shes fond of the man  of course ive told you this already but i must try to make it clear how that fact bears upon the business in hand  sally certainly fought for him and theres no doubt that one could find fault with several things she did but the point is that shes evidently determined on making the most of him now she has got him  in some respects at least shes absolutely straightone hundred cents to the dollar is what allen says of herand although you might perhaps not have expected this i believe it would hurt her horribly to feel that gregory was squandering money that didnt strictly belong to him  then you mean to make her understand what he is doing  no said mrs hastings i want you to do it  ive reasons for believing that your influence would go further with her than mine  for one thing i fancy she is feeling rather ashamed of herself  agatha looked thoughtful  she had certainly not credited sally with possessing any fine sense of honour but she was willing to accept her companions assurance  the situation she pointed out is rather a delicate one  you wish to expose gregorys conduct to the girl he is going to marry though as you admit the explanation will probably be painful to her  cant you understand that the course suggested is a particularly difficult and repugnant oneto me  ive no doubt of it said mrs hastings  still i think it must be adoptedfor several reasons  in the first place i fancy that if we can pull gregory up now we will save him from involving himself irretrievably  after all perhaps you owe him the effort  then i think that we all owe something to harry and we can at least endeavour to carry his wishes out  he laid down what was to be done with his possessions in a will and he never could have anticipated gregory dissipating them as he is doing  the last reason as she had foreseen proved irresistible to agatha and she made a sign of concurrence  if you will drive me over i will do what i can she said  now she had succeeded mrs hastings lost no time and they set out for the creightons homestead next day while soon after they reached it she tactfully contrived that sally should be left alone with agatha they stood outside the house together when the latter turned to her companion  sally she said there is something that i must tell you  sally glanced at her face and then walked quietly forward until the log barn hid them from the house  then she sat down upon a pile of straw in its shadow and signed to agatha that she should take a place beside her  now she said sharply you can go on its about gregory  agatha who found it very difficult to begin though she had been well primed by hastings on the previous evening sat down amidst the straw and looked about her for a moment or two  it was a hot afternoon dazzlingly bright and almost breathlessly still  in front of her the dark green wheat rolled waisthigh and beyond it the vast sweep of whitened grass rolled back to the skyline flooded with light  far away a team and a waggon slowly moved across it but that was the only sign of life and no sound from the house reached them to break the heavy stillness  then she nerved herself to the effort and spoke quietly for several minutes before she glanced at her companion  it was very evident that the latter had understood all that she had said for she sat very still with a hard set face  oh she said if id thought youd come to tell me this because you were vexed with me id know what to do  this was what agatha had dreaded  it certainly looked as if she had come to triumph over her rivals humiliation but sally made it clear that she acquitted her of that intention  still she said i know that wasnt the reason and im not mad withyou  it hurtsand she made a little abrupt movementbut i know its true  then she turned to agatha suddenly  why did you do it  i thought you might save gregory if i told you  illustration i thought you might save gregory if i told you  that was all and sally looked at her with incredulous eyes  no said agatha simply that was only part  it did not seem right that gregory should go against wyllards wishes and gamble the range away on the wheat market  she admitted it without hesitation for she realised now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview  she was fighting wyllards battle and that fact sustained her  sally winced  yes she said i guess you had to tell me  he was fond of you  one could be proud of that  harry wyllard never did anything low down and mean  agatha did not resent her candour  although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago she saw that the girl felt the contrast between her lovers character and that of the man whose place he had taken and regretted it  then agathas eyes grew a trifle hazy  wyllard they think is dead she said in a low strained voice you have gregory still  sally looked at her with unveiled compassion and agatha did not shrink from it  yes she said with a simplicity that became her and gregory must have someone totake care of him  i must do it if i can  there was no doubt that agatha was stirred  this halftaught girls quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry once more made her almost ashamed  we will leave it to you she said  then it became evident that there was another side to sallys character for her manner changed and the suggestive hardness crept back into her eyes  well she said id most been expecting something of this kind when i heard that man edmonds was going to the range  he has got a pull on gregory but hes surely not going to feel quite happy when i get hold of him  she rose in another moment and saying nothing further walked back towards the house in front of which they came upon mrs hastings sally looked at the latter significantly  im going over to the range after supper she said  mrs hastings drove away with agatha and said very little to her during the journey but an hour after they had reached the homestead she slipped quietly into the girls room and found her lying in a big chair sobbing bitterly  she sat down close beside her and laid a hand upon her shoulder  i dont think sally could have said anything to trouble you like this she said  it was a moment or two before agatha turned a wet white face towards her and saw gentle sympathy in her eyes  there was she felt no cause for reticence  no she said it was the contrast between us  she has gregory  mrs hastings made a sign of comprehension  and you have lost harrybut i think you have not lost him altogether  we do not know that he is deadbut even if it is so it was all that was finest in him he offered you  it is yours still  she broke off and sat silent a moment or two before she went on again  my dear it is perhaps cold comfort and i am not sure that i can make what i feel quite clear  still harry was only human and it is almost inevitable that had it all turned out differently he would have said and done things that would have offended you  now he has left you a purged and stainless memoryone i think which must come very near to the reality  the man who went up therefor an idea a fantastic point of honoursloughed off every taint of the baseness that hampers most of us in doing it  it was a man changed and uplifted above all petty things by a high chivalrous purpose who made that last grim journey  agatha realised the truth of this  already wyllards memory had become etherealised and she treasured it as a very fine and precious thing still though he now wore immortal laurels that would not content her when all her human nature cried out for his bodily presence  she wanted him as she had grown to love him in the warm erring flesh and the vague splendid vision was cold and far remote  there was a barrier greater than that of crashing ice and bitter water between them  oh she said  i have felt that  i try to feel it alwaysbut just now its not enough  then she turned her face away with a bitter sob and mrs hastings who stooped and kissed her went out quietly  she knew what had come about and that the girl had broken down at last after months of strain  in the meanwhile it happened that edmonds the mortgage broker drove over to the range and found hawtrey waiting him in wyllards room  it was early in the evening and he could see the hired men busy outside tossing prairie hay from the waggons into the great barn  they were halfnaked and grimed with dust but hawtrey who was dressed in store clothes had evidently taken no share in their labours  when edmonds came in he turned to him with anxiety in his face  well he said sharply  markets a little stiffer said edmonds  he sat down and stretched out his hand towards the cigarbox on the table while hawtrey waited until he had picked one out with very evident impatience  still moving up he asked  edmonds nodded  its the other folks last stand he said  with the wheat ripening as its doing the flood that will pour in before the next two months are out will sweep them off the market  i was half afraid from your note that this little rally had some weight with you and that as one result of it you meant to cover now  that admitted hawtrey was in my mind  then said his companion its a pity  hawtrey leaned upon the table with hesitation in his face and attitude he had neither the courage nor the steadfastness to make a gambler and every fluctuation of the market swayed him to and fro  he had a good deal of wheat to deliver by and bye and for prices had fallen steadily until a week or two ago he could still secure a very desirable margin if he bought in against his sales now  unfortunately however he had once or twice lost heavily in an unexpected rally and he greatly desired to recoup himself  then he had decided nothing would tempt him to take part in another deal  if i hold on and the market stiffens further ill be awkwardly fixed he said  wyllard made a will and in a few months ill have to hand everything over to his executors  there would naturally be unpleasantness over a serious shortage  edmonds smiled  he had handled his man cleverly and had now a reasonably secure hold upon him and the range but he was far from satisfied  if hawtrey made a further loss he would in all probability become irretrievably involved  then he pointed out theres every reason why you should try to get straight  hawtrey admitted it  of course he said  you feel sure i could do it by holding on  his companion seldom answered a question of this kind  it was apt to lead to unpleasantness afterwards  well he said beeman and oliphant and barstow are operating for a fall  one would fancy that you were safe in doing what they do  when men of their weight sell forward figures go down  this was correct as far as it went but edmonds was quite aware that the gentlemen alluded to usually played a very deep and obscure game he had also reasons for believing that they were doing it now  it was however evident that his companions hesitation was vanishing  its a big hazard but i feel greatly tempted to hang on he said  edmonds who disregarded this sat smoking quietly  since he was tolerably certain as to what the result would be he felt it was now desirable to let hawtrey decide for himself in which case it would be impossible for the latter to reproach him afterwards  wheat it seemed very probable would fall still further when the harvest commenced but he had reasons for believing that the market would rally first  in that case hawtrey who had sold forward largely would fall altogether into his hands and he looked forward with very pleasurable anticipation to enforcing his claim upon the range  in the meanwhile he was unobtrusively watching his companions face and it had become evident that in another moment or two hawtrey would adopt the course suggested when there was a rattle of wheels outside  edmonds who saw a broncho team and a waggon appear from behind the barn realised that he must decide the matter now  as i want to reach landers before its dark ill have to get on he said carelessly  if youll give me a letter to the broker ill send it on to him  next moment a clear voice rose up somewhere outside  i guess you neednt worry it said ill go right in  then while gregory started sally walked into the room  edmonds was disconcerted but he made her a little inclination and then sat down again quietly determined to wait for he fancied there was hostility in the swift glance she flashed at him  thats quite a smart team you were driving miss creighton he said  sally who disregarded this turned to hawtrey  whats he doing here she asked  he came over on a little matter of business said hawtrey  you have been selling wheat again  hawtrey looked embarrassed for her manner was not conciliatory well he admitted i have sold some  wheat you havent got  hawtrey did not answer and sally sat down  her manner suggested that she meant to thoroughly investigate the matter and edmonds who would have greatly preferred to get rid of her decided that as this appeared impossible he would appeal to her cupidity  the creightons were somewhat grasping folks and he had heard of her engagement to hawtrey  if you will permit me ill try to explain he said  well say that you have reason for believing that wheat will go down and you tell a broker to sell it forward at a price a little below the actual one  if other people do the same it drops faster and before you have to deliver you can buy it in at less than you sold it at  a good many dollars can be picked up that way  it looks easy sally admitted with something in her manner which led him to fancy he might win her over  of course prices have been falling  gregory has been selling down  he has  in fact theres already a big margin to his credit said edmonds unsuspectingly  that is if he bought in now hed have clearedseveral thousand dollars  edmonds told her exactly how much and then started in sudden consternation with rage in his heart for she turned to hawtrey imperiously  then youll write your broker to buy in right away she said  there was an awkward silence during which the two men looked at one another until edmonds spoke  are you wise in suggesting this miss creighton he asked  sally laughed harshly  oh yes she said its a sure thing  and i dont suggest  i tell him to get it done  she turned again to hawtrey who sat very still looking at her with a flush in his face  take your pen and give him that letter to the broker now  there was this in her favour that hawtrey was to some extent relieved by her persistence  he had not the nerve to make a successful speculator and he had already felt uneasy about the hazard he would incur by waiting  besides although prices had slightly advanced he could still secure a reasonable margin if he covered his sales  in any case he did as she bade him and in another minute or two he handed edmonds an envelope  the latter who rose took it from him quietly for he was one who could face defeat  well he said with a gesture of resignation ill send the thing on  if miss creighton will excuse me ill tell your man to get out my waggon  then he went out and sally turned to hawtrey with the colour in her cheeks and a flash in her eyes  its harry wyllards money she said     chapter xxvii  in the wilderness  a bitter wind was blowing when wyllard stood outside the little tent the morning after he had made a landing on the ice watching the grey daylight break amidst a haze of sliding snow  he was to leeward of the straining canvas which partly sheltered him but the raw cold struck through him to the bone and he was stiff and sore from his exertions during the previous day  most of his joints ached unpleasantly and his clothing had not quite dried upon him with the warmth of his body he was also conscious of a strong desire to crawl back into the tent and go to sleep again but that was one it would clearly not be wise to indulge in since they were he fancied still some distance off the beach and the ice might commence to break up at any moment  it stretched away before him seamed by fissures and serrated ridges here and there for a few hundred yards and then was lost in the sliding snow and as he gazed at it all his physical nature shrank from the prospect of the journey through the frozen desolation  then with a little shiver he crawled back into the tent where his two companions were crouching beside the cooking lamp  the feeble light of its sputtering blue flame touched their faces which were graver than usual but charly turned and looked up as he came in  winds dropping said wyllard curtly  well start as soon as you have made breakfast  we must try to reach the beach tonight  charly made no answer though the duskyskinned siwash grunted and in a few more minutes they silently commenced their meal  it was promptly finished and they struck the tent and packed it with their sleeping bags and provisions upon the sled and then taking up the traces set out across the ice  the light had grown a little clearer now and the snow was thinning but it still whirled about them and lay piled in drawnout wreaths to lee of every hummock or ragged ridge  they floundered through them kneedeep and in the softer places the weight upon the traces grew unpleasantly heavy  that however was not a thing any of them felt the least desire to complain of and it was indeed a matter of regret to them that they were not harnessed to a heavier burden  there was a snowwrapped desolation in front of them and they had lost a number of small comforts and part of their provisions in making a landing  whether the latter could by any means be replaced they did not know and in the meanwhile it certainly did not seem very probable  this was however an excellent reason for pushing on as fast as possible and they stumbled and floundered forward until late in the afternoon while the ice became more rugged and broken as they proceeded  the snow had ceased but the drifts which stretched across their path were plentiful and they were in the midst of one when it seemed to wyllard who was leading that they were sinking much deeper than usual  the snow was over the top of his long boots the sled seemed very heavy and he could hear his comrades floundering savagely then there was a cry behind him and he was jerked suddenly backwards for a pace or two until he flung himself down at full length clawing at the snow  after that he was drawn back no further but the strain upon the trace became almost insupportable and there was still a furious scuffling behind him  in a moment or two however the strain slackened and looking round he saw charly waistdeep in the snow  the latter struggled out with difficulty holding on by the trace but the sled had vanished and it was with grave misgivings that wyllard scrambled to his feet  then saying nothing they hauled with all their might and after a tense effort that left them gasping dragged the sled back into sight  part of its load however had been left behind in the yawning hole  charly went back a pace or two cautiously until he once more sank to the waist and they had some trouble in dragging him clear  then he sat down on the sled and wyllard stood still looking at the holes in the snow  did you feel anything under you he asked at length in a jarring voice  i didnt said charly simply  it was only the trace saved me from dropping through altogether but if id gone a little further id have been in the water  kind of snow bridge over a crevice  we broke it up and the sled fell through  wyllard turned and flung the tent their sleeping bags and the few packages which had not fallen out off the sled after which he hastily opened one or two of them  his companions looked at them with apprehension in their eyes until he spoke again  the provisions may last a week or so if we cut down rations he said  he could not remember afterwards if anybody suggested it and he fancied that the same idea occurred to all of them at once but in another moment or two they set about undoing the traces from the sled and making them secure about their bodies  then for half an hour they made perilous attempt after attempt to recover the lost provisions and signally failed  the snow broke through continuously beneath the foremost man but it did not break away altogether and they could not tell what lay beneath it when they had drawn him out of the hole  when it became evident that the attempt was useless they held a brief council sitting on the sled  i guess we dont want to go back said charly  its quite likely weve crossed a good many of these crevices and the snows getting soft  besides dampier will have hauled off and headed for the inlet by now  he spoke quietly though his face was grim and then pausing a moment waved his hand  it seems to me he added we have got to fetch the inlet while the provisions last  exactly said wyllard  since the chart shows a river between us and it the sooner we start the better  if the thaw holds the stream will break up the ice on it  the indian who made no suggestion grunted what appeared to be concurrence and they silently set to work to reload the sled  that done they took up the traces and floundered on again into the gathering dimness and a thin haze of driving snow  darkness had fallen when they made camp again and sat wornout and aching in every limb about the sputtering lamp inside the little straining tent  the meal they made was a very frugal one and they lay down in the darkness after it for half their store of oil had been left behind in the crevice  they said very little for the second disaster had almost crushed the courage out of them and it was very clear to all that it would only be by a strenuous effort they could reach the inlet before their provisions quite ran out  they slept however and rising in a stinging frost next morning set out again on the weary march but it was slow travelling and at noon they left the tent and poles behind  in another few days said wyllard well leave the sled  they made the beach that afternoon though the only sign of it was the fringe of more ragged ice and the white slope beyond the latter  a thin haze hung about them heavy with frosty rime and they could not see more than a quarter of a mile ahead  when darkness fell they scraped out a hollow beneath what seemed to be a snowcovered rock and sat upon their sleeping bags about the cooking lamp  then having eaten they huddled close together with part of their aching bodies upon the sled in a bitter frost but none of them slept much that night  the morning broke clear and warmer and wyllard climbing to the summit of the rock had a brief glimpse of the serrated summits of a great white range that rose out of a dingy greyness to the west and south it however faded like a vision while he watched it and turning he looked out across the rolling wilderness that stretched away to the north  nothing broke its gleaming monotony and there was no sign of life anywhere in the vast expanse  by and bye it narrowed and when he clambered down the haze was creeping in again  they set out after breakfast breaking through a thin crust of snow which rendered the march almost insuperably difficult and they had painfully made a league or two by the approach of night  the snow had grown softer and the thawing surface would not bear the sled which sunk in the slush beneath  still they floundered on for a while after darkness fell and then lay down in a hollow packed close together while a fine rain poured down on them  somehow they slept and though this was more difficult got upon their feet again when morning came for of all the hard things the wanderer in rainswept bush or frozen wilderness must bear there is none that tests his powers more than the bracing himself for another day of effort in the early dawn  comfortless as the nights lair has been the jaded body craves for such faint warmth as it afforded and further rest the brain is dull and heavy and the aching limbs appear incapable of supporting the weight on them  difficulties loom appallingly large in the faint creeping light courage fails and the will grows feeble  wyllard and his companions felt all this but it was clear to them that they could not dally with their provisions running out and staggering out of camp after a very scanty meal they hauled the sled through the slush they churned up for an hour or so then they stopped gasping the indian slipped out of the traces and charly who nodded cast them loose from him  weve hauled that thing about far enough he said  wyllard stood looking at them for a moment or two with a furrowed face and a hand that the frost had split tightly clenched  it was evident that they could haul the hampering load no further and he was troubled by an almost insupportable weariness  then he made a little unwilling sign of concurrence  in that case he said you have to decide what youll leave behind  they discussed it for some minutes partly because it furnished an excuse for sitting upon the sled though none of them had much doubt as to the result of the council  it was unthinkable that they should sacrifice a scrap of the provisions  then when each man had lashed a light load upon his shoulders with a portion of the cutup traces they set out again and it rained upon them heavily all that day  during the four following days they were buffeted by a furious wind but the temperature had risen and the snow was melting fast and splashing kneedeep through slush and water they made progress  while he stumbled along with the packstraps galling his shoulders wyllard was conscious of little beyond the unceasing pain in his joints and the leaden heaviness of his limbs but the recollection of that march haunted him like a horrible nightmare long afterwards when each sensation and incident emerged from the haze of numbing misery  he remembered that he stormed at and almost fought with charly who lagged behind now and then in a fit of languid dejection and that once he fell heavily and was sensible of a certain halfconscious regret that he was still capable of going on when the indian dragged him to his feet again  they rarely spoke to one another and noticed nothing beyond the strip of white waste through which uncovered brown patches commenced to break immediately in front of them except when they crossed some low elevation and looked down upon the stretch of dull grey water not far away on one hand  the breeze at least had swept the ice away and that was reassuring because it meant that dampier would be at the inlet when they reached it though now and then a horrible fear that their strength would fail them or their provisions run out first crept in  their faces had already grown gaunt and haggard and each scanty meal had been further cut down to the smallest portion which would keep life and power of movement within them  still though the weight of it hampered him almost intolerably wyllard clung to the one rifle that they had saved from the disaster at the landing and a dozen cartridges this was a folly which he and charly had once virulent words about  at length they came one evening to a river which flowed across their path and lay down beside it feeling that the end was not far away except in the eddies and shallows the ice had broken up and the stream swirled by between in raging flood thick with heavy masses which it had brought down from its higher reaches  they crashed upon the gleaming spurs that here and there projected from the halfthawn fringe and smashed with a harsh crackling among the boulders and there was no doubt as to what would befall the stoutest swimmer who might attempt the passage  so far as wyllard afterwards remembered none of them said anything when they lay down among the wet stones but with the first of the daylight they started up stream  the river was not a large one and it seemed just possible that they might find a means of crossing higher up though they afterwards admitted that this was a good deal more than they expected  during the afternoon the ground rose sharply and the stream flowed out of a deep ravine which they followed  the rocks as far as wyllard could remember were of volcanic origin and some of them had crumbled into heaps of ragged debris  the slope of the ravine became a talus it was almost impossible to scramble along and they were forced back upon the boulders and the halfthawn ice in the slacker pools  still they made some progress and when evening drew near found a little clearer space between rock and river  the indian had in the meanwhile wrenched his foot or knee and when at length they stopped to make camp among the rocks it was some little time before he overtook them  then he said that he had found the slot of some animal which he fancied had gone up the ravine  what the beast was he did not seem to know but he assured them that it was at least large enough to eat and that appeared to be of the most importance then  he would not however take the rifle  nothing would compel him to drag himself another rod that night he said and the others who had noticed how he limped accepted his statement  he sat down among the stones with an expressionless face and charly decided that it was wyllards part to try to pick up the trail  you could beat me every time at trailing or shooting when we went ashore on the american side and im not sorry to let it go at that now he said  wyllard smiled very grimly and ive carried this rifle a week on top of my other load  you cant shoot when youre dead played out  then they called in the indian and left it to him and saying nothing he gravely pointed to wyllard  charly grinned for the first time in several days  well he said in this case i guess ive no objections to let it be as he suggests  wyllard who said nothing further took up the rifle and strode very wearily out of camp  there was he fancied scarcely an hours daylight left and already the dimness seemed a little more marked down in the hollow  he however found the slot again and as there was a wall of rock on one side of him up which he did not think a beast of any kind could scramble he pushed on up stream beside the ice  there was nothing except this to guide him but he was a little surprised to feel that his perceptions which had been dull and dazed the last few days were growing clearer  he noticed the different sounds the river made and picked out the sharp crackle of ice among the stones though he had hitherto only been conscious of a hoarse pulsating roar  the rocks also took distinctive shapes instead of looming in blurred masses before his heavy eyes and he found himself gazing with strained attention into each strip of deeper shadow  still though he walked cautiously there was no sign of any life in the ravine  he was horribly weary and now and then he set his lips as he stumbled noisily among the stones but he pushed on beside the water while the deep hollow grew dimmer and more shadowy     chapter xxviii  the unexpected  by and bye wyllard felt a troublesome dizziness creeping over him and he sat down upon a boulder with the rifle across his knees  he had eaten very little during the last few days which had been spent in arduous exertion and now the leaden weariness which he had fought against since morning threatened to overcome him  in addition to this he was oppressed by a black dejection which though his mind had never been clearer reacted upon his failing physical powers for it was now unpleasantly evident that he and his companions could not reach the inlet while their provisions held out  there was no longer any doubt that he had involved them in disaster and the knowledge that he had done so was very bitter  he sat still awhile with haggard face and set lips gazing up the ravine for although he scarcely fancied that either of the others had expected anything else he shrank from going back as emptyhanded as when he had left them  the light was getting very dim but he could still see the ice fringe upon the pool in front of him and a mass of rock that rose black against the creeping dusk not very far away beyond it on the one side there seemed to be a waste of stones amidst which a few wreaths of snow still gleamed lividly  then a wall of rock scarcely distinguishable in the shadow shut in the hollow  the latter was filled with the hoarse roar of the river and the sharp crash and crackle of streamdriven ice but by and bye the wornout man started as he caught another faint sound which suggested the clink of a displaced stone  his hands closed hard upon the rifle but he sat very still listening with strained attention until he heard the sound again  then a thrill ran through him for he was quite certain of its meaning  a stone had rolled over higher up the gorge and he rose and moved forward cautiously keeping the detached rock between him and the upper portion of the ravine  once or twice a stone clattered noisily beneath his feet and he stopped for a moment or two wondering with tense anxiety whether the sound could be heard at any distance through the roar of the river  this was a very much grimmer business than crawling through the long grass for a shot at the prairie antelope when in case of success it had scarcely seemed worth while to pack the tough and stringy venison back to the homestead  by and bye he heard the clatter of a displaced stone again and this time it was so distinct and near that it puzzled him  the wild creatures of the waste were he knew always alert and their perception of an approaching danger was wonderful  it seemed strange since he had heard it that the beast he was creeping in upon could apparently not hear him but he realised that he must face the hazard of its doing so for in another few minutes it would be too dark to shoot  he had almost reached the rock by this time and he shifted his grasp on the rifle holding it thrust forward in front of him while crouching low he looked down for a spot on which to set his foot each time he moved  it would he knew be useless to go any further if a stone turned over now  none did however and he crept strung up to highest tension into the deeper gloom behind the rock  a little pool ran in close beneath the latter from the river but it was covered with ice and slushy snow and treading very cautiously he crept across it and held his breath as he moved out from behind the stone  then he stopped suddenly for a man stood face to face with him scarcely a stones throw away  his furclad figure cut sharply against a gleaming bank of snow and he held a gun in his hand  though the light had almost gone it was evident to wyllard that he was a white man  they stood very still for several seconds gazing at one another and then the stranger dropped the butt of his weapon and called out sharply  wyllard who failed to understand him did not move and he spoke again  what he said was still unintelligible but wyllard who had fallen in with a few germans from minnesota on the prairie fancied that he recognised the language  he made a sign that it was still beyond his comprehension and the stranger tried again  this time it was french he spoke  you can come forward comrade he said  he did not seem to be hostile and wyllard who tossed his rifle into the hollow of his left arm moved out to meet him a pace or two  you are russian he said in the language the other had used for french of a kind is freely spoken in parts of canada  the man laughed  that afterwards he answered  it is said so  my name is overwegalbrecht overweg  as to you it appears you do not understand russian  wyllard drew a little nearer and sat down upon a boulder  now the tension had somewhat slackened his weariness had once more become almost insupportable and he felt that he might need his strength and senses  in the meanwhile he was somewhat bewildered by the encounter for it was certainly astonishing to fall in with a man who spoke three civilised languages and wore spectacles in that desolate wilderness  no he said it is almost the first time i have heard it  ah said the other there is a certain significance in that admission my friend  it is permissible to inquire where you have come from and what you are doing here  wyllard who had no desire to give him any information upon the latter point pointed towards the east  that is where i come from  as to my business at the moment you will excuse me  it is perhaps not a rudeness to ask what is yours  the stranger laughed  caution it seems is necessary and to the east where you have pointed there is only the sea  i will however tell you my business  it is the science and nothe seemed to add this with a certain significancein any way connected with the administration of the country  wyllard was conscious of a vast relief on hearing this but as he was not quite sure that he could believe it he felt that prudence was still advisable  in any case he could not let the stranger go away until he had learned whether there were any more white men with him he sat still thinking rather hard for a moment or two  you have a camp somewhere near he asked at length  certainly said the other  you will come back with me or shall i come to yours  there are several of you  besides myself two kamtchadales  then said wyllard i will come with you  i have left two comrades a little further down the ravine  will you wait until i bring them  the stranger made a sign of assent and sitting down upon a ledge of rock took out a cigar  wyllard now felt more sure of him since it was evident that had he meditated any treachery he would naturally have preferred him to make the visit unattended  in any case it seemed likely that he would have something to eat in his camp  wyllard plodded back down the ravine and when he reappeared with the others overweg was still sitting there in the gathering darkness  he greeted them with a wave of his hand and rising silently led the way up the hollow until they came into sight of a little tent that glimmered beneath a rock  there was a light inside it and two dusky figures were silhouetted against the canvas  when the party reached it overweg drew the flap back and the light shone upon his face as he signed them to enter  wyllard standing still a moment looked at him steadily and then seeing the little smile in his eyes quietly went in  after that overweg called to one of the kamtchadales who came in and busied himself about the cooking lamp while his guests sat down with a sense of luxurious content among the skins that were spread upon the ground sheet  after the raw cold outside the tent was very snug and warm  they said little however and overweg made no attempt at conversation until the kamtchadale laid out a meal when he watched them with a smile while they ate voraciously  he had stripped his furs off and sat with his knees drawn up on one of the skins a little plump roundfaced man with towcoloured hair and eyes that gleamed shrewdly behind his spectacles  shall i open another can he asked at length  no said wyllard  we owe you thanks enough already  provisions are evidently plentiful with you  overweg nodded  i have a base camp two or three days journey back he said  it is possible that i shall make a depôt  we brought our stores up from the south with dog sleds before the snow grew soft but it is necessary for me to push on further  my business you understand is the scientific survey to report upon the natural resources of the country  he paused and his manner changed a little when he went on again  i have he added to this extent taken you into my confidence and i invite an equal candour  two things are evident  you have made a long journey and your french is not that one hears in paris  first of all said wyllard i must ask again are you a russian  overweg spread his hands out with a little whimsical gesture  my name which i have told you is not sclavonic and it may be admitted that i was born in bavaria  in the meanwhile it is true that i have been sent on a mission by the russian government  i wonder said wyllard reflectively how far you consider your duty towards your employers goes  overwegs eyes twinkled  it covers all that can be ascertained about the geological structure and the fauna of the country especially the fauna that produce marketable furs  at present i am not convinced that it goes very much further  it was clear to wyllard that he was to a large extent in this mans hands already since he could not reach the inlet without provisions and overweg could if he thought fit send back a messenger to the russian authorities  he was one who could think quickly and make a momentous decision and he realised that if he could not win the mans sympathy there must be open hostility between them  it seemed possible that he might obviate any necessity for the latter  in that case i think i may tell you what has brought me here he said  if you have travelled much in kamchatka you can perhaps help me  to begin with i sailed from vancouver in canada going on for a year ago  it took him some time to make his errand clear and then overweg looked at him in a rather curious fashion  it is he said a tale that in these days one finds some little difficulty in believing  still it must be admitted that i am acquainted with one fact which appears to substantiate it  then as he saw the blood rise to wyllards forehead he broke off with a little soft laugh  my friend he added is it permitted to offer you my felicitations the men who would attempt a thing of this kind are i think singularly rare  the fact said wyllard impatiently  there is a kamtchadale in my base camp who told me of a place where a white man was buried some distance to the west of us  he spoke of a second white man but nobody i understand knows what became of him  wyllard straightened himself suddenly  you will send for that kamtchadale  assuredly  the tale you have told me has stirred my curiosity  as my path lies west up the river valley we can if it pleases you go on for a while together  wyllard who thanked him turned to charly with a faint sigh of relief  it seems that we shall not bring those men back but i think we may find out where they lie he said  charly made no comment for this was the most he had expected and a few minutes later there was silence in the little tent when the men lay down to sleep among the skins  they started at sunrise next morning and followed the river slowly by easy stages until the man sent back to overwegs base camp overtook them with another kamtchadale  then they pushed on still further inland and it was a week later when one evening their guide led them up to a little pile of stones upon a lonely ridge of rock  there were two letters very rudely cut on one of them and wyllard who stooped down beside it took off his cap when he rose  theres no doubt that jake leslie lies here he said and looked at overweg  your man is sure it was only one white man who buried him  overweg spoke to the kamtchadale who answered him  there was only one white man he said  it seems he went inland afterwardsat least a year ago  then wyllard turned to charly and his face was very grave  that makes it certain that two of them have died  there was one left and he may be dead by this time  he spread his hands out with a forceful gesture  if one only knew  charly made no answer  he was not a man of education or much imagination but like others of his kind he had alternately borne many privations in the wilderness logging prospecting trailcutting about the remoter mines and at sea  as one result of this there crept into his mind some recognition of what the outcast who lay at rest beside their feet had had to facethe infinite toil of the march the black despair the blinding snow and arctic frost  he met his leaders gaze with a look of comprehending sympathy  by what grim efforts and primitive devices their comrade had clung to life so long as he had done it seemed very probable that they would never know but they clearly realised that though some might call it an illegal raid or even piracy it was a work of mercy this outlaw who had borne so much had undertaken when he was cast away  in the word to swing the boats over and face the roaring surf in the darkness of the night he had heard the clear call of duty and had fearlessly obeyed his obedience had cost him much but as the man who had come so far to search for him looked down upon the little pile of stones that had been raised above his bones in the desolate wilderness there awoke within him a sure recognition of the fact that this was not the end  that at least was unthinkable  his comrade sloughing off the halffrozen suffering flesh had gone on to join the immortalswith his duty done  it was with a warmth at his heart and a slight haziness in his eyes that wyllard turned away at length but when he put on his fur cap again he was more determined than ever to carry out the search  there were many perils and difficulties to be faced but he felt that he must not flinch  one man went inland he said to overweg  i must go that way too  the little spectacled scientist looked at him curiously  ah he said the road your comrade travelled is a hard one  you have seen what it leads to  then wyllard did what is in the case of such men as he was a somewhat unusual thing for he gave another a glimpse of the feelings he generally kept hidden deep in him  no he said quietly the hard road leads furtherwhere we do not knowbut one feels that the full knowledge will not bring sorrow when it is some day given to those who have the courage to follow  overweg spread his hands out  it is not the view of the materialists but it is conceivable that the materialists may be wrong  in this case however it is the concrete and practical we have to grapple with my friend  you say you are going inland to search for that man and for awhile i go that way but though i have my base camp there is the question of provisions if you come with me  they discussed the matter until wyllard suggested that he could replace any provisions his companion supplied him with from the schooner to which overweg agreed and they afterwards decided to send the siwash and one of the kamtchadales on to the inlet with a letter to dampier the two started next day when they found a place where the river was with difficulty fordable and the rest pushed on slowly into a broken and rising country seamed with belts of thin forest here and there they held westwards for another week and then one evening made their camp among a few stunted and straggling firs  the temperature had risen in the daytime but the nights were cold and when they had eaten their evening meal they were glad of the shelter of the tent  a small fire of resinous branches was sinking into a faintly glowing mass close outside of it  the flap was however drawn back and wyllard who lay facing the opening could see a triangular patch of dim blue sky with a sharp sickle moon hanging low above a black fir branch  the night was clear and still but now and then there was a faint elfin sighing among the stunted trees that died away again  he was then while still determined moodily discouraged for they had seen no sign of human life during the journey and his reason told him that he might search for years before he found the bones of the last survivor of the party still he meant to search while overweg was willing to supply him with provisions  by and bye he saw charly sharply raise his head and gaze towards the opening  did you hear anything outside he asked  it would be the kamtchadales said wyllard  they went back a mile or two to lay some traps  then said wyllard decisively it couldnt have been anything  charly did not appear satisfied and it seemed to wyllard that overweg was also listening but there was deep stillness outside now and he dismissed the matter from his mind  a few minutes later it however seemed to him that a shadowy form appeared out of the gloom among the firs and faded into it again  this struck him as very curious since if it had been one of the kamtchadales he would have walked straight into camp but he said nothing to his companions and there was silence for a while until charly rose softly to his feet  get out as quietly as you can he said as he slipped by wyllard who crept after him to the entrance  when he reached it his companions voice rang out with a startling vehemence  stop right now he cried and after a pause nobodys going to hurt you  walk right ahead  then wyllard felt his heart beat furiously for a dusky halfseen figure materialised out of the gloom and grew into sharper form as it drew nearer to the sinking fire  the thing was wholly unexpected almost incredible but it was clear that the man could understand english and his face was white  in another moment wyllards last doubt vanished and he sprang forward with a gasp  lewsontom lewson he said  then charly thrust the man inside the tent and when somebody lighted a lamp he sat down stupidly and looked at them  his face was gaunt and furrowed and almost blackened by exposure to the frost his hair was long and tattered garments of greasy skins hung about him  there was also something that suggested bewildered incredulity in his eyes  its real he said slowly and haltingly  you have come at last  they assured him that this was the case and for a moment or two the mans face worked and he made a hoarse sound in his throat  lord he said if im dreaming i dont want to wake  charly leaned forward and smote him on the shoulder  shall i hit you like i did that afternoon in the thompson house on the vancouver water front he asked  then the certainty of the thing seemed to dawn upon the man for he quivered and his eyes half closed  after that he straightened himself with an effort  i should have known and i think i did he said  something seemed to tell me that you would come for us when you could  wyllards face flushed but he said nothing and it was charly who asked the next question  the others are dead  lewson made a little expressive gesture  hopkins was drowned in a crevice of the ice  i buried leslie back yonder  he broke off abruptly as though speech cost him an effort and wyllard turned to overweg  this is the last of the men i was looking for he said  overweg quietly nodded  then you have my felicitationsbut it might be advisable if you did not tell me too much he said  afterwards i may be questioned by those in authority     chapter xxix  cast away  tom lewson had been an hour in camp before he commenced the story of his wanderings and at first he spoke slowly and falteringly lying propped up on one elbow with the lamplight on his worn face  we broke an oar coming off the beach that night and it kind of crippled us he said  twice she nearly went back again in the surf and i dont quite know how we pulled her off  anyway one of us was busy heaving out the water that broke into her  it was jake i think and he seemed kind of silly  once we saw a boat hove up on a sea but we lost her in the spray and a long while after we saw the schooner just then a comber that broke on board most hove us over and when we had dodged the next two there wasnt a sign of her  after that we knew that we were done and we just tried to keep her headto and ease her to the seas  he stopped a moment and looked round at the others with troubled eyes as though trying to marshal uncertain memories for this was a simple sailorman who contented himself with the baldest narrative  still two of those who heard him could fill in the things he had not mentionedthe mad lurching of the halfswamped boat the tense struggle with the oars each time a big frothing comber forged out of the darkness and the savage desperation of the drenched and halffrozen men cast away with the roaring surf to lee of them and their enemies watching upon the hammered beach  it blew hard that night he added  somehow she lived through it but there wasnt a sign of the island when morning came  nothing but the combers and the flying haze  guess the wind must have shifted a few points and drove us by the end of it  then we found jake had his head laid open by a sealing club  the sea was getting longer and as we were too played out to hold her to it we got her away before it and somehow she didnt roll over  i think it was next day though it might have been longer when we fetched another island  she just washed up on it and one of the others pulled me out  there wasnt a sign of anybody on the beach but there were plenty of skinned holluschackie seals on the slope behind it and that was fortunate for us  you struck nobody on the island enquired wyllard  we didnt said lewson simply  the russians must have sent a vessel to take off the killers after the last drive of the season a day or two before for the holluschackie were quite fresh and perhaps it was blowing hard and the surf getting steep for theyd left quite a few of their things behind them  anyway that was how we figured it  we found the shacks the killers lived in and we made out that winter in one of them  it occurred to wyllard that this was a thing very few men except sealers could have done had they been cast ashore without stores or tools to face the awful winter of the north  how did you get through he asked  well said lewson we had a rifle and the catridges werent spoilt  the killers hadnt taken their cooking outfit and by and bye we got a walrus in an open lane among the ice  theyd left some gear behind them but we were most of two days cutting and heaving the beast out with a parbuckle under him  there was no trouble about things keeping in that frost  besides wed the holluschackie blubber to burn and there was a halfempty bag or two of stores in one of the shacks  no we hadnt any great trouble in making out  you had to stay there until the ice broke up said charly  and after  the boat was gone and we couldnt get away  she broke up in the surf and we burned what we saved of her  at last a schooner came along and we hid out across the island until shed gone away  it was blowing fresh and hazy and she just shoved a new gang of killers ashore  there was an okotsk russian with them but he made no trouble for us  he was white anyway and it kind of seemed to me he didnt like one of the other men who got hurt that night on the beach  then some of them did get badly hurt wyllard broke in  lewson laughed a little almost silent laugh which nevertheless sounded strangely grim  well he said from what that russian told usand we got to understand each other by and byeone of the killers had his ribs broke and it seems that another would go lame for life  besides among other things there was a white man got his face quite smashed i saw him after with his nose flattened way out to starboard and one eye canted  he was a boss of some kind  they called him smirnoff  overweg looked up sharply  ah he said smirnoff  a man with an unsavoury name  i have heard of him  anyway lewson went on we killed seals all the open season with that russian and ive no fault to find with him  in fact i figure if he could have fixed it hed have left us on the island that winter but when a schooner came to take the killers off and collect the skins smirnoff was on board of her  thatand an ominous gleam crept into lewsons eyeswas the real beginning of the trouble  he had us hauled up before himguess the other man had to tell him who we wereand when i wouldnt answer he slashed me with a sleddogwhip across the face  lewson clenched a lean brown fist  yes he added hoarsely i was whippedbut they should have tied my hands first  it was not my fault i didnt have that mans life  it was most a minute before three of them pulled me off him and he was considerably worse to look at then  there was silence for a minute or two and wyllard who felt his own face grow a trifle warm saw the suggestive hardness in charlys eyes lewson was gazing out into the darkness but the veins were swollen on his forehead and his whole body had stiffened  then he spread his hands out  well let that go  i cant think of it  they put us on board the schooner and by and bye she ran into a creek on the coast  we were to be sent somewhere to be dealt with and we knew what that meant with what they had against us  well they went ashore to collect some skins from the kamtchadales and at night we cut the boat adrift  we got off in the darkness and if they followed they never trailed us  guess they figured we couldnt make out through the winter that was coming on  so far the story had been more or less connected and comprehensible it laid no great tax on wyllards credulity and indeed all that lewson described had come about very much as dampier had once or twice suggested but it seemed an almost impossible thing that the three men should have survived during the years that followed  lewson as it happened never made that matter very clear  he sat silent for almost a minute before he went on again  we hauled the boat out and hid her among the rocks and after that we fell in with some kamtchadales going north he said  they took us along i dont know how far but they were trapping for furs and by and byei think it was months afterwe got away from them  then we fell in with another crowd and went on further north with them  they were koriaks and we lived with them a long whilea winter and a summer anyway  it was more perhapsi cant remember  he broke off with a vague gesture and sat looking at the others vacantly with his lean face furrowed  we must have been with them two yearsbut i dont quite know  it was all the same up yonderever so far to the north  it seemed to wyllard that he had seldom heard anything more expressive in its way than this sailormans brief and fragmentary description of his life in the wilderness  he had heard from steam whaler skippers a little about the tundra that fringes the polar sea the vast desolation frozen hard in summer a few inches below the surface on which nothing beyond the mosses ever grew  it was easy to understand the braincrushing sameness and monotony of an existence chequered only by times of dire scarcity on those lonely shores  how did you live he asked  there were the birds in summer and fish in the rivers  in winter we killed things in the lanes in the ice though there were weeks when we lay about the blubber lamp in the pits  they made pits and put a roof on them  i dont know why we stayed there but jake had always a notion that we might get across to alaskasomehow  we were way out on the ice one day when jim fell into a crevice and we couldnt get him out  he broke off and sat still awhile as one dreaming  i cant put things together but at last we came south jake and i and struck the kamtchadales again  we could talk to them and one of them told us about a schooner lying in an inlet by a settlement  the russians had brought her there from the islands and she must have been a sealer jake figured it was just possible we might run away with her and push across for the aleutians or alaska  charly looked up suddenly  shewasa sealerhaysons seminole i was in victoria when we heard that the russians had seized her  wyllard turned to overweg who nodded when he asked a question in french  yes he said i believe the vessel lies in the inlet still  they have used her now and then  it is understood that they were warranted in seizing her but i think there was some diplomatic pressure brought to bear on them for they sent her crew home  then lewson went on again  food was scarce that season and we got most nothing in the traps he said  besides there were russians out prospecting and that headed us off  we figured that some of the kamtchadales who traded skins to the settlements would put them on our trail  when we went to look for the boat shed gone but we hadnt much notion of getting off in her though another timei dont remember whenwe gave two kamtchadales messages wed cut on slips of wood  sometimes the schooners stood in along the coast  wyllard nodded  dunton of the cypress got your message he said he was in difficulties then but he afterwards sent it me  well said lewson there isnt much more to it  we hung about the beach awhile and then went north before the winter  jake played out on the trail  by and bye he had to let up and in a day or two i buried him  he spread his hands out and his voice grew hoarse  after that it didnt seem to matter what became of me but i kept the trail somehow and found i couldnt stay up yonder  thats why i started south with some of them before the summer came  now im heretalking englishtalking with white menbut it doesnt seem the same as it should have beenwithout the others  he broke off and said no more that night but wyllard translated part of his story for the benefit of overweg  the latter made a little expressive gesture  the thing it seems incredible he commented  this man who has so little to tell knows things which would make a trained explorer famous  it generally happens that way said wyllard with a dry smile  the men who know cant tell  overweg made a sign of assent and then changed the subject  what will you do now  start for the inlet where we expect to find the schooner at sunrise i want to sayand wyllard hesitatedthat you have laid an obligation on me which i can never repay but i can at least replace the provisions you have supplied me with  that goes for nothing said the other with a smile  i have however drawn upon my base camp rather heavily and should be glad of any stores from the schooner that you could let me have  the difficulty is that i do not wish to go too far towards the beach  they arranged a rendezvous a day or twos march from the inlet and in another halfhour all of them were fast asleep  when the first of the daylight came wyllard set off with his two companions and since it was evident that dampier must have now lain in the inlet awaiting them a considerable time they marched fast for several days  then to their consternation they came upon the siwash lying beside a river badly lame  it appeared that in climbing a slippery ridge of rock the knee he had injured had given way and he had fallen some distance heavily after which the kamtchadale finding him helpless had disappeared with most of the provisions  none of the party ever learned what had become of him but they realised in the meanwhile that the situation was now a rather serious one  charly who looked at wyllard when he had heard the indians story explained it concisely  im worrying about the boat we left on the edge of the ice he said ive had a notion all along it was going to make trouble  dampier would see the wreckage when he ran in and i guess it would only mean one thing to him  hed make quite certain he was right when he didnt find us at the inlet  he paused and pointed towards the distant sea you have got to push right on with lewson as fast as you can while i try to bring the siwash along  wyllard started in the next few minutes and afterwards never quite forgot the strain and stress of that arduous march  the journey he had made with overweg had been difficult enough but they had then at least traversed rising ground from which most of the melting snow had drained away  now however as they approached the more level littoral there were wide tracts of mire and swamp to be painfully floundered through while every ravine and hollow was swept by a frothing torrent and they had often to search for hours for a place where it was possible to cross  to make things worse they were drenched with bitter rain half the time and trails of dingy mist obscured their path but they toiled on stubbornly through every obstacle though it was only by the tensest effort that wyllard kept pace with his companion  the gaunt longhaired lewson seemed proof against physical weariness and there was seldom any change in the expression of his grim lined face  now and then wyllard felt a curious shrinking as he glanced at it for its fixed look suggested what this man had borne in the awful solitudes of the frozen north  slowly with infinite toil they crossed the weary leagues lying at night with a single skin between them and the soil for they travelled light and wyllard was limping painfully with his boots worn off his feet when at length one morning they came into sight of a low promontory which rose against a stretch of grey lifeless sea  his heart throbbed fast as he realised that behind it lay the inlet into which dampier had arranged to bring the selache  he glanced at lewson who said nothing and they plodded forward faster than before  the misty sun was high in the heavens when at length they reached the foot of the steep rise and wyllard gasped heavily as they crept up the ascent  he was making a severe muscular effort but it was the nervous tension that troubled him most for he knew that he would look down upon the inlet from the summit  he blamed himself bitterly for not sending on a messenger to dampier when he fell in with overweg which in his eagerness to follow up the clue the latter had given him he had at first omitted to do  there had certainly been difficulties in the way for the increase in the scientists party had made additional packers necessary and wyllard felt that he could not reasonably compel him to leave the camp comforts he had evidently been accustomed to behind  in spite of that he had been at fault in not disregarding every objection and he realised it now  somehow he kept pace with lewson but he closed one hand tight as he neared the top  when he reached it he stopped suddenly and his face set hard as he looked down standing very still  beneath him lay a strip of dim green water with a fringe of soft white surf at the foot of the promontory while beyond the latter there stretched away an empty expanse of slowly heaving sea  there was nothing else however no schooner in the inlet no boat upon the beach  in another moment or two they went down the slope savagely at a stumbling run and then stopped gasping by the waters edge and looked at one another  there were marks in the sand which showed them where a boat had been drawn up not very long ago  the selache had evidently been there and had sailed away again  then wyllard sat down limply upon the shingle for all the strength seemed to suddenly melt out of him and it was several minutes before he looked up  lewson was still standing a shapeless barbaric figure in his garments of skins with a dark lined face that had scarcely changed gazing out to sea  the hide moccasins he wore had chafed through and wyllard noticed that the blood was trickling from one of his feet  well he said harshly  wyllard laid a stern restraint upon himself  their case looked desperate but it must at least be grappled with  we must go back and meet the rest he said  that firstwhat is to come afterwards i dont quite know  then a faint gleam of resolution crept into his eyes  the schooner the russians seized lies in an inlet down the coast  lewson made a sign of comprehension  there are four of us  there will be birds by and bye  i can trap things  then he flung himself down near his comrade and for an hour neither of them said anything  wyllard at least was wornout physically and limp from the last few hours mental strain while lewson very seldom said more than was absolutely necessary  then they made a very frugal meal and long afterwards wyllard was haunted by the memory of that dreary afternoon during which he lay upon the shingle watching the slow pulsations of the dim lifeless sea  they set out again early next morning and as it happened found a little depôt of provisions that dampier had made but it was several days before they met charly and the indian and another week had passed before overweg reached the place appointed  he listened to wyllards story gravely and then appeared to consider  you have some plans he asked  wyllard admitted that this was the case and overweg smiled behind his spectacles  it is perhaps better that you do not tell me what they are he said  there is however one thing i can do  you say you left some stores you could not carry at the depôt which i will take for provisions are now not plentiful with me but there are still a few things you have not which are almost necessary at my base camp andhe spread his hands outafter all if i have to go south a little earlier than i intended it is not a great matter  he wrote on a strip of paper which he handed to wyllard  you will take these and nothing else  i may add that smirnoff is stationed at the inlet where the schooner lies  wyllard thanked him and then looked him in the eyes  there is a long journey before us and you have only my word that i will take nothing but these things  overweg nodded quietly  yes he said it is however perhaps permissible to assure you that it is sufficient for me  very little more was said and in another halfhour wyllard and his companions were ready to set out  he and the little spectacled scientist grasped each others hands and then wyllard abruptly turned away  a few minutes later he turned again and looking back saw overweg standing upon the ridge where he had left him silhouetted against a low grey sky  he raised his cap once and wyllard who answered him swung round once more and strode on faster towards the south  he knew that his regard for this stranger who had fallen across his path would remain unchanged while his life should last     chapter xxx  the last effort  it was after a long and arduous journey which had left its mark on all of them that wyllard and his companions lay among the boulders beside a sheltered inlet waiting for the dusk to fall one lowering evening they were cramped and aching for they had scarcely moved during the last hour their garments were badly tattered and their halfcovered feet were bleeding  they were as they recognised a pitiful company to seize a vessel with three knives and one rifle between them but there was resolution in their haggard faces  close in front of them the green water lapped softly among the stones the breeze was light off shore and the tide which was just running ebb rippled against the bows of a little schooner lying some thirty yards from the bank  she had been seized for illegal sealing some years earlier and it was evident that she had been very little used since then  the paint was peeling from her cracked and weathered side her gear was frayed and bleached with frost and rain and only very hardpressed men would have faced the thought of going to sea in her wyllard and his companions were however very hardpressed indeed and they preferred the hazards of a voyage in the crazy vessel to falling into the russians hands  it was also clear that they had no choice it must be either one thing or the other  some little distance upstream a low rise cut against the dingy sky it shut off all view of the upper part of the inlet which wound in behind it but wyllard and his companions had cautiously climbed the slope earlier in the afternoon and lying flat upon the summit had looked down upon the little wooden houses that clustered above the beach  he had then decided that this part of the inlet would dry out at about halfebb and as the schooners boat which he meant to seize lay upon the shingle it was evident that he must carry out his plans within the next three hours  these were very simple  there was nobody on board the schooner which lay in deeper water and he fancied that it would be possible to swim off to her and slip the cable but they must have provisions and there was so far as he could see only one way of obtaining them  a building which stood by itself close beside the beach was evidently a store for he had seen two men carrying bags and cases out of it under the superintendence of a third in some kind of uniform and it appeared to be unguarded  wyllard who had reasons for surmising that the few settlements on the coast were under strict official control fancied that the store contained government supplies and had arranged that charly and lewson should break into it as soon as darkness fell and pull off to the schooner with anything they could find inside  whether they would succeed in doing this he did not know and he admitted to himself that it scarcely seemed probable but he could think of no other plan and the attempt must be made  in the meanwhile a thin haze drove across the crest of the rise the breeze freshened slightly and the little ripples lapped more noisily along the shingle  there was evidently a good deal of fresh water coming down the inlet and it was in a fever of impatience he watched the schooner strain at her cable  that evening had already seemed the longest he had ever spent in his life  by and bye it commenced to rain and little streams of chilly water trickled about the weary men but they lay still with lips tight set in tense suspense  what lewson had had to face in the awful icy wastes to the north of them wyllard could scarcely imagine and lewson could not tell but he and his two other comrades had borne things almost beyond endurance since he commenced his search and now there was far too much at stake for him to increase the odds against them by any undue precipitancy  he was then in a dangerous mood but he had laid his plans with grim coldblooded caution and he meant to adhere to them  at length and very slowly the light faded until the beach grew shadowy and the schooners spars and rigging showed dim and blurred against a dusky background  the rise that shut off the settlement was lost in drifting haze and the dull rumble of the surf on the outer beach came up more sharply through the gathering darkness  the measured beat of its deep pulsations almost maddened wyllard as he lay and listened for if all went right he would be sliding out over the long heave with every sail piled on to the crazy schooner in another hour or two  at length when there was only a faint gleam of water sliding by below he rose stiffly to his feet and lewson stretched out a hand for the rifle that lay among the stones  there was a sharp click as he jerked the lever and then he laughed a little jarring laugh as the magazine snapped back  theyll treat us as pirates if they get hands on usand ive been lashed in the facewith a sleddogwhip he said  charly said nothing as he loosened the long seamans knife in his belt and wyllard made no remonstrance for there is as he recognised a point beyond which prudence does not count  after what overweg had once or twice told him it was unthinkable that they should fall into smirnoffs hands  then lewson and charly melted away into the darkness and wyllard and the siwash walked quietly down to the waters edge a little upstream of the schooner as the stream was running strong  they however stripped off nothing for it was evident that none of the rags they left behind could be replaced and they knew from experience that when the first shock is over a man swimming in icy water is kept a little warmer by his clothing  for all that the cold struck through wyllard like a knife when he flung himself forward and swung his left hand out and it was perhaps a minute before he was clearly conscious of anything beyond the physical agony and the mental effort to retain control of his faculties  then he made out the schooner a vague blurred shape a little downstream of him and he swam furiously his face dipping under each time his left hand came out  he drew level with her clutched at her cable a foot short and was driven against her bows  then the stream swept him onward gasping and clawing savagely at her slippery side until his fingers found a hold  it was merely the rounded top of a bolt but with a desperate effort he clutched the bent iron that led up from it to one of the deadeyes of the mainmastshrouds  he could not however draw himself up any further and he hung on wondering when his strength would fail him until the siwash who had already crawled up the cable leaned down from above and seized his shoulder  in another moment or two he reached the rail and went staggering across the deck dripping and half dazed  action was however imperatively necessary and he braced himself for the effort  the schooner was lying with her anchor upstream but he did not think it would be possible to heave her over it and break it out unless he waited until the others arrived and it would then be a lengthy and what was more to the purpose a noisy operation  the anchor must be sacrificed but there was the difficulty that he could hardly expect to find a shackle on the cable in the dark  running forward with the siwash he pulled a chain stopper out and then shipping the windlass levers found with vast relief that it would work it would make a horribly distinct clanking he knew but that could not be helped and the next thing was to discover if the end of the chain was made fast below for it is very seldom that a skipper finds it necessary to pay all his cable out  dropping into the darkness of the locker beneath the forecastle he was more fortunate than he could reasonably have expected to be for as he crawled over the rusty links he felt a shackle  it appeared to be of the usual harppattern with a cottered pin and he called out sharply to the siwash who presently flung him an iron bar and a big spike then he struck one of the two or three sulphur matches he had carefully treasured and when the sputtering blue flame went out set to work to back the pin out in the dark  he smashed his knuckles and badly bruised his hands but he succeeded and knew that he had shortened the chain by twothirds now  then he scrambled up on deck again and hurried aft for the vessels kedge had been laid out astern to prevent her swinging  there was a heavy hemp warp attached to it and it cost them some time to heave most of it over after which they proceeded to get the mainsail on to her  it was covered with a coat and wyllard cut himself as he slashed through the tiers in savage impatience  then he and the siwash toiled at the halliards desperately for the task of raising the heavy gaff was almost beyond their powers  there was no grease on the masthoops the blocks had evidently not been used for months and several times they desisted a moment or two gasping breathless and utterly exhausted  still foot by foot they got the black canvas up and then leaving the peak hanging ran forward to the boomforesail which was smaller and lighter  they set that cast two jibs and the staysail loose and let them lie and wyllard sat down feeling that the thing they had done would if attempted in cold blood have appeared almost impossible  it was done however and now he must wait until the boat appeared there was no sign of her and as he gazed up the inlet seeing only the dim glimmer of the water and the sliding mist the suspense became almost intolerable  minute slipped by after minute and still nothing loomed out of the haze  the canvas rustled and banged above him there was a growing splashing beneath the bows and the schooner strained more heavily at her cable  everything was ready only his comrades did not appear  he clenched his hands and set his lips as he waited and wondered at the siwash who sat upon the rail a dim shapeless figure impassively still  at length his heart throbbed furiously for a faint splash of oars came out of the darkness and they both ran forward to the windlass  the sharp clanking it made drowned the splash of oars but in another minute or two there was a crash as the boat drove alongside and charly scrambled up with a rope while lewson hurled sundry bags and cases after him  then he climbed on deck in turn and charly commenced a breathless explanation  its all we could get  theres nobody on our trail he said  the last fact was most important and wyllard cut him short  get the jibs and staysail on to her  the new arrivals did it while the cable clanked and rattled as the schooner drove astern but at the first heave the rotten staysail tore off the hanks and one jib burst as they ran it up its stay  then for an anxious moment or two the cable jammed and the anchor brought the schooner up  all four flung themselves upon the windlass levers and after a furious effort the chain came up again and ran out faster fathom by fathom rattling horribly until the end of it shot suddenly over the windlass  then there was another check as the schooner brought up by the kedge swung suddenly across the stream  her banging canvas filled she listed over and it was evident to all of them that if the kedge started she would forthwith drive ashore its warp ripped out of the water tense with strain and she was swinging on it heading for the beach when wyllard flung himself upon the wheel  hang on to every inch or break it he roared  out mainboom box your jib and staysail up to weather  they did it amidst a great clatter of blocks and thrashing of canvas in desperate haste while wyllard wrenched up his helm and the schooner straining on the warp fell away with her bows downstream he was quivering all through and the sweat of effort dripped from him when he swung up an arm to lewson who was standing at the bollard the warp was made fast to  now he cried hoarsely let her go  the rope fell with a splash the schooner lurched forward and drove away down the inlet with the stream running seaward under her while wyllard felt a trifle dazed from sheer revulsion of feeling  the rumble of the surf was growing louder the deck slanted slightly beneath him and if they could keep her off the beach for the next few minutes there was freedom before them  he hazarded a glance astern but could see no sign of a boat up the inlet  they had done a thing which even then appeared almost incredible  the breeze came down fresher the gurgle at the bows grew louder and the deck commenced to heave with a slow and regular rise and fall then a long shadowy point girt about with spectral surf slipped by and they were out in open water  they ran her out for an hour or two and then though the peak of the mainsail burst to tatters as they hauled her on a wind let her stretch away northwards following the trend of coast  well stand on as shes lying until we find a creek or river mouth we must have water wyllard said  an hour later he called charly to the wheel and sitting down in the shelter of the rail soon afterwards went to sleep though this was about the last thing he had contemplated doing  it was grey dawn when he opened his eyes again and stood up aching all over and very cold to see that the schooner was tumbling over a little spiteful sea with the hazy loom of land not far away from her  then he glanced at the gear and canvas and was almost appalled while charly who was busy close by saw his face and grinned  you dont want to look at her too much he said  we took a swig on the peakhalliards a little while ago and had to let up before we pulled the gaff off her  boomforesails worse and the jibs are dropping off her while the water just pours in through her topsides when she puts another lee plank down  wyllard made a little expressive gesture and leaned upon the rail  he realised then something of the nature of the task he had undertaken they had no anchor no fresh water no fuel for cooking and so far as he was aware very few provisions while it seemed to him that the weathered wornout gear would not hold the masts in the vessel in any weight of breeze  still the thing must be attempted and there was one want at least that could be supplied  anyway he said well beat her in  when we come abreast of the first creek you and tom and the siwash will go ashore  it was afternoon when they sighted one and they took most of the canvas off the vessel before three of them pulled away in the boat leaving wyllard at the helm  it was blowing moderately fresh off shore and it was with feverish impatience he watched them toiling at the oars two of them pulling while the third man sculled  then they disappeared behind a point and an anxious hour went by before the boat which now showed a very scanty strip of side above the tumbling foam crept out from the beach again  having no breakers they had brought the water off in bulk sitting in it as they pulled and it was fortunate that the boat lurched off shore easily before the little splashing seas  they lost some of the water before they hove it into the big and very rusty tank and then they held a consultation when they had swung the boat in and the schooner was running off to the east again  weve about stores enough to last two weeksthat is if you dont expect too much lewson pointed out  theres an american stove in the deckhouse and while we cant find anything meant to burn in it theres an axe down forward and we could cut out cabin floorings or a beam or two without taking too much stiffening out of her  wyllard who had inspected the stores fancied that a fortnight was the very longest that could be counted on though they ate no more than would keep a modicum of strength in them  from their kind and quality he surmised that they had been intended for the officials in charge of the settlement  how did you get them tom he asked  the thing said lewson quietly was simple  it was dark and hazy and raining quite hard and the first thing we did was to run the boat down and leave her nearly afloat  then we crawled back and lay by listening outside that store  we were figuring how we were to break it in when two men came along  they went in and came out with a bag or two and as they left the door open we figured they were coming back for more  we humped out a moderate load and had just got it down to the boat when we saw those men or two others in the haze  i was for lying by but charly would get out then  charly laughed drily  he wanted to take the rifle and go back to look for smirnoff  id no use for any trouble of that kind and i shoved the boat off while he was seeing how many catridges there were in the magazine  he waded in and grabbed the boat when he saw i was sure going but i shoved her away from him  then it kind of struck him he had to get in or swim  lewsons expression grew very grim  thats the thing that hurts the mostto go away before i got even with that man he said  still i may get over it if i try to think of him with his nose smashed hard to starboard  wyllard made a sign of impatience  he felt that after all there was perhaps something to be said for smirnoffs point of view  there is just one plan open to us and thats to drive her across to the eastward as fast as we can he said  we might perhaps pick up an alaska cc factory before the provisions quite run out if this breeze and the gear hold up  failing that we must try for one of the western aleutians  the others concurred in this and very fortunately the breeze kept to the west and south for wyllard had very grave doubts as to whether he could have thrashed the schooner to windward through a steep head sea indeed on looking back on that voyage and remembering the state of the vessel it seemed to him that he and his companions had only escaped as by a miracle  in any case they hove her to one misty evening in a deep inlet behind a promontory and wyllard who sculled up it alone in the growing darkness badly startled the agent of an acc factory when he appeared ragged haggard and wet with rain in the doorway of a big stovewarmed room  the agent however was as he admitted out for business and when wyllard produced a wad of paper money stained by wet and perspiration he appeared quite willing to part with certain provisions  he was also told that no questions would be answered and when he had given wyllard supper the latter sculled away in the darkness leaving him none the wiser  half an hour later the schooner slipped out to sea again  the rest was by comparison easy  they had the coast of alaska and british columbia close aboard and they crept southwards in fine weather once running off their course when the smoke of a steamer crept up above the horizon  then they ran for the northern tongue of vancouver island in a strong breeze of wind and wyllard who had already decided that the vessel would scarcely fetch five hundred dollars and that it would be better if all trace of her disappeared pulled his wheel over suddenly as she was scraping by a surfswept reef  in another minute she was on hard and fast and they had scarcely got the boat over when the masts went with a crash  a quarter of an hour later they were thrown up on the beach and before they set out on a long march through the bush there was very little to be seen of the vessel  three or four days afterwards they reached a little wooden town and wyllard who slipped into it alone in the dusk bought clothing for himself and his companions who put it on in the bush  then they went into the town together and slept that night in a wooden hotel  their troubles were over and what was more wyllard who pledged the rest to secrecy fancied that what had become of the schooner would remain a mystery     chapter xxxi  wyllard comes home  harvest had commenced at the range and the clashing binders were moving through the grain when hawtrey sat one afternoon in wyllards room at the range  it was then about five oclock and every man belonging to the homestead was toiling barearmed and grimed with dust among the yellow oats but hawtrey sat at a table gazing at the litter of papers in front of him with a troubled face  he wore a white shirt and store clothes which was distinctly unusual in case of a western farmer at harvest time and edmonds the mortgage jobber leaned back in a big chair quietly watching him  the latter had as it happened called at a singularly inconvenient time and hawtrey was anxious to get rid of him before the guests he expected arrived  it was sallys birthday and since she took pleasure in simple festivities of any kind he had arranged to celebrate it at the range  he was however sufficiently acquainted with his companions character to realise that it was most unlikely that he would take his departure before he had accomplished the purpose which had brought him there  this was to collect several thousand dollars  it was quite clear to hawtrey that he was in an unpleasantly tight place  edmonds held a bond upon his homestead teams and implements as security for a short date loan repayment of which was due and he was to be married to sally in a month or so  cant you wait a little he asked at length  im afraid not was the uncompromising reply  moneys tight this fall and things have gone against me  besides you could pay me off if you wanted to  edmonds turned towards an open window and glanced at the great stretch of yellow grain that ran back across the prairie  dusty teams and binders with flashing wooden arms moved halfhidden along the edge of it and the still clear air was filled with a clash and clatter and the rustle of flungout sheaves  there was no doubt that money could be raised upon that harvest field indeed hawtrey fancied that his companion would be quite content to take a bond for the delivery of so many thousand bushels in repayment of the loan but while he had already gone further than he had at one time contemplated doing this was a course he shrank from suggesting after all the grain was wyllards and there was the difficulty that wyllard might still come back while if he failed to do this an absence of another few months would entitle his executors to presume him dead in either case hawtrey would be required to account for his property  no he said i cant takethat way  there was a trace of contempt in the mortgage jobbers smile  you of course understand just how youre fixed but it seemed to me from that draft of the arrangement with wyllard that you have the power to do pretty much what you like  anyway if you gave me a bond on as much of that grain as would wipe out the loan at present figure it would only mean that you would have wyllards trustees for creditors instead of me and its probable that they wouldnt be as hard upon you as im compelled to be  as things stand you have got to square up or i throw your place on the market  hawtreys face betrayed his dismay and his companion fancied that he would yield to a little further pressure  he had not said anything about the mortgage to sally and it would be singularly unpleasant to be turned out upon the prairie within a month or two of his marriage for he could not count upon being left in possession of the range much longer  im only entitled to handle wyllards money onhisaccount he objected  edmonds appeared to reflect  so far as i can remember there was nothing of that kind stated in the draft of the arrangement  it empowered you to do anything you thought fit with the money but its altogether your own affair  i can of course get my dollars back by selling your homestead up and i have to decide if that must be done or not before i leave  he had very little doubt as to what the decision would be  hawtrey would yield and afterwards it would not be difficult to draw him into some unwise speculation with the object of getting the money back which he imagined that hawtrey would be desperately anxious to do  as the result of this he expected to get such a hold upon the range that he would be master of the situation when the property fell into the hands of wyllards trustees  that hawtrey would be disgraced as well as ruined naturally did not count with him  the latter took up one of the papers and read it through with vacillation in his eyes  then he rose and stood leaning on the table while he gazed at the teams toiling amidst the grain  there was wealth enough yonder to release him from his torturing anxieties and after all he felt something must turn up before the reckoning was due  it was not in his nature to face a crisis and with him a trouble seemed less formidable if it could only be put off a little  edmonds who knew with what kind of man he had to deal said nothing further and quietly reached out for another cigar  in the meanwhile though neither of the men were aware of this sally had just got down from her waggon on the other side of the house and another couple of teams were already growing larger upon the sweep of whitened prairie  as she entered the homestead she met mrs nansen and the latter informed her that hawtrey was busy with edmonds in wyllards room  sallys eyes sparkled when she heard it and her face grew hard  that man she said  well i guess ill go right in to them  in another minute she opened the door and answered the mortgage jobbers somewhat embarrassed greeting with a frigid stare  having some experience of sallys uncompromising directness he was inclined to fancy that the game was up but he said nothing further and she fixed her eyes on hawtrey  whats this man doing here again she asked  you promised me you would never make another deal with him  hawtrey flushed  had he fancied it would have been the least use he would have made some attempt to get sally out of the room but he was unpleasantly sure that unless she was fully satisfied first it would only result in failure  besides driven to desperation as he was he had a halfconscious feeling that she might provide him with some means of escape  sally had certainly saved him once already and humiliating as it was he fancied that she did not expect too much from him  she might be very angry but sallys anger was after all less difficult to face than agathas quiet scorn  i havent made another deal  itsa previous one he said lamely  sally swung round on edmonds  you have come here for money  you may as well tell me  i wont leave you with gregory until you do  it was quite evident that she would make her promise good and edmonds nodded  yes he said about 3000 dollars  and gregory cant pay you  edmonds reflected rapidly and decided to take a bold course  he was acquainted with hawtreys habit of putting things off and fancied that the latter would seize upon the first loophole of escape from an embarrassing situation  that was why he gave him a lead  well he said there is a way in which he could do it if he wished he has only to fill in a paper and hand it me  he had however not sufficiently counted on sallys knowledge of his victims affairs or her quickness of wit for she turned to hawtrey with a commanding gesture  where are you going to get 3000 dollars from she asked  the blood crept into hawtreys face for this was a thing he could not tell her but a swift suspicion flashed into her mind as she looked at him  perhaps it could beraised he said  to pay his mortgage off and sally swung round on edmonds now  yes the latter admitted he can easily do it  then the girl turned to hawtrey  gregory she said with harsh incisiveness theres only one way you could get that moneyand it isnt yours  hawtrey said nothing but he could not meet her gaze and when he turned from her she looked back at the mortgage jobber  if youre gone before i come back therell sure be trouble she informed him and sped swiftly out of the room  then hawtrey sat down limply in his chair and edmonds laughed in a jarring manner  the game was up but after all if he got his 3000 dollars he could be satisfied for he had already extracted a good many from hawtrey one way or another  if i were you id marry that girl right away he said  youd be safer if you had her to look after you  hawtrey let the jibe pass  for one thing he felt that it was warranted and just then his anxiety was too strong for anger  in the meanwhile sally ran out of the house to meet hastings who had just handed his wife down from their waggon and drew him a pace or two aside  im worried about gregory she said hes in troublebig trouble somehow we have got to raise 3000 dollars  edmonds is inside with him  hastings did not seem greatly astonished  ah he said i guess its over that mortgage of his  it would be awkward for you and gregory if edmonds took the homestead and turned him out  sallys face grew rather white but she met his gaze steadily  oh she said thats not what i would mind the most  hastings reflected a moment or two  he fancied that this was a very difficult admission for the girl to make and that she had made it suggested that hawtrey might become involved in more serious difficulties  he had also a strong suspicion of what they were likely to be  sally he said quietly you are afraid of edmonds making him do something you would not like  though she did not answer directly he saw the shame in the girls face and remembered that he was one of wyllards trustees  i must raise those dollarsnowand i dont know where to get more than five hundred from  i might manage that she said  well said hastings you want me to lend you them and im not sure that i can  still if youll wait a few minutes ill see what i can do  sally left him and he turned to his wife whose expression suggested that she had overheard part of what was said and had guessed the rest  you mean to raise that money  after all we are friends of his and it may save him from letting edmonds get his grip upon the range she said  hastings made a sign of reluctant assent  i dont quite know how i can do it personally in view of the figure wheat is standing at and i dont think much of any security that gregory could offer me  still there is perhaps a way in which it could be arranged and its one that considering everything is more or less admissible  i think ill wait here for agatha  agatha was in the waggon driven by sproatly close behind them and when he had handed her and winifred down hastings who walked to the house with them drew her into an unoccupied room while mrs nansen took the rest into the big general one  im afraid that gregorys in rather serious trouble  sally seems very anxious about him he said  its rather a delicate subject but i understand that in a general way you are on good terms with both of them  agatha met his somewhat embarrassed gaze with a smile  she fancied that what he really wished to discover was whether she still felt any bitterness against gregory and blamed him for pledging himself to sally  yes she said sally and i are good friends and i am very sorry to hear that gregory is in any difficulty  hastings still seemed embarrassed and she was becoming puzzled by his manner  once upon a time you would have done anything possible to make things easier for him he said  i wonder if i might ask if to some extent you have that feeling still  of course  if he is in serious trouble i should be glad to do anything within my power to help him  even if it cost we will say about six hundred english pounds  agatha gazed at him in bewildered astonishment  there are some twenty dollars in my possession which your wife handed me not long ago  still if you had the money you would be glad to help himand would not regret it afterwards  no said agatha decisively if i had the means and the need was urgent i should be glad to do what i could  then she laughed  i cant understand in the least how this is to the purpose  if you will wait for the next two or three months i may be able to explain it to you said hastings  in the meanwhile there are one or two things i have to do  agatha sat still when he left her wondering what he could have meant but feeling that she would be willing to do what she had assured him his suggestion that it was possible that she still cherished any sense of grievance against gregory because he was going to marry sally however brought a little scornful smile into her eyes  it was singularly easy to forgive gregory that for she now saw him as he wasshallow careless shiftless a man without depth of character he had a few surface graces and on occasion a certain halfinsolent forcefulness of manner which in a curious fashion was almost becoming there was however nothing beneath the surface  when he had to face a crisis he collapsed like a pricked bladder which was the first simile she could think of though she admitted that it was not a particularly elegant one  he was it seemed quite willing that a woman should help him out of the trouble he had involved himself in for she had no doubt that sally had sent hastings on his somewhat incomprehensible errand  then a clear voice came in through the window and turning towards it she saw that a young lad clad in blue duck was singing as he drove his binder through the grain  the song was a very simple one which had some vogue just then upon the prairie but her eyes grew suddenly hazy as odd snatches of it reached her through the beat of hoofs the clash of the binders arms and the rustle of the flungout sheaves    my bonny lies over the ocean   my bonny lies far over the sea   then he called to his horses and it was a few moments before she heard again    bring back my bonny to me   a quiver ran through her as she leaned upon the window frame  there was a certain pathos in the simple strain and she could fancy that the lad who was clearly english as an exile felt it too  once more as the jaded horses and clashing machine grew smaller down the edge of the great sweep of yellow grain his voice came faintly up to her with its haunting thrill of longing and regret    bring back my bonny to me   this in her case was more than anyone could do and as she stood listening a tear splashed upon her closed hands  the man by comparison with whom gregory appeared a mere lay figure was in all probability lying still far up in the solitudes of the frozen north with his last grim journey done  this time however he had not carried her picture with him  gregory was to blame for that and it was the one thing she could not forgive him  she leaned against the window for another minute struggling with an almost uncontrollable longing and looking out upon the sweep of golden wheat and whitened grass with brimming eyes until there was a rattle of wheels and she saw edmonds drive away  in another minute she heard voices in the corridor and it became evident that hastings was speaking to his wife  ive got rid of the man and its reasonable to expect that gregory will keep clear of him after this he said  dont you mean that agatha did it  it was mrs hastings who asked the question and agatha became intent as she heard her name  she did not however hear the answer and mrs hastings spoke again  allen she said you dont keep a secret badly though harry pledged you not to tell  still all that caution was a little unnecessary  it was of course just the kind of thing he would do  what did he do hastings asked and agatha heard his wifes soft laugh for they were just outside the door now  left the range or most of it to agatha in case he didnt come back again  they went on and agatha turning from the window sat down limply with the blood in her face and her heart beating horribly fast  wyllards last care it seemed had been to provide for her and that fact brought her a curious sense of solace  in an unexplainable fashion it took the bitterest sting out of her grief though how far he had succeeded in his intentions did not seem to matter in the least  it was sufficient to know that amidst all the haste of his preparation he had not forgotten her  then becoming a little calmer she understood what had been in hastingss mind during the interview that had puzzled her and was glad that she assured him of her willingness to sacrifice anything that might be hers if it was needed to set gregory free  it was she felt what wyllard would have done with the money  he had said that gregory was a friend of his and that she knew meant a good deal to him  it was however evident that she must join the others if she did not wish her absence to excite undesirable comment and going out she came face to face with sally in the corridor  the girl stopped and saw the sympathy in her eyes  yes she said impulsively ive saved him  edmonds has gone hastings bought him off and though i dont quite know how you helped him  he stayed behind to wait for you  agatha smiled  the vibrant relief in her companions voice stirred her and she realised once more that in choosing this halftaught girl at least gregory had acted with wholly unusual wisdom  it was with a sense of halfcontemptuous amusement at her folly she remembered how she had once fancied that gregory was marrying beneath him  sally was far from perfect but when it was a matter of essentials the man was not fit to brush her shoes  my dear she said i really dont know exactly what ihavedone but if it amounts to anything it is a pleasure to me  then they went together into the big general room where gregory was talking to winifred somewhat volubly  agatha however fancied from his manner that he had at least the grace to feel ashamed of himself supper she heard mrs nansen say would be ready very shortly and feeling in no mood for general conversation she sat near a window looking out across the harvest field until she heard a distant shout and saw a waggon appear on the crest of the rise  then to her astonishment two of the binders stopped and she saw a couple of men who sprang down from them run to meet the waggon  in another moment or two more of the teams stopped and a faint clamour of cries went up while here and there little running figures straggled up the slope then her companions clustered about her at the window wondering and winifred turned to hastings  what are they shouting for she asked  they are all crowding about the waggon now  agatha felt suddenly dazed and dizzy for she knew what the answer to that question must be even before mrs hastings spoke  its harry coming back she said and gasped  in another moment they streamed out of the house and agatha found it scarcely possible to follow them for the sudden revulsion of feeling had almost overpowered her  still she reached the door and saw the waggon drawn up amidst a cluster of struggling men and by and bye wyllard whom they surrounded break out as if by force from the midst of them  she stood on the threshold waiting him and in the midst of her exultation a pang smote her as she saw how gaunt and worn he was he came straight towards her apparently regardless of the others and clasping the hands she held out drew her into the house  so you have not married gregory yet he said and laughed triumphantly when he saw the answer in her shining eyes  no she said softly it is certain that i will never marry him  wyllard drew her back still further with a compelling grasp  why he asked  agatha looked up at him and then turned her eyes away  i was waiting for you she said simply  illustration i was waiting for you she said simply  then he took her in his arms and kissed her before he turned still with her hand in his to face the others who were now flocking back to the house and in another moment or two they went in together amidst a confused clamour of good wishes     the end
