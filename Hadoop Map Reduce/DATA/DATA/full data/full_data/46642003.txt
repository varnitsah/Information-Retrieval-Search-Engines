pinch of seasoning in this dull heavy life of ours one should never look to have all the troubles the labors and the cares with never a whit of innocent jollity and mirth yes one must smile now and then if for nothing else than to lift the corners of the lips in laughter that are only too often dragged down in sorrow  it is for this that i sit here now telling you all manner of odd quips and jests until yon sober wise man shakes his head and goes his way thinking that i am even more of a shallowwitted knave than i really am but prut who cares for that i am sure that i do not if you do not  yet listen one must not look to have nothing but pepper and salt in this life of oursno indeed at that rate we would be worse off than we are now i only mean that it is a good and pleasant thing to have something to lend the more solid part a little savor now and then  so here ill sit and perhaps when you have been good children and have learned your lessons or done your work your mother will let you come and play a little while with me i will always be ready and waiting for you here and i will warrant your mother that i will do you no harm with anything that i may tell you if i can only make you laugh and be merry for a little while then my work will be well done and i will be glad in the doing of it  and now give me my cap and bells again for my wits are growing cold without them

to his mother mother i would like to marry gretchenthe nice pretty little daughter of the herr mayor  jacobs mother thought that he was crazy marry the daughter of the herr mayor indeed you want to marry the daughter of the herr mayor listen many a man wants and wants and nothing comes of it  that was what jacob boehms mother said to him  but jacob was deaf in that ear nothing would do but his mother must go to the herr mayor and ask for leave for him to marry gretchen and jacob begged and begged so prettily that at last his mother promised to go and do as he wished so off she went though doubt was heavy in her shoes for she did not know how the herr mayor would take it  so jacob wants to marry gretchen does he said the herr mayor  yes that was what jacob wanted  and is he a practical huntsman said the herr mayor  oh yes he was that  so good said the herr mayor then tell jacob that when he is such a clever huntsman as to be able to shoot the whiskers off from a running hare without touching the skin then he can have gretchen  illustration jacobs mother  the herr mayor  then jacobs mother went back home again now said she jacob will at least be satisfied  yes said jacob when she had told him all that the herr mayor had said to her that is a hard thing to do but what one man has done another man can so he shouldered his gun and started away into the world to learn to be as clever a huntsman as the herr mayor had said  he plodded on and on until at last he fell in with a tall stranger dressed all in red  where are you going jacob said the tall stranger calling him by his name just as if he had eaten pottage out of the same dish with him  i am going said jacob to learn to be so clever a huntsman that i can shoot the whiskers off from a running hare without touching the skin  that is a hard thing to learn said the tall stranger  yes jacob knew that it was a hard thing but what one man had done another man could do  what will you give me if i teach you to be as clever a huntsman as that said the tall stranger  what will you take to teach me said jacob for he saw that the stranger had a horses hoof instead of a foot and he did not like his looks i can tell you  oh it is nothing much that i want said the tall man only just sign your name to this paperthat is all  but what was in the paper yes jacob had to know what was in the paper before he would set so much as a finger to it  oh there was nothing in the paper only this that when the red one should come for jacob at the end of ten years time jacob should promise to go along with him whithersoever he should take him  at this jacob hemmed and hawed and scratched his head for he did not know about that all the same said he i will sign the paper but on one condition  illustration jacob and the red one  at this the red one screwed up his face as though he had sour beer in his mouth for he did not like the sound of the word condition well said he what is the condition  it is only this said jacob that you shall be my servant for the ten years and if in all that time i should chance to ask you a question that you cannot answer then i am to be my own man again  oh if that was all the red man was quite willing for that  then he took jacobs gun and blew down into the barrel of it now said he you are as skillful a huntsman as you asked to be  that i must try said jacob so jacob and the red one went around hunting here and hunting there until they scared up a hare shoot said the red one and jacob shot clip off flew the whiskers of the hare as neatly as one could cut them off with the barbers shears  yes good said jacob now i am a skillful huntsman  then the stranger in red gave jacob a little bone whistle and told him to blow in it whenever he should want him after that jacob signed the paper and the stranger went one way and he went home again  well jacob brushed the straws off from his coat and put a fine shine on his boots and then he set off to the herr mayors house  how do you find yourself jacob said the herr mayor  so good said jacob  and are you a skillful huntsman now said the herr mayor  oh yes jacob was a skillful huntsman now  yes good but the herr mayor must have proof of that now could jacob shoot a feather out of the tail of the magpie flying over the trees yonder  oh yes nothing easier than that so jacob raised the gun to his cheek bang went the gun and down fell a feather from the tail of the magpie at this the herr mayor stared and stared for he had never seen such shooting  and now may i marry gretchen said jacob  illustration jacob shoots at the magpie  at this the herr mayor scratched his head and hemmed and hawed no jacob could not marry gretchen yet for he had always said and sworn that the man who should marry gretchen should bring with him a plough that could go of itself and plough three furrows at once if jacob would show him such a plough as that then he might marry gretchen and welcome that was what the herr mayor said  jacob did not know how about that perhaps he could get such a plough perhaps he could not if such a plough was to be had though he would have it so off he went home again and the herr mayor thought that he was rid of him now for sure and certain  but when jacob had come home he went back of the woodpile and blew a turn or two on the little bone whistle that the red stranger had given him no sooner had he done this than the other stood before him as suddenly as though he had just stepped out of the door of nowheres  what do you want jacob said he  i would like said jacob to have a plough that can go by itself and plough three furrows at once  that you shall have said the red one then he thrust his hand into his breeches pocket and drew forth the prettiest little plough that you ever saw he stood it on the ground before jacob and it grew large as you see it in the picture plough away said he and then he went back again whither he had come  so jacob laid his hands to the plough andwhiskaway it went like john stormwetters colt with jacob behind it out of the farmyard they went and down the road and so to the herr mayors house and behind them lay three fine brown furrows smoking in the sun  when the herr mayor saw them coming he opened his eyes you may be sure for he had never seen such a plough as that in all of his life before  and now said jacob i should like to marry gretchen if you please  at this the herr mayor hemmed and hawed and scratched his head again no jacob could not marry gretchen yet for the herr mayor had always said and sworn that the man who married gretchen should bring with him a purse that always had two pennies in it and could never be emptied no matter how much was taken out of it  illustration jacob and the magic plough  jacob did not know how about that perhaps he could get it and perhaps he could not if such a thing was to be had though he would have it as sure as the mecklenburg folks brew sour beer so off he went home again and the herr mayor thought that now he was rid of him for certain  but jacob went back of the woodpile and blew on his bone whistle again and once more the red one came at his bidding  what will you have now said he to jacob  i should like said jacob to have a purse which shall always have two pennies in it no matter how much i take out of it  that you shall have said the red one whereupon he thrust his hand into his pocket and fetched out a beautiful silken purse with two pennies in it he gave the purse to jacob and then he went away again as quickly as he had come  after he had gone jacob began taking pennies out of his purse and pennies out of his purse until he had more than a hatfulhui i would like to have such a purse as that  then he marched off to the herr mayors house with his chin up for he might hold his head as high as any now that he had such a purse as that in his pocket as for the herr mayor he thought that it was a nice pretty little purse but could it do this and that as he had said  jacob would show him that so he began taking pennies and pennies out of it until he had filled all the pots and pans in the house with them and now might he marry gretchen  yes that he might so said the herr mayor for who would not like to have a lad for a soninlaw who always had two pennies more in his purse than he could spend  so jacob married his gretchen and between his plough and his purse he was busy enough i can tell you  so the days went on and on and on until the ten years had gone by and the time had come for the red one to fetch jacob away with him as for jacob he was in a sorry state of dumps as you may well believe  at last gretchen spoke to him see jacob said she what makes you so down in the mouth  oh nothing at all said jacob  but this did not satisfy gretchen for she could see that there was more to be told than jacob had spoken so she teased and teased until at last jacob told her all and that the red one was to come the next day and take him off as his servant unless he could ask him a question which he could not answer  prut said gretchen and is that all then there is no stuffing to that sausage for i can help you out of your trouble easily enough then she told jacob that when the next day should come he should do thus and so and she would do this and that and between them they might cheat the red one after all  so when the next day came gretchen went into the pantry and smeared herself all over with honey then she ripped open a bed and rolled herself in the feathers  byandby came the red one rap tap tap he knocked at the door  are you ready to go with me now jacob said he  yes jacob was quite ready to go only he would like to have one favor granted him first  what is it that you want said the red one  only this said jacob i would like to shoot one more shot out of my old gun before i go with you  oh if that was all he might do that and welcome so jacob took down his gun and he and the red one went out together walking side by side for all the world as though they were born brothers  illustration jacob and the red one go hunting together  byandby they saw a wren shoot at that said the red one  oh no said jacob that is too small  so they went on a little farther  byandby they saw a raven shoot at that then said the red one  oh no said jacob that is too black  so they went on a little farther  byandby they came to a ploughed field and there was something skipping over the furrows that looked for all the world like a great bird that was gretchen for the feathers stuck to the honey and all over her so that she looked just like a great bird  shoot at that shoot at that said the red one clapping his hands together  oh yes said jacob i will shoot at that so he raised his gun and took aim then he lowered his gun again but what is it said he  at this the red one screwed up his eyes and looked and looked but for the life of him he could not tell what it was  no matter what it is said he only shoot and be done with it for i must be going  yes good but what is it said jacob  then the red one looked and looked again but he could tell no better this time than he could before it may be this and it may be that said he only shoot and be done with it for they are waiting for me at home  yes my friend said jacob that is all very good only tell me what it is and i will shoot  thunder and lightning bawled the red one i do not know what it is  then be off with you said jacob for since you cannot answer my question all is over between us two  at this the red one had to leave jacob so he fled away over hill and dale bellowing like a bull  as for jacob and gretchen they went back home together very well pleased with each other and themselves  and the meaning of all this is that many another   man beside jacob boehm would find himself     in a pretty scrape only for his wife  illustration jacob and gretchen get the best of the red one and go home together happily     illustration two opinions

gold      so they traveled day by day     in a jolly jocund way till the shoemaker a pretty lass espied     when quoth he it seems to me     there can never never be better luck than this in all the world beside      so the others said goodbye     and went on till byandby they espied a shady inn beside the way     where the hostess faira widow     in a lone seclusion hid oh here is luck the tailor said and here ill stay      so the baker jogged along     all alone with neer a song or a jest and nothing tempted him to stay     but he went from bad to worse     for he never found the purse and for all i know he is wandering to this day      it is better on the whole     for an ordinary soul so i gather from this song ive tried to sing     for to take the luck that may     chance to fall within his way than to toil for an imaginary thing  h pyle     illustration  claus  his wonderful staff   hans and claus were born brothers hans was the elder and claus was the younger hans was the richer and claus was the poorerthat is the way that the world goes sometimes  everything was easy for hans at home he drank much beer and had sausages and white bread three times a day but claus worked and worked and no luck came of itthat also is the way that the world goes sometimes  one time claus spoke to hans of this matter see hans said he you should give me some money for that which belongs to one brother should help the other  but hans saw through different colored spectacles than claus no he would do nothing of the kind if claus wanted money he had better go out into the world to look for it for some folks said that money was rolling about in the wide world like peas on a threshingfloor so said hans for claus was so poor that hans was ashamed of him and wanted him to leave home so as to be rid of him for good and all  this was how claus came to go out into the world  but before he went he cut himself a good stout staff of hazelwood to help his heavy feet over the road  now the staff that claus had cut was a rod of witchhazel which has the power of showing wherever treasure lies buried but claus knew no more of that than the chick in the shell  so off he went into the world walking along with great contentment kicking up little clouds of dust at every step and whistling as gayly as though trouble had never been hatched from mares eggs byandby he came to the great town and then he went to the marketplace and stood with many others with a straw in his mouthfor that meant that he wanted to take service with somebody  presently there came along an old old man bent almost double with the weight of the years which he carried upon his shoulders this was a famous doctor of the blackarts he had read as many as a hundred books so that he was more learned than any man in all of the worldeven the minister of the village he knew as well as the birds know when the cherries are ripe that claus had a stick of witchhazel so he came to the marketplace peering here and peering there just as honest folks do when they are looking for a servant after a while he came to where claus was and then he stopped in front of him do you want to take service my friend said he  yes that was what claus wanted why else should he stand in the marketplace with a straw in his mouth  well they bargained and bargained and talked and talked and the end of the matter was that claus agreed to sell his services to the old master of blackarts for seven pennies a week so they made their bargain and off went the master with claus at his heels after they had come a little distance away from the crowd at the marketplace the master of blackarts asked claus where he had got that fine staff of hazel  illustration claus and the master of blackarts  oh i got it over yonder said claus pointing with his thumb  but could he find the place again  well claus did not know how about that perhaps he could and perhaps he could not  but suppose that claus had a thaler in his hand then could he find the place again  oh yes in that case claus was almost sure that he could find the place again  so good then here was a bottle of yellow water if claus would take the bottle of yellow water and pour it over the stump from which he had cut his staff there would come seven green snakes out of a hole at the foot of the hazelbush after these seven snakes there would come a white snake with a golden crown on its head from out of the same hole now if claus would catch that white snake in the empty bottle and bring it to the master of blackarts he should have not one thaler but twothat was what the master said  oh yes claus could do that that was no such hard thing so he took the bottle of yellow water and off he went  byandby he came to the place where he had cut his hazeltwig there he did as the master of blackarts had told him he poured the yellow water over the stump of hazel from which he had cut his staff then everything happened just as the other had said first there came seven green snakes out of the hole at the foot of the hazelbush and after they had all gone there came a white snake with a little golden crown on its head and with its body gleaming like real silver then claus caught the white snake and put it into the bottle and corked it up tightly after he had done this he went back to the master of blackarts again  now this white snake was what the folk call a tomtsnake in that land whoever eats of a broth made of it can understand the language of all the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field so nobody need wonder that the master was as glad as glad could be to have his white snake safe and sound  illustration claus and the white snake  he bade claus build a fire of dry wood and as soon as there was a good blaze he set a pot of water upon it to boil when the water in the pot began to boil he chopped up the white snake into little pieces and threw them into it so the snake boiled and boiled and boiled and claus stared with wonder as though he would never shut his eyes again  now it happened that just about the time that the broth was cooked the master was called out of the room for this or for that no sooner was his back turned than claus began to wonder what the broth was like i will just have a little taste said he to himself surely it can do no harm to the rest of the soup so he stuck his finger first into the broth and then into his mouth but what the broth tasted like he never could tell for just then the master came in again and claus was so frightened at what he had done that he had no wits to think of the taste of anything  presently the master of blackarts went to the pot of broth and taking off the lid began smelling of it but no sooner had he sniffed a smell of the steam than he began thumping his head with his knuckles and tearing his hair and stamping his feet somebodys had a finger in my broth he roared for the master knew at once that all the magic had been taken out of it by the touch of clauss finger  as for poor claus he was so frightened that he fell upon his knees and began begging oh dear master but he got no further than this for the master bawled at him  you have taken the best  you may have the rest  and so saying he threw pot and broth and all at claus so that if he hadnt ducked his head he might have been scalded to death then claus ran out into the street for he saw that there was no place for him to stay in that house  now in the street there was a cock and a hen scratching and clucking together in the dust and claus understood every word that they said to each other so he stopped and listened to them  this is what they said  the cock said to the hen yonder goes our new servingman  and the hen said to the cock yes yonder he goes  and the cock said to the hen he is leaving the best behind him  illustration the master is angry  and the hen said to the cock what is it that he is leaving  and the cock said to the hen he is leaving behind him the witchhazel staff that he brought with him  and the hen said to the cock yes that is so he would be a fool to leave that behind yet he is not the first one to think that peas are pebbles  as for claus you can guess how he opened his eyes for he saw how the land lay and that he had other ears than he had before  hui said he that is good i have bought more for my penny than i had in my bargain  as for the hazel staff he was not going to leave that behind you may be sure so he sneaked about the place till he laid hand on it again then he stepped away right foot foremost for he did not know what the master of blackarts might do to him if he should catch him  well after he had left the town he went along tramp tramp tramp until byandby he grew tired and sat down beneath an oaktree to rest himself  illustration claus listens to the talk of the two ravens  now as he sat there looking up through the leaves thinking of nothing at all two ravens came flying and lit in the tree above him after a while the ravens began talking together and this was what they said  the one raven said yonder is poor claus sitting below us  and the other raven said poor claus did you say brother do you not see the witchhazel lying on the ground beside him  the one raven said oh yes i see that but what good does it do him  and the other raven said it does him no good now but if he were to go home again and strike on the great stone on the top of the hill back of herr axels house then it would do him good for in it lies a great treasure of silver and gold  claus had picked up his ears at all this talk you may be sure see said he that is the way that a man will pass by a great fortune in the little world at home to seek for a little fortune in the great world abroadwhich was all very true after that he lost no time in getting back home again  what are you back again said hans  oh yes said claus i am back again  that is always the way with a pewter penny said hansfor that is how some of us are welcomed home after we have been away  as for claus he was as full of thoughts as an egg is of meat but he said nothing of them to hans off he went to the high hill back of herr axels house and there sure enough was the great stone at the very top of the hill  claus struck on the stone with his oaken staff and it opened like the door of a beer vault for all was blackness within a flight of steps led down below and down the steps claus went but when he had come to the bottom of the steps he stared till his eyes were like great round saucers for there stood sacks of gold and silver piled up like bags of grain in the malthouse  illustration claus and the manikin  at one end of the room was a great stone seat and on the seat sat a little manikin smoking a pipe as for the beard of the little man it was as long as he was short for it hung down so far that part of it touched the stone floor  how do you find yourself claus said the little manikin calling claus by his name  so good said claus taking off his hat to the other  and what would you like to have claus said the little man  i would like said claus to have some money if you please  take what you want said the little man only do not forget to take the best with you  oh no claus would not forget the best so he held the staff tighter than ever in his fistfor what could be better than the staff that brought him there so he went here and there filling his pockets with the gold and silver money till they bulged out like the pockets of a thief in the orchard but all the time he kept tight hold of his staff i can tell you  when he had as much as his pockets could hold he thanked the little manikin and went his way and the stone door closed behind him  and now claus lived like a calf in the green cornfield everything he had was of the best and he had twice as much of that as any of the neighbors then how brother hans stared and scratched his head and wondered when he saw how claus sat in the sun all day doing nothing but smoking his pipe and eating of the best as though he were a born prince every day claus went to the little man in the hill with his pockets empty and came back with them stuffed with gold and silver money at last he had so much that he could not count it and so he had to send over to brother hans for his quartpot so that he might measure it  but hans was cunning i will see what makes brother claus so welloff in the world all of a sudden said he so he smeared the inside of the quartpot with birdlime  then claus measured his gold and silver money in hanss quartpot and when he was done with it he sent it back again but more went back with the quartpot than came with it for two goldpieces stuck to the birdlime and it was these that went back with the pot to brother hans  illustration hans discovers clauss luck  what cried hans has that stupid claus found so much money that he has to measure it in a quartpot we must see the inside of this business so off he went to clauss house and there he found claus sitting in the sun and smoking his pipe just as though he owned all of the world  where did you get all that money claus said hans  oh claus could not tell him that  but hans was bound to know all about it so he begged and begged so prettily that at last claus had to tell him everything then of course nothing would do but hans must have a try with the hazel staff also  well claus made no words at that he was a goodnatured fellow and surely there was enough for both so the upshot of the matter was that hans marched off with the hazel staff  but hans was no such simpleton as claus no not he oh no he would not take all that trouble for two poor pocketfuls of money he would have a bagful no he would have two bagfuls so he slung two meal sacks over his shoulder and off he started for the hill back of herr axels house  when he came to the stone he knocked upon it and it opened to him just as it had done for claus down he went into the pit and there sat the little old manikin just as he had done from the very first  how do you find yourself hans said the little old manikin  oh hans found himself very well might he have some of the money that stood around the room in the sacks  yes that he might only remember to take the best away with him  prut teach a dog to eat sausages hans would see that he took the best trust him for that so he filled the bags full of gold and never touched the silverfor surely gold is better than anything else in the world says hans to himself so when he had filled his two bags with gold and had shaken the pieces well down he flung the one over one shoulder and the other over the other and then he had as much as he could carry as for the staff of witchhazel he let it lie where it was for he only had two hands and they were both full  but hans never got his two bags of gold away from the vault for just as he was leavingbang came the stone together and caught him as though he was a mouse in the door and that was an end of him that happened because he left the witchhazel behind  that was the way in which claus came to lose his magic staff but that did not matter much for he had enough to live on and to spare so he married the daughter of the herr baron for he might marry whom he chose now that he was rich and after that he lived as happy as a fly on the warm chimney  now this is soit is better to take a little away at a   time and carry your staff with you than to     take all at once and leave it behind     illustration venturesome boldness this illustrated poem depicts the tailor

a beautiful piggy whose name         was james   and whose beauty and worth   from the day of his birth were matters of popular fame         and his claim to gentility no one could blame  so seeing his promise she thought         she ought to have him sufficiently taught         the art   of deportment to go   into company so a master of dancing she brought         who was fraught with a style which the piggiwig caught  so his company manners were rare         his care of social observances there         would bear   the closest inspection   and not a reflection could rest on his actions

hold ones tongue as to what one sees one would be the better for it they are the wise people of this world who keep silence as to what they see many such there are who behold things such as neither you nor i may ever hope to look upon and yet we know nothing of this because they say nothing of it going their own ways like common folks and as though they saw nothing in an egg but the meat  dame margery twist of tavistock town was not one of these wise folks who hold their tongues she was a good gossiping chattering old soul whose hen never hatched a chick but all of the neighbors knew of it as the saying goes the poor old creature had only one eye how she lost the other you shall presently hear and also how her wonderful tulip garden became like anybody elses tulip garden  dame margery twist lived all alone with a great tabby cat she dwelt in a little cottage that stood back from the road and just across the way from the butchers shop all within was as neat and as bright as a new pin so that it was a delight just to look upon the row of blue dishes upon the dresser the pewter pipkins as bright as silver or the sanded floor as clean as your mothers table over the cottage twined sweet woodbines so that the air was ladened with their fragrance in the summertime when the busy yellowlegged bees droned amid the blossoms from the two hives that stood along against the wall but the wonder of the garden was the tulip bed for there were no tulips in all england like them and folks came from far and near only to look upon them and to smell their fragrance they stood in double rows and were of all colorswhite yellow red purple and pied they bloomed early and lasted later than any others and when they were in flower all the air was filled with their perfume  now all of these things happened before the smoke of the factories and the rattling of the steamcars had driven the fairy folks away from this world into nomansland and this was the secret of the dames fine tulip bed for the fairies dwelt among the flowers and she often told her gossips how that she could hear the fairy mothers singing their babies to sleep at night when the moon was full and the evening was warm she had never seen the little folks herself for few folks are given to look upon them and dame margerys eyes were not of that nature nevertheless she heard them and that in my opinion is the next best thing to seeing them  dame margery twist as i said was a good kind comfortable old soul and was moreover the best nurse in all of tavistock town was any one ill it was dame margery who was called upon to attend him as for the dame herself she was always ready to bring a sick body into good health again and was always paid well for the nursing  illustration dame twist drinketh tea  one evening the dame was drinking her tea by herself with great comfort it was just at the dusking of the twilight the latticed window was opened so that the little breezes came rushing into the room or stayed a while to play wantonly with the white linen curtains the tabby cat was purring in the doorway and the dame was enjoying the sweetness of the summertime there came a knock at the door who is it said dame margery  its tommy lamb if you please maam said a little voice  come in tommy said the dame  so in came tommy lamb a little curlyheaded fellow not any older than you what is it you want tommy said the dame  if you please maam theres a little gentleman outside no taller than i be he gave me this box and told me to tell you to rub your eyes with the salve and then to come out to him  the dame looked out of the window but never a body stood there that she could see where is the gentleman dearie said she  yonder he is with a great white horse standing beside him said tommy lamb and he pointed with his finger as he spoke  the dame rubbed her eyes and looked again but never a thing did she see but the green gate the lilacbushes and the butchers shop opposite the truth of the matter is that little children like you my dear see things which we grown folks with the dust of the world in our eyes may never behold well said dame margery to herself this is strange for sure i see no little old gentleman in green then she opened the box that she held and looked into it and saw that it was filled with a green salve ill rub some of it on my eyes at any rate said she whereupon she did so then she looked again and lo and behold there stood a little old man no taller than tommy lamb his face was as brown and as withered and as wrinkled as a winters crabapple left on the bare tree when the frost is about he was dressed all in green from top to toe and on his head was a tall green cap with a bell at the peak which tinkled at every movement of his head by his side stood a great tall milkwhite horse with a long tail and mane tied with partycolored ribbons  illustration the little man and the great horse  dame margery went out to the little old gentleman in green and asked him what he would have with her he told the dame that his wife was sorely sick and that he wanted her to come and nurse her for the night at this dame margery hemmed and hawed and shook her head for she did not like the thought of going out at night she knew not where and with such a strange little body then the little man begged her and pleaded with her and his voice and his words were as sweet as honey at last he persuaded her to go promising her a good reward if she would nurse his wife back into her health again so the dame went back into the cottage to make ready for her journeying throwing her red ridingcloak over her shoulders and drawing her thick shoes upon her feet then she filled her reticule with a parcel of simples in case they should be needed after this she came out again and climbed up behind the little man in green and so settled herself upon the pillion saddle for her ride then the little man whistled to his horse and away they went  they seemed to fly rather than ride upon the hard ground for the hedges and cottages and orchards flew past as though in a dream but fast as they went the old dame saw many things which she had never dreamed of before she saw all of the hedgerows the byways the woods and fields alive with fairyfolk each little body was busy upon his or her own business laughing chatting talking and running here and there like folks on a marketday  illustration dame twist visits a strange patient  so they came at last to a place which the dame knew was the threetreehill but it was not the threetreehill which she had seen in all of her life before for a great gateway seemed to open into it and it was into this gateway that the little man in green urged the great white horse  after they had entered the hill dame margery climbed down from the pillion and stood looking about her then she saw that she was in a great hall the walls of which were glistening with gold and silver while bright stones gleamed like so many stars all over the roof of the place three little fairy children were playing with golden balls on the floor and when they saw the dame they stopped in their sport and stood looking silently upon her with great wideopened eyes just as though they were little mortal children in the corner of the room was a bed all of pure gold and over the bed were spread coverlets of gold and silver cloth and in the bed lay a beautiful little lady very white and ill then dame margery knew well enough that every one of these little people were fairies  the dame nursed the fairy lady all that night and by cockcrow in the morning the little woman had ease from her pain  then the little man spoke for the first time since dame margery had left home lookee dame margery said he i promised to pay you well and i will keep my word come hither so the dame went to him as he had bidden her to do and the little man filled her reticule with black coals from the hearth the dame said nothing but she wondered much whether the little man called this good pay for her pains after this she climbed up on the great horse again and behind the little man and they rode out of the place and home where they were safe and sound ere the day had fairly broken but before the little man had left her he drew out another little box just like the one that tommy lamb had brought her the evening before only this time the box was filled with red ointment rub your eyes with this dame margery said he  illustration dame twist drives away the little folks  now dame margery twist knew butter from cheese as the saying is she knew that the green salve was of a kind which very few people have had rubbed over their eyes in this world that it was of a kind which poets would give their ears to possesseven were it a lump no larger than a pea so when she took the box of red ointment she only rubbed one eye with ither left eye her right eye she pretended to rub but in truth she never touched it at all  then the little man got upon his horse again and rode away to his home in the hill  after he had gone away dame margery thought that she would empty her reticule of the dirty black coals so she turned it topsyturvy and shook it over the hearth and out tumbledblack coals no great lumps of pure gold that shone bright yellow like fire in the light of the candle the good dame could scarcely believe her eyes for here was wealth enough to keep her in comfort for all the rest of her days  but dame margerys right eye i wish i could only see what she saw with that right eye of hers what was it she saw that i will tell you  the next night was full moon and dame margery came and looked out over the fine bed of tulips of which she was very proud heyday she cried and rubbed her eyes in doubt as to whether she was asleep or awake for the whole place was alive with little folks  but she was awake and it was certain that she saw them yes there they werelittle men little women little children and little babies as thick in the tulip bed as folks at a wedding the little men sat smoking their pipes and talking together the little women sat nursing their babies singing to them or rocking them to sleep in cradles of tulip flowers the little children played at hideandseek among the flowerstalks so the dame leaned out of the window watching them with great delight for it is always a delight to watch the little folks at their sports  illustration dame margery twist goeth to see the merry doings at the fair  after a while she saw where one of the tiny fairy children hid himself under a leaf while the others who were to seek him looked up and down and high and low but could find him nowhere then the old dame laughed and laughed to see how the others looked for the little fellow but could not tell where he was at last she could hold her peace no longer but called out in a loud voice look under the leaf blackcap  the words were no sooner out of her mouth than whisk whirr off they scampered out of the garden and awayfathers mothers children babies all crying in their shrill voices she sees us she sees us for fairies are very timid folk and dread nothing more than to have mortals see them in their own shapes  so they never came back again to the dames garden and from that day to this her tulips have been like everybody elses tulips moreover whenever she went out the fairies scampered away before her like so many mice for they all knew that she could see them with her magical eye this as you may see was bad enough but no other harm would have come of it if she had only gathered wisdom at that time seeing what ill came of her speech but like many other old dames that i wot of no sound was so pleasant to her ears as the words of her own mouth  now about a twelvemonth after the time that the dame had nursed the fairy lady the great fair was held at tavistock all the world and his wife were there so of course dame margery went also and the fair was well worth going to i can tell you booths stood along in a row in the yellow sunlight of the summertime and flags and streamers of many colors fluttered in the breeze from long poles at the end of each booth ale flowed like water and dancing was going on on the green for peter weeks the piper was there and his pipes were with him it was a fine sight to see all of the youths and maids decked in fine ribbons of pink and blue dancing handinhand to his piping in the great tent the country people had spread out their goodsbutter cheese eggs honey and the likemaking as goodly a show as you would want to see dame margery was in her glory for she had people to gossip with everywhere so she went hither and thither and at last into the great tent where these things of which i have spoken were all spread out for show  illustration dame twist sees the little man in green for the last time  then lo and behold who should she see gliding here and there among the crowd of other people but the little man in green whom she had seen a year ago she opened her eyes mightily wide for she saw that he was doing a strange thing by his side hung a little earthenware pot and in his hand he held a little wooden scraper which he passed over the rolls of butter afterwards putting that which he scraped from the rolls into the pot that hung beside him dame margery peeped into the pot and saw that it was half full then she could contain herself no longer  heyday neighbor cried she here be pretty doings truly out upon thee to go scraping good luck and full measure off of other folks butter  when the little man in green heard the dame speak to him he was so amazed that he nearly dropped his wooden scraper why dame margery can you see me then  aye marry can i and what you are about doing also out upon you say i  and did you not rub your eyes with the red salve then said the little man  one eye yes but one eye no said the dame slyly  which eye do you see me with said he  with this eye gossip and very clearly i would have you know and she pointed to her right eye  then the little man swelled out his cheeks until they were like two little brown dumplings puff he blew a breath into the good dames eye puff he blew and if the dames eye had been a candle the light of it could not have gone out sooner  the dame felt no smart but she might wink and wink and wink again but she would never wink sight into the eye upon which the little man had blown his breath for it was blind as the stone wall back of the mill where tom the tinker kissed the millers daughter  dame margery twist never greatly missed the sight of that eye but all the same i would give both of mine for it  all of these things are told at tavistock town even to this day and if you go thither you may hear them for yourself  but i say again as i said at first if one could   only hold ones tongue as to what one sees     one would be the better for it     illustration ye song of ye gossips this is a full page illustrated poem depicting the three old maids

in fairy form first playing with the tree and then as a tempest  play  earnest  over dewy hill and lea     merrily rushed a madcap breeze at play and the daisies like the bright     stars at night danced and twinkled in its way  now a tree called to the breeze     little breeze will you come and have a play and the wind upon its way     stopped to play then the leaves with sudden shiver     sudden quiver     met the light     madcap breeze     with delight  presently the breeze grew stronger for it cared to play no longer   so it flung the limbs about   and it tossed the leaves in rout

flight and ye cobbler at work  the accident of birth    saint nicholas used to send so i am told   all newborn babes by storks in days of old  1 king friedrich max of stultzenmannenkim     for many years unto the saint did pray that he would send unto his queen and him     a baby boy to be the king some day at last the saint the kings petition heard and called to him a sober longlegged bird  2 quoth he good wilhelm stork such was its name     here is a baby boy to take away it is for fritz so bear him to the same     or rather to his queen without delay for one grows weary when one always hears the same words daily dinning in ones ears  3 now wilhelm stork was old and dull of wits     for age not always sharpens wisdom much so what does he but bear the gift to fritz     the cobbler who

clever peter  the two bottles  yes peter is clever so said his mother but then every goose thinks her own gosling a swan  the minister and all of the people of the village said peter was but a dull block maybe peter was a fool but as the old saying goes never a fool tumbles out of the tree but he lights on his toes so now you shall hear how that peter sold his two baskets of eggs for more than you or i could do wise as we be  peter said his mother  yes said peter for he was well brought up and always answered when he was spoken to  my dear little child thou art wise though so young now how shall we get money to pay our rent  sell the eggs that the speckled hen has laid said peter  but when we have spent the money for them what then  sell more eggs said peter for he had an answer for everything  but when the speckled hen lays no more eggs what shall we do then  we shall see said peter  now indeed art thou wise said his mother and i take thy meaning it is this when we have spent all we must do as the little birds do and trust in the good heaven peter meant nothing of the kind but then folks will think that such wise fellows as peter and i mean more than we say whence comes our wisdom  so the next day peter started off to the town with the basket full of nice white eggs the day was bright and warm and fair the wind blew softly and the wheatfields lay like green velvet in the sun the flowers were sprinkled all over the grass and the bees kicked up their yellow legs as they tilted into them the garlic stuck up stout spikes into the air and the young radishes were green and lusty the brown bird in the tree sang cuckoo cuckoo and peter trudged contentedly along kicking up little clouds of dust at every footstep whistling merrily and staring up into the bright sky where the white clouds hung like little sheep feeding on the wide blue field if those clouds were sheep and the sheep were mine then i would be a great man and very proud said peter but the clouds were clouds and he was not a great man nevertheless he whistled more merrily than ever for it was very nice to think of these things  so he trudged along with great comfort until high noontide against which time he had come nigh to the town for he could see the red roofs and the tall spires peeping over the crest of the next green hill by this time his stomach was crying give give for it longed for bread and cheese now a great gray stone stood near by at the forking of the road and just as peter came to it he heard a noise click clack he turned his head and lo and behold the side of the stone opened like a door and out came a little old man dressed all in fine black velvet goodday peter said he goodday sir said peter and he took off his hat as he spoke for he could see with half an eye that this little old gentleman was none of your cheeseparing fine folks  will you strike a bargain with me for your eggs said the little old man yes peter would strike a bargain what would the little gentleman give him for his eggs i will give you this said the little old man and he drew a black bottle out of his pocket  peter took the bottle and turned it over and over in his hands it is said he a pretty little good little sweet little bottle but it is not worth as much as my basket of eggs  prut said the little gentleman now you are not talking like the wise peter you should never judge by the outside of things what would you like to have  i should like said peter to have a good dinner  nothing easier said the little gentleman and he drew the cork pop pop and what should come out of the bottle but two tall men dressed all in blue with gold trimmings what will you have sir said the first of these to the little gentleman  a good dinner for two said the little man  no sooner said than done for before you could say frederic strutzenwillenbachen there stood a table with a sweet clean white cloth spread over it and on this was the nicest dinner that you ever saw for there were beer and chitterlings and cheese and good white bread fit for the king then peter and the little man fell to with might and main and ate till they could eat no more after they were done the two tall men took table and dishes and all back into the bottle again and the little gentleman corked it up  illustration clever peter  the little gentleman in black  yes said peter i will give you my basket of eggs for the little black bottle and so the bargain was struck then peter started off home and the little man went back again into the great stone and closed the door behind him he took the basket of eggs with him where he took it neither peter nor i will ever be able to tell you  so peter trudged along homeward until after a while the day waxing warm he grew tired i wish said he that i had a fine white horse to ride  then he took the cork out of the bottle pop pop and out came the two tall fellows just as they had done for the little old man what will you have sir said the first of them  i will have said peter a fine white horse to ride  no sooner said than done for there before him in the road stood a fine white horse with a long mane and tail just like so much spun silk in his mouth was a silver bit on his back was a splendid saddle covered all over with gold and jewels on his feet were shoes of pure gold so that he was a very handsome horse indeed  peter mounted on his great horse and rode away home as grand as though he were a lord or a nobleman  every one whom he met stopped in the middle of the road and looked after him just look at peter cried they but peter held his chin very high and rode along without looking at them for he knew what a fine sight he was on his white horse  and so he came home again  what didst thou get for thy eggs my little duck said his mother  i got a bottle mother said peter  then at first peters mother began to think as others thought that peter was a dull block but when she saw what a wonderful bottle it was and how it held many good things and one over she changed her mind again and thought that her peter was as wise as the moon  and now nothing was lacking in the cottage if peter and his mother wanted this it came to them if they wished for that the two tall men in the bottle fetched it they lined the house all inside with pure gold and built the chimneys of bricks of silver so that there was nothing so fine between all the four great rivers peter dressed in satin and his mother in silk and everybody called him lord peter even the minister of the village said that he was no dull boy for nobody is dull who rides on horseback and never wears wooden shoes so now peter was a rich man  illustration clever peter rides to the kings palace upon his fine horse  one morning peter said to his mother mother i am going to ask the king to let me marry his daughter  to this his mother said nothing for surely her peter was as good as any princess that ever lived  so off peter rode dressed all in his best and seated astride of a grand horse at last he came to the palace which was finer than the handsome new house of herr mayor kopff rap rap rap peter knocked at the door and presently came a neat servant girl and opened it to him is the king at home my dear said peter  yes the king was at home would he come into the parlor and sit down so peter went into the parlor and sat down and then the king came in dressed all in his best dressinggown with silver slippers upon his feet and a golden crown upon his head  what is your name said the king  peter stultzenmilchen said peter  and what do you want lord peter said the king for as i have said peter was dressed in his best clothes and the old king thought that he was a great lord  i want to marry your daughter said peter  to this the king said hummm and peter said nothing then the king said that he had determined that no one should marry his daughter without bringing him a basketful of diamonds rubies topazes emeralds pearls and all manner of precious stones for he thought by this to get rid of peter  is that all said peter nothing is easier  so off he went until he came to a chestnut woods just back of the royal kitchengarden there he uncorked his bottle pop pop and out came the two tall men what will you have sir said they peter told them what he wanted and it was no sooner said than done for there on the ground before him stood a basketful of all kinds of precious stones each of them was as large as a hens egg and over all of them was spread a nice clean white napkin so peter took the basket on his arm and went back again to the palace  but how the king did open his eyes to be sure and how he stared now said peter i should like to marry your daughter if you please  at this the king hemmed and hawed again no peter could not marry the princess yet for the king had determined that no man should marry his daughter without bringing him a bird all of pure silver that could sing whenever it was wanted and that more sweetly than a nightingale for he thought that now he should be rid of peter at any rate  nothing easier said peter and off he went again  when he had come to the chestnut woods he uncorked his bottle and told the two tall men what he wanted no sooner said than done for there was a bird all of pure silver and not only that but the bird sat in a little golden tree and the leaves of the tree were emeralds and rubies hung like cherries from the branches  then peter wrapped this up in his handkerchief and took it to the palace as for the king he could not look at it or listen to it enough  now said peter i should like to marry your daughter if you please  but at this the king sang the same tune again no peter could not marry his daughter yet for the king had determined that the man who was to marry his daughter should first bring him a golden sword so keen that it could cut a feather floating in the air yet so strong that it could cut through an iron bar  nothing easier said peter and this time the men of the bottle brought him such a sword as he asked for and the hilt was studded all over with precious stones so that it was very handsome indeed then peter brought it to the king and it did as the king would have itit cut through a feather floating in the air as for the iron bar it cut through that as easily as you would bite through a radish  illustration peter eats with the king and princess  and now it seemed as though there was nothing else to be done but to let peter marry the princess so the king asked him in to supper and they all three sat down together the king and the princess and peter and it was a fine feast i can tell you for they had both white and red wine besides sausages and cheese and real white bread and puddings and all manner of good things for kings and princesses eat and drink of the best  as for peter he made eyes at the princess and the princess looked down on her plate and blushed and peter thought that he had never seen such a pretty girl  after a while the king began to question peter how he came by all these fine thingsthe precious stones the silver bird and the golden sword but no peter would not tell then the king and the princess begged and begged him until at last peter lost his wits and told all about the bottle then the king said nothing more and presently it being nine oclock peter went to bed after he had gone the king and the princess put their heads together and the end of the matter was that the wicked king went to peters room and stole the bottle from under the pillow where he had hidden it and put one in its place that was as empty as a beer barrel after the soldiers have been in the town for the king and the princess thought that it would be a fine thing to have the bottle for themselves  when the next morning had come and they were all sitting at their breakfast together the king said now lord peter let us see what your bottle will do give us such and such a kind of wine  nothing easier said peter then he uncorked the bottle but not so much as a single dead fly came out of it  but where is the wine said the king  i do not know said peter  at this the king called him hard names and turned him out of the palace neck and heels so back poor peter went to his mother with a flea in his ear as the saying is now he was poor again and everybody called him a dull block for he rode no great white horse and he wore wooden shoes  never mind said his mother here is another basket of eggs from the speckled hen so peter set off with these to the market town as he had done with the others before when he had come to the great stone at the forking of the road whom should he meet but the same little gentleman he had met the first time will you strike a bargain said he yes peter would strike a bargain and gladly thereupon the little old man brought out another black bottle  two men are in this bottle said the little old man when they have done all that you want them to do say brikketligg and they will go back again will you trade with me yes peter would trade so peter gave the little man the eggs and the little man gave peter the second bottle and they parted very good friends  after a while peter grew tired now said he to himself i will ride a little and so he drew the cork out of the bottle pop pop out came two men from the bottle but this time they were ugly and black and each held a stout stick in his hand they said not a word but without more ado fell upon peter and began threshing him as though he was wheat on the barn floor stop stop cried peter and he went hopping and skipping up and down and here and there but it seemed as though the two ugly black men did not hear him for the blows fell as thick as hail on the roof at last he gathered his wits together like a flock of pigeons and cried brikketligg brikketligg then whisk pop they went back into the bottle again and peter corked it up and corked it tightly i can tell you  illustration clever peter and the unlucky bottle  the next day he started off to the palace once more rap rap rap he knocked at the door was the king at home yes the king was at home would he come and sit in the parlor  presently the king came in in dressinggown and slippers what are you back again said he  yes i am back again said peter  what do you want said the king  i want to marry the princess said peter  what have you brought this time said the king  i have brought another bottle said peter  then the king rubbed his hands and was very polite indeed and asked peter in to breakfast and peter went so they all three sat down together the king the princess and peter  my dear said the king to the princess the lord peter has brought another bottle with him thereat the princess was very polite also would lord peter let them see the bottle oh yes peter would do that so he drew it out of his pocket and sat it upon the table  perhaps they would like to have it opened yes that they would so peter opened the bottle  hui what a hubbub there was the king hopped about till his slippers flew off his dressinggown fluttered like great wings and his crown rolled off from his head and across the floor like a quoit at the fair as for the princess she never danced in all of her life as she danced that morning they made such a noise that the soldiers of the royal guard came running in but the two tall black men spared them no more than the king and the princess then came all of the lords of the council and they likewise danced to the same music as the rest  oh peter dear lord peter cork up your men again they all cried  will you give me back my bottle said peter  yes yes cried the king  will you marry me said peter  yes yes cried the princess  then peter said brikketligg and the two tall men popped back into the bottle again so the king gave him back his other bottle and the minister was called in and married him to the princess  after that he lived happily and when the old king died he became king over all of the land as for the princess she was as good a wife as you ever saw but peter always kept the bottle near to himmaybe that was the reason  ah me if i could only take my eggs to such a   market and get two such bottles for them     what would i do with them it would       take too long to tell you  illustration clever peter opens the unlucky bottle for the king and princess

grass   with buds and blossoms set and the shepherd played unto the lass   upon a flageolet  it seemed to me as though it was   a very pleasant thing particularly so because   the time of year was spring  but o the ground was damp and so   at least i have been told the shepherd caught the lumbago   the shepherdess a cold  my darling child the fact is   that the poets often sing of those joys

one wish for that good drinkable another for the bread the he left the faggotmaker all amazed at what hed said  i wonder says the faggotmaker after he had gone i wonder if theres any truth in that same little song so turning this thing over in his mind he cast around till he saw the empty bottle where it lay upon the ground i wish said he just as a test if what he said is so into that empty bottle now that i may straightway go no sooner said that done forwhisk into the flask he fell where he found himself as tightly packed as chicken in the shell in vain he kicked and twisted and in vain he howled with pain for in spite of all his efforts he could not get out again so seeing how the matter stood he had to wish once more when out he slipped as easily as hed gone in before  if we had

pyle     illustration a verse with a moral but no name this illustrated poem depicts the wise man asking all sorts of people  a verse with a moral but no name  a wise man once of haarlem town went wandering up and wandering down   and ever the question asked  if all the world was paper   and if all the sea was ink and if the trees were bread and cheese   what would we do for drink  then all the

hecklemann had no luck at all now and then we hear folks say that they have no luck but they only mean that their luck is bad and that they are ashamed of it everybody but hans hecklemann had luck of some kind either good or bad and what is more everybody carries his luck about with him some carry it in their pocketbooks some carry it in their hats some carry it on their finger tips and some carry it under their tonguesthese are lawyers mine is at this moment sitting astride of my pen though i can no more see it than though it was thin air whether it is good or bad depends entirely as to how you look upon it  but hans hecklemann had no luck at all how he lost it nobody knows but it is certain that it was clean gone from him  he was as poor as charity and yet his luck was not bad for poor as he was he always had enough for his wife and his family and himself to eat they all of them worked from dawn to nightfall and yet his luck was not good for he never laid one penny on top of the other as the saying is he had food enough to eat and clothes enough to wear so his luck was not indifferent now as it was neither good bad nor indifferent you see that it could have been no luck at all  hans hecklemanns wife was named catherine one evening when hans came into the cottage with just enough money to buy them all bread and not a cracked farthing to spare catherine spoke to him of this matter  hans said she you have no luck at all  illustration hans hecklemann catherine  no said hans i have not which was the truth as i have already told you  what are you going to do about it said catherine  nothing at all said hans  doing nothing puts no cabbage into the pot said catherine  it takes none out said hans  see hans said catherine go to the old wise woman in the wood and talk to her about it who knows but that she can tell you how and where you lost your luck  if i should find my luck it might be bad and not good said hans  it is worth having a look at said catherine you can leave it where you find it if it does not please you  no said hans when a man finds his luck he has to take it whether he likes it or no  so hans talked but he had made up his mind to do as catherine said to go and see the old wise woman in the wood he argued with her but he only argued with her to let her know how little was her knowledge and how great was his after he had clearly shown her how poor her advice was he took it many other men are like hans hecklemann  so early the next morning hans jogged along to the old wise womans cottage while the day was sweet and fresh the hedgerows were covered all over with white blossoms as though it was with so much snow the cuckoo was singing among the budding branches and the little flowers were looking up everywhere with their bright faces surely said hans to himself if i find my luck on this day it must be good and not ill  so he came to the little red cottage at the edge of the wood wherein lived the wise woman who knew many things and one hans scraped his feet on the stones until they were clean and then he knocked at the door  come in said the old wise woman  she was as strange an old woman as one could hope to see in a lifetime her nose bent down to meet her chin and her chin bent up to reach her nose her face was gray with great age and her hair was as white as snow she wore a long red cloak over her shoulders and a great black cat sat on the back of her chair  what do you want son hans said she  i want to find my luck mother said hans  where did you lose it son hans said she  that i do not know mother said hans  then the old wise woman said hummm in a very thoughtful voice and hans said nothing at all  after a while she spoke again have you enough to eat said she  oh yes said hans  have you enough to drink said she  plenty of water enough of milk but no beer said hans  have you enough clothes to cover you said she  oh yes said hans  are you warm enough in winter said she  oh yes said hans  then you had better leave well enough alone said she for luck can give you nothing more  but it might put money into my pocket said hans  and it might take away the good things that you already have said she  all the same i should like to find it again said hans if i could only lay my hands on it i might make good out of it even if it is bad  i doubt that said the old wise woman nevertheless she saw that hans was set in his own way and that he only talked stiffness into his stubbornness so she arose from her chair with much groaning for her joints were stiffened with age and limping to a closet in the wall she brought a book thence then she ran her finger down one page and up another until she had found that which she sought when she had found it she spoke  illustration hans hecklemann goes to the cottage of the old wise woman in search of his luck  son hans you lost your luck three years ago when you were coming from the fair at kneitlingen you sat down on the overturned cross that lies where three roads meet and it fell out of your pocket along with a silver shilling now hans your luck was evil therefore it stuck to the good sign as all evil things of that kind must like a fly to butter also i tell you this when an evil manikin such as this touches the sign of the good cross he becomes visible to the eyes of everybody who chooses to look upon him therefore go to the stone cross and you will find your luck running this way and that but never able to get away from it so saying the old woman shut her book again then she arose from her chair and went once more to the closet in the wall this time she took from it a little sack woven of black goats hair when you have found your luck again put it into this little bag said she once in it no evil imp will be able to get out again so long as you keep the strings tied and now goodbye  illustration hans hecklemann and the old wisewoman  then hans slipped the little sack into his pocket and set out for the overturned stone cross where the three roads meet when he had come to the place he looked here and there and this way and that but for a long time he could see nothing at all at last after much looking he beheld a little black beetle running hither and thither on the stone i wonder said hans if this can be my luck  so saying he caught the little beetle betwixt his finger and thumb but very carefully for he could not tell whether or not it might bite him the beetle stuck to the stone as though it had been glued there but at last hans pulled it away thenlo it was not a beetle that he held in his hand but a little manikin about as long as your thumb and as black as ink hans hecklemann was so frightened that he nearly dropped it for it kicked and screeched and rolled its red eyes in a very ugly way as he held it however he popped it into the little sack and pulled the strings tight and there it was safe and sound  that is what hans hecklemanns luck was like  so hans having his luck secure in the little sack began to bargain with it what will you do for me if i let you out said he  nothing at all snarled his luck  very well said hans we will see about that  so he carried it home with him and threw sack and all into a nasty pot where catherine cast the scrapings of the dishesthe fat and what not that she boiled down into soap now and then there he left his luck to stay until the next day and then he went to it again what will you do for me if i will let you out now said he  nothing at all snarled his luck  very well said hans we will see about that so he let him stay where he was for another day and so the fiddle played every day hans hecklemann went to his luck and asked it what it would give him if he would let it out and every day his luck said nothing and so a week or more passed  illustration hans finds his luck  at last hanss luck gave in  see hans it said one morning if you will let me out of this nasty pickle i will give you a thousand thalers  ah no said hans thalers are only thalers as my good father used to say they melt away like snow and then nothing is left of them i will trust no such luck as that  i will give you two thousand thalers said his luck  illustration hans hecklemann ploughs for gold  ah no said hans two thousand thalers are only twice one thousand thalers i will trust no such luck as that either  then what will you take to let me out hans hecklemann said his luck  look said hans yonder stands my old plough now if you will give me to find a golden noble at the end of every furrow that i strike with it i will let you out if notwhy then into the soap you go  done said hanss luck  done said hans  then he opened the mouth of the sack andpuff went his luck like wind out of a bag andpop it slipped into his breeches pocket  he never saw it again with his mortal eyes but it stayed near to him i can tell you ha ha ha it laughed in his pocket you have made an ill bargain hans i can tell you  never mind said hans i am contented  hans hecklemann did not tarry long in trying the new luck of his old plough as you may easily guess off he went like the wind and borrowed fritz friedleburgs old gray horse then he fastened the horse to the plough and struck the first furrow when he had come to the end of itpop up shot a golden noble as though some one had spun it up from the ground with his finger and thumb hans picked it up and looked at it and looked at it as though he would swallow it with his eyes then he seized the handle of the plough and struck another furrowpop up went another golden noble and hans gathered it as he had done the other one so he went on all of that day striking furrows and gathering golden nobles until all of his pockets were as full as they could hold when it was too dark to see to plough any more he took fritz friedleburgs horse back home again and then he went home himself  all of his neighbors thought that he was crazy for it was nothing but plough plough plough morning and noon and night spring and summer and autumn frost and darkness alone kept him from his labor his stable was full of fine horses and he worked them until they dropped in the furrows that he was always ploughing  yes hans is crazy they all said but when hans heard them talk in this way he only winked to himself and went on with his ploughing for he felt that he knew this from that  but ill luck danced in his pocket with the golden nobles and from the day that he closed his bargain with it he was an unhappy man he had no comfort of living for it was nothing but work work work he was up and away at his ploughing at the first dawn of day and he never came home till night had fallen so though he ploughed golden nobles he did not turn up happiness in the furrows along with them after he had eaten his supper he would sit silently behind the stove warming his fingers and thinking of some quicker way of doing his ploughing for it seemed to him that the goldpieces came in very slowly and he blamed himself that he had not asked his luck to let him turn up three at a time instead of only one at the end of each furrow so he had no comfort in his gathering wealth as day followed day he grew thin and haggard and worn but seven boxes of bright new goldpieces lay hidden in the cellar of which nobody knew but himself he told no one how rich he was growing and all of his neighbors wondered why he did not starve to death  so you see the ill luck in his breeches pocket had the best of the bargain after all  after hans had gone the way of all men his heirs found the chests full of gold in the cellar and therewith they bought fat lands and became noblemen and gentlemen but that made hanss luck none the better  from all this i gather  that few folks can turn ill luck into good luck that the best thing for one to do is to let well enough alone that one cannot get happiness as one does cabbageswith     money that happiness is the only good luck after all     illustration ye song of ye

boggart is a small imp that lives in a mans house unseen by any one doing a little good and much harm this imp was called a boggart in the old times now we call such by other namesilltemper meanness uncharitableness and the like even now they say you may find a boggart in some houses there is no placing reliance on a boggart sometimes he may seem to be of service to his master but there is no telling when he may do him an ill turn  rap tap tap came a knock at the door  the wind was piping jack frosts for the time was winter and it blew from the north the snow lay all over the ground like soft feathers and the hayricks looked as though each one wore a duncecap like the dull boy in dame weeks school over by the green the icicles hung down by the thatch and the little birds crouched shivering in the bare and leafless hedgerows  but inside the farmhouse all was warm and pleasant the great logs snapped and crackled and roared in the wide chimneyplace throwing red light up and down the walls so that the dark night only looked in through the latticed windows farmer griggs sat warming his knees at the blaze smoking his pipe in great comfort while his crock of ale with three roasted crabapples bobbing about within it warmed in the hot ashes beside the blazing logs simmering pleasantly in the ruddy heat  illustration farmer georgie griggs  dame griggss spinningwheel went hummmm hummmmm like a whole hiveful of bees the cat purred in the warmth the dog basked in the blaze and little red sparks danced about the dishes standing all along in a row on the dresser  but rap tap tap came a knock at the door  then farmer griggs took his pipe from out his mouth didee hear un dame said he zooks now there be somebody outside the door  well then thou gert oaf why dont ee let un in said dame griggs  lookee now said georgie griggs to himself sure women be of quicker wits than men so he opened the door whoo in rushed the wind and the blaze of the logs made as though it would leap up the chimney for fear  will you let me in out of the cold georgie griggs piped a small voice farmer griggs looked down and saw a little wight no taller than his knee standing in the snow on the doorstep his face was as brown as a berry and he looked up at the farmer with great eyes as bright as those of a toad the red light of the fire shone on him and georgie griggs saw that his feet were bare and that he wore no coat  who be ee little man said farmer griggs  im a boggart at your service  na na said farmer griggs thees at na sarvice omine ill give na room in my house to the likes o

illustration farmer griggs and the boggart  then farmer griggs listened a little longer without shutting the door and so did dame griggs whats thy name boggart said he  hardfist said the boggart and he came a little farther in at the door for he saw that farmer griggs had a mind to let him in all of the way  i dont know said georgie griggs scratching his head doubtfully its an ill thing lettin mischief intull the house thees better outside i doubt  shut the door georgie called out dame griggs thourt lettin th cold air intull th room  then farmer griggs shut the door but the boggart was on the inside  this is the way in which the boggart came into farmer griggss house and there he was to stay for it is no such easy matter getting rid of the likes of him when we once let him in i can tell you  the boggart came straightway over to the warm fire and the dog growledchurrrrand showed his teeth and the cat spit anger and jumped up on the dresser with her back arched and her tail on end but the boggart cared never a whit for this but laid himself comfortably down among the warm ashes  now imps like this boggart can only be seen as the frost is seenwhen it is cold so as he grew warmer and warmer he grew thin like a jellyfish and at last when he had become thoroughly warmed through farmer griggs and the dame could see him no more than though he was thin air but he was in the house and he stayed there i can tell you for a time everything went as smooth as cream all of the work of the house was done as though by magic for the boggart did all that he had promised he made the fires he baked the bread he washed the dishes he scoured the pans he scrubbed the floors he brewed the beer he roasted the meat he stuffed the sausages he skimmed the milk he made the butter he pressed the cheese he plucked the geese he spun the thread he knit the stockings he mended the clothes he patched the shoeshe was everywhere and did all of the work of the house when farmer griggs saw these things done and so deftly he rubbed his hands and chuckled to himself he sent cook and scullion and serving maid apacking there being nothing for them to do for as i said all of these things were done as smooth as cream but after a time and when the boggarts place had become easy to him like an old shoe mischief began to play the pipes and he began to show his pranks the first thing that he did was to scrape the farmers butter so that it was light of weight and all of the people of the market town hooted at him for giving less than he sold then he skimmed the childrens milk so that they had nothing but poor watery stuff to pour over their pottage of a morning he took the milk from the cat so that it was like to starve he even pilfered the bones and scrapings of the dishes from the poor housedog as though he was a very magpie he blew out the rushlights so that they were all in the dark after sunset he made the fires burn cold and played a hundred and forty other impish tricks of the like kind as for the poor little children they were always crying and complaining that the boggart did this and the boggart did that that he scraped the butter from their bread and pulled the coverlids off of them at night  still the boggart did his work well and so farmer griggs put up with his evil ways as long as he could at last the time came when he could bear it no longer lookee now mally said he to his dame its all along o thee that this troubles coome intull th house id never let the boggart in with my own goodwill so spoke farmer griggs for even nowadays there are men here and there who will now and then lay their own bundle of faults on their wives shoulders  i bade thee do naught but shut the door answered dame griggs  ay its easy enough to shut the door after the troubles come in  then turn it out again  turn un out odds bodkins thats womans wit dostee not see that theres no turnin o un out na na theres naught to do but to go out ourselves  yes there was nothing else to be done go they must if they would be rid of the boggart so one fine bright day in the blessed springtime they packed all of their belongings into a great wain or cart and set off to find a new home  oft they trudged just as you see in the picture the three little children seated high up in the wain and the farmer and the dame plodding ahead  illustration the departure  illustration farmer griggs and the wise man  now as they came to the bottom of shooters hill whom should they meet but their good neighbor and gossip jerry jinks so georgie said he youre leavin th ould house at last  high jerry quoth georgie we were forced tull it neighbor for that black boggart torments us so that there was no rest night or day for it the poor bairns stomachs are empty and the good dames nigh dead for it so off we go like th fieldfares in the autumnwere flittin were flittin  now on the wain was a tall upright churn as soon as georgie had ended his speech the lid of the churn began to clipperclapper and who should speak out of it but the boggart himself ay jerry said he were a flittin were a flittin man goodday to ye neighbor goodday to ye come and see us soon time  high cried georgie griggs art thou there thou black imp dang un well all go back tull th old house for sure its better to bear trouble there than in a new place  so back they went againboggart and all  by this you may see my dear if you warm an imp by your fire he will soon turn the whole house topsyturvy likewise one cannot get rid of a boggart by going from here to there for it is sure to be in the cart with the household things  but how did georgie griggs get rid of his boggart that i will tell you  he went to father grimes the wise man who lived on in a little house on the moor father grimes said he how shall i get rid of my boggart  then father grimes told him to take this and that and to do thus and so with them and see what followed so farmer griggs went to hugh the tailors and told him to make a pretty red coat and a neat pair of blue breeches then he went to william the hatters and bade him to make a nice little velvet cap with a bell at the top of it then he went to thomas the shoemakers and bade him to make a fine little pair of shoes so they all did as he told them and after these things were made he took them home with him he laid them on a warm spot on the hearth where the boggart used to come to sleep at night then he and his dame hid in the closet to see what would follow  presently came the boggart whisking here and dancing there though neither the farmer nor the dame could see him any more than though he had been a puff of wind  heighho cried the boggart these be fine things for sure so saying he tried the hat upon his head and it fitted exactly then he tried the coat on his shoulders and it fitted like wax then he tried the breeches on his legs and they fitted as though they grew there then he tried the shoes on his feet and there never was such a fit so he was clad in all his new clothes from top to toe whereupon he began dancing until he made the ashes on the hearth spin around with him as though they had gone mad and as he danced he sang  cap for the head alas poor head  coat for the back alas poor back  breeks for the legs alas poor legs  shoen for the feet alas poor feet  if these be mine mine cannot be  the house of honest man georgie  so he went singing and dancing and skipping and leaping out of the house and away as for georgie griggs and his dame they never heard a squeak from him afterwards  thus it was that farmer griggs got rid of his boggart all i can say is that if i could get rid of mine as easily for i have one in my own house i would make him a suit of clothes of the finest silks and satins and would hang a bell of pure silver on the point of his cap but alackaday there are no more wise men left to us like good father grimes to tell one an easy way to get rid of ones boggart  illustration the boggart rejoices     illustration ye story of a blue china plate this illustrated page depicts the father seeing the man sing to his daughter the father chasing them with a whip and then the two flying away from his as birds  ye story of a blue china plate    there was a cochin chinaman     whose name it was ahlee   and the same was just as fine a man     as you could wish to see       for he was rich and strong       and his queue was extra long and he lived on rice and fish and chiccory    which he had a lovely daughter     and her name was mairian   and the youthful wang who sought her     hand was but a poor young man     so her haughty father said     you shall never never wed such a pauper as this penniless young man    so the daughter and her lover     they eloped one summer day   which ahlee he did discover     and pursued without delay       but the goddess loo ive heard       changed each lover to a bird and from the bad ahlee they flew away    ah me ahlee the chance is     that we all of us may know   of unpleasant circumstances     we would like to stay but oh       the inevitable things       will take unto them wings and will fly where we may never hope to go       i would further like to state       that the tale which i relate       you can see on any plate that was made in cochin china years ago     illustration moral blindness this illustrated poem depicts the

come when i must go the way of everybody else now i would like to see you married before i leave you  very well said the prince for he always answered the king in seemly fashion and who shall it be  why not the princess of the white mountain said the old king  why not indeed said the young prince only she is too short  why not the princess of the blue mountain said the old king  why not indeed said the young prince only she is too tall  why not the princess of the red mountain said the old king  why not indeed said the young prince only she is too dark  then whom will you have said the old king  that i do not know said the young prince only this that her brow shall be as white as milk and her cheeks shall be as red as blood and her eyes shall be as blue as the skies and her hair shall be like spun gold  then go and find her said the old king in a huff for his temper was as short as chopped flax and dont come back again till youve found her he bawled after the prince as he went out to the door  so the prince went out into the wide world to find such a maiden as he spoke ofwhose brow was as white as milk whose cheeks were as red as blood whose eyes were as blue as the skies and whose hair was like spun goldand he would have to travel a long distance to find such a one nowadays would he not  so off he went tramp tramp tramp till his shoes were dusty and his clothes were gray nothing was in his wallet but a lump of brown bread and a cold sausage for he had gone out into the world in haste as many a one has done before and since his day  so he went along tramp tramp tramp and byandby he came to a place where three roads met and there sat an old woman  hui hui but i am hungry said the old woman  now the prince was a goodhearted fellow so he said to the old woman it is little i have but such as it is you are welcome to it thereupon he gave the old woman the lump of brown bread and the cold sausage that was in his wallet and the old woman ate it up at a bite  hui hui but i am cold said she  it is little that i have but such as it is you are welcome to it said the prince and he gave the old woman the dusty coat off his back after that he had nothing more to give her  illustration ye king prince john  one does not give something for nothing said the old woman so she began fumbling about in her pocket until she found an old rusty key and the best part of the key was that whenever one looked through the ring of it one saw everything just as it really was and not as it seemed to be  who would not give his dinner and the coat off his back for such a key  after that the prince stepped out again right foot foremost tramp tramp tramp until evening had come and he felt as hungry as one is like to do when one goes without ones dinner at last he came to a dark forest and to a gray castle that stood just in the middle of it this castle belonged to a great ugly troll though the prince knew nothing of that  now i shall have something to eat said he and he opened the door of the castle and went in  only one person was within and that was a maiden but she was as black from head to foot as fritz the charcoal burner the prince had never seen the like of her in all of his life before so he drew the rusty key out of his pocket and took a peep at her through the ring of it to see what manner of body she really was  then he saw that she was no longer black and ugly but as beautiful as a ripe apple for her forehead was as white as milk her cheeks were as red as blood her eyes were as blue as the skies and her hair was like spun gold moreover any one could see with half an eye that she was a real princess for she wore a gold crown on her head such as real princesses are never without  you are the one whom i seek said the prince  yes i am the one you seek said she  and how can i free you from your enchantment said he  if you will abide here three nights and will bear all that shall happen to you without a word then i shall be free said she  oh yes i will do that said the prince  after that the black princess set a good supper before him and the prince ate like three men  byandby there was a huge noise and the door opened and in came an ugly troll with a head as big as a bucket he rolled his great saucer eyes around till he saw the prince where he sat beside the fire  illustration the prince aids the old woman  black cats and spotted toads bellowed he what are you doing here  but to this the prince answered never a word  we shall see whether or no there is sound in you roared the troll thereupon he caught the prince by the hair and dragged him out into the middle of the room then he snatched up a great cudgel and began beating the prince as though he were a sack of barleyflour but the prince said never a word at last the troll had to give over beating him for the morning had come and the troll was afraid the sun would catch him and if that were to happen he would swell up and burst with a great noise we shall see whether you will come again said he and then he left the prince lying on the floor more dead than alive and if anybody was sore in all of the world the prince was that man  after the troll had left the house the black princess came and wept over the prince and when her tears fell on him pain and bruise left him and he was as whole as ever when he looked he saw that the black princesss feet were as white as silver  the next night the troll came again and with him two others black cats and spotted toads bellowed he are you here again then he caught the prince by the hair and dragged him out into the middle of the floor and all three of the trolls fell upon the prince and beat him with clubs as though he had been a sack of barleyflour but the prince bore this too without a word at last the morning came and they had to give over beating him we shall see if you will come again said the troll of the house  after the trolls had gone the black princess came and wept over the prince as she had done before and when her tears fell on him he was made whole again and now the hands of the black princess were as white as silver  illustration the great ugly troll finds the prince by the fire  the third night the troll of the house came and brought with him six others then the same thing happened as before and they beat the prince with great cudgels as thick as my thumb at last the morning came and they went away bellowing and howling for their enchantment had gone as for the prince he lay upon the floor more dead than alive for he could neither see nor hear anything that happened about him  then the princess came for the third time and wept over him and he was whole and sound again as for the princess she stood before him and now her brow was as white as milk and her cheeks were as red as blood and her eyes were as blue as the skies and her hair was like spun gold but the beautiful princess had little or nothing upon her so the prince wrapped her in a rams skin that was in the trolls house then he turned his toes the way he had come and started away for home taking her along with him  so they went along and along till they had come so near to the kings house that they could see the high roofs and the weathercocks over the crest of the next hill there the prince bade the princess to wait for him till he went home and brought her a dress of real silver and gold such as was fitting for her to wear then he left her and the princess sat down beside the roadside to wait until he should come again  now as the princess sat there there came along the old gooseherd of the palace and with her came her daughter for they were driving the royal geese home again from where they had been eating grass when they saw the beautiful princess clad in her rams hide they stared as though they would never shut their eyes again then they wanted to know all about herwho she was and where she came from and what she sat there for so the princess told them all that they wanted to know and that she waited there for the prince to come with a dress all of silver and gold which would suit her better than the old rams hide which she wore  then the old goosewoman thought that it would be a fine thing to have her daughter in the princesss place so that she might have the dress of real silver and gold and marry the prince so the gooseherds daughter held the princess and the old gooseherd stripped the rams hide off from her  no sooner had they done this than the princess was changed into a beautiful golden bird and flew away over hill and over valley then the gooseherds daughter clad herself in the rams hide and sat down in the princesss place  illustration the gooseherd  her daughter meet the princess at the roadside  yes my pretty little bird said the old gooseherd thou wilt make a fine princess but prut she was no more like a princess than i am for she was squat and roundshouldered and had hair of the color of tow  then the old gooseherd drove her geese away and the goosegirl waited for the coming of the prince  sure enough after a while the prince came with a fine dress all of real silver and gold but when he saw the goosegirl he beat his head with his knuckles for he thought that it was the princess and that she was enchanted again  why did he not look through the ring of his magic key  perhaps for this perhaps for thatone cannot be always wise  illustration the prince looks through the magic key  then the prince dressed the goosegirl in the fine dress of gold and silver and took her home with him hui how everybody stared and laughed when they saw what kind of a princess it was that the prince brought home with him as for the poor old king he rubbed his spectacles and looked and looked for he thought that this was a strange sort of a wife for the prince to make such a buzz about however he said nothing for he thought to himself that perhaps she would grow prettier byandby  so orders were given for a grand wedding on thursday and the old king asked all of the neighbors to come and even those who lived at a distance for this was to be a very grand wedding indeed  but the old gooseherd told her daughter to mix a sleeping powder with the princes wine at supper for if the real princess were to come at all she would come that night so the goosegirl did as she was told and the prince drank the sleeping powder with his wine and knew nothing of it  that night the golden bird came flying and sat in the linden tree just outside of the princes chamber window then she clapped her wings and sang  i wept over you once  i wept over you twice  i wept over you three times  in the rams skin i waited  and out of the rams skin i flew    why are you sleeping    life of my life  but the prince slept as sound as a dormouse and when the dawn came and the cocks crew the golden bird was forced to fly away  the next night the false princess did as she had done before and mixed a sleeping powder with the princes cup of wine  that night the golden bird came again and perched in the linden tree outside of the princes window and sang  i wept over you once  i wept over you twice  i wept over you three times  in the rams skin i waited  and out of the rams skin i flew    why are you sleeping    life of my life  but once more the prince slept through it all and when morning had come the golden bird was forced to fly away  now it chanced that that night some of the folk of the kings household heard the bird singing and they told the prince all about it so when the third night came and the false princess gave the prince the cup of wine with the sleeping powder in it he threw the wine over his shoulder and never touched so much as a drop of it  that night the bird came for the third time and sang as it had done before  but this time the prince was not sleeping he jumped out of his bed and ran to the window and there he saw the bird and its feathers shone like fire because they were of pure gold then he got his magic key and looked through the ring of it and whom should he see but his own princess sitting in the linden tree  then the prince called to her what shall i do to set you free from this enchantment  throw your knife over me said the princess  no sooner said than done the prince threw his knife over her and there she stood in her own true shape then the prince took her to the king and when the king saw how pretty she was he skipped and danced till his slippers flew about his ears  the next morning the old king went to the false princess and said what should be done to one who would do thus and so  illustration the old king rejoices at his new daughterinlaw  to this the false princess answered as bold as brass such a one should be thrown into a pit full of toads and snakes  you have spoken for yourself said the king and he would have done just so to her had not the true princess begged for her so that she was sent back again to tend the geese for that was what she was fit

and watching the lamb dance and finally a group of lambs looking at its tail as the wolves run away  ye sad story concerning on innocent little lamb and four wicked wolves  a little lamb was gamboling     upon a pleasant day and four grey wolves came shambling     and stopped to see it play       in the sun   said the lamb perhaps i may   charm these creatures with my play   and theyll let me go away       when ive done  the wolves they sat asmiling at     the playful thing to see how exceedingly beguiling that     its pretty play could be       see it hop   but its strength began to wane   though it gamboled on in pain   till it finally was fain       for to stop  oh then there was a munching     of that tender little thing and a crunching and a scrunching     as yould munch a chicken wing       no avail   was its cunning merry play   for the only thing they say   that was left of it that day       was its tail   so with me when i am done   and the critics have begun   all theyll leave me of my fun       ll be the tale  h pyle     illustration  the apple of contentment   there was a woman once and she had three daughters the first daughter squinted with both eyes yet the woman loved her as she loved salt for she herself squinted with both eyes the second daughter had one shoulder higher than the other and eyebrows as black as soot in the chimney yet the woman loved her as well as she loved the other for she herself had black eyebrows and one shoulder higher than the other the youngest daughter was as pretty as a ripe apple and had hair as fine as silk and the color of pure gold but the woman loved her not at all for as i have said she herself was neither pretty nor had she hair of the color of pure gold why all this was so even hans pfifendrummel cannot tell though he has read many books and one over  the first sister and the second sister dressed in their sunday clothes every day and sat in the sun doing nothing just as though they had been born ladies both of them  as for christinethat was the name of the youngest girlas for christine she dressed in nothing but rags and had to drive the geese to the hills in the morning and home again in the evening so that they might feed on the young grass all day and grow fat  the first sister and the second sister had white bread and butter beside and as much fresh milk as they could drink but christine had to eat cheeseparings and breadcrusts and had hardly enough of them to keep goodman hunger from whispering in her ear  this was how the churn clacked in that house  well one morning christine started off to the hills with her flock of geese and in her hands she carried her knitting at which she worked to save time so she went along the dusty road until byandby she came to a place where a bridge crossed the brook and what should she see there but a little red cap with a silver bell at the point of it hanging from the alder branch it was such a nice pretty little red cap that christine thought that she would take it home with her for she had never seen the like of it in all of her life before  so she put it in her pocket and then off she went with her geese again but she had hardly gone twoscore of paces when she heard a voice calling her christine christine  she looked and who should she see but a queer little gray man with a great head as big as a cabbage and little legs as thin as young radishes  what do you want said christine when the little man had come to where she was  oh the little man only wanted his cap again for without it he could not go back home into the hillthat was where he belonged  but how did the cap come to be hanging from the bush yes christine would like to know that before she gave it back again  illustration the little man asks far his cap  well the little hillman was fishing by the brook over yonder when a puff of wind blew his cap into the water and he just hung it up to dry that was all that there was about it and now would christine please give it to him  christine did not know how about that perhaps she would and perhaps she would not it was a nice pretty little cap what would the little underground man give her for it that was the question  oh the little man would give her five thalers for it and gladly  no five thalers was not enough for such a pretty little capsee there was a silver bell hanging to it too  well the little man did not want to be hard at a bargain he would give her a hundred thalers for it  no christine did not care for money what else would he give for this nice dear little cap  see christine said the little man i will give you this for the cap and he showed her something in his hand that looked just like a bean only it was as black as a lump of coal  yes good but what is that said christine  that said the little man is a seed from the apple of contentment plant it and from it will grow a tree and from the tree an apple everybody in the world that sees the apple will long for it but nobody in the world can pluck it but you it will always be meat and drink to you when you are hungry and warm clothes to your back when you are cold moreover as soon as you pluck it from the tree another as good will grow in its place now will you give me my hat  oh yes christine would give the little man his cap for such a seed as that and gladly enough so the little man gave christine the seed and christine gave the little man his cap again he put the cap on his head andpuffaway he was gone as suddenly as the light of a candle when you blow it out  so christine took the seed home with her and planted it before the window of her room the next morning when she looked out of the window she beheld a beautiful tree and on the tree hung an apple that shone in the sun as though it were pure gold then she went to the tree and plucked the apple as easily as though it were a gooseberry and as soon as she had plucked it another as good grew in its place being hungry she ate it and thought that she had never eaten anything as good for it tasted like pancake with honey and milk  illustration christine and the apple  byandby the oldest sister came out of the house and looked around but when she saw the beautiful tree with the golden apple hanging from it you can guess how she stared  presently she began to long and long for the apple as she had never longed for anything in her life i will just pluck it said she and no one will be the wiser for it but that was easier said than done she reached and reached but she might as well have reached for the moon she climbed and climbed but she might as well have climbed for the sunfor either one would have been as easy to get as that which she wanted at last she had to give up trying for it and her temper was none the sweeter for that you may be sure  illustration christines mother and sisters wish for the apple  after a while came the second sister and when she saw the golden apple she wanted it just as much as the first had done but to want and to get are very different things as she soon found for she was no more able to get it than the other had been  last of all came the mother and she also strove to pluck the apple but it was no use she had no more luck of her trying than her daughters all that the three could do was to stand under the tree and look at the apple and wish for it and wish for it  they are not the only ones who have done the like with the apple of contentment hanging just above them  as for christine she had nothing to do but to pluck an apple whenever she wanted it was she hungry there was the apple hanging in the tree for her was she thirsty there was the apple cold there was the apple so you see she was the happiest girl betwixt all the seven hills that stand at the ends of the earth for nobody in the world can have more than contentment and that was what the apple brought her   ii  one day a king came riding along the road and all of his people with him he looked up and saw the apple hanging in the tree and a great desire came upon him to have a taste of it so he called one of the servants to him and told him to go and ask whether it could be bought for a potful of gold  so the servant went to the house and knocked on the doorrap tap tap  what do you want said the mother of the three sisters coming to the door  oh nothing much only a king was out there in the road and wanted to know if she would sell the apple yonder for a potful of gold  yes the woman would do that just pay her the pot of gold and he might go and pluck it and welcome  so the servant gave her the pot of gold and then he tried to pluck the apple first he reached for it and then he climbed for it and then he shook the limb  but it was no use for him to try he could no more get itwellthan i could if i had been in his place  at last the servant had to go back to the king the apple was there he said and the woman had sold it but try and try as he would he could no more get it than he could get the little stars in the sky  then the king told the steward to go and get it for him but the steward though he was a tall man and a strong man could no more pluck the apple than the servant  illustration the king reaches for the apple  so he had to go back to the king with an empty fist no he could not gather it either  then the king himself went he knew that he could pluck itof course he could well he tried and tried but nothing came of his trying and he had to ride away at last without having had so much as a smell of the apple  after the king came home he talked and dreamed and thought of nothing but the apple for the more he could not get it the more he wanted itthat is the way we are made in this world at last he grew melancholy and sick for want of that which he could not get then he sent for one who was so wise that he had more in his head than ten men together this wise man told him that the only one who could pluck the fruit of contentment for him was the one to whom the tree belonged this was one of the daughters of the woman who had sold the apple to him for the pot of gold  when the king heard this he was very glad he had his horse saddled and he and his court rode away and so came at last to the cottage where christine lived there they found the mother and the elder sisters for christine was away on the hills with her geese  the king took off his hat and made a fine bow  the wise man at home had told him this and that now to which one of her daughters did the appletree belong so said the king  oh it is my oldest daughter who owns the tree said the woman  so good then if the oldest daughter would pluck the apple for him he would take her home and marry her and make a queen of her only let her get it for him without delay  prut that would never do what was the girl to climb the appletree before the king and all of the court no no let the king go home and she would bring the apple to him all in good time that was what the woman said  well the king would do that only let her make haste for he wanted it very much indeed  as soon as the king had gone the woman and her daughters sent for the goosegirl to the hills then they told her that the king wanted the apple yonder and that she must pluck it for her sister to take to him if she did not do as they said they would throw her into the well so christine had to pluck the fruit and as soon as she had done so the oldest sister wrapped it up in a napkin and set off with it to the kings house as pleased as pleased could be rap tap tap she knocked at the door had she brought the apple for the king  oh yes she had brought it here it was all wrapped up in a fine napkin  illustration the king talks with the wise man  after that they did not let her stand outside the door till her toes were cold i can tell you as soon as she had come to the king she opened her napkin believe me or not as you please all the same i tell you that there was nothing in the napkin but a hard round stone when the king saw only a stone he was so angry that he stamped like a rabbit and told them to put the girl out of the house so they did and she went home with a flea in her ear i can tell you  then the king sent his steward to the house where christine and her sisters lived  he told the woman that he had come to find whether she had any other daughters  illustration the kings steward and christine  yes the woman had another daughter and to tell the truth it was she who owned the tree just let the steward go home again and the girl would fetch the apple in a little while  as soon as the steward had gone they sent to the hills for christine again look she must pluck the apple for the second sister to take to the king if she did not do that they would throw her into the well  so christine had to pluck it and gave it to the second sister who wrapped it up in a napkin and set off for the kings house but she fared no better than the other for when she opened the napkin there was nothing in it but a lump of mud so they packed her home again with her apron to her eyes  illustration christine gives the apple to the king  after a while the kings steward came to the house again had the woman no other daughter than these two  well yes there was one but she was a poor ragged thing of no account and fit for nothing in the world but to tend the geese  where was she  oh she was up on the hills now tending her flock  but could the steward see her  yes he might see her but she was nothing but a poor simpleton  that was all very good but the steward would like to see her for that was what the king had sent him there for  so there was nothing to do but to send to the hills for christine  after a while she came and the steward asked her if she could pluck the apple yonder for the king  yes christine could do that easily enough so she reached and picked it as though it had been nothing but a gooseberry on the bush then the steward took off his hat and made her a low bow in spite of her ragged dress for he saw that she was the one for whom they had been looking all this time  so christine slipped the golden apple into her pocket and then she and the steward set off to the kings house together  when they had come there everybody began to titter and laugh behind the palms of their hands to see what a poor ragged goosegirl the steward had brought home with him but for that the steward cared not a rap  have you brought the apple said the king as soon as christine had come before him  yes here it was and christine thrust her hand into her pocket and brought it forth then the king took a great bite of it and as soon as he had done so he looked at christine and thought that he had never seen such a pretty girl as for her rags he minded them no more than one minds the spots on a cherry that was because he had eaten of the apple of contentment  and were they married of course they were and a grand wedding it was i can tell you it is a pity that you were not there but though you were not christines mother and sisters were and what is more they danced with the others though i believe they would rather have danced upon pins and needles  never mind said they we still have the apple of contentment at home though we cannot taste of it but no they had nothing of the kind the next morning it stood before the young queen christines window just as it had at her old home for it belonged to her and to no one else in all of the world that was lucky for the king for he needed a taste of it now and then as much as anybody else and no one could pluck it for him but christine  now that is all of this story what does it   mean can you not see prut rub     your spectacles and look again   the end
