91888901	a far country  by winston churchill     book 1     i  my name is hugh paret i was a corporation lawyer but by no means a typical one the choice of my profession being merely incidental and due as will be seen to the accident of environment the book i am about to write might aptly be called the autobiography of a romanticist in that sense if in no other i have been a typical american regarding my country as the happy huntingground of enlightened selfinterest as a function of my desires whether or not i have completely got rid of this romantic virus i must leave to those the aim of whose existence is to eradicate it from our literature and our life a somewhat augean task  i have been impelled therefore to make an attempt at setting forth with what frankness and sincerity i may with those powers of selection of which i am capable the life i have lived in this modern america the passions i have known the evils i have done i endeavour to write a biography of the inner life but in order to do this i shall have to relate those causal experiences of the outer existence that take place in the world of space and time in the four walls of the home in the school and university in the noisy streets in the realm of business and politics i shall try to set down impartially the motives that have impelled my actions to reveal in some degree the amazing mixture of good and evil which has made me what i am today to avoid the tricks of memory and resist the inherent desire to present myself other and better than i am your american romanticist is a sentimental spoiled child who believes in miracles whose needs are mostly baubles whose desires are dreams expediency is his motto innocent of a knowledge of the principles of the universe he lives in a state of ceaseless activity admitting no limitations impatient of all restrictions what he wants he wants very badly indeed this wanting things was the cornerstone of my character and i believe that the science of the future will bear me out when i say that it might have been differently built upon certain it is that the system of education in vogue in the 70s and 80s never contemplated the search for natural cornerstones  at all events when i look back upon the boy i was i see the beginnings of a real person who fades little by little as manhood arrives and advances until suddenly i am aware that a stranger has taken his place  i lived in a city which is now some twelve hours distant from the atlantic seaboard a very different city too it was in youth in my grandfathers day and my fathers even in my own boyhood from what it has since become in this most material of ages  there is a book of my photographs preserved by my mother which i have been looking over lately first is presented a plump child of two gazing in smiling trustfulness upon a world of sunshine later on a lean boy in plaided kilts whose wavy chestnutbrown hair has been most carefully parted on the side by norah his nurse the face is still childish then appears a youth of fourteen or thereabout in long trousers and the queerest of short jackets standing beside a marble table against a classic background he is smiling still in undiminished hope and trust despite increasing vexations and crossings meaningless lessons which had to be learned disciplines to rack an aspiring soul and long uncomfortable hours in the stiff pew of the first presbyterian church associated with this torture is a peculiar sunday smell and the faint rustling of silk dresses i can see the stern black figure of dr pound who made interminable statements to the lord  oh lord i can hear him say thou knowest  these pictures though yellowed and faded suggest vividly the being i once was the feelings that possessed and animated me love for my playmates vague impulses struggling for expression in a world forever thwarting them i recall too innocent dreams of a future unidentified dreams from which i emerged vibrating with an energy that was lost for lack of a definite objective yet it was constantly being renewed i often wonder what i might have become if it could have been harnessed directed speculations are vain calvinism though it had begun to make compromises was still a force in those days inimical to spontaneity and human instincts and when i think of calvinism i see not dr pound who preached it but my father who practised and embodied it i loved him but he made of righteousness a stern and terrible thing implying not joy but punishment the suppression rather than the expansion of aspirations his religion seemed woven all of austerity contained no shining threads to catch my eye dreams to him were matters for suspicion and distrust  i sometimes ask myself as i gaze upon his portrait now the duplicate of the one painted for the bar association whether he ever could have felt the secret hot thrills i knew and did not identify with religion his religion was real to him though he failed utterly to make it comprehensible to me the apparent calmness evenness of his life awed me a successful lawyer a respected and trusted citizen was he lacking somewhat in virility vitality i cannot judge him even today i never knew him there were times in my youth when the curtain of his unfamiliar spirit was withdrawn a little and once after i had passed the crisis of some childhood disease i awoke to find him bending over my bed with a tender expression that surprised and puzzled me  he was well educated and from his portrait a shrewd observer might divine in him a genteel taste for literature the fine features bear witness to the influence of an american environment yet suggest the intellectual englishman of matthew arnolds time the face is distinguished ascetic the chestnut hair lighter and thinner than my own the side whiskers are not too obtrusive the eyes bluegrey there is a large black cravat crossed and held by a cameo pin and the coat has odd narrow lapels his habits of mind were english although he harmonized well enough with the manners and traditions of a city whose inheritance was scotchirish and he invariably drank tea for breakfast one of my earliest recollections is of the silver breakfast service and eggcups which my greatgrandfather brought with him from sheffield to philadelphia shortly after the revolution his son dr hugh moreton paret after whom i was named was the best known physician of the city in the decorous second bank days  my mother was sarah breck hers was my scotchirish side old benjamin breck her grandfather undaunted by sea or wilderness had come straight from belfast to the little log settlement by the great river that mirrored then the mantle of primeval forest on the hills so much for chance he kept a store with a side porch and squarepaned windows where hams and sides of bacon and sugar loaves in blue glazed paper hung beside ploughs and calico prints barrels of flour of molasses and rum all of which had been somehow marvellously transported over the passes of those forbidding mountainspasses we blithely thread today in dining cars and compartment sleepers behind the store were moored the barges that floated down on the swift current to the ohio carrying goods to even remoter settlements in the western wilderness  benjamin in addition to his emigrants leather box brought with him some of that pigment that was to dye the locality for generations a deep blue i refer of course to his presbyterianism and in order the better to ensure to his progeny the fastness of this dye he married the granddaughter of a famous divine celebrated in the annals of new englandno doubt with some injusticeas a staunch advocate on the doctrine of infant damnation my cousin robert breck had old benjamins portrait which has since gone to the kinleys heaven knows who painted it though no great art were needed to suggest on canvas the tough fabric of that sitter who was more irish than scotch the heavy stick he holds might with a slight stretch of the imagination be a blackthorn his head looks capable of withstanding many blows his hand of giving many and as i gazed the other day at this picture hanging in the shabby suburban parlour i could only contrast him with his anaemic descendants who possessed the likeness between the children of poor mary kinleycousin roberts daughter and the hardy stock of the old country there is a gap indeed  benjamin breck made the foundation of a fortune it was his son who built on the second bank the wide corniced mansion in which to house comfortably his eight children there two tiers above the river lived my paternal grandfather dr paret the brecks physician and friend the durretts and the hambletons ironmasters the hollisters sherwins the mcalerys and ewansesbreck connectionsthe willetts and ogilvys in short everyone of importance in the days between the thirties and the civil war theirs were generous houses surrounded by shade trees with glorious back yardsi have been toldwhere apricots and pears and peaches and even nectarines grew  the business of breck and company wholesale grocers descended to my mothers first cousin robert breck who lived at claremore the very sound of that word once sufficed to give me a shiver of delight but the claremore i knew has disappeared as completely as atlantis and the place is now a suburb hateful word cut up into building lots and connected with boyne street and the business section of the city by trolley lines then it was the country and fairly saturated with romance cousin robert when he came into town to spend his days at the store brought with him some of this romance i had almost said of this aroma he was no suburbanite but rural to the backbone professing a most proper contempt for dwellers in towns  every summer day that dawned held claremore as a possibility and such was my capacity for joy that my appetite would depart completely when i heard my mother say questioningly and with proper wifely respect  if youre really going off on a business trip for a day or two mr paret she generally addressed my father thus formally i think ill go to roberts and take hugh  shall i tell norah to pack mother i would exclaim starting up  well see what your father thinks my dear  remain at the table until you are excused hugh he would say  released at length i would rush to norah who always rejoiced with me and then to the wire fence which marked the boundary of the peters domain next door eager with the refreshing lack of consideration characteristic of youth to announce to the peterseswho were to remain at home the news of my good fortune there would be tom and alfred and russell and julia and little myra with her grassstained knees faring forth to seek the adventures of a new day in the shady western yard myra was too young not to look wistful at my news but the others pretended indifference seeking to lessen my triumph and it was julia who invariably retorted we can go out to uncle jakes farm whenever we want to cant we tom  no journey ever taken since has equalled in ecstasy that leisurely trip of thirteen miles in the narrowgauge railroad that wound through hot fields of nodding corn tassels and between delicious acridsmelling woods to claremore no silent palace sleeping in the sun no edifice decreed by kubla khan could have worn more glamour than the house of cousin robert breck  it stood half a mile from the drowsy village deep in its own grounds amidst lawns splashed with shadows with gravel paths edgedin barbarous fashion if you please with shells there were flower beds of equally barbarous design and two iron deer which like the figures on keatss grecian urn were ever ready poised to fleeand yet never fled for cousin robert was rich as riches went in those days not only rich but comfortable stretching behind the house were sweet meadows of hay and red clover basking in the heat orchards where the cows cropped beneath the trees arbours where purple clusters of concords hung beneath warm leaves there were woods beyond into which under the guidance of willie breck i made adventurous excursions and in the autumn gathered hickories and walnuts the house was a rambling wooden mansion painted grey with red scrollwork on its porches and horsehair furniture inside oh the smell of its darkened interior on a midsummer day like the flavour of that choicest of tropical fruits the mangosteen it baffles analysis and the nearest i can come to it is a mixture of matting and cornbread with another element too subtle to define  the hospitality of that house one would have thought we had arrived my mother and i from the ends of the earth such was the welcome we got from cousin jenny cousin roberts wife from mary and helen with the flaxen pigtails from willie whom i recall as permanently without shoes or stockings met and embraced by cousin jenny at the station and driven to the house in the squeaky surrey the moment we arrived she and my mother would put on the dressingsacks i associated with hot weather and sit sewing all day long in rockingchairs at the coolest end of the piazza the women of that day scorned lying down except at night and as evening came on they donned starched dresses i recall in particular one my mother wore with little vertical stripes of black and white and a full skirt and how they talked from the beginning of the visit until the end i have often since wondered where the topics came from  it was not until nearly seven oclock that the train arrived which brought home my cousin robert he was a big man his features and even his ample moustache gave a disconcerting impression of rugged integrity and i remember him chiefly in an alpaca or seersucker coat though much less formal more democraticin a wordthan my father i stood in awe of him for a different reason and this i know now was because he possessed the penetration to discern the flaws in my youthful characterflaws that persisted in manhood none so quick as cousin robert to detect deceptions which were hidden from my mother  his hobby was carpentering and he had a little shop beside the stable filled with shining tools which willie and i in spite of their attractions were forbidden to touch willie by dire experience had learned to keep the law but on one occasion i stole in alone and promptly cut my finger with a chisel my mother and cousin jenny accepted the fiction that the injury had been done with a flint arrowhead that willie had given me but when cousin robert came home and saw my bound hand and heard the story he gave me a certain look which sticks in my mind  wonderful people those indians were he observed they could make arrowheads as sharp as chisels  i was most uncomfortable  he had a strong voice and spoke with a rising inflection and a marked accent that still remains peculiar to our locality although it was much modified in my mother and not at all noticeable in my father with an odd nasal alteration of the burr our scotchirish ancestors had brought with them across the seas for instance he always called my father mr parrret he had an admiration and respect for him that seemed to forbid the informality of matthew it was shared by others of my fathers friends and relations  sarah cousin robert would say to my mother youre coddling that boy you ought to lam him oftener hand him over to me for a couple of monthsill put him through his paces so youre going to send him to college are you hes too good for old benjamins grocery business  he was very fond of my mother though he lectured her soundly for her weakness in indulging me i can see him as he sat at the head of the supper table carving liberal helpings which mary and helen and willie devoured with country appetites watching our plates  whats the matter hugh you havent eaten all your lamb  he doesnt like fat robert my mother explained  id teach him to like it if he were my boy  well robert he isnt your boy cousin jenny would remind him his bark was worse than his bite like many kind people he made use of brusqueness to hide an inner tenderness and on the train he was hail fellow well met with every tom dick and harry that commutedalthough the word was not invented in those daysand the conductor and brakeman too but he had his standards and held to them  mine was not a questioning childhood and i was willing to accept the scheme of things as presented to me entire in my tenderer years when i had broken one of the commandments on my fathers tablet there were more than ten and had on his homecoming been sent to bed my mother would come softly upstairs after supper with a book in her hand a book of selected bible stories on which dr pound had set the seal of his approval with a glazed picture cover representing daniel in the lions den and an angel standing beside him on the somewhat specious plea that holy writ might have a chastening effect she was permitted to minister to me in my shame the amazing adventure of shadrach meshach and abednego particularly appealed to an imagination needing little stimulation it never occurred to me to doubt that these gentlemen had triumphed over caloric laws but out of my window at the back of the second storey i often saw a sudden crimson glow in the sky to the southward as though that part of the city had caught fire there were the big steelworks my mother told me belonging to mr durrett and mr hambleton the father of ralph hambleton and the grandfather of hambleton durrett my schoolmates at miss carolines i invariably connected the glow not with hambleton and ralph but with shadrach meshach and abednego later on when my father took me to the steelworks and i beheld with awe a huge pot filled with molten metal that ran out of it like water i asked himif i leaped into that stream could god save me he was shocked miracles he told me didnt happen any more  when did they stop i demanded  about two thousand years ago my son he replied gravely  then said i no matter how much i believed in god he wouldnt save me if i jumped into the big kettle for his sake  for this i was properly rebuked and silenced  my boyhood was filled with obsessing desires if god for example had cast down out of his abundant store manna and quail in the desert why couldnt he fling me a little pocket money a paltry quarter of a dollar let us say which to me represented wealth to avoid the reproach of the pharisees i went into the closet of my bedchamber to pray requesting that the quarter should be dropped on the north side of lyme street between stamford and tryon in short as conveniently near home as possible then i issued forth not feeling overconfident but hoping tom peters leaning over the ornamental castiron fence which separated his front yard from the street presently spied me scanning the sidewalk  what are you looking for hugh he demanded with interest  oh something i dropped i answered uneasily  what  naturally i refused to tell it was a broiling midsummer day julia and russell who had been warned to stay in the shade but who were engaged in the experiment of throwing the yellow cat from the top of the lattice fence to see if she would alight on her feet were presently attracted and joined in the search the mystery which i threw around it added to its interest and i was not inconsiderably annoyed suppose one of them were to find the quarter which god had intended for me would that be justice  its nothing i said and pretended to abandon the questto be renewed later but this ruse failed they continued obstinately to search and after a few minutes tom with a shout picked out of a hot crevice between the bricksa nickel  its mine i cried fiercely  did you lose it demanded julia the canny one as tom was about to give it up  my lying was generally reserved for my elders  nno i said hesitatingly but its mine all the same it wassent to me  sent to you they exclaimed in a chorus of protest and derision and how indeed was i to make good my claim the peterses when assembled were a clan led by julia and in matters of controversy moved as one how was i to tell them that in answer to my prayers for twentyfive cents god had deemed five all that was good for me  somesomebody dropped it there for me  who demanded the chorus say thats a good one  tears suddenly blinded me overcome by chagrin i turned and flew into the house and upstairs into my room locking the door behind me an interval ensued during which i nursed my sense of wrong and it pleased me to think that the money would bring a curse on the peters family at length there came a knock on the door and a voice calling my name  hugh hugh  it was tom  hughie wont you let me in i want to give you the nickel  keep it i shouted back you found it  another interval and then more knocking  open up he said coaxingly ii want to talk to you  i relented and let him in he pressed the coin into my hand i refused he pleaded  you found it i said its yours  butbut you were looking for it  that makes no difference i declared magnanimously  curiosity overcame him  say hughie if you didnt drop it who on earth did  nobody on earth i replied cryptically  naturally i declined to reveal the secret nor was this by any means the only secret i held over the peters family who never quite knew what to make of me they were not troubled with imaginations julia was a little older than tom and had a sharp tongue but over him i exercised a distinct fascination and i knew it literal himself goodnatured and warmhearted the gift i had of tingeing life with romance to put the thing optimistically of creating kingdoms out of back yardsat which julia and russell sniffedheld his allegiance firm     ii  i must have been about twelve years of age when i realized that i was possessed of the bards inheritance a momentous journey i made with my parents to boston about this time not only stimulated this gift but gave me the advantage of which other travellers before me have likewise availed themselvesof being able to take certain poetic liberties with a distant land that my friends at home had never seen often during the heat of summer noons when we were assembled under the big maple beside the lattice fence in the peters yard the spirit would move me to relate the most amazing of adventures our train for instance had been held up in the night by a band of robbers in black masks and rescued by a traveller who bore a striking resemblance to my cousin robert breck he had shot two of the robbers these fabrications once started flowed from me with ridiculous ease i experienced an unwonted exhilaration exaltation i began to believe that they had actually occurred in vain the astute julia asserted that there were no train robbers in the east what had my father done well he had been very brave but he had had no pistol had i been frightened no not at all i too had wished for a pistol why hadnt i spoken of this before well so many things had happened to me i couldnt tell them all at once it was plain that julia though often fascinated against her will deemed this sort of thing distinctly immoral  i was a boy divided in two one part of me dwelt in a fanciful realm of his own weaving and the other part was a commonplace and protesting inhabitant of a world of lessons disappointments and discipline my instincts were not vicious ideas bubbled up within me continually from an apparently inexhaustible spring and the very strength of the longings they set in motion puzzled and troubled my parents what i seem to see most distinctly now is a young mind engaged in a ceaseless struggle for selfexpression for selfdevelopment against the inertia of a tradition of which my father was the embodiment he was an enigma to me then he sincerely loved me he cherished ambitions concerning me yet thwarted every natural budding growth until i grew unconsciously to regard him as my enemy although i had an affection for him and a pride in him that flared up at times instead of confiding to him my aspirations vague though they were i became more and more secretive as i grew older i knew instinctively that he regarded these aspirations as evidences in my character of serious moral flaws and i would sooner have suffered many afternoons of his favourite punishmentsolitary confinement in my roomthan reveal to him those occasional fits of creative fancy which caused me to neglect my lessons in order to put them on paper loving literature in his way he was characteristically incapable of recognizing the literary instinct and the symptoms of its early stages he mistook for inherent frivolity for lack of respect for the truth in brief for original sin at the age of fourteen i had begun secretly alas how many things i did secretly to write stories of a sort stories that never were finished  he regarded reading as duty not pleasure he laid out books for me which i neglected he was part and parcel of that american environment in which literary ambition was regarded as sheer madness and no one who has not experienced that environment can have any conception of the pressure it exerted to stifle originality to thrust the new generation into its religious and commercial moulds shall we ever i wonder develop the enlightened education that will know how to take advantage of such initiative as was mine that will be on the watch for it sympathize with it and guide it to fruition  i was conscious of still another creative need that of dramatizing my ideas of converting them into action and this need was to lead me farther than ever afield from the path of righteousness the concrete realization of ideas as many geniuses will testify is an expensive undertaking requiring a little pocket money and i have already touched upon that subject my father did not believe in pocket money a sea story that my cousin donald ewan gave me at christmas inspired me to compose one of a somewhat different nature incidentally i deemed it a vast improvement on cousin donalds book now if i only had a boat with the assistance of ham durrett and tom peters gene hollister and perry blackwood and other friends this story of mine might be staged there were however as usual certain seemingly insuperable difficulties in the first place it was winter time in the second no facilities existed in the city for operations of a nautical character and lastly my christmas money amounted only to five dollars it was my father who pointed out these and other objections for after a careful perusal of the price lists i had sent for i had been forced to appeal to him to supply additional funds with which to purchase a rowboat incidentally he read me a lecture on extravagance referred to my last months report at the academy and finished by declaring that he would not permit me to have a boat even in the highly improbable case of somebodys presenting me with one let it not be imagined that my ardour or my determination were extinguished shortly after i had retired from his presence it occurred to me that he had said nothing to forbid my making a boat and the first thing i did after school that day was to procure for twentyfive cents a secondhand book on boat construction the woodshed was chosen as a shipbuilding establishment it was convenientand my father never went into the back yard in cold weather inquiries of lumberyards developing the disconcerting fact that four dollars and seventyfive cents was inadequate to buy the material itself to say nothing of the cost of steaming and bending the ribs i reluctantly abandoned the ideal of the graceful craft i had sketched and compromised on a flat bottom observe how the ways of deception lead to transgression i recalled the castoff lumber pile of jarvis the carpenter a goodnatured englishman coarse and fat in our neighbourhood his reputation for obscenity was so well known to mothers that i had been forbidden to go near him or his shop grits jarvis his son who had inherited the talent was also contraband i can see now the huge bulk of the elder jarvis as he stood in the melting sootpowdered snow in front of his shop and hear his comments on my pertinacity  if you ever wants another mans missus when you grows up my lad gawd elp im  why should i want another mans wife when i dont want one of my own i demanded indignant  he laughed with his customary lack of moderation  you mind what old jarvis says he cried what you wants you gets  i did get his boards by sheer insistence no doubt they were not very valuable and without question he more than made up for them in my mothers bill i also got something else of equal value to me at the momentthe assistance of grits the contraband daily after school i smuggled him into the shed through the alley acquiring likewise the services of tom peters which was more of a triumph than it would seem tom always had to be worked up to participation in my ideas but in the end he almost invariably succumbed the notion of building a boat in the dead of winter and so far from her native element naturally struck him at first as ridiculous where in jehoshaphat was i going to sail it if i ever got it made he much preferred to throw snowballs at innocent wagon drivers  all that tom saw at first was a dirty coalspattered shed with dim recesses for it was lighted on one side only and its temperature was somewhere below freezing surely he could not be blamed for a tempered enthusiasm but for me all the dirt and cold and discomfort were blotted out and i beheld a gallant craft manned by sturdy seamen forging her way across blue water in the south seas treasure island alas was as yet unwritten but among my fathers books were two old volumes in which i had hitherto taken no interest with crude engravings of palms and coral reefs of naked savages and tropical mountains covered with jungle the adventures in brief of one captain cook i also discovered a book by a later traveller spurred on by a mysterious motive power and to the great neglect of the pons asinorum and the staple products of the southern states i gathered an amazing amount of information concerning a remote portion of the globe of headhunters and poisoned stakes of typhoons of queer warcraft that crept up on you while you were dismantling galleons when desperate handtohand encounters ensued little by little as i wove all this into personal adventures soon to be realized tom forgot the snowballs and the maddened grocerymen who chased him around the block while grits would occasionally stop sawing and cry outah sy frequently adding that he would be gdd  the cold woodshed became a chantry on the new england coast the alley the wintry sea soon to embrace our ship the sawhorseswhich stood between a coalbin on one side and unused stalls filled with rubbish and kindling on the otherthe ways the yard behind the lattice fence became a backwater the flapping clothes the sails of ships that took refuge thereon mondays and tuesdays even my father was symbolized with unparalleled audacity as a watchful government which had up to the present no inkling of our semipiratical intentions the cook and the housemaid though remonstrating against the presence of grits were friendly confederates likewise old cephas the darkey who from my earliest memory carried coal and wood and blacked the shoes washed the windows and scrubbed the steps  one afternoon tom went to work  the history of the building of the good ship petrel is similar to that of all created things a story of trial and error and waste at last one march day she stood ready for launching she had even been caulked for grits from an unknown and unquestionably dubious source had procured a bucket of tar which we heated over afire in the alley and smeared into every crack it was natural that the news of such a feat as we were accomplishing should have leaked out that the yard should have been visited from time to time by interested friends some of whom came to admire some to scoff and all to speculate among the scoffers of course was ralph hambleton who stood with his hands in his pockets and cheerfully predicted all sorts of dire calamities ralph was always a superior boy tall and a trifle saturnine and cynical with an amazing selfconfidence not wholly due to the wealth of his father the ironmaster he was older than i  she wont float five minutes if you ever get her to the water was his comment and in this he was supported on general principles by julia and russell peters ralph would have none of the petrel or of the south seas either but he wantedso he saidto be in at the death the hambletons were one of the few families who at that time went to the sea for the summer and from a practical knowledge of craft in general ralph was not slow to point out the defects of ours tom and i defended her passionately  ralph was not a romanticist he was a born leader excelling at organized games exercising over boys the sort of fascination that comes from doing everything better and more easily than others it was only during the progress of such enterprises as this affair of the petrel that i succeeded in winning their allegiance bit by bit as toms had been won fanning their enthusiasm by impersonating at once achilles and homer recruiting while relating the odyssey of the expedition in glowing colours ralph always scoffed and when i had no scheme on foot they went back to him having surveyed the boat and predicted calamity he departed leaving a circle of quaint and youthful figures around the petrel in the shed gene hollister romantically inclined yet somewhat hampered by a strict parental supervision ralphs cousin ham durrett who was even then a rather fat boy goodnatured but selfish don and harry ewan my second cousins mac and nancy willett and sam and sophy mcalery nancy was a tomboy not to be denied and sophy her shadow we held a council the allimportant question of which was how to get the petrel to the water and what water to get her to the river was not to be thought of and blackstone lake some six miles from town finally logans millpond was decided ona muddy sheet on the outskirts of the city but how to get her to logans millpond cephas was at length consulted it turned out that he had a coloured friend who went by the impressive name of thomas jefferson taliaferro pronounced tolliver who was in the express business and who after surveying the boat with some misgivingsfor she was ten feet longfinally consented to transport her to tidewater for the sum of two dollars but it proved that our combined resources only amounted to a dollar and seventyfive cents ham durrett never contributed to anything on this sum thomas jefferson compromised  saturday dawned clear with a stiff march wind catching up the dust into eddies and whirling it down the street no sooner was my father safely on his way to his office than thomas jefferson was reported to be in the alley where we assembled surveying with some misgivings thomas jeffersons steed whose ability to haul the petrel two miles seemed somewhat doubtful other difficulties developed the door in the back of the shed proved to be too narrow for our ships beam but men embarked on a desperate enterprise are not to be stopped by such trifles and the problem was solved by sawing out two adjoining boards these were afterwards replaced with skill by the ships carpenter able seaman grits jarvis then the petrel by heroic efforts was got into the wagon the seat of which had been removed old thomas jefferson perched himself precariously in the bow and protestingly gathered up his ropepatched reins  folksll low ise plum crazy drivin dis yere boat he declared observing with concern that some four feet of the stern projected over the tailboard ef she topples ill git to heaven quickern a bullet  when one is shanghaied howeverin the hands of buccaneersit is too late to withdraw six shoulders upheld the rear end of the petrel others shoved and thomas jeffersons rickety horse began to move forward in spite of himself an expression of sheer terror might have been observed on the old negros crinkled face but his voice was drowned and we swept out of the alley scarcely had we travelled a block before we began to be joined by all the boys along the line of march marbles tops and even incipient baseball games were abandoned that saturday morning people ran out of their houses teamsters halted their carts the breathless excitement the exaltation i had felt on leaving the alley were now tinged with other feelings unanticipated but not wholly lacking in delectable qualityconcern and awe at these unforeseen forces i had raised at this ever growing and enthusiastic body of volunteers springing up like dragons teeth in our path after all was not i the hero of this triumphal procession the thought was consoling exhilarating and here was nancy marching at my side a little subdued perhaps but unquestionably admiring and realizing that it was i who had created all this nancy who was the aptest of pupils the most loyal of followers though i did not yet value her devotion at its real worth because she was a girl her imagination kindled at my touch and on this eventful occasion she carried in her arms a parcel the contents of which were unknown to all but ourselves at length we reached the muddy shores of logans pond where two score eager hands volunteered to assist the petrel into her native element  alas that the reality never attains to the vision i had beheld in my dreams the petrel about to take the water and nancy willett standing very straight making a little speech and crashing a bottle of wine across the bows this was the content of the mysterious parcel she had stolen it from her fathers cellar but the number of uninvited spectators which had not been foreseen considerably modified the programmeas the newspapers would have said they pushed and crowded around the ship and made frank and even brutal remarks as to her seaworthiness even nancy inured though she was to the masculine sex had fled to the heights and it looked at this supreme moment as though we should have to fight for the petrel an attempt to muster her doughty buccaneers failed the gunner too had fledgene hollister ham durrett and the ewanses were nowhere to be seen and a muster revealed only tom the fidus achates and grits jarvis  ah sy he exclaimed in the teeth of the menacing hordes stand back carnt yer ill bash yer face in johnny whose boat is this  shall it be whispered that i regretted his belligerency here in truth was the drama stagedmy drama had i only been able to realize it the good ship beached the headhunters hemming us in on all sides the scene prepared for one of those struggles against frightful odds which i had so graphically related as an essential part of our adventures  lets roll the cuss in the fancy collar proposed one of the headhuntersmeaning me  ill stove yer slats if yer touch him said grits and then resorted to appeal i sy carnt yer stand back and let a chap ave a charnst  the headhunters only jeered and what shall be said of the captain in this moment of peril shall it be told that his heart was beating wildlybumping were a better word he was trying to remember that he was the captain otherwise he must admit with shame that he too should have fled so much for romance when the test comes will he remain to fall fighting for his ship like horatius he glanced up at the hill where instead of the porch of the home where he would fain have been he beheld a wisp of a girl standing alone her hat on the back of her head her hair flying in the wind gazing intently down at him in his danger the renegade crew was nowhere to be seen there are those who demand the presence of a woman in order to be heroes  give us a chance cant you he cried repeating gritss appeal in not quite such a stentorian tone as he would have liked while his hand trembled on the gunwale tom peters it must be acknowledged was much more of a buccaneer when it was a question of deeds for he planted himself in the way of the belligerent chief of the headhunters who spoke with a decided brogue  get out of the way said tom with a little squeak in his voice yet there he was and he deserves a tribute  an unlookedfor diversion saved us from annihilation in the shape of one who had a talent for creating them we were bewilderingly aware of a girlish figure amongst us  you cowards she cried you cowards  lithe and fairly quivering with passion it was nancy who showed us how to face the headhunters they gave back they would have been brave indeed if they had not retreated before such an intense little nucleus of energy and indignation  ah give em a chanst said their chief after a moment he even helped to push the boat towards the water but he did not volunteer to be one of those to man the petrel on her maiden voyage nor did logans pond that wild march day greatly resemble the south seas nevertheless my eye on nancy i stepped proudly aboard and seized an oar grits and tom followedwhen suddenly the petrel sank considerably below the waterline as her builders had estimated it ere we fully realized this the now friendly headhunters had given us a shove and we were off the captain who should have been waving goodbye to his lady love from the poop sat down abruptlythe crew likewise not however before she had heeled to the scuppers and a halfbucket of iced water had run it headhunters were mere daily episodes in gritss existence but water he muttered something in cockney that sounded like a prayer the wind was rapidly driving us toward the middle of the pond and something cold and ticklish was seeping through the seats of our trousers we sat like statues  the bright scene etched itself in my memorythe bare brown slopes with which the pond was bordered the irish shanties the clotheslines with red flannel shirts snapping in the biting wind nancy motionless on the bank the group behind her silent now impressed in spite of itself at the sight of our intrepidity  the petrel was sailing stern first would any of us indeed ever see home again i thought of my fathers wrath turned to sorrow because he had refused to gratify a sons natural wish and present him with a real rowboat out of the corners of our eyes we watched the water creeping around the gunwale and the very muddiness of it seemed to enhance its coldness to make the horrors of its depths more mysterious and hideous the voice of grits startled us  o gawd he was saying were agoing to sink and i carnt swim the blarsted tars give way back here  is she leaking i cried  shes afilling up like a bath tub he lamented  slowly but perceptibly in truth the bow was rising and above the whistling of the wind i could hear his chattering as she settled then several things happened simultaneously an agonized cry behind me distant shouts from the shore a sudden upward lunge of the bow and the torture of being submerged inch by inch in the icy yellow water despite the splashing behind me i sat as though paralyzed until i was waist deep and the boards turned under me and then with a spasmodic contraction of my whole being i struck outonly to find my feet on the muddy bottom such was the inglorious end of the good ship petrel for she went down with all hands in little more than half a fathom of water it was not until then i realized that we had been blown clear across the pond  figures were running along the shore and as tom and i emerged dragging grits between usfor he might have been drowned there abjectly in the shallowswe were met by a stout and barearmed irishwoman whose scanty hair i remember was drawn into a tight knot behind her head and who seized us all three as though we were a bunch of carrots  come along wid ye she cried  shivering we followed her up the hill the spectators of the tragedy who by this time had come around the pond trailing after nancy was not among them inside the shanty into which we were thrust were two small children crawling about the floor and the place was filled with steam from a washtub against the wall and a boiler on the stove with a vigorous injunction to make themselves scarce the irishwoman slammed the door in the faces of the curious and ordered us to remove our clothes grits was put to bed in a corner while tom and i provided with various garments huddled over the stove there fell to my lot the red flannel shirt which i had seen on the clothesline she gave us hot coffee and was back at her washtub in no time at all her entire comment on a proceeding that seemed to tom and me to have certain elements of gravity being bys will be bys the final ironical touch was given the anticlimax when our rescuer turned out to be the mother of the chief of the headhunters himself he had lingered perforce with his brothers and sister outside the cabin until dinner time and when he came in he was meek as moses  thus the ready hospitality of the poor which passed over the heads of tom and me as we ate bread and onions and potatoes with a ravenous hunger it must have been about two oclock in the afternoon when we bade goodbye to our preserver and departed for home  at first we went at a dogtrot but presently slowed down to discuss the future looming portentously ahead of us since entire concealment was now impossible the question washow complete a confession would be necessary our cases indeed were dissimilar and toms incentive to hold back the facts was not nearly so great as mine it sometimes seemed to me in those days unjust that the peterses were able on the whole to keep out of criminal difficulties in which i was more or less continuously involved for it did not strike me that their sins were not those of the imagination the method of toms father was the slipper he and tom understood each other while between my father and myself was a great gulf fixed not that tom yearned for the slipper but he regarded its occasional applications as being as inevitable as changes in the weather lying did not come easily to him and left to himself he much preferred to confess and have the matter over with i have already suggested that i had cultivated lying that weapon of the weaker party in some degree at least in selfdefence  tom was loyal moreover my conviction would probably deprive him for six whole afternoons of my company on which he was more or less dependent but the defence of this case presented unusual difficulties and we stopped several times to thrash them out we had been absent from dinner and doubtless by this time julia had informed toms mother of the expedition and anyone could see that our clothing had been wet so i lingered in no little anxiety behind the peters stable while he made the investigation our spirits rose considerably when he returned to report that julia had unexpectedly been a trump having quieted his mother by the surmise that he was spending the day with his aunt fanny so far so good the problem now was to decide upon what to admit for we must both tell the same story  it was agreed that we had fallen into logans pond from a raft my suggestion well said tom the petrel hadnt proved much better than a raft after all i was in no mood to defend her  this designation of the petrel as a raft was my first legal quibble the question to be decided by the court was what is a raft just as the supreme tribunal of the land has been required in later years to decide what is whiskey the thing to be concealed if possible was the building of the raft although this information was already in the possession of a number of persons whose fathers might at any moment see fit to congratulate my own on being the parent of a genius it was a risk however that had to be run and secondly since grits jarvis was contraband nothing was to be said about him  i have not said much about my mother who might have been likened on such occasions to a grand jury compelled to indict yet torn between loyalty to an oath and sympathy with the defendant i went through the peters yard climbed the wire fence my object being to discover first from ella the housemaid or hannah the cook how much was known in high quarters it was hannah who as i opened the kitchen door turned at the sound and set down the saucepan she was scouring  is it home ye are mercy to goodness this on beholding my shrunken costume glory be to god youre not drownded and your mother worritin her heart out so its into the wather ye were  i admitted it  hannah i said softly  what then  does mother knowabout the boat  now dont ye be wheedlin  i managed to discover however that my mother did not know and surmised that the best reason why she had not been told had to do with hannahs criminal acquiescence concerning the operations in the shed i ran into the front hall and up the stairs and my mother heard me coming and met me on the landing  hugh where have you been  as i emerged from the semidarkness of the stairway she caught sight of my dwindled garments of the trousers well above my ankles suddenly she had me in her arms and was kissing me passionately as she stood before me in her grey belted skirt the familiar redandwhite cameo at her throat her heavy hair parted in the middle in her eyes was an odd appealing look which i know now was a sign of mother love struggling with a presbyterian conscience though she inherited that conscience i have often thought she might have succeeded in casting it offor at least some of ithad it not been for the fact that in spite of herself she worshipped its incarnation in the shape of my father her voice trembled a little as she drew me to the sofa beside the window  tell me about what happened my son she said  it was a terrible moment for me for my affections were still quiveringly alive in those days and i loved her i had for an instant an instinctive impulse to tell her the whole storysouth sea islands and all and i could have done it had i not beheld looming behind her another figure which represented a stern and unsympathetic authority and somehow made her suddenly of small account not that she would have understood the romance but she would have comprehended me i knew that she was powerless to save me from the wrath to come i wept it was because i hated to lie to heryet i did so fear gripped me andlike some respectable criminals i have since knowni understood that any confession i made would inexorably be used against me i wonder whether she knew i was lying at any rate the case appeared to be a grave one and i was presently remanded to my room to be held over for trial  vividly as i write i recall the misery of the hours i have spent while awaiting sentence in the little chamber with the honeysuckle wallpaper and steel engravings of happy but dumpy children romping in the fields and groves on this particular march afternoon the weather had become morne as the french say and i looked down sadly into the grey back yard which the wind of the morning had strewn with chips from the petrel at last when shadows were gathering in the corners of the room i heard footsteps ella appeared prim and virtuous yet a little commiserating my father wished to see me downstairs it was not the first time she had brought that summons and always her manner was the same  the scene of my trials was always the sitting room lined with grim books in their walnut cases and my father sat like a judge behind the big desk where he did his work when at home oh the distance between us at such an hour i entered as delicately as agag and the expression in his eye seemed to convict me before i could open my mouth  hugh he said your mother tells me that you have confessed to going without permission to logans pond where you embarked on a raft and fell into the water  the slight emphasis he contrived to put on the word raft sent a colder shiver down my spine than the iced water had done what did he know or was this mere suspicion too late now at any rate to plead guilty  it was a sort of a raft sir i stammered  a sort of a raft repeated my father where may i ask did you find it  ii didnt exactly find it sir  ah said my father it was the moment to glance meaningly at the jury the prisoner gulped you didnt exactly find it then will you kindly explain how you came by it  well sir weiput it together  have you any objection to stating hugh in plain english that you made it  no sir i suppose you might say that i made it  or that it was intended for a rowboat  here was the time to appeal to force a decision as to what constituted a rowboat  perhaps it might be called a rowboat sir i said abjectly  or that in direct opposition to my wishes and commands in forbidding you to have a boat to spend your money foolishly and wickedly on a whim you constructed one secretly in the woodshed took out a part of the back partition thus destroying property that did not belong to you and had the boat carted this morning to logans pond i was silent utterly undone evidently he had specific information there are certain expressions that are at times more than mere figures of speech and now my fathers wrath seemed literally towering it added visibly to his stature  hugh he said in a voice that penetrated to the very corners of my soul i utterly fail to understand you i cannot imagine how a son of mine a son of your mother who is the very soul of truthfulness and honourcan be a liar oh the terrible emphasis he put on that word nor is it as if this were a new tendencyi have punished you for it before your mother and i have tried to do our duty by you to instil into you christian teaching but it seems wholly useless i confess that i am at a less how to proceed you seem to have no conscience whatever no conception of what you owe to your parents and your god you not only persistently disregard my wishes and commands but you have for many months been leading a double life facing me every day while you were secretly and continually disobeying me i shudder to think where this determination of yours to have what you desire at any price will lead you in the future it is just such a desire that distinguishes wicked men from good  i will not linger upon a scene the very remembrance of which is painful to this day i went from my fathers presence in disgrace in an agony of spirit that was overwhelming to lock the door of my room and drop face downward on the bed to sob until my muscles twitched for he had indeed put into me an awful fear the greatest horror of my boyish imagination was a wicked man was i as he had declared utterly depraved and doomed in spite of myself to be one  there came a knock at my doorella with my supper i refused to open and sent her away to fall on my knees in the darkness and pray wildly to a god whose attributes and character were sufficiently confused in my mind on the one hand was the stern despotic monarch of the westminster catechism whom i addressed out of habit the father who condemned a portion of his children from the cradle was i one of those who he had decreed before i was born must suffer the tortures of the flames of hell putting two and two together what i had learned in sunday school and gathered from parts of dr pounds sermons and the intimation of my father that wickedness was within me like an incurable diseasewas not mine the logical conclusion what then was the use of praying my supplications ceased abruptly and my ever ready imagination stirred to its depths beheld that awful scene of the last day the darkness such as sometimes creeps over the city in winter when the jaundiced smoke falls down and we read at noonday by gaslight i beheld the tortured faces of the wicked gathered on the one side and my mother on the other amongst the blessed gazing across the gulf at me with yearning and compassion strange that it did not strike me that the sight of the condemned whom they had loved in life would have marred if not destroyed the happiness of the chosen about to receive their crowns and harps what a theologythat made the creator and preserver of all mankind thus illogical     iii  although i was imaginative i was not morbidly introspective and by the end of the first day of my incarceration my interest in that solution had waned at times however i actually yearned for someone in whom i could confide who could suggest a solution i repeat i would not for worlds have asked my father or my mother or dr pound of whom i had a wholesome fear or perhaps an unwholesome one except at morning bible reading and at church my parents never mentioned the name of the deity save to instruct me formally intended or no the effect of my religious training was to make me ashamed of discussing spiritual matters and naturally i failed to perceive that this was because it laid its emphasis on personal salvation i did not however become an unbeliever for i was not of a nature to contemplate with equanimity a godless universe  my sufferings during these series of afternoon confinements did not come from remorse but were the result of a vague sense of injury and their effect was to generate within me a strange motive power a desire to do something that would astound my father and eventually wring from him the confession that he had misjudged me to be sure i should have to wait until early manhood at least for the accomplishment of such a coup might it not be that i was an embryonic literary genius many were the books i began in this ecstasy of selfvindication only to abandon them when my confinement came to an end  it was about this time i think that i experienced one of those shocks which have a permanent effect upon character it was then the custom for ladies to spend the day with one another bringing their sewing and sometimes when i unexpectedly entered the sittingroom the voices of my mothers visitors would drop to a whisper one afternoon i returned from school to pause at the head of the stairs cousin bertha ewan and mrs mcalery were discussing with my mother an affair that i judged from the awed tone in which they spoke might prove interesting  poor grace mrs mcalery was saying i imagine shes paid a heavy penalty no man alive will be faithful under those circumstances  i stopped at the head of the stairs with a delicious guilty feeling  have they ever heard of her cousin bertha asked  it is thought they went to spain replied mrs mcalery solemnly yet not without a certain zest mr jules hollister will not have her name mentioned in his presence you know and whitcomb chased them as far as new york with a horsepistol in his pocket the report is that he got to the dock just as the ship sailed and then you know he went to live somewhere out westin iowa i believe  did he ever get a divorce cousin bertha inquired  he was too good a church member my dear my mother reminded her  well id have got one quick enough church member or no church member declared cousin bertha who had in her elements of daring  not that i mean for a moment to excuse her mrs mcalery put in but edward whitcomb did have a frightful temper and he was awfully strict with her and he was old enough anyhow to be her father grace hollister was the last woman in the world i should have suspected of doing so hideous a thing she was so sweet and simple  jennings was very attractive said my cousin bertha i dont think i ever saw a handsomer man now if he had looked at me  the sentence was never finished for at this crucial moment i dropped a grammar  i had heard enough however to excite my curiosity to the highest pitch and that evening when i came in at five oclock to study i asked my mother what had become of gene hollisters aunt  she went away hugh replied my mother looking greatly troubled  why i persisted  it is something you are too young to understand  of course i started an investigation and the next day at school i asked the question of gene hollister himself only to discover that he believed his aunt to be dead and that night he asked his mother if his aunt grace were really alive after all whereupon complications and explanations ensued between our parents of which we saw only the surface signs my father accused me of eavesdropping which i denied and sentenced me to an afternoon of solitary confinement for repeating something which i had heard in private i have reason to believe that my mother was also reprimanded  it must not be supposed that i permitted the matter to rest in addition to grits jarvis there was another contraband among my acquaintances namely alec pound the scrapegrace son of the reverend doctor pound alec had an encyclopaedic mind especially well stocked with the kind of knowledge i now desired first and last he taught me much which i would better have got in another way to him i appealed and got the story my worst suspicions being confirmed mrs whitcombs house had been across the alley from that of mr jennings but no one knew that anything was going on though there had been signals from the windowsthe neighbours afterwards remembered  i listened shudderingly  but i cried they were both married  what difference does that make when you love a woman alec replied grandly i could tell you much worse things than that  this he proceeded to do fascinated i listened with a sickening sensation it was a mild afternoon in spring and we stood in the deep limestone gutter in front of the parsonage a little gothic wooden house set in a gloomy yard  i thought said i that people couldnt love any more after they were married except each other  alec looked at me pityingly  youll get over that notion he assured me  thus another ingredient entered my character denied its food at home good food my soul eagerly consumed and made part of itself the fermenting stuff that alec pound so willing distributed and it was fermenting stuff let us see what it did to me working slowly but surely it changed for me the dawning mystery of sex into an evil instead of a holy one the knowledge of the tragedy of grace hollister started me to seeking restlessly on bookshelves and elsewhere for a secret that forever eluded me and forever led me on the word fermenting aptly describes the process begun suggesting as it does something closed up away from air and sunlight continually working in secret engendering forces that fascinated yet inspired me with fear undoubtedly this secretiveness of our elders was due to the pernicious dualism of their orthodox christianity in which love was carnal and therefore evil and the flesh not the gracious soil of the spirit but something to be deplored and condemned exorcised and transformed by the miracle of grace now love had become a terrible power gripping me whose enchantment drove men and women from home and friends and kindred to the uttermost parts of the earth  it was long before i got to sleep that night after my talk with alec pound i alternated between the horror and the romance of the story i had heard supplying for myself the details he had omitted i beheld the signals from the windows the clandestine meetings the sudden and desperate flight and to think that all this could have happened in our city not five blocks from where i lay  my consternation and horror were concentrated on the manand yet i recall a curious bifurcation instead of experiencing that automatic righteous indignation which my father and mother had felt which had animated old mr jules hollister when he had sternly forbidden his daughters name to be mentioned in his presence which had made these people outcasts there welled up within me an intense sympathy and pity by an instinctive process somehow linked with other experiences i seemed to be able to enter into the feelings of these two outcasts to understand the fearful yet fascinating nature of the impulse that had led them to elude the vigilance and probity of a world with which i myself was at odds i pictured them in a remote land shunned by mankind was there something within me that might eventually draw me to do likewise the desire in me to which my father had referred which would brook no opposition which twisted and squirmed until it found its way to its object i recalled the words of jarvis the carpenter that if i ever set my heart on another mans wife god help him god help me  a wicked man i had never beheld the handsome and fascinating mr jennings but i visualised him now dark like all villains with a black moustache and snapping black eyes he carried a cane i always associated canes with villains whereupon i arose groped for the matches lighted the gas and gazing at myself in the mirror was a little reassured to find nothing sinister in my countenance  next to my fathers faith in a moral governor of the universe was his belief in the tariff and the republican party and this belief among others he handed on to me on the cinder playground of the academy we republicans used to wage during campaigns pitched battles for the tariff it did not take a great deal of courage to be a republican in our city and i was brought up to believe that democrats were irrational inferior andwith certain exceptions like the hollistersdirty beings there was only one degree lower and that was to be a mugwump it was no wonder that the hollisters were democrats for they had a queer streak in them owing no doubt to the fact that old mr jules hollisters mother had been a frenchwoman he looked like a frenchman by the way and always wore a skullcap  i remember one autumn afternoon having a violent quarrel with gene hollister that bade fair to end in blows when he suddenly demandedill bet you anything you dont know why youre a republican  its because im for the tariff i replied triumphantly  but his next question floored me what for example was the tariff i tried to bluster it out but with no success  do you know i cried finally with sudden inspiration  it turned out that he did not  arent we darned idiots he asked to get fighting over something we dont know anything about  that was genes french blood of course but his question rankled and how was i to know that he would have got as little satisfaction if he had hurled it into the marching ranks of those imposing torchlight processions which sometimes passed our house at night with drums beating and fifes screaming and torches wavingthousands of citizens who were for the tariff for the same reason as i to wit because they were republicans  yet my father lived and died in the firm belief that the united states of america was a democracy  resolved not to be caught a second time in such a humiliating position by a democrat i asked my father that night what the tariff was but i was too young to understand it he said i was to take his word for it that the country would go to the dogs if the democrats got in and the tariff were taken away here in a nutshell though neither he nor i realized it was the political instruction of the marching hordes theirs not to reason why i was too young they too ignorant such is the method of authority  the steelmills of mr durrett and mr hambleton he continued would be forced to shut down and thousands of workmen would starve this was just a sample of what would happen prosperity would cease he declared that word prosperity made a deep impression on me and i recall the certain reverential emphasis he laid on it and while my solicitude for the workmen was not so great as his and mr durretts i was concerned as to what would happen to us if those twin gods the tariff and prosperity should take their departure from the land knowing my love for the good things of the table my father intimated with a rare humour i failed to appreciate that we should have to live henceforth in spartan simplicity after that like the intelligent workman i was firmer than ever for the tariff  such was the idealistic plane on whichand from a good mani received my first political instruction and for a long time i connected the dominance of the republican party with the continuation of manna and quails in other words with nothing that had to do with the spiritual welfare of any citizen but with clothing and food and material comforts my education was progressing  though my father revered plato and aristotle he did not apparently take very seriously the contention that that government alone is good which seeks to attain the permanent interests of the governed by evolving the character of its citizens to put the matter brutally politics despite the lofty sentiments on the transparencies in torchlight processions had only to do with the belly not the soul  politics and government one perceives had nothing to do with religion nor education with any of these a secularized and disjointed world our leading citizens learned in the classics though some of them might be paid no heed to the dictum of the greek idealist who was more practical than they would have supposed the man who does not carry his city within his heart is a spiritual starveling  one evening a year or two after that tariff campaign i was pretending to study my lessons under the student lamp in the sittingroom while my mother sewed and my father wrote at his desk when there was a ring at the doorbell i welcomed any interruption even though the visitor proved to be only the druggists boy and there was always the possibility of a telegram announcing for instance the death of a relative such had once been the case when my uncle avery paret had died in new york and i was taken out of school for a blissful four days for the funeral  i went tiptoeing into the hall and peeped over the banisters while ella opened the door i heard a voice which i recognized as that of perry blackwoods father asking for mr paret and then to my astonishment i saw filing after him into the parlour some ten or twelve persons with the exception of mr ogilvy who belonged to one of our old families and mr watling a lawyer who had married the youngest of gene hollisters aunts the visitors entered stealthily after the manner of burglars some of these were heavyjowled and all had an air of mystery that raised my curiosity and excitement to the highest pitch i caught hold of ella as she came up the stairs but she tore herself free and announced to my father that mr josiah blackwood and other gentlemen had asked to see him my father seemed puzzled as he went downstairs a long interval elapsed during which i did not make even a pretence of looking at my arithmetic at times the low hum of voices rose to what was almost an uproar and on occasions i distinguished a marked irish brogue  i wonder what they want said my mother nervously  at last we heard the front door shut behind them and my father came upstairs his usually serene face wearing a disturbed expression  who in the world was it mr paret asked my mother  my father sat down in the armchair he was clearly making an effort for selfcontrol  blackwood and ogilvy and watling and some city politicians he exclaimed  politicians she repeated what did they want that is if its anything you can tell me she added apologetically  they wished me to be the republican candidate for the mayor of this city  this tremendous news took me off my feet my father mayor  of course you didnt consider it mr paret my mother was saying  consider it he echoed reprovingly i cant imagine what ogilvy and watling and josiah blackwood were thinking of they are out of their heads i as much as told them so  this was more than i could bear for i had already pictured myself telling the news to envious schoolmates  oh father why didnt you take it i cried  by this time when he turned to me he had regained his usual expression  you dont know what youre talking about hugh he said accept a political office that sort of thing is left to politicians  the tone in which he spoke warned me that a continuation of the conversation would be unwise and my mother also understood that the discussion was closed he went back to his desk and began writing again as though nothing had happened  as for me i was left in a palpitating state of excitement which my fathers selfcontrol or sangfroid only served to irritate and enhance and my head was fairly spinning as covertly i watched his pen steadily covering the paper  how could hehow could any man of flesh and blood sit down calmly after having been offered the highest honour in the gift of his community and he had spurned it as if mr blackwood and the others had gratuitously insulted him and how was it if my father so revered the republican party that he would not suffer it to be mentioned slightingly in his presence that he had refused contemptuously to be its mayor  the next day at school however i managed to let it be known that the offer had been made and declined after all this seemed to make my father a bigger man than if he had accepted it naturally i was asked why he had declined it  he wouldnt take it i replied scornfully officeholding should be left to politicians  ralph hambleton with his precocious and cynical knowledge of the world minimized my triumph by declaring that he would rather be his grandfather nathaniel durrett than the mayor of the biggest city in the country politicians he said were bloodsuckers and thieves and the only reason for holding office was that it enabled one to steal the taxpayers money  as i have intimated my vision of a future literary career waxed and waned but a belief that i was going to be somebody rarely deserted me if not a literary lion what was that somebody to be such an environment as mine was woefully lacking in heroic figures to satisfy the romantic soul in view of the experience i have just related it is not surprising that the notion of becoming a statesman did not appeal to me nor is it to be wondered at despite the somewhat exaggerated respect and awe in which ralphs grandfather was held by my father and other influential persons that i failed to be stirred by the elements of greatness in the grim personality of our first citizen the ironmaster for he possessed such elements he lived alone in ingrain street in an uncompromising mansion i always associated with the sabbath not only because i used to be taken there on decorous sunday visits by my father but because it was the very quintessence of presbyterianism the moment i entered its portalsas mr hawthorne appropriately would have called themmy spirit was overwhelmed and suffocated by its formality and orderliness within its stern walls nathaniel durrett had made a model universe of his own such as the deity of the westminster confession had no doubt meant his greater one to be if man had not rebelled and foiled him it was a world from which i was determined to escape at any cost  my father and i were always ushered into the gloomy library with its high ceiling with its long windows that reached almost to the rococo cornice with its cold marble mantelpiece that reminded me of a tombstone with its interminable book shelves filled with yellow bindings on the centre table in addition to a ponderous bible was one of those oldfashioned carafes of red glass tipped with blue surmounted by a tumbler of blue tipped with red behind this table mr durrett sat reading a volume of sermons a really handsome old man in his black tie and pleated shirt tall and spare straight as a ramrod with a finely moulded head and straight nose and sinewy hands the colour of mulberry stain he called my father by his first name an immense compliment considering how few dared to do so  well matthew the old man would remark after they had discussed dr pounds latest flight on the nature of the trinity or the depravity of man or horticulture or the republican party do you have any better news of hugh at school  i regret to say mr durrett my father would reply that he does not yet seem to be aroused to a sense of his opportunities  whereupon mr durrett would gimble me with a blue eye that lurked beneath grizzled brows quite as painful a proceeding as if he used an iron tool i almost pity myself when i think of what a forlorn stranger i was in their company they two indeed were of one kind and i of another sort who could never understand themnor they me to what depths of despair they reduced me they never knew and yet they were doing it all for my good they only managed to convince me that my love of folly was ineradicable and that i was on my way head first for perdition i always looked during these excruciating and personal moments at the coloured glass bottle  it grieves me to hear it hugh mr durrett invariably declared youll never come to any good without study now when i was your age  i knew his history by heart a common one in this country although he made an honourable name instead of a dishonourable one and when i contrast him with those of his successors whom i was to know later but i shall not anticipate american genius had not then evolved the false entry method of overcapitalization a thrilling history mr durretts could i but have entered into it i did not reflect then that this stern old man must have throbbed once nay fire and energy still remained in his bowels else he could not have continued to dominate a city nor did it occur to me that the great steelworks that lighted the southern sky were the result of a passion of dreams similar to those possessing me but which i could not express he had founded a family whose position was virtually hereditary gained riches which for those days were great compelled men to speak his name with a certain awe but of what use were such riches as his when his religion and morality compelled him to banish from him all the joys in the power of riches to bring  no i didnt want to be an ironmaster but it may have been about this time that i began to be impressed with the power of wealth the adulation and reverence it commanded the importance in which it clothed all who shared in it  the private school i attended in the company of other boys with whom i was brought up was called densmore academy a large square building of a then hideous modernity built of smooth orangered bricks with threads of black mortar between them one reads of happy school days yet i fail to recall any really happy hours spent there even in the yard which was covered with black cinders that cut you when you fell i think of it as a penitentiary and the memory of the barred lower windows gives substance to this impression  i suppose i learned something during the seven years of my incarceration all of value had its teachers known anything of youthful psychology of natural bent could have been put into me in three at least four criminally wasted years to say nothing of the benumbing and desiccating effect of that old system of education chalk and chalkdust the mediterranean a tinted portion of the map italy a mans boot which i drew painfully with many yawns history no glorious epic revealing as it unrolls the meaning of things no revelation of that wondrous distillation of the spirit of man but an endless marching and countermarching up and down the map weary columns of figures to be learned by rote instantly to be forgotten again on june the 7th general soandso proceeded with his whole army where what does it matter one little chapter of carlyle illuminated by a teacher of understanding were worth a million such textbooks alas for the hatred of virgil paret a shiver begin at the one hundred and thirtieth line and translate i can hear myself droning out in detestable english a meaningless portion of that endless journey of the pious aeneas can see gene hollister with heartrending glances of despair stumbling through cornelius nepos in an unventilated room with chalkrubbed blackboards and heavy odours of ink and stale lunch and i graduated from densmore academy the best school in our city in the 80s without having been taught even the rudiments of citizenship  knowledge was presented to us as a corpse which bit by bit we painfully dissected we never glimpsed the living growing thing never experienced the spirit the same spirit that was able magically to waft me from a wintry lyme street to the south seas the energizing electrifying spirit of true achievement of life of god himself little by little its flames were smothered until in manhood there seemed no spark of it left alive many years were to pass ere it was to revive again as by a miracle i travelled awakening at dawn i saw framed in a porthole rosered seriphos set in a living blue that paled the sapphire the seas ulysses had sailed and the company of the argonauts my soul was steeped in unimagined colour and in the memory of one rapturous instant is gathered what i was soon to see of greece is focussed the meaning of history poetry and art i was to stand one evening in spring on the mound where heroes sleep and gaze upon the plain of marathon between darkening mountains and the blue thread of the strait peaceful now flushed with pink and white blossoms of fruit and almond trees to sit on the cliffthrone whence a persian king had looked down upon a salamis fought and lost in that porthole glimpse a themistocles was revealed a socrates a homer and a phidias an aeschylus and a pericles yes and a john brooding revelations on his seagirt rock as twilight falls over the waters  i saw the roman empire that scarlet woman whose sands were dyed crimson with blood to appease her harlotry whose ships were laden with treasures from the immutable east grain from the valley of the nile spices from arabia precious purple stuffs from tyre tribute and spoil slaves and jewels from conquered nations she absorbed and yet whose very emperors were the unconscious instruments of a progress they wot not of preserved to the west by marathon and salamis with caesars legions its message went forth across hispania to the cliffs of the wild western ocean through hercynian forests to tribes that dwelt where great rivers roll up their bars by misty northern seas and even to celtic fastnesses beyond the wall     iv  in and out of my early memories like a dancing ray of sunlight flits the spirit of nancy i was always fond of her but in extreme youth i accepted her incense with masculine complacency and took her allegiance for granted never seeking to fathom the nature of the spell i exercised over her naturally other children teased me about her but what was worse with that charming lack of selfconsciousness and consideration for what in after life are called the finer feelings they teased her about me before me my presence deterring them not at all i can see them hopping around her in the peters yard crying outnancys in love with hugh nancys in love with hugh  a sufficiently thrilling pastime this for nancy could take care of herself i was a bungler beside her when it came to retaliation and not the least of her attractions for me was her capacity for anger fury would be a better term she would fly at themeven as she flew at the headhunters when the petrel was menaced and she could run like a deer woe to the unfortunate victim she overtook masculine strength exercised apologetically availed but little and i have seen russell peters and gene hollister retire from such encounters humiliated and weeping she never caught ralph his methods of torture were more intelligent and subtle than genes and russells but she was his equal when it came to a question of tongues  i know whats the matter with you ralph hambleton she would say youre jealous an accusation that invariably put him on the defensive you think all the girls are in love with you dont you  these scenes i found somewhat embarrassing not so nancy after discomfiting her tormenters or wounding and scattering them she would return to my side in spite of her frankly expressed preference for me she had an elusiveness that made a continual appeal to my imagination she was never obvious or commonplace and long before i began to experience the discomforts and sufferings of youthful love i was fascinated by a nature eloquent with contradictions and inconsistencies she was a tomboy yet her own sex was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by contact with the other and no matter how many trees she climbed she never seemed to lose her daintiness it was innate  she could at times be surprisingly demure these impressions of her daintiness and demureness are particularly vivid in a picture my memory has retained of our walking together unattended to susan blackwoods birthday party she must have been about twelve years old it was the first time i had escorted her or any other girl to a party mrs willett had smiled over the proceeding but nancy and i took it most seriously as symbolic of things to come i can see powell street where nancy lived at four oclock on a mild and cloudy december afternoon the decorous retiring houses nancy on one side of the pavement by the iron fences and i on the other by the tree boxes i cant remember her dress only the exquisite sense of her slimness and daintiness comes back to me of her dark hair in a long braid tied with a red ribbon of her slender legs clad in black stockings of shining silk we felt the occasion to be somehow too significant too eloquent for words  in silence we climbed the flight of stone steps that led up to the blackwood mansion when suddenly the door was opened letting out sounds of music and revelry mr blackwoods coloured butler ned beamed at us hospitably inviting us to enter the brightness within the shades were drawn the carpets were covered with festal canvas the folding doors between the square rooms were flung back the prisms of the big chandeliers flung their light over animated groups of matrons and children mrs watling the mother of the watling twinstoo young to be present was directing with vivacity the game of king william was king jamess son and mrs mcalery was playing the piano         now choose you east now choose you west         now choose the one you love the best  tom peters in a velvet suit and consequently very miserable refused to embrace ethel hollister while the scornful julia lurked in a corner nothing would induce her to enter such a foolish game i experienced a novel discomfiture when ralph kissed nancy afterwards came the feast from which ham durrett in a pink paper cap with streamers was at length forcibly removed by his mother thus early did he betray his love for the flesh pots  it was not until i was sixteen that a player came and touched the keys of my soul and it awoke bewildered at these first tender notes the music quickened tripping in ecstasy to change by subtle phrases into themes of exquisite suffering hitherto unexperienced i knew that i loved nancy  with the advent of longer dresses that reached to her shoe tops a change had come over her the tomboy the willing campfollower who loved me and was unashamed were gone forever and a mysterious transfigured being neither girl nor woman had magically been evolved could it be possible that she loved me still my complacency had vanished suddenly i had become the aggressor if only i had known how to aggress but in her presence i was seized by an accursed shyness that paralyzed my tongue and the things i had planned to say were left unuttered it was somethingthough i did not realize itto be able to feel like that  the time came when i could no longer keep this thing to myself the need of an outlet of a confidant became imperative and i sought out tom peters it was in february i remember because i had venturedwith incredible daringto send nancy an elaborate rosy valentine written on the back of it in a handwriting all too thinly disguised was the following verse the triumphant result of much hard thinking in school hours            should you of this the sender guess           without another sign           would you repent and rest content           to be his valentine  i grew hot and cold by turns when i thought of its possible effects on my chances  one of those useless slushy afternoons i took tom for a walk that led us as dusk came on past nancys house only by painful degrees did i succeed in overcoming my bashfulness but tom when at last i had blurted out the secret was most sympathetic although the ailment from which i suffered was as yet outside of the realm of his experience i have used the word ailment advisedly since he evidently put my trouble in the same category with diphtheria or scarlet fever remarking that it was darned hard luck in vain i sought to explain that i did not regard it as such in the least there was suffering i admitted but a degree of bliss none could comprehend who had not felt it he refused to be envious or at least to betray envy yet he was curious asking many questions and i had reason to think before we parted that his admiration for me was increased was it possible that he too didnt love nancy no it was funny but he didnt he failed to see much in girls his tone remained commiserating yet he began to take an interest in the progress of my suit  for a time i had no progress to report out of consideration for those members of our weekly dancing class whose parents were episcopalians the meetings were discontinued during lent and to call would have demanded a courage not in me i should have become an object of ridicule among my friends and i would have died rather than face nancys mother and the members of her household i set about making ingenious plans with a view to encounters that might appear casual nancys school was dismissed at two so was mine by walking fast i could reach salisbury street near st marys seminary for young ladies in time to catch her but even then for many days i was doomed to disappointment she was either in company with other girls or else she had taken another route this i surmised led past sophy mcalerys house and i enlisted tom as a confederate he was to make straight for the mcalerys on elm while i followed powell two short blocks away and if nancy went to sophys and left there alone he was to announce the fact by a preconcerted signal through long and persistent practice he had acquired a whistle shrill enough to wake the dead accomplished by placing a finger of each hand between his teetha gift that was the envy of his acquaintances and the subject of much discussion as to whether his teeth were peculiar tom insisted that they were it was an added distinction  on this occasion he came up behind nancy as she was leaving sophys gate and immediately sounded the alarm she leaped in the air dropped her schoolbooks and whirled on him  tom peters how dare you frighten me so she cried  tom regarded her in sudden dismay  ii didnt mean to he said i didnt think you were so near  but you must have seen me  i wasnt paying much attention he equivocateda remark not calculated to appease her anger  why were you doing it  i was just practising said tom  practising exclaimed nancy scornfully i shouldnt think you needed to practise that any more  oh ive done it louder he declared listen  she seized his hands snatching them away from his lips at this critical moment i appeared around the corner considerably out of breath my heart beating like a watchmans rattle i tried to feign nonchalance  hello tom i said hello nancy whats the matter  its tomhe frightened me out of my senses dropping his wrists she gave me a most disconcerting look there was in it the suspicion of a smile what are you doing here hugh  i heard tom i explained  i should think you might have where were you  over in another street i answered with deliberate vagueness nancy had suddenly become demure i did not dare look at her but i had a most uncomfortable notion that she suspected the plot meanwhile we had begun to walk along all three of us tom obviously ill at ease and discomfited lagging a little behind just before we reached the corner i managed to kick him his departure was by no means graceful  ive got to go he announced abruptly and turned down the side street we watched his sturdy figure as it receded  well of all queer boys said nancy and we walked on again  hes my best friend i replied warmly  he doesnt seem to care much for your company said nancy  oh they have dinner at half past two i explained  arent you afraid of missing yours hugh she asked wickedly  ive got time idid rather be with you after making which audacious remark i was seized by a spasm of apprehension but nothing happened nancy remained demure she didnt remind me that i had reflected upon tom  thats nice of you hugh  oh im not saying it because its nice i faltered id rather be with you thanwith anybody  this was indeed the acme of daring i couldnt believe i had actually said it but again i received no rebuke instead came a remark that set me palpitating that i treasured for many weeks to come  i got a very nice valentine she informed me  what was it like i asked thickly  oh beautiful all pink lace andand cupids and the picture of a young man and a young woman in a garden  was that all  oh no there was a verse in the oddest handwriting i wonder who sent it  perhaps ralph i hazarded ecstatically  ralph couldnt write poetry she replied disdainfully besides it was very good poetry  i suggested other possible authors and admirers she rejected them all we reached her gate and i lingered as she looked down at me from the stone steps her eyes shone with a soft light that filled me with radiance and into her voice had come a questioning shy note that thrilled the more because it revealed a new nancy of whom i had not dreamed  perhaps ill meet you againcoming from school i said  perhaps she answered youll be late to dinner hugh if you dont go  i was late and unable to eat much dinner somewhat to my mothers alarm love had taken away my appetite after dinner when i was wandering aimlessly about the yard tom appeared on the other side of the fence  dont ever ask me to do that again he said gloomily  i did meet nancy again coming from school not every day but nearly every day at first we pretended that there was no arrangement in this and we both feigned surprise when we encountered one another it was nancy who possessed the courage that i lacked one afternoon she saidi think id better walk with the girls tomorrow hugh  i protested but she was firm and after that it was an understood thing that on certain days i should go directly home feeling like an exile sophy mcalery had begun to complain and i gathered that sophy was nancys confidante the other girls had begun to gossip it was nancy who conceived the brilliant ideathe more delightful because she said nothing about it to meof making use of sophy she would leave school with sophy and i waited on the corner near the mcalery house poor sophy she was always of those who piped while others danced in those days she had two strawcoloured pigtails and her plain faithful face is before me as i write she never betrayed to me the excitement that filled her at being the accomplice of our romance  gossip raged of course far from being disturbed we used it so to speak as a handle for our lovemaking which was carried on in an inferential rather than a direct fashion were they saying that we were lovers delightful we laughed at one another in the sunshine at last we achieved the great adventure of a clandestine meeting and went for a walk in the afternoon avoiding the houses of our friends ive forgotten which of us had the boldness to propose it the crocuses and tulips had broken the black mould the flower beds in the front yards were beginning to blaze with scarlet and yellow the lawns had turned a living green what did we talk about the substance has vanished only the flavour remains  one awoke of a morning to the twittering of birds to walk to school amidst delicate lacelike shadows of great trees acloud with old gold the buds lay curled like tiny feathers on the pavements suddenly the shade was dense the sunlight white and glaring the odour of lilacs heavy in the air spring in all its fulness had comespring and nancy just so subtly yet with the same seeming suddenness had budded and come to leaf and flower a perfect understanding which nevertheless remained undefined this i had no doubt was my fault and due to the incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire although we did not altogether abandon our secret trysts we began to meet in more natural ways there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed together through the woods and fields pausing to tear off one by one the petals of a daisy she loves me she loves me not i never ventured to kiss her i always thought afterwards i might have done so she had seemed so willing her eyes had shone so expectantly as i sat beside her on the grass nor can i tell why i desired to kiss her save that this was the traditional thing to do to the lady one loved to be sure the very touch of her hand was galvanic paradoxically i saw the human side of her the yielding gentleness that always amazed me yet i never overcame my awe of the divine she was a being sacrosanct whether this idealism were innate or the result of such romances as i had read i cannot say i got indeed an avowal of a sort the weekly dancing classes having begun again on one occasion when she had waltzed twice with gene hollister i protested  dont be silly hugh she whispered of course i like you better than anyone elseyou ought to know that  we never got to the word love but we knew the feeling  one cloud alone flung its shadow across these idyllic days before i was fully aware of it i had drawn very near to the first great junctionpoint of my life my graduation from densmore academy we were to change cars in the language of principal haime well enough for the fortunate ones who were to continue the academic journey which implied a postponement of the serious business of life but month after month of the last term had passed without a hint from my father that i was to change cars again and again i almost succeeded in screwing up my courage to the point of mentioning college to himnever quite his manner though kind and calm somehow strengthened my suspicion that i had been judged and found wanting and doomed to business galley slavery i deemed it humdrum prosaic degrading when i thought of it at night i experienced almost a frenzy of selfpity my father couldnt intend to do that just because my monthly reports hadnt always been what he thought they ought to be gene hollisters were no better if as good and he was going to princeton was i hugh paret to be denied the distinction of being a college man the delights of university existence cruelly separated and set apart from my friends whom i loved held up to the world and especially to nancy willett as good for nothing else the thought was unbearable characteristically i hoped against hope  i have mentioned garden parties one of our annual institutions was mrs willetts childrens party in may for the willett house had a garden that covered almost a quarter of a block mrs willett loved children the greatest regret of her life being that providence had denied her a large family as far back as my memory goes she had been something of an invalid she had a sweet sad face and delicate hands so thin as to seem almost transparent and she always sat in a chair under the great tree on the lawn smiling at us as we soared to dizzy heights in the swing or played croquet or scurried through the paths and in and out of the latticed summerhouse with shrieks of laughter and terror it all ended with a feast at a long table made of sawhorses and boards covered with a white cloth and when the cake was cut there was wild excitement as to who would get the ring and who the thimble  we were more decorous or rather more awkward now and the party began with a formal period when the boys gathered in a group and pretended indifference to the girls the girls were cleverer at it and actually achieved the impression that they were indifferent we kept an eye on them uneasily while we talked to be in nancys presence and not alone with nancy was agonizing and i wondered at a sangfroid beyond my power to achieve accused her of coldness my sufferings being the greater because she seemed more beautiful daintier more irreproachable than i had ever seen her even at that early age she gave evidence of the social gift and it was due to her efforts that we forgot our best clothes and our newly born selfconsciousness when i begged her to slip away with me among the currant bushes she whisperedi cant hugh im the hostess you know  i had gone there in a flutter of anticipation but nothing went right that day there was dancing in the big rooms that looked out on the garden the only girl with whom i cared to dance was nancy and she was busy finding partners for the backward members of both sexes though she was my partner to be sure when it all wound up with a virginia reel on the lawn then at supper to cap the climax of untoward incidents an animated discussion was begun as to the relative merits of the various colleges the girls too taking sides mac willett nancys cousin was going to yale gene hollister to princeton the ewan boys to our state university while perry blackwood and ralph hambleton and ham durrett were destined for harvard tom peters also though he was not to graduate from the academy for another year i might have known that ralph would have suspected my misery he sat triumphantly next to nancy herself while i had been told off to entertain the faithful sophy noticing my silence he demanded wickedlywhere are you going hugh  harvard i think i answered with as bold a front as i could muster i havent talked it over with my father yet it was intolerable to admit that i of them all was to be left behind  nancy looked at me in surprise she was always downright  oh hugh doesnt your father mean to put you in business she exclaimed  a hot flush spread over my face even to her i had not betrayed my apprehensions on this painful subject perhaps it was because of this very reason knowing me as she did that she had divined my fate could my father have spoken of it to anyone  not that i know of i said angrily i wondered if she knew how deeply she had hurt me the others laughed the colour rose in nancys cheeks and she gave me an appealing almost tearful look but my heart had hardened as soon as supper was over i left the table to wander nursing my wrongs in a far corner of the garden gay shouts and laughter still echoing in my ears i was negligible even my pathetic subterfuge had been detected and cruelly ridiculed by these friends whom i had always loved and sought out and who now were so absorbed in their own prospects and happiness that they cared nothing for mine and nancy i had been betrayed by nancy twilight was coming on i remember glancing down miserably at the new blue suit i had put on so hopefully for the first time that afternoon  separating the garden from the street was a high smooth board fence with a little gate in it and i had my hand on the latch when i heard the sound of hurrying steps on the gravel path and a familiar voice calling my name  hugh hugh  i turned nancy stood before me  hugh youre not going  yes i am  why  if you dont know theres no use telling you  just because i said your father intended to put you in business oh hugh why are you so foolish and so proud do you suppose that anyonethat ithink any the worse of you  yes she had read me she alone had entered into the source of that prevarication the complex feelings from which it sprang but at that moment i could not forgive her for humiliating me i hugged my grievance  it was true what i said i declared hotly my father has not spoken it is true that im going to college because ill make it true i may not go this year  she stood staring in sheer surprise at sight of my sudden quivering passion i think the very intensity of it frightened her and then without more ado i opened the gate and was gone  that night though i did not realize it my journey into a far country was begun  the misery that followed this incident had one compensating factor although too late to electrify densmore and principal haime with my scholarship i was determined to go to college now somehow sometime i would show my father these companions of mine and above all nancy herself the stuff of which i was made compel them sooner or later to admit that they had misjudged me i had been possessed by similar resolutions before though none so strong and they had a way of sinking below the surface of my consciousness only to rise again and again until by sheer pressure they achieved realization  yet i might have returned to nancy if something had not occurred which i would have thought unbelievable she began to show a marked preference for ralph hambleton at first i regarded this affair as the most obvious of retaliations she likewise had pride gradually however a feeling of uneasiness crept over me as pretence her performance was altogether too realistic she threw her whole soul into it danced with ralph as often as she had ever danced with me took walks with him deferred to his opinions until in spite of myself i became convinced that the preference was genuine i was a curious mixture of selfconfidence and selfdepreciation and never had his superiority seemed more patent than now his air of satisfaction was maddening  how well i remember his triumph on that hot june morning of our graduation from densmore a triumph he had apparently achieved without labour and which he seemed to despise a fitful breeze blew through the chapel at the top of the building we the graduates sat in two rows next to the platform and behind us the wooden benches nicked by many kniveswere filled with sisters and mothers and fathers some anxious some proud and some sad so brief a span like that summers day and youth was gone would the time come when we too should sit by the waters of babylon and sigh for it the world was upside down  we read the one hundred and third psalm then principal haime in his long prince albert and a ridiculously inadequate collar that emphasized his scrawny neck reminded us of the sacred associations we had formed of the peculiar responsibilities that rested on us who were the privileged of the city we had crossed today he said an invisible threshold some were to go on to higher institutions of learning others i gulped quoting the scriptures he complimented those who had made the most of their opportunities and it was then that he called out impressively the name of ralph forrester hambleton summa cum laude suddenly i was seized with passionate vehement regrets at the sound of the applause i might have been the prize scholar instead of ralph if i had only worked if i had only realized what this focussing day of graduation meant i might have been a marked individual with people murmuring words of admiration of speculation concerning the brilliancy of my future when at last my name was called and i rose to receive my diploma it seemed as though my incompetency had been proclaimed to the world  that evening i stood in the narrow gallery of the flagdecked gymnasium and watched nancy dancing with ralph  i let her go without protest or reproach a mysterious lesion seemed to have taken place i felt astonished and relieved yet i was heavy with sadness my emancipation had been bought at a price something hitherto spontaneous warm and living was withering within me     v  it was true to my fathers character that he should have waited until the day after graduation to discuss my future if discussion be the proper word the next evening at supper he informed me that he wished to talk to me in the sittingroom whither i followed him with a sinking heart he seated himself at his desk and sat for a moment gazing at me with a curious and benumbing expression and then the blow fell  hugh i have spoken to your cousin robert breck about you and he has kindly consented to give you a trial  to give me a trial sir i exclaimed  to employ you at a small but reasonable salary  i could find no words to express my dismay my dreams had come to this that i was to be made a clerk in a grocery store the fact that it was a wholesale grocery store was little consolation  but father i faltered i dont want to go into business  ah the sharpness of the exclamation might have betrayed to me the pain in which he was but he recovered himself instantly and i could see nothing but an inexorable justice closing in on me mechanically a blind justice in its inability to read my soul the time to have decided that he declared was some years ago my son i have given you the best schooling a boy can have and you have not shown the least appreciation of your advantages i do not enjoy saying this hugh but in spite of all my efforts and of those of your mother you have remained undeveloped and irresponsible my hope as you know was to have made you a professional man a lawyer and to take you into my office my father and grandfather were professional men before me but you are wholly lacking in ambition  and i had burned with it all my life  i have ambition i cried the tears forcing themselves to my eyes  ambitionfor what my son  i hesitated how could i tell him that my longings to do something to be somebody in the world were never more keen than at that moment matthew arnold had not then written his definition of god as the stream of tendency by which we fulfil the laws of our being and my father at any rate would not have acquiesced in the definition dimly but passionately i felt then as i had always felt that i had a mission to perform a service to do which ultimately would be revealed to me but the hopelessness of explaining this took on now the proportions of a tragedy and i could only gaze at him  what kind of ambition hugh he repeated sadly  ii have sometimes thought i could write sir if i had a chance i like it better than anything else ii have tried it and if i could only go to college  literature there was in his voice a scandalized note  why not father i asked weakly  and now it was he who for the first time seemed to be at a loss to express himself he turned in his chair and with a sweep of the hand indicated the long rows of mustybacked volumes here he said you have had at your disposal as wellassorted a small library as the city contains and you have not availed yourself of it yet you talk to me of literature as a profession i am afraid hugh that this is merely another indication of your desire to shun hard work and i must tell you frankly that i fail to see in you the least qualification for such a career you have not even inherited my taste for books i venture to say for instance that you have never even read a paragraph of plutarch and yet when i was your age i was completely familiar with the lives you will not read scott or dickens  the impeachment was not to be denied for the classics were hateful to me naturally i was afraid to make such a damning admission my father had succeeded in presenting my ambition as the height of absurdity and presumption and with something of the despair of a shipwrecked mariner my eyes rested on the green expanses of those bookbacks bohns standard library nor did it occur to him or to me that one might be great in literature without having read so much as a gritty page of them  he finished his argument by reminding me that worthless persons sought to enter the arts in the search for a fools paradise and in order to satisfy a reprehensible craving for notoriety the implication was clear that imaginative production could not be classed as hard work and he assured me that literature was a profession in which no one could afford to be second class a longfellow a harriet beecher stowe or nothing this was a practical age and a practical country we had indeed produced irvings and hawthornes but the future of american letters was to say the least problematical we were a utilitarian people who would never create a great literature and he reminded me that the days of the romantic and the picturesque had passed he gathered that i desired to be a novelist well novelists with certain exceptions were fantastic fellows who blew iridescent soapbubbles and who had no morals in the face of such a philosophy as his i was mute the world appeared a dreary place of musty offices and smoky steelworks of coal dust of labour without a spark of inspiration and that other the world of my dreams simply did not exist  incidentally my father had condemned cousin roberts wholesale grocery business as a refuge of the lesser of intellect that could not achieve the professionsan inference not calculated to stir my ambition and liking for it at the start  i began my business career on the following monday morning at breakfast held earlier than usual on my account my mothers sympathy was the more eloquent for being unspoken while my father wore an air of unwonted cheerfulness charging me when i departed to give his kindest remembrances to my cousin robert breck with a sense of martyrdom somehow deepened by this attitude of my parents i boarded a horsecar and went down town early though it was the narrow streets of the wholesale district reverberated with the rattle of trucks and echoed with the shouts of drivers the day promised to be scorching at the door of the warehouse of breck and company i was greeted by the ineffable smell of groceries in which the suggestion of parched coffee prevailed this is the sharpest remembrance of all and even today that odour affects me somewhat in the manner that the interior of a ship affects a person prone to seasickness my cousin robert in his wellworn alpaca coat was already seated at his desk behind the clouded glass partition next the alley at the back of the store and as i entered he gazed at me over his steelrimmed spectacles with that same disturbing look of clairvoyance i have already mentioned as one of his characteristics the grey eyes were quizzical and yet seemed to express a little commiseration  well hugh youve decided to honour us have you he asked  im much obliged for giving me the place cousin robert i replied  but he had no use for that sort of politeness and he saw through me as always  so youre not too tony for the grocery business eh  oh no sir  it was good enough for old benjamin breck he said well ill give you a fair trial my boy and no favouritism on account of relationship any more than to willie  his strong voice resounded through the store and presently my cousin willie appeared in answer to his summons the same willie who used to lead me on mischief bent through the barns and woods and fields of claremore he was barefoot no longer though freckled still grown lanky and tall he wore a coarse blue apron that fell below his knees and a pencil was stuck behind his ear  get an apron for hugh said his father  willies grin grew wider  ill fit him out he said  start him in the shipping department directed cousin robert and turned to his letters  i was forthwith provided with an apron and introduced to the slim and anaemic but cheerful johnny hedges the shipping clerk hard at work in the alley secretly i looked down on my fellowclerks as one destined for a higher mission made out of better stufffiner stuff despite my attempt to hide this sense of superiority they were swift to discover it and perhaps it is to my credit as well as theirs that they did not resent it curiously enough they seemed to acknowledge it before the week was out i had earned the nickname of beau brummel  say beau johnny hedges would ask when i appeared of a morning what happened in the great world last night  i had an affection for them these fellowclerks and i often wondered at their contentment with the drab lives they led at their selfcongratulation for having a job at breck and companys  you dont mean to say you like this kind of work i exclaimed one day to johnny hedges as we sat on barrels of xxxx flour looking out at the hot sunlight in the alley  it aint a question of liking it beau he rebuked me its all very well for you to talk since your fathers a millionaire a fiction so firmly embedded in their heads that no amount of denial affected it but what do you think would happen to me if i was fired i couldnt go home and take it easyyou bet not i just want to shake hands with myself when i think that ive got a home and a job like this i know a fellera hard worker he was too who walked the pavements for three months when the colvers failed and couldnt get nothing and took to drink and the last i heard of him he was sleeping in police stations and walking the ties and his wifes a waitress at a cheap hotel dont you think its easy to get a job  i was momentarily sobered by the earnestness with which he brought home to me the relentlessness of our civilization it seemed incredible i should have learned a lesson in that store barring a few discordant days when the orders came in too fast or when we were short handed because of sickness it was a veritable hive of happiness morning after morning clerks and porters arrived pale yet smiling and laboured with cheerfulness from eight oclock until six and departed as cheerfully for modest homes in obscure neighbourhoods that seemed to me areas of exile they were troubled with no visions of better things when the travelling men came in from the road there was great hilarity important personages these looked up to by the city clerks jolly reckless elizabethanlike rovers who had tasted of the wine of libertyand of other wines with the ineradicable lust for the road in their blood no more routine for jimmy bowles who was king of them all i shudder to think how much of my knowledge of life i owe to this jimmy whose stories would have filled a quarto volume but could on no account have been published for a selfrespecting postoffice would not have allowed them to pass through the mails as it was jimmy gave them circulation enough i can still see his round face with the nose just indicated his wicked twinkling little eyes and i can hear his husky voice fall to a whisper when the boss passed through the store jimmy when visiting us always had a group around him his audacity with women amazed me for he never passed one of the lady clerks without some form of caress which they resented but invariably laughed at one day he imparted to me his code of morality he never made love to another mans wife so he assured me if he knew the man the secret of life he had discovered in laughter and by laughter he sold quantities of cousin roberts groceries  mr bowles boasted of a catholic acquaintance in all the cities of his district but before venturing forth to conquer these he had learned his own city by heart my cousin robert was not aware of the fact that mr bowles showed the town to certain customers he even desired to show it to me but an epicurean strain in my nature held me back johnny hedges went with him occasionally and henry schneider the bill clerk and i listened eagerly to their experiences afterwards confiding them to tom  there were times when driven by an overwhelming curiosity i ventured into certain strange streets alone shivering with cold and excitement gripped by a fascination i did not comprehend my eyes now averted now irresistibly raised toward the white streaks of light that outlined the windows of dark houses  one winter evening as i was going home i encountered at the mailbox a young woman who shot at me a queer twisted smile i stood still as though stunned looking after her and when halfway across the slushy street she turned and smiled again prodigiously excited i followed her fearful that i might be seen by someone who knew me nor was it until she reached an unfamiliar street that i ventured to overtake her she confounded me by facing me  get out she cried fiercely  i halted in my tracks overwhelmed with shame but she continued to regard me by the light of the street lamp  you didnt want to be seen with me on second street did you youre one of those sneaking swells  the shock of this sudden onslaught was tremendous i stood frozen to the spot trembling convicted for i knew that her accusation was just i had wounded her and i had a desire to make amends  im sorry i faltered i didnt meanto offend you and you smiled i got no farther she began to laugh and so loudly that i glanced anxiously about i would have fled but something still held me something that belied the harshness of her laugh  youre just a kid she told me say you get along home and tell your mamma i sent you  whereupon i departed in a state of humiliation and selfreproach i had never before known wandering about aimlessly for a long time when at length i arrived at home late for supper my mothers solicitude only served to deepen my pain she went to the kitchen herself to see if my mincepie were hot and served me with her own hands my father remained at his place at the head of the table while i tried to eat smiling indulgently at her ministrations  oh a little hard work wont hurt him sarah he said when i was his age i often worked until eleven oclock and never felt the worse for it business must be pretty good eh hugh  i had never seen him in a more relaxing mood a more approving one my mother sat down beside me words seem useless to express the complicated nature of my suffering at that momentmy remorse my sense of deception of hypocrisyyes and my terror i tried to talk naturally to answer my fathers questions about affairs at the store while all the time my eyes rested upon the objects of the room familiar since childhood here were warmth love and safety why could i not be content with them thankful for them what was it in me that drove me from these sheltering walls out into the dark places i glanced at my father had he ever known these wild destroying desires oh if i only could have confided in him the very idea of it was preposterous such placidity as theirs would never understand the nature of my temptations and i pictured to myself their horror and despair at my revelation in imagination i beheld their figures receding while i drifted out to sea alone would the tidewhich was somehow within mecarry me out and out in spite of all i could do       give me that man      that is not passions slave and i will wear him      in my hearts core  i did not shirk my tasks at the store although i never got over the feeling that a fine instrument was being employed where a coarser one would have done equally well there were moments when i was almost overcome by surges of selfcommiseration and of impotent anger for instance i was once driven out of a shop by an incensed german grocer whom i had asked to settle a longstanding account yet the days passed the daily grind absorbed my energies and when i was not collecting or tediously going over the stock in the dim recesses of the store i was running errands in the wholesale district treading the burning brick of the pavements dodging heavy trucks and drays and perspiring clerks who flew about with memorandum pads in their hands or awaiting the pleasure of bank tellers save harvey the venerable porter i was the last to leave the store in the evening and i always came away with the taste on my palate of breck and companys mail it being my final duty to lick the whole of it and deposit it in the box at the corner the gum on the envelopes tasted of wintergreen  my cousin robert was somewhat astonished at my application  well make a man of you yet hugh he said to me once when i had performed a commission with unexpected despatch  business was his allinall and he had an undisguised contempt for higher education to send a boy to college was in his opinion to run no inconsiderable risk of ruining him what did they amount to when they came home strutting like peacocks full of fads and fancies and much too good to associate with decent hardworking citizens nevertheless when autumn came and my friends departed with eclat for the east i was desperate indeed even the contemplation of robert breck did not console me and yet here in truth was a life which might have served me as a model his store was his castle and his reputation for integrity and square dealing as wide as the city often i used to watch him with a certain envy as he stood in the doorway his hands in his pockets and greeted fellowmerchant and banker with his genuine and dignified directness this man was his own master they all called him robert and they made it clear by their manner that they knew they were addressing one who fulfilled his obligations and asked no favours  crusty old nathaniel durrett once declared that when you bought a bill of goods from robert breck you did not have to check up the invoice or employ a chemist here was a character to mould upon if my ambition could but have been bounded by breck and company i too might have come to stand in that doorway content with a tribute that was greater than caesars  i had been dreading the christmas holidays which were indeed to be no holidays for me and when at length they arrived they brought with them from the east certain heroes fashionably clad citizens now of a larger world than mine these former companions had become superior beings they could not help showing it and their presence destroyed the balance of things for alas i had not wholly abjured the feminine sex after all and from being a somewhat important factor in the lives of ruth hollister and other young women i suddenly became of no account new interests new rivalries and loyalties had arisen in which i had no share i must perforce busy myself with invoices of flour and coffee and canned fruits while sleigh rides and coasting and skating expeditions to blackstone lake followed one another day after dayfor the irony of circumstances had decreed a winter uncommonly cold there were evening parties too where i felt like an alien though my friends were guilty of no conscious neglect and had i been able to accept the situation simply i should not have suffered  the principal event of those holidays was a play given in the old hambleton house which later became the boyne club under the direction of the lively and talented mrs watling i was invited indeed to participate but even if i had had the desire i could not have done so since the rehearsals were carried on in the daytime nancy was the leading lady i have neglected to mention that she too had been away almost continuously since our misunderstanding for the summer in the mountainsa sojourn recommended for her mothers health and in the autumn she had somewhat abruptly decided to go east to boardingschool at farmington during the brief months of her absence she had marvellously acquired maturity and aplomb a worldliness of manner and a certain frivolity that seemed to put those who surrounded her on a lower plane she was only seventeen yet she seemed the woman of thirty whose role she played first there were murmurs then sustained applause i scarcely recognized her she had taken wings and soared far above me suggesting a sphere of power and luxury hitherto unimagined and beyond the scope of the world to which i belonged  her triumph was genuine when the play was over she was immediately surrounded by enthusiastic admirers eager to congratulate her to dance with her i too would have gone forward but a sense of inadequacy of unimportance of an inability to cope with her held me back and from a corner i watched her sweeping around the room holding up her train and leaning on the arm of bob lansing a classmate whom ralph had brought home from harvard then it was ralphs turn that affair seemed still to be going on my feelings were a strange medley of despondency and stimulation  our eyes met her partner now was ham durrett capriciously releasing him she stood before me  hugh you havent asked me to dance or even told me what you thought of the play  i thought it was splendid i said lamely  because she refrained from replying i was farther than ever from understanding her how was i to divine what she felt or whether any longer she felt at all here in this costume of a woman of the world with the string of pearls at her neck to give her the final touch of brilliancy was a strange new creature who baffled and silenced me we had not gone halfway across the room when she halted abruptly  im tired she exclaimed i dont feel like dancing just now and led the way to the big rose punchbowl one of the durretts most cherished possessions glancing up at me over the glass of lemonade i had given her she went on why havent you been to see me since i came home ive wanted to talk to you to hear how you are getting along  was she trying to make amends or reminding me in this subtle way of the cause of our quarrel what i was aware of as i looked at her was an attitude a vantage point apparently gained by contact with that mysterious outer world which thus vicariously had laid its spell on me i was tremendously struck by the thought that to achieve this attitude meant emancipation invulnerability against the aches and pains which otherwise our fellowbeings had the power to give us mastery over lifethe ability to choose calmly as from a height what were best for ones self untroubled by loves and hates untroubled by loves and hates at that very moment paradoxically i loved her madly but with a love not of the old quality a love that demanded a vantage point of its own even though she had made an advanceand some elusiveness in her manner led me to doubt it i could not go to her now i must go as a conquerora conqueror in the lists she herself had chosen where the prize is power  oh im getting along pretty well i said at any rate they dont complain of me  somehow she ventured somehow its hard to think of you as a business man  i took this for a reference to the boast i had made that i would go to college  business isnt so bad as it might be i assured her  i think a man ought to go away to college she declared in what seemed another tone he makes friends learns certain thingsit gives him finish we are very provincial here  provincial i did not stop to reflect how recently she must have acquired the word it summed up precisely the selfestimate at which i had arrived the sting went deep before i could think of an effective reply nancy was being carried off by the young man from the east who was clearly infatuated he was not provincial she smiled back at me brightly over his shoulder in that instant were fused in one resolution all the discordant elements within me of aspiration and discontent it was not so much that i would show nancy what i intended to doi would show myself and i felt a sudden elation and accession of power that enabled me momentarily to despise the puppets with whom she danced from this mood i was awakened with a start to feel a hand on my shoulder and i turned to confront her father mcalery willett a gregarious easygoing pleasureloving gentleman who made only a pretence of business having inherited an ample fortune from his father unique among his generation in our city in that he paid some attention to fashion in his dress good living was already beginning to affect his figure his mellow voice had a way of breaking an octave  dont worry my boy he said you stick to business these college fellows are cocks of the walk just now but some day youll be able to snap your fingers at all of em  the next day was dark overcast smoky dampthe soft unwholesome dampness that follows a spell of hard frost i spent the morning and afternoon on the gloomy third floor of breck and company making a list of the stock i remember the place as though i had just stepped out of it the freight elevator at the back the dusty iron columns the continuous piles of cases and bags and barrels with narrow aisles between them the dirty windows spotted and sootstreaked that looked down on second street i was determined now to escape from all this and i had my plan in mind  no sooner had i swallowed my supper that evening than i set out at a swift pace for a modest residence district ten blocks away coming to a little frame house set back in a yardone of those houses in which the ringing of the front doorbell produces the greatest commotion childrens voices were excitedly raised and then hushed after a brief silence the door was opened by a pleasantfaced brownbearded man who stood staring at me in surprise his hair was rumpled he wore an old house coat with a hole in the elbow and with one finger he kept his place in the book which he held in his hand  hugh paret he exclaimed  he ushered me into a little parlour lighted by two lamps that bore every evidence of having been recently vacated its features somehow bespoke a struggle for existence as though its occupants had worried much and loved much it was a room best described by the word homehome made more precious by a certain precariousness toys and schoolbooks strewed the floor a sewingbag and apron lay across the sofa and in one corner was a rolltopped desk of varnished oak the seats of the chairs were comfortably depressed  so this was where mr wood lived mr wood instructor in latin and greek at densmore academy it was now borne in on me for the first time that he did live and have his ties like any other human being instead of just appearing magically from nowhere on a platform in a chalky room at nine every morning to vanish again in the afternoon i had formerly stood in awe of his presence but now i was suddenly possessed by an embarrassment and shall i say it by a commiseration bordering on contempt for a man who would consent to live thus for the sake of being a schoolteacher how strange that civilization should set such a high value on education and treat its functionaries with such neglect  mr woods surprise at seeing me was genuine for i had never shown a particular interest in him nor in the knowledge which he strove to impart  i thought you had forgotten me hugh he said and added whimsically most boys do when they graduate  i felt the reproach which made it the more difficult for me to state my errand  i knew you sometimes took pupils in the evening mr wood  pupilsyes he replied still eyeing me suddenly his eyes twinkled he had indeed no reason to suspect me of thirsting for learning but i was under the impression that you had gone into business hugh  the fact is sir i explained somewhat painfully that i am not satisfied with business i feelas if i ought to know more and i came to see if you would give me lessons about three nights a week because i want to take the harvard examinations next summer  thus i made it appear and so persuaded myself that my ambition had been prompted by a craving for knowledge as soon as he could recover himself he reminded me that he had on many occasions declared i had a brain  your father must be very happy over this decision of yours he said  that was the point i told him it was to be a surprise for my father i was to take the examinations first and inform him afterwards  to my intense relief mr wood found the scheme wholly laudable and entered into it with zest he produced examinations of preceding years from a pigeonhole in his desk and inside of half an hour the arrangement was made the price of the lessons settled they were well within my salary which recently had been raised  when i went down town or collecting bills for breck and company i took a textbook along with me in the streetcars now at last i had behind my studies a driving force algebra latin greek and history became worth while means to an end i astonished mr wood and sometimes he would tilt back his chair take off his spectacles and pull his beard  why in the name of all the sages he would demand couldnt you have done this well at school you might have led your class instead of ralph hambleton  i grew very fond of mr wood and even of his thin little wife who occasionally flitted into the room after we had finished i fully intended to keep up with them in after life but i never did i forgot them completely  my parents were not wholly easy in their minds concerning me they were bewildered by the new aspect i presented for my lately acquired motive was strong enough to compel me to restrict myself socially and the evenings i spent at home were given to study usually in my own room once i was caught with a latin grammar i was just looking over it i said my mother sighed i knew what was in her mind she had always been secretly disappointed that i had not been sent to college and presently when my father went out to attend a trustees meeting the impulse to confide in her almost overcame me i loved her with that affection which goes out to those whom we feel understand us but i was learning to restrain my feelings she looked at me wistfully i knew that she would insist on telling my father and thus possibly frustrate my plans that i was not discovered was due to a certain quixotic twist in my fathers character i was working now and though not actually earning my own living he no longer felt justified in prying into my affairs  when june arrived however my tutor began to show signs that his conscience was troubling him and one night he delivered his ultimatum the joke had gone far enough he implied my intentions indeed he found praiseworthy but in his opinion it was high time that my father were informed of them he was determined to call at my fathers office  the next morning was blue with the presage of showers blue too with the presage of fate an interminable morning my tasks had become utterly distasteful and in the afternoon so when i sat down to make out invoices i wrote automatically the names of the familiar customers my mind now exalted by hope now depressed by anxiety the result of an interview perhaps even now going on would determine whether or no i should be immediately released from a slavery i detested would mr wood persuade my father if not i was prepared to take more desperate measures remain in the grocery business i would not in the evening as i hurried homeward from the corner where the boyne street car had dropped me i halted suddenly in front of the peters house absorbing the scene where my childhood had been spent each of these spreading maples was an old friend and in these yards i had played and dreamed an unaccountable sadness passed over me as i walked on toward our gate i entered it gained the doorway of the house and went upstairs glancing into the sitting room my mother sat by the window sewing she looked up at me with an ineffable expression in which i read a trace of tears  hugh she exclaimed  i felt very uncomfortable and stood looking down at her  why didnt you tell us my son in her voice was in truth reproach yet mingled with that was another note which i think was pride  what has father said i asked  oh my dear he will tell you himself ii dont knowhe will talk to you  suddenly she seized my hands and drew me down to her and then held me away gazing into my face with a passionate questioning her lips smiling her eyes wet what did she see was there a subtler relationship between our natures than i guessed did she understand by some instinctive power the riddle within me divine through love the force that was driving me on she knew not whither nor i at the sound of my fathers step in the hall she released me he came in as though nothing had happened  well hugh are you home he said  never had i been more impressed more bewildered by his selfcommand than at that time save for the fact that my mother talked less than usual supper passed as though nothing had happened whether i had shaken him disappointed him or gained his reluctant approval i could not tell gradually his outward calmness turned my suspense to irritation  but when at length we were alone together i gained a certain reassurance his manner was not severe he hesitated a little before beginning  i must confess hugh that i scarcely know what to say about this proceeding of yours the thing that strikes me most forcibly is that you might have confided in your mother and myself  hope flashed up within me like an explosion  ii wanted to surprise you father and then you see i thought it would be wiser to find out first how well i was likely to do at the examinations  my father looked at me unfortunately he possessed neither a sense of humour nor a sense of tragedy sufficient to meet such a situation for the first time in my life i beheld him at a disadvantage for i had somehow managed at length to force him out of position and he was puzzled i was quick to play my trump card  i have been thinking it over carefully i told him and i have made up my mind that i want to go into the law  the law he exclaimed sharply  why yes sir i know that you were disappointed because i did not do sufficiently well at school to go to college and study for the bar  i felt indeed a momentary pang but i remembered that i was fighting for my freedom  you seemed satisfied where you were he said in a puzzled voice and your cousin robert gives a good account of you  ive tried to do the work as well as i could sir i replied but i dont like the grocery business or any other business i have a feeling that im not made for it  and you think now that you are made for the law he asked with the faint hint of a smile  yes sir i believe i could succeed at it id like to try i replied modestly  youve given up the idiotic notion of wishing to be an author  i implied that he himself had convinced me of the futility of such a wish i listened to his next words as in a dream  i must confess to you hugh that there are times when i fail to understand you i hope it is as you say that you have arrived at a settled conviction as to your future and that this is not another of those caprices to which you have been subject nor a desire to shirk honest work mr wood has made out a strong case for you and i have therefore determined to give you a trial if you pass the examinations with credit you may go to college but if at any time you fail to make good progress you come home and go into business again is that thoroughly understood  i said it was and thanked him effusively i had escapedthe prison doors had flown open but it is written that every happiness has its sting and my joy intense though it was had in it a core of remorse  i went downstairs to my mother who was sitting in the hall by the open door  father says i may go i said  she got up and took me in her arms  my dear i am so glad although we shall miss you dreadfully hugh  yes mother  oh hugh i so want you to be a good man  her cry was a little incoherent but fraught with a meaning that came home to me in spite of myself  a while later i ran over to announce to the amazed tom peters that i was actually going to harvard with him he stood in the halflighted hallway his hands in his pockets blinking at me  hugh youre a wonder he cried how in jehoshaphat did you work it  i lay long awake that night thinking over the momentous change so soon to come into my life wondering exultantly what nancy willett would say now i was not one at any rate to be despised or neglected     vi  the following september tom peters and i went east together in the early morning boston broke on us like a mecca as we rolled out of the old albany station joint lords of a herdic how sharply the smell of the saltladen east wind and its penetrating coolness come back to me i seek in vain for words to express the exhilarating effect of that briny coolness on my imagination and of the visions it summoned up of the newer larger life into which i had marvellously been transported we alighted at the parker house fullfledged men of the world and tried to act as though the breakfast of which we partook were merely an incident not an event as though we were seniors and not freshmen assuming an indifference to the beings by whom we were surrounded and who were breakfasting tooalthough the nicelooking ones with fresh faces and trim clothes were all undoubtedly olympians the better to proclaim our nonchalance we seated ourselves on a lounge of the marblepaved lobby and smoked cigarettes this was liberty indeed at length we departed for cambridge in another herdic  boston could it be possible everything was so different here as to give the place the aspect of a dream the bulfinch state house the decorous shops the still more decorous dwellings with the purplepaned windows facing the common back bay still boarded up ivyspread suggestive of a mysterious and delectable existence we crossed the charles river bluegrey and still that morning traversed a nondescript district and at last found ourselves gazing out of the windows at the mellowed plumcoloured bricks of the university buildings all at once our exhilaration evaporated as the herdic rumbled into a side street and backed up before the door of a nottooinviting threestoried house with a queer extension on top its steps and vestibule were however immaculate the bell was answered by a plainly overworked servant girl of whom we inquired for mrs bolton our landlady there followed a period of waiting in a parlour from which the light had been almost wholly banished with slippery horsehair furniture and a marbletopped table and mrs bolton when she appeared dressed in rusty black harmonized perfectly with the funereal gloom she was a tall rawboned severe lady with a peculiar redmottled complexion that somehow reminded one of the outcropping rocks of her native new england soil  you want to see your rooms i suppose she remarked impassively when we had introduced ourselves and as we mounted the stairs behind her tom in a whisper nicknamed her granite face presently she left us  hospitable soul said tom who with his hands in his pockets was gazing at the bare walls of our sittingroom well have to go into the housefurnishing business hughie i vote we dont linger here todaywell get melancholia  outside however the sun was shining brightly and we departed immediately to explore cambridge and announce our important presences to the proper authorities we went into boston to dine it was not until nine oclock in the evening that we returned and the bottom suddenly dropped out of things he who has tasted that first acute homesickness of college will know what i mean it usually comes at the opening of ones trunk the sight of the top tray gave me a pang i shall never forget i would not have believed that i loved my mother so much these articles had been packed by her hands and in one corner among the underclothes on which she had neatly sewed my initials lay the new bible she had bought hugh moreton paret from his mother september 1881 i took it up tom was not looking and tried to read a passage but my eyes were blurred what was it within me that pressed and pressed until i thought i could bear the pain of it no longer i pictured the sittingroom at home and my father and mother there thinking of me yes i must acknowledge it in the bitterness of that moment i longed to be back once more in the railedoff space on the floor of breck and company writing invoices  presently as we went on silently with our unpacking we became aware of someone in the doorway  hello you fellows he cried were classmates i guess  we turned to behold an ungainly young man in an illfitting blue suit his face was pimply his eyes a teutonic blue his yellow hair rumpled his naturally large mouth was made larger by a friendly grin  im hermann krebs he announced simply who are you  we replied i regret to say with a distinct coolness that did not seem to bother him in the least he advanced into the room holding out a large red and serviceable hand evidently it had never dawned on him that there was such a thing in the world as snobbery but tom and i had been coached by ralph hambleton and perry blackwood warned to be careful of our friendships there was a reason in any case mr krebs would not have appealed to us in answer to a second question he was informed what city we hailed from and he proclaimed himself likewise a native of our state  why im from elkington he exclaimed as though the fact sealed our future relationships he seated himself on toms trunk and added welcome to old harvard  we felt that he was scarcely qualified to speak for old harvard but we did not say so  you look as if youd been pallbearers for somebody was his next observation  to this there seemed no possible reply  you fellows are pretty well fixed here he went on undismayed gazing about a room which had seemed to us the abomination of desolation your folks must be rich im up under the skylight  even this failed to touch us his fatherhe told us with undiminished candourhad been a german emigrant who had come over in 49 after the cause of liberty had been lost in the old country and made eyeglasses and opera glasses there hadnt been a fortune in it he hermann had worked at various occupations in the summer time from peddling to farming until he had saved enough to start him at harvard tom who had been bending over his bureau drawer straightened up  what did you want to come here for he demanded  say what did you mr krebs retorted genially to get an education of course  an education echoed tom  isnt harvard the oldest and best seat of learning in america there was an exaltation in krebss voice that arrested my attention and made me look at him again a troubled chord had been struck within me  sure said tom  what did you come for mr krebs persisted  to sow my wild oats said tom i expect to have something of a crop too  for some reason i could not fathom it suddenly seemed to dawn on mr krebs as a result of this statement that he wasnt wanted  well so long he said with a new dignity that curiously belied the informality of his farewell  an interval of silence followed his departure  well hes got a crust said tom at last  my own feeling about mr krebs had become more complicated but i took my cue from tom who dealt with situations simply  hell come in for a few knockouts he declared heres to old harvard the greatest institution of learning in america oh gee  our visitor at least made us temporarily forget our homesickness but it returned with redoubled intensity when we had put out the lights and gone to bed  before we had left home it had been mildly hinted to us by ralph and perry blackwood that scholarly eminence was not absolutely necessary to ones welfare and happiness at cambridge the hint had been somewhat superfluous but the question remained what was necessary with a view of getting some light on this delicate subject we paid a visit the next evening to our former friends and schoolmates whose advice was conveyed with a masterly circumlocution that impressed us both there are some things that may not be discussed directly and the conduct of life at a modern universitywhich is a reflection of life in the greater worldis one of these perry blackwood and ham did most of the talking while ralph characteristically lay at full length on the windowseat interrupting with an occasional terse and cynical remark very much to the point as a sophomore he in particular seemed lifted immeasurably above us for he wasas might have been expected already a marked man in his class the rooms which he shared with his cousin made a tremendous impression on tom and me and seemed palatial in comparison to our quarters at mrs boltons eloquent of the freedom and luxury of undergraduate existence their note perhaps was struck by the profusion of gay sofa pillows then something of an innovation the heavy expensive furniture was of a pattern new to me and on the mantel were three or four photographs of ladies in the alluring costume of the musical stage in which tom evinced a particular interest  did grandfather send em he inquired  theyre hams said ralph and he contrived somehow to get into those two words an epitome of his cousins character ham was stouter and his clothes were more striking more obviously expensive than ever on our way homeward after we had walked a block or two in silence tom exclaimeddont make friends with the friendlesseh hughie we knew enough to begin all right didnt we  have i made us out a pair of deliberate calculating snobs well after all it must be remembered that our bringing up had not been of sufficient liberality to include the krebses of this world we did not indeed spend much time in choosing and weighing those whom we should know and those whom we should avoid and before the first term of that freshman year was over tom had become a favourite he had the gift of making men feel that he delighted in their society that he wished for nothing better than to sit for hours in their company content to listen to the arguments that raged about him once in a while he would make a droll observation that was greeted with fits of laughter he was always referred to as old tom or good old tom presently when he began to pick out chords on the banjo it was discovered that he had a good tenor voice though he could not always be induced to sing somewhat to the jeopardy of the academic standard that my father expected me to sustain our rooms became a rendezvous for many clubable souls whose maudlin midnight attempts at harmony often set the cocks crowing         free from care and despair         what care we        tis wine tis wine         that makes the jollity  as a matter of truth on these occasions it was more often beer beer transported thither in toms new valisegiven him by his motherand stuffed with snow to keep the bottles cold sometimes granite face adorned in a skyblue wrapper would suddenly appear in the doorway to declare that we were a disgrace to her respectable house the university authorities should be informed etc etc poor woman we were outrageously inconsiderate of her one evening as we came through the hall we caught a glimpse in the dimly lighted parlour of a young man holding a shy and pale little girl on his lap annie mrs boltons daughter on the face of our landlady was an expression i had never seen there like a light i should scarcely have known her tom and i paused at the foot of the stairs he clutched my arm  darned if it wasnt our friend krebs he whispered  while i was by no means so popular as tom i got along fairly well i had escaped from provincialism from the obscure purgatory of the wholesale grocery business new vistas exciting and stimulating had been opened up nor did i offend the sensibilities and prejudices of the new friends i made but gave a hearty consent to a code i found congenial i recognized in the social system of undergraduate life at harvard a reflection of that of a greater world where i hoped some day to shine yet my ambition did not prey upon me mere conformity however would not have taken me very far in a sphere from which i in common with many others desired not to be excluded one day in an idle but inspired moment i paraphrased a song from pinafore applying it to a college embroglio and the brief and lively vogue it enjoyed was sufficient to indicate a future usefulness i had found myself this was in the last part of the freshman year and later on i became a sort of amateur class poetlaureate many were the skits i composed and tom sang them  during that freshman year we often encountered hermann krebs whistling merrily on the stairs  got your themes done he would inquire cheerfully  and tom would always mutter when he was out of earshot he has got a crust  when i thought about krebs at alland this was seldom indeedhis manifest happiness puzzled me our cool politeness did not seem to bother him in the least on the contrary i got the impression that it amused him he seemed to have made no friends and after that first evening memorable for its homesickness he never ventured to repeat his visit to us  one windy november day i spied his somewhat ludicrous figure striding ahead of me his trousers above his ankles i was bundled up in a new ulsterof which i was secretly quite proudbut he wore no overcoat at all  well how are you getting along i asked as i overtook him  he made clear as he turned his surprise that i should have addressed him at all but immediately recovered himself  oh fine he responded ive had better luck than i expected im correspondent for two or three newspapers i began by washing windows and doing odd jobs for the professors wives he laughed i guess that doesnt strike you as good luck  he showed no resentment at my patronage but a selfsufficiency that made my sympathy seem superfluous giving the impression of an inner harmony and content that surprised me  i neednt ask how youre getting along he said  at the end of the freshman year we abandoned mrs boltons for more desirable quarters  i shall not go deeply into my college career recalling only such incidents as seen in the retrospect appear to have had significance i have mentioned my knack for songwriting but it was not i think until my junior year there was startlingly renewed in me my youthful desire to write to create something worth while that had so long been dormant  the inspiration came from alonzo cheyne instructor in english a remarkable teacher in spite of the finicky mannerisms which tom imitated and when in reading aloud certain magnificent passages he forgot his affectations he managed to arouse cravings i thought to have deserted me forever was it possible after all that i had been right and my father wrong that i might yet be great in literature  a mere hint from alonzo cheyne was more highly prized by the grinds than fulsome praise from another teacher and to his credit it should be recorded that the grinds were the only ones he treated with any seriousness he took pains to answer their questions but towards the rest of us the chosen he showed a thinly veiled contempt none so quick as he to detect a simulated interest or a wily effort to make him ridiculous and few tried this a second time for he had a rapierlike gift of repartee that transfixed the offender like a moth on a pin he had a way of eyeing me at times his glasses in his hand a queer smile on his lips as much as to imply that there was one at least among the lost who was made for better things not that my work was poor but i knew that it might have been better out of his classes however beyond the immediate disturbing influence of his personality i would relapse into indifference  returning one evening to our quarters which were now in the yard i found tom seated with a blank sheet before him thrusting his hand through his hair and biting the end of his penholder to a pulp in his muttering which was mixed with the curious stingless profanity of which he was master i caught the name of cheyne and i knew that he was facing the crisis of a fortnightly theme the subject assigned was a narrative of some personal experience and it was to be handed in on the morrow my own theme was already written  ive been holding down this chair for an hour and i cant seem to think of a thing he rose to fling himself down on the lounge i wish i was in canada  why canada  trout fishing with uncle jake at that club of his where he took me last summer tom gazed dreamily at the ceiling whenever i have some darned foolish theme like this to write i want to go fishing and i want to go like the devil ill get uncle jake to take you too next summer  i wish you would  say thats living all right hughie up there among the tamaracks and balsams and he began for something like the thirtieth time to relate the adventures of the trip  as he talked the idea presented itself to me with sudden fascination to use this incident as the subject of toms theme to write it for him from his point of view imitating the droll style he would have had if he had been able to write for when he was interested in any matter his oral narrative did not lack vividness i began to ask him questions what were the trees like for instance how did the frenchcanadian guides talk he had the gift of mimicry aided by a partial knowledge of french i wrote down a few sentences as they sounded the canoe had upset and he had come near drowning i made him describe his sensations  ill write your theme for you i exclaimed when he had finished  gee not about that  why not its a personal experience  his gratitude was pathetic by this time i was so full of the subject that it fairly clamoured for expression and as i wrote the hours flew once in a while i paused to ask him a question as he sat with his chair tilted back and his feet on the table reading a detective story i sketched in the scene with bold strokes the desolate bois brule on the mountain side the polished crystal surface of the pool broken here and there with the circles left by rising fish i pictured armand the guide his pipe between his teeth holding the canoe against the current and i seemed to smell the sharp tang of the balsams to hear the roar of the rapids below then came the sudden hooking of the big trout habitant oaths from armand bouleversement wetness darkness confusion a halfstrangled feeling a brief glimpse of green things and sunlight and then strangulation or what seemed like it strangulation the sense of being picked up and hurled by a terrific force whither a blinding whiteness in which it was impossible to breathe one sharp almost unbearable pain then another then oblivion finally awakening to be confronted by a much worried uncle jake  by this time the detective story had fallen to the floor and tom was huddled up in his chair asleep he arose obediently and wrapped a wet towel around his head and began to write once he paused long enough to mutteryes thats about itthats the way i felt and set to work again mechanicallyall the praise i got for what i deemed a literary achievement of the highest order at three oclock am he finished pulled off his clothes automatically and tumbled into bed i had no desire for sleep my brain was racing madly like an engine without a governor i could write i could write i repeated the words over and over to myself all the complexities of my present life were blotted out and i beheld only the long sweet vista of the career for which i was now convinced that nature had intended me my immediate fortunes became unimportant immaterial no juice of the grape i had ever tasted made me half so drunk with the morning of course came the reaction and i suffered the after sensations of an orgie awaking to a world of necessity cold and grey and slushy and necessity alone made me rise from my bed my experience of the night before might have taught me that happiness lies in the trick of transforming necessity but it did not the vision had fadedtemporarily at least and such was the distraction of the succeeding days that the subject of the theme passed from my mind  one morning tom was later than usual in getting home i was writing a letter when he came in and did not notice him yet i was vaguely aware of his standing over me when at last i looked up i gathered from his expression that something serious had happened so mournful was his face and yet so utterly ludicrous  say hugh im in the deuce of a mess he announced  whats the matter i inquired  he sank down on the table with a groan  its alonzo he said  then i remembered the theme  whatwhats he done i demanded  he says i must become a writer think of it me a writer he says im a young shakespeare that ive been lazy and hid my light under a bushel he says he knows now what i can do and if i dont keep up the quality hell know the reason why and write a personal letter to my father oh hell  in spite of his evident anguish i was seized with a convulsive laughter tom stood staring at me moodily  you think its funnydont you i guess it is but whats going to become of me thats what i want to know ive been in trouble before but never in any like this and who got me into it you  here was gratitude  youve got to go on writing em now his voice became desperately pleading say hugh old man you can temper em downtemper em down gradually and by the end of the year lets say theyll be about normal again  he seemed actually shivering  the end of the year i cried the predicament striking me for the first time in its fulness say youve got a crust  youll do it if i have to hold a gun over you he announced grimly  mingled with my anxiety which was real was an exultation that would not down nevertheless the idea of developing tom into a shakespearetom who had not the slightest desire to be one i was appalling besides having in it an element of useless selfsacrifice from which i recoiled on the other hand if alonzo should discover that i had written his theme there were penalties i did not care to dwell upon with such a cloud hanging over me i passed a restless night  as luck would have it the very next evening in the level light under the elms of the square i beheld sauntering towards me a dapper figure which i recognized as that of mr cheyne himself as i saluted him he gave me an amused and most disconcerting glance and when i was congratulating myself that he had passed me he stopped  fine weather for march paret he observed  yes sir i agreed in a strange voice  by the way he remarked contemplating the bare branches above our heads that was an excellent theme your roommate handed in i had no idea that he possessed suchsuch genius did you by any chance happen to read it  yes siri read it  werent you surprised inquired mr cheyne  well yes sirthat isi mean to say he talks just like that sometimesthat is when its anything he cares about  indeed said mr cheyne thats interesting most interesting in all my experience i do not remember a case in which a gift has been developed so rapidly i dont want to give the impressionah that there is no room for improvement but the thing was very well done for an undergraduate i must confess i never should have suspected it in peters and its most interesting what you say about his cleverness in conversation he twirled the head of his stick apparently lost in reflection i may be wrong he went on presently i have an idea it is you i must literally have jumped away from him he paused a moment without apparently noticing my panic that it is you who have influenced peters  sir  i am wrong then or is this merely commendable modesty on your part  oh no sir  then my hypothesis falls to the ground i had greatly hoped he added meaningly that you might be able to throw some light on this mystery  i was dumb  paret he asked have you time to come over to my rooms for a few minutes this evening  certainly sir  he gave me his number in brattle street  like one running in a nightmare and making no progress i made my way home only to learn from hallamwho lived on the same floorthat tom had inconsiderately gone to boston for the evening with four other weary spirits in search of relaxation avoiding our club table i took what little nourishment i could at a modest restaurant and restlessly paced the moonlit streets until eight oclock when i found myself in front of one of those lowgabled colonial houses which on less soulshaking occasions had exercised a great charm on my imagination my hand hung for an instant over the bell i must have rung it violently for there appeared almost immediately an old lady in a lace cap who greeted me with gentle courtesy and knocked at a little door with glistening panels the latch was lifted by mr cheyne himself  come in paret he said in a tone that was unexpectedly hospitable  i have rarely seen a more inviting room a wood fire burned brightly on the brass andirons flinging its glare on the big white beam that crossed the ceiling and reddening the square panes of the windows in their panelled recesses between these were rows of booksattractive books in chased bindings red and blue books that appealed to be taken down and read there was a table covered with reviews and magazines in neat piles and a lamp so shaded as to throw its light only on the white blotter of the pad two easy chairs covered with flowered chintz were ranged before the fire in one of which i sank much bewildered upon being urged to do so  i utterly failed to recognize alonzo in this new atmosphere and he had moreover dropped the subtly sarcastic manner i was wont to associate with him  jolly old house isnt it he observed as though i had casually dropped in on him for a chat and he stood with his hands behind him stretched to the blaze looking down at me it was built by a certain colonel draper who fought at louisburg and afterwards fled to england at the time of the revolution he couldnt stand the patriots im not so sure that i blame him either are you interested in colonial things mr paret  i said i was if the question had concerned aztec relics my answer would undoubtedly have been the same and i watched him dazedly while he took down a silver porringer from the shallow mantel shelf  its not a revere he said in a slightly apologetic tone as though to forestall a comment but its rather good i think i picked it up at a sale in dorchester but i have never been able to identify the coat of arms  he showed me a ladle with the names of patience and william simpson engraved quaintly thereon and took down other articles in which i managed to feign an interest finally he seated himself in the chair opposite crossed his feet putting the tips of his fingers together and gazing into the fire  so you thought you could fool me he said at length  i became aware of the ticking of a great clock in the corner my mouth was dry  i am going to forgive you he went on more gravely for several reasons i dont flatter as you know its because you carried out the thing so perfectly that i am led to think you have a gift that may be cultivated paret you wrote that theme in the way peters would have written it if he had not beenwhat shall i sayscripturally inarticulate and i trust it may do you some good if i say it was something of a literary achievement if not a moral one  thank you sir i faltered  have you ever he inquired lapsing a little into his lectureroom manner seriously thought of literature as a career have you ever thought of any career seriously  i once wished to be a writer sir i replied tremulously but refrained from telling him of my fathers opinion of the profession ambitiona purer ambition than i had known for yearsleaped within me at his words he alonzo cheyne had detected in me the promethean fire  i sat there until ten oclock talking to the real mr cheyne a human mr cheyne unknown in the lectureroom nor had i suspected one in whom cynicism and distrust of undergraduates of my sort seemed so ingrained of such idealism he did not pour it out in preaching delicately unobtrusively and on the whole rather humorously he managed to present to me in a most disillusionizing light that conception of the university held by me and my intimate associates after i had left him i walked the quiet streets to behold as through dissolving mists another harvard and there trembled in my soul like the birthstruggle of a flame something of the vision later to be immortalized by st gaudens the spirit of harvard responding to the spirit of the republicto the call of lincoln who voiced it the place of that bronze at the corner of boston common was as yet empty but i have since stood before it to gaze in wonder at the light shining in darkness on mute uplifted faces black faces at harvards son leading them on that the light might live and prevail  i too longed for a cause into which i might fling myself in which i might lose myself i halted on the sidewalk to find myself staring from the opposite side of the street at a familiar house my old landladys mrs boltons and summoned up before me was the tired smiling face of hermann krebs was it because when he had once spoken so crudely of the university i had seen the reflection of her spirit in his eyes a light still burned in the extension roofkrebss light another shone dimly through the ground glass of the front door obeying a sudden impulse i crossed the street  mrs bolton in the skyblue wrapper and looking more forbidding than ever answered the bell life had taught her to be indifferent to surprises and it was i who became abruptly embarrassed  oh its you mr paret she said as though i had been a frequent caller i had never once darkened her threshold since i had left her house  yes i answered and hesitated is mr krebs in  well she replied in a lifeless tone which nevertheless had in it a touch of bitterness i guess theres no reason why you and your friends should have known he was sick  sick i repeated is he very sick  i calculate hell pull through she said sunday the doctor gave him up and no wonder he hasnt had any proper food since hes ben here she paused eyeing me if youll excuse me mr paret i was just going up to him when you rang  certainly i replied awkwardly would you be so kind as to tell himwhen hes well enoughthat i came to see him and that im sorry  there was another pause and she stood with a hand defensively clutching the knob  yes ill tell him she said  with a sense of having been baffled i turned away  walking back toward the yard my attention was attracted by a slowly approaching cab whose occupants were disturbing the quiet of the night with song  shollitytis wine tis wine that makeshshollity  the vehicle drew up in front of a new and commodious buildingi believe the first of those designed to house undergraduates who were willing to pay for private bathrooms and other modern luxuries out of one window of the cab protruded a pair of shoeless feet out of the other a hatless head i recognized as belonging to tom peters hence i surmised that the feet were his also the driver got down from the box and a lively argument was begun insidefor there were other occupantsas to how mr peters was to be disembarked and i gathered from his frequent references to the shgyptian obelisk that the engineering problem presented struck him as similar to the unloading of cleopatras needle  careful careful he cautioned as certain expelling movements began from within easy ham you jamfool keep the door shut yll break me  now jerry all heave shgether exclaimed a voice from the blackness of the interior  will ye wait a minute mr durrett sir implored the cabdriver youll be after ruining me cab entirely loud roars and vigorous resistance from the obelisk the cab rocking violently this gintleman meaning me will have him by the head and ill get hold of his feet sir which he did after a severe kick in the stomach  headsh all right martin  to be sure it is mr peters now will ye rest aisy awhile sir  im axphyxiated cried another voice from the darkness the mined voice of jerome kyme our classmate  get the tackles under him came forth in commanding tones from conybear  in the meantime many windows had been raised and much gratuitous advice was being given the three occupants of the cabs seat who had previously clamoured for mr peters removal now inconsistently resisted it suddenly he came out with a jerk and we had him fairly upright on the pavement minus a collar and tie and the buttons of his evening waistcoat those who remained in the cab engaged in a riotous game of hunt the slipper while tom peered into the dark interior observing gravely the progress of the sport first flew out an overcoat and a muchbattered hat finally the pumps all of which in due time were adjusted to his person and i started home with him with much parting counsel from the other three  whereinell were you hughie he inquired hunted all over for you had a sousin good time went to babcockshad champagnethen to see babesh inthwoods ham knows one of the babesh had supper with four of em nice babesh  for heavens sake dont step on me again i cried  shpoloshize old man but yknow im william shakespheare cn do what i damplease he halted in the middle of the street and recited dramatically      not marble nor th gilded monuments      of prinches shll outlive m powerful rhyme  hows that alonzho bgosh  where did you learn it i demanded momentarily forgetting his condition  frm ralph he replied says i wrote it cant remember  after i had got him to beda service i had learned to perform with more or less proficiencyi sat down to consider the events of the evening to attempt to get a proportional view the intensity of my disgust was not hypocritical as i gazed through the open door into the bedroom and recalled the times when i too had been in that condition tom peters drunk and sleeping it off was deplorable without doubt but hugh paret drunk was detestable and had no excuse whatever nor did i mean by this to set myself on a higher ethical plane for i felt nothing but despair and humility in my state of clairvoyance i perceived that he was a better man than i and that his lapses proceeded from a love of liquor and the transcendent sense of goodfellowship that liquor brings     vii  the crisis through which i passed at cambridge inaugurated by the events i have just related i find very difficult to portray it was a religious crisis of course and my most pathetic memory concerning it is of the vain attempts to connect my yearnings and discontents with the theology i had been taught i began in secret to read my bible yet nothing i hit upon seemed to point a way out of my present predicament to give any definite clew to the solution of my life i was not mature enough to reflect that orthodoxy was a sunday religion unrelated to a world whose wheels were turned by the motives of selfinterest that it consisted of ideals not deemed practical since no attempt was made to put them into practice in the only logical mannerby reorganizing civilization to conform with them the implication was that the christ who had preached these ideals was not practical there were undoubtedly men in the faculty of the university who might have helped me had i known of them who might have given me even at that time a clew to the modern logical explanation of the bible as an immortal record of the thoughts and acts of men who had sought to do just what i was seeking to doconnect the religious impulse to life and make it fruitful in life an explanation by the way a thousandfold more spiritual than the old but i was hopelessly entangled in the meshes of the mystic the miraculous and supernatural if i had analyzed my yearnings i might have realized that i wanted to renounce the life i had been leading not because it was sinful but because it was aimless i had not learned that the greek word for sin is a missing of the mark just aimlessness i had been stirred with the desire to perform some service for which the world would be grateful to write great literature perchance but it had never been suggested to me that such swellings of the soul are religious that religion is that kind of feeling of motive power that drives the writer and the scientist the statesman and the sculptor as well as the priest and the prophet to serve mankind for the joy of serving that religion is creative or it is nothing not mechanical not a force imposed from without but a driving power within the religion i had learned was salvation from sin by miracle sin a deliberate rebellion not a pathetic missing of the mark of life useful service of man not the wandering of untutored souls who had not been shown the way i felt religious i wanted to go to church i wanted to maintain when it was on me that exaltation i dimly felt as communion with a higher power with god and which also was identical with my desire to write to create  i bought books sets of wordsworth and keats of milton and shelley and shakespeare and hid them away in my bureau drawers lest tom and my friends should see them these too i read secretly making excuses for not joining in the usual amusements once i walked to mrs boltons and inquired rather shamefacedly for hermann krebs only to be informed that he had gone out there were lapses of course when i went off on the old excursionsfor the most part the usual undergraduate follies though some were of a more serious nature on these i do not care to dwell sex was still a mystery always i awoke afterwards to bitter selfhatred and despair but my work in english improved and i earned the commendation and friendship of mr cheyne with a wisdom for which i was grateful he was careful not to give much sign of it in classes but the fact that he was getting soft on me was evident enough to be regarded with suspicion indeed the state into which i had fallen became a matter of increasing concern to my companions who tried every means from ridicule to sympathy to discover its cause and shake me out of it the theory most accepted was that i was in love  come on now hughietell me who she is i wont give you away tom would beg once or twice indeed i had imagined i was in love with the sisters of boston classmates whose dances i attended to these parties tom not having overcome his diffidence in respect to what he called social life never could be induced to go  it was ralph who detected the true cause of my discontent typical as no other man i can recall of the code to which we had dedicated ourselves the code that moulded the important part of the undergraduate world and defied authority he regarded any defection from it in the light of treason an instructor in a fit of impatience had once referred to him as the mephistopheles of his class he had fatal attractions and a remarkable influence his favourite pastime was the capricious exercise of his will on weaker characters such as his cousin ham durrett if they swore off ralph made it his business to get them drunk again and having accomplished this would proceed himself to administer a new oath and see that it was kept alcohol seemed to have no effect whatever on him though he was in the class above me i met him frequently at a club to which i had the honour to belong then a suite of rooms over a shop furnished with a pool and a billiard table easychairs and a bar it has since achieved the dignity of a house of its own  we were having one evening a religious argument cinibar laurens and myself and some others i cant recall how it began i think cinibar had attacked the institution of compulsory chapel which nobody defended there was something inherently wrong he maintained with a religion to which men had to be driven against their wills somewhat to my surprise i found myself defending a christianity out of which i had been able to extract but little comfort and solace neither laurens nor conybear however were for annihilating it although they took the other side of the discussion of a subject of which none of us knew anything their attacks were but halfhearted like me they were still under the spell exerted by a youthful training  we were all of us aware of ralph who sat at some distance looking over the pages of an english sporting weekly presently he flung it down  havent you found out yet that man created god hughie he inquired and even if there were a personal god what reason have you to think that man would be his especial concern or any concern of his whatever the discovery of evolution has knocked your christianity into a cocked hat  i dont remember how i answered him in spite of the superficiality of his own arguments which i was not learned enough to detect i was ingloriously routed darwin had kicked over the bucket and that was all there was to it after we had left the club both conybear and laurens admitted they were somewhat disturbed declaring that ralph had gone too far i spent a miserable night recalling the naturalistic assertions he had made so glibly asking myself again and again how it was that the religion to which i so vainly clung had no greater effect on my actions and on my will had not prevented me from lapses into degradation and i hated myself for having argued upon a subject that was still sacred i believed in christ which is to say that i believed that in some inscrutable manner he existed continued to dominate the world and had suffered on my account  to whom should i go now for a confirmation of my wavering beliefs one of the resultsit will be remembered of religion as i was taught it was a pernicious shyness and even though i had found a mentor and confessor i might have hesitated to unburden myself this would be different from arguing with ralph hambleton in my predicament as i was wandering through the yard i came across a notice of an evening talk to students in holder chapel by a clergyman named phillips brooks this was before the time let me say in passing when his sermons at harvard were attended by crowds of undergraduates well i stood staring at the notice debating whether i should go trying to screw up my courage for i recognized clearly that such a step if it were to be of any value must mean a distinct departure from my present mode of life and i recall thinking with a certain revulsion that i should have to turn good my presence at the meeting would be known the next day to all my friends for the idea of attending a religious gathering when one was not forced to do so by the authorities was unheard of in our set i should be classed with the despised pious ones who did such things regularly i shrank from the ridicule i had however heard of mr brooks from ned symonds who was by no means of the pious type and whose parents attended mr brookss church in boston i left my decision in abeyance but when evening came i stole away from the club table on the plea of an engagement and made my way rapidly toward holder chapel i had almost reached itwhen i caught a glimpse of symonds and of some others approachingand i went on to turn again by this time the meeting which was in a room on the second floor had already begun palpitating i climbed the steps the door of the room was slightly ajar i looked in i recall a distinct sensation of surprisethe atmosphere of that meeting was so different from what i had expected not a pious atmosphere at all i saw a very tall and heavy gentleman dressed in black who sat wholly at ease on the table one hand was in his pocket one foot swung clear of the ground and he was not preaching but talking in an easy conversational tone to some forty young men who sat intent on his words i was too excited to listen to what he was saying i was making a vain attempt to classify him but i remember the thought for it struck me with forcethat if christianity were so thoroughly discredited by evolution as ralph hambleton and other agnostics would have one believe why should this remarkably sane and ablelooking person be standing up for it as though it were still an established and incontrovertible fact  he had not certainly the air of a dupe or a sentimentalist but inspired confidence by his very personality youthlike i watched him narrowly for flaws for oratorical tricks for all kinds of histrionic symptoms again i was near the secret again it escaped me the argument for christianity lay not in assertions about it but in being it this man was christianity i must have felt something of this even though i failed to formulate it and unconsciously i contrasted his strength which reinforced the atmosphere of the room with that of ralph hambleton who was a greater influence over me than i have recorded and had come to sway me more and more as he had swayed others the strength of each was impressive yet this mr brooks seemed to me the bodily presentment of a set of values which i would have kept constantly before my eyes i felt him drawing me overcoming my hesitation belittling my fear of ridicule i began gently to open the doorwhen something happenedone of those little things that may change the course of a life the door made little noise yet one of the men sitting in the back of the room chanced to look around and i recognized hermann krebs his face was still sunken from his recent illness into his eyes seemed to leap a sudden appeal an appeal to which my soul responded yet i hurried down the stairs and into the street instantly i regretted my retreat i would have gone back but lacked the courage and i strayed unhappily for hours now haunted by that look of krebs now wondering what the remarkably sanelooking and informal clergyman whose presence dominated the little room had been talking about i never learned but i did live to read his biography to discover what he might have talked aboutfor he if any man believed that life and religion are one and preached consecration to lifes task  of little use to speculate whether the message had i learned it then would have fortified and transformed me  in spite of the fact that i was unable to relate to a satisfying conception of religion my newborn determination i made up my mind at least to renounce my tortuous ways i had promised my father to be a lawyer i would keep my promise i would give the law a fair trial later on perhaps i might demonstrate an ability to write all very praiseworthy the season was lent a fitting time for renunciations and resolves although i had more than once fallen from grace i believed myself at last to have settled down on my true coursewhen something happened the devil interfered subtly as usualnow in the person of jerry kyme it should be said in justice to jerry that he did not look the part he had sunnyred curly hair mischievous blue eyes with long lashes and he harboured no respect whatever for any individual or institution sacred or profane he possessed however a shrewd sense of his own value as many innocent and unsuspecting souls discovered as early as our freshman year and his method of putting down the presumptuous was both effective and unique if he liked you there could be no mistake about it  one evening when i was engaged in composing a theme for mr cheyne on no less a subject than the interpretation of the work of william wordsworth i found myself unexpectedly sprawling on the floor in my descent kicking the table so vigorously as to send the inkwell a foot or two toward the ceiling this be it known was a typical proof of jerrys esteem for he had entered noiselessly jerking the back of my chair which chanced to be tilted and stood with his hands in his pockets surveying the ruin he had wrought watching the ink as it trickled on the carpet then he picked up the book  poetry you darned old grind he exclaimed disgustedly say parry i dont know whats got into you but i want you to come home with me for the easter holidays itll do you good well be on the hudson you know and well manage to make life bearable somehow  i forgot my irritation in sheer surprise  why thats mighty good of you jerry i began struggling to my feet  oh rot he exclaimed i shouldnt ask you if i didnt want you  there was no denying the truth of this and after he had gone i sat for a long time with my pen in my mouth reflecting as to whether or not i should go for i had the instinct that here was another crossroads that more depended on my decision than i cared to admit but even then i knew what i should do ridiculous not toi told myself how could a week or ten days with jerry possibly affect my newborn resolve  yet the prospect now of a visit to the kymes was by no means so glowing as it once would have been for i had seen visions i had dreamed dreams beheld a delectable country of my very own a year agonay even a month agohow such an invitation would have glittered i returned at length to my theme over which before jerrys arrival i had been working feverishly but now the glamour had gone from it  presently tom came in  anyone been here he demanded  jerry i told him  what did he want  he wanted me to go home with him at easter  youre going of course  i dont know i havent decided  youd be a fool not to was toms comment it voiced succinctly a prevailing opinion  it was the conclusion i arrived at in my own mind but just why i had been chosen for the honour especially at such a time was a riddle jerrys invitations were charily given and valued accordingly and more than once at our table i had felt a twinge of envy when conybear or someone else had remarked with the proper nonchalance in answer to a question that they were going to weathersfield such was the name of the kyme place  i shall never forget the impression made on me by the decorous luxury of that big house standing amidst its old trees halfway up the gentle slope that rose steadily from the historic highway where poor andre was captured i can see now the heavy stone pillars of its portico vignetted in a flush of tenderest green the tulips just beginning to flame forth their easter colours in the wellkept beds the stately wellgroomed evergreens the vivid lawns the clipped hedges and like an overwhelming wave of emotion that swept all before it the impressiveness of wealth took possession of me for here was a kind of wealth i had never known that did not exist in the west nor even in the still puritan environs of boston where i had visited it took itself for granted proclaimed itself complacently to have solved all problems by ignoring them perhaps but i was too young to guess this it was order personified gaining effect at every turn by a multitude of details too trivial to mention were it not for the fact that they entered deeply into my consciousness until they came to represent collectively the very flower of achievement it was a wealth that accepted tribute calmly as of inherent right law and tradition defended its sanctity more effectively than troops literature descended from her high altar to lend it dignity and the long silent library displayed row upon row of the masters appropriately clad in morocco or calfsmollett macaulay gibbon richardson fielding scott dickens irving and thackeray as though each had striven for a tablet here art had denied herself that her canvases might be hung on these walls and even the church on that first sunday of my visit forgot the blood of her martyrs that she might adorn an appropriate niche in the setting the clergyman at one of the dinner parties gravely asked a blessing as upon an institution that included and absorbed all other institutions in its being  the note of that house was a tempered gaiety guests arrived from new york spent the night and departed again without disturbing the even tenor of its ways unobtrusive servants ministered to their wantsand to mine  conybear was there and two classmates from boston and we were treated with the amiable tolerance accorded to college youths and intimates of the son of the house one night there was a dance in our honour nor have i forgotten jerrys sister nathalie whom i had met at class days a slim and willowy exotic young lady of the botticelli type with a crown of burnished hair yet more suggestive of a hothouse than of spring she spoke english with a french accent capricious impulsive she captured my interest because she put a high value on her favour she drove me over the hills informing me at length that i was sympathiquedifferent from the rest in short she emphasized and intensified what i may call the weathersfield environment stirred up in me new and vague aspirations that troubled yet excited me  then there was mrs kyme a pretty lighthearted lady still young who seemed to have no intention of growing older who romped and played songs for us on the piano the daughter of an old but now impecunious westchester family she had been born to adorn the position she held she was adapted by nature to wring from it the utmost of the joys it offered from her rather than from her husband both of the children seemed to have inherited i used to watch mr grosvenor kyme as he sat at the end of the dinnertable dark preoccupied taciturn symbolical of a wealth new to my experience and which had about it a certain fabulous quality it toiled not neither did it spin but grew as if by magic day and night until the very conception of it was overpowering what must it be to have had ancestors who had been clever enough to sit still until a congested and discontented europe had begun to pour its thousands and hundreds of thousands into the gateway of the western world until that gateway had become a metropolis ancestors of course possessing what now suddenly appeared to me as the most desirable of giftssince it reaped so dazzling a harvestbusiness foresight from time to time these ancestors had continued to buy desirable corners which no amount of persuasion had availed to make them relinquish lease them yes sell them never by virtue of such a system wealth was as inevitable as human necessity and the thought of human necessity did not greatly bother me mr kymes problem of life was not one of making money but of investing it one became automatically a personage  it was due to one of those singular coincidencesso interesting a subject for speculationthat the man who revealed to me this golden romance of the kyme family was none other than a resident of my own city mr theodore watling now become one of our most important and influential citizens a corporation lawyer new and stimulating qualification suggesting as it did a deus ex machina of great affairs that he of all men should come to weathersfield astonished me since i was as yet to make the connection between that finished decorous secluded existence and the source of its being the evening before my departure he arrived in company with two other gentlemen a mr talbot and a mr saxes whose names were spoken with respect in a sphere of which i had hitherto taken but little cognizancewall street conybear informed me that they were magnates we were sitting in the drawingroom at tea when they entered with mr watling and no sooner had he spoken to mrs kyme than his quick eye singled me out of the group  why hugh he exclaimed taking my hand i had no idea i should meet you herei saw your father only last week the day i left home and he added turning to mrs kyme hugh is the son of mr matthew paret who has been the leader of our bar for many years  the recognition and the tribute to my father were so graciously given that i warmed with gratitude and pride while mr kyme smiled a little remarking that i was a friend of jerrys theodore watling for being here had suddenly assumed in my eyes a considerable consequence though the note he struck in that house was a strange one it was however his own note and had a certain distinction a ring of independence of the knowledge of selfworth dinner at weathersfield we youngsters had usually found rather an oppressive ceremony with its shaded lights and precise ritual over which mr kyme presided like a high priest conversation had been restrained that night as johnnie laurens afterwards expressed it things loosened up and mr watling was responsible for the loosening taking command of the kyme dinner table appeared to me to be no mean achievement but this is just what he did without being vulgar or noisy or assertive suavitar in modo forbiter in re if as i watched him there with a newborn pride and loyalty i had paused to reconstruct the idea that the mention of his name would formerly have evoked i suppose i should have found him falling short of my notion of a gentleman it had been my fathers opinion but mr watlings marriage to gene hollisters aunt had given him a standing with us at home he possessed virility vitality in a remarkable degree yet some elusive quality that was neither tact nor delicacythough related to these differentiated him from the commonplace selfmade man of ability he was just off the type to liken him to a clothing store model of a wellbuilt broadshouldered man with a firm neck a handsome rather square face not lacking in colour and a conventional drooping moustache would be slanderous yet he did suggest it suggesting it he redeemed it and the middle western burr in his voice was rather attractive than otherwise he had not so much the air of belonging there as of belonging anywhereone of those anomalistic american citizens of the world who go abroad and make intimates of princes before the meal was over he had inspired me with loyalty and pride enlisted the admiration of jerry and conybear and johnnie laurens we followed him into the smokingroom sitting down in a row on a leather lounge behind our elders  here now that the gentlemen were alone there was an inspiring largeness in their talk that fired the imagination the subject was investments at first those of coal and iron in my own state for mr watling it appeared was counsel for the boyne iron works  it will pay you to keep an eye on that company mr kyme he said knocking the ashes from his cigar now that old mr durretts gone  you dont mean to say nathaniel durretts dead said mr kyme  the lawyer nodded  the old regime passed with him adolf scherer succeeds him and you may take my word for it hes a coming man mr durrett who was a judge of men recognized that scherer was an emigrant he had ideas and rose to be a foreman for the last few years mr durrett threw everything on his shoulders  little by little the scope of the discussion was enlarged until it ranged over a continent touching lightly upon lines of railroad built or projected across the great west our pioneers had so lately succeeded in wresting from the savages upon mines of copper and gold hidden away among the mountains and millions of acres of forest and grazing lands which a complacent government would relinquish provided certain technicalities were met touching lightly too very lightlyupon senators and congressmen at washington and for the first time i learned that not the least of the functions of these representatives of the people was to act as the medium between capital and investment to facilitate the handing over of the republics resources to those in a position to develop them the emphasis was laid on development or rather on the resulting prosperity for the country that was the justification and it was taken for granted as supreme nor was it new to me this cult of prosperity i recalled the torchlight processions of the tariff enthusiasts of my childhood days my fathers championship of the republican party he had not idealized politicians either for the american politics and ethics were strangers  thus i listened with increasing fascination to these gentlemen in evening clothes calmly treating the united states as a melon patch that existed largely for the purpose of being divided up amongst a limited and favored number of persons i had a feeling of being among the initiated where it may be asked were my ideals let it not be supposed that i believed myself to have lost them if so the impression i have given of myself has been wholly inadequate no they had been transmuted that is all transmuted by the alchemy of weathersfield by the personality of theodore watling into brighter visions my eyes rarely left his face i hung on his talk which was interspersed with native humour though he did not always join in the laughter sometimes gazing at the fire as though his keen mind were grappling with a problem suggested i noted the respect in which his opinions were held and my imagination was fired by an impression of the power to be achieved by successful men of his profession by the evidence of their indispensability to capital itself at last when the gentlemen rose and were leaving the room mr watling lingered with his hand on my arm  of course youre going through the law school hugh he said  yes sir i replied  good he exclaimed emphatically the law today is more of a career than ever especially for a young man with your antecedents and advantages and i know of no city in the united states where i would rather start practice if i were a young man than ours in the next twenty years we shall see a tremendous growth of course youll be going into your fathers office you couldnt do better but ill keep an eye on you and perhaps ill be able to help you a little too  i thanked him gratefully  a famous artist who started out in youth to embrace a military career and who failed to pass an examination at west point is said to have remarked that if silicon had been a gas he would have been a soldier i am afraid i may have given the impression that if i had not gone to weathersfield and encountered mr watling i might not have been a lawyer this impression would be misleading and while it is certain that i have not exaggerated the intensity of the spiritual experience i went through at cambridge a somewhat belated consideration for the truth compels me to register my belief that the mood would in any case have been ephemeral the poison generated by the struggle of my nature with its environment had sunk too deep and the very education that was supposed to make a practical man of me had turned me into a sentimentalist i became as will be seen anything but a practical man in the true sense though the world in which i had been brought up and continued to live deemed me such my father was greatly pleased when i wrote him that i was now more than ever convinced of the wisdom of choosing the law as my profession and was satisfied that i had come to my senses at last he had still been prepared to see me go off at a tangent as he expressed it on the other hand the powerful effect of the appeal made by weathersfield and mr watling must not be underestimated here in one object lesson was emphasized a host of suggestions each of which had made its impression and when i returned to cambridge alonzo cheyne knew that he had lost me  i pass over the rest of my college course and the years i spent at the harvard law school where were instilled into me without difficulty the dictums that the law was the most important of all professions that those who entered it were a priestly class set aside to guard from profanation that ark of the covenant the constitution of the united states in short i was taught law precisely as i had been taught religionscriptural infallibility over againa static law and a static theologya set of concepts that were supposed to be equal to any problems civilization would have to meet until the millennium what we are wont to call wisdom is often naively innocent of impending change it has no barometric properties  i shall content myself with relating one incident only of this period in the january of my last year i went with a party of young men and girls to stay over sunday at beverly farms where mrs fremantlea young boston matron had opened her cottage for the occasion this cottage a roomy gabled structure stood on a cliff at the foot of which roared the wintry atlantic while we danced and popped corn before the open fires during the daylight hours we drove about the country in sleighs or made ridiculous attempts to walk on snowshoes  on sunday afternoon left temporarily to my own devices i wandered along the cliff crossing into the adjoining property the wind had fallen the waves much subdued broke rhythmically against the rocks during the night a new mantle of snow had been spread and the clouds were still low and menacing as i strolled i became aware of a motionless figure ahead of meone that seemed oddly familiar the set of the shabby overcoat on the stooping shoulders the unconscious pose contributed to a certain sharpness of individuality in the act of challenging my memory i halted the man was gazing at the seascape and his very absorption gave me a sudden and unfamiliar thrill the word absorption precisely expresses my meaning for he seemed indeed to have become a part of his surroundingsan harmonious part presently he swung about and looked at me as though he had expected to find me thereand greeted me by name  krebs i exclaimed  he smiled and flung out his arm indicating the scene his eyes at that moment seemed to reflect the seathey made the gaunt face suddenly beautiful  this reminds me of a japanese print he said  the words or the tone in which he spoke curiously transformed the picture it was as if i now beheld it anew through his vision the grey water stretching eastward to melt into the grey sky the massed black trees on the hillside powdered with white the snow in rounded fantastic patches on the huge boulders at the foot of the cliff krebs did not seem like a stranger but like one whom i had known alwaysone who stood in a peculiar relationship between me and something greater i could not define the impression was fleeting but real i remember wondering how he could have known anything about japanese prints  i didnt think you were still in this part of the country i remarked awkwardly  im a reporter on a boston newspaper and ive been sent up here to interview old mr dome who lives in that house and he pointed to a roof above the trees there is a rumour which i hope to verify that he has just given a hundred thousand dollars to the university  andwont he see you  at present hes taking a nap said krebs he comes here occasionally for a rest  do you like interviewing i asked  he smiled again  well i see a good many different kinds of people and thats interesting  butbeing a reporter i persisted  this continued patronage was not a conscious expression of superiority on my part but he did not seem to resent it he had aroused my curiosity  im going into the law he said  the quiet confidence with which he spoke aroused suddenly a twinge of antagonism he had every right to go into the law of course and yet my query would have made it evident to me had i been introspective in those days that the germ of the ideal of the profession implanted by mr watling was expanding were not influential friends necessary for the proper kind of career and where were krebss in spite of the history of daniel webster and a long line of american tradition i felt an incongruity in my classmates aspiration and as he stood there gaunt and undoubtedly hungry his eyes kindling i must vaguely have classed him with the revolutionaries of all the ages must have felt in him instinctively a menace to the stability of that order with which i had thrown my fortunes and yet there were comparatively poor men in the law school itself who had not made me feel this way he had impressed me against my will taken me by surprise commiseration had been mingled with other feelings that sprang out of the memory of the night i had called on him when he had been sick now i resented something in him which tom peters had called crust  the law i repeated why  well he said even when i was a boy working at odd jobs i used to think if i could ever be a lawyer i should have reached the top notch of human dignity  once more his smile disarmed me  and now i asked curiously  you see it was an ideal with me i suppose my father was responsible for that he had the german temperament of 48 and when he fled to this country he expected to find utopia the smile emerged again like the sun shining through clouds while fascination and antagonism again struggled within me and then came frightful troubles for years he could get only enough work to keep him and my mother alive but he never lost his faith in america it is man he would say man has to grow up to itto liberty without the struggle liberty would be worth nothing and he used to tell me that we must all do our part we who had come here and not expect everything to be done for us he had made that mistake if things were bad why put a shoulder to the wheel and help to make them better  that helped me he continued after a moments pause for ive seen a good many things especially since ive been working for a newspaper ive seen again and again the power of the law turned against those whom it was intended to protect ive seen lawyers who care a great deal more about winning cases than they do about justice who prostitute their profession to profit makingprofit making for themselves and others and they are often the respectable lawyers too men of high standing whom you would not think would do such things they are on the side of the powerful and the best of them are all retained by rich men and corporations and what is the result one of the worst evils i think that can befall a country the poor man goes less and less to the courts he is getting bitter which is bad which is dangerous but men wont see it  it was on my tongue to refute this to say that everybody had a chance i could indeed recall many arguments that had been drilled into me quotations even from court decisions but something prevented me from doing thissomething in his manner which was neither argumentative nor combative  thats why i am going into the law he added and i intend to stay in it if i can keep alive its a great chance for mefor all of us arent you at the law school  i nodded once more as his earnest glance fell upon me came that suggestion of a subtle inexplicable link between us but before i could reply steps were heard behind us and an elderly servant bareheaded was seen coming down the path  are you the reporter he demanded somewhat impatiently of krebs if you want to see mr dome youd better come right away hes going out for a drive  for a while after he had shaken my hand and departed i stood in the snow looking after him     viii  on the wednesday of that same week the news of my fathers sudden and serious illness came to me in a telegram and by the time i arrived at home it was too late to see him again alive it was my first experience with death and what perplexed me continually during the following days was an inability to feel the loss more deeply when a child i had been easily shaken by the spectacle of sorrow had i during recent years as a result of a discovery that emotions arising from human relationships lead to discomfort and suffering deliberately been forming a shell until now i was incapable of natural feelings of late i had seemed closer to my father and his letters though formal had given evidence of his affection in his repressed fashion he had made it clear that he looked forward to the time when i was to practise with him why was it then as i gazed upon his fine features in death that i experienced no intensity of sorrow what was it in me that would not break down he seemed worn and tired yet i had never thought of him as weary never attributed to him any yearning and now he was released  i wondered what had been his private thoughts about himself his private opinions about life and when i reflect now upon my lack of real knowledge at five and twenty i am amazed at the futility of an expensive education which had failed to impress upon me the simple basic fact that life was struggle that either development or retrogression is the fate of all men that characters are never completely made but always in the making i had merely a disconcerting glimpse of this truth with no powers of formulation as i sat beside my mother in the bedroom where every article evoked some childhood scene here was the dent in the walnut footboard of the bed made one wintry day by the impact of my box of blocks the big armchair covered with i know not what stiff embroidery which had served on countless occasions as a chariot driven to victory i even remembered how every wednesday morning i had been banished from the room which had been so large a part of my childhood universe when ella the housemaid had flung open all its windows and crowded its furniture into the hall  the thought of my wanderings since then became poignant almost terrifying the room with all its memories was unchanged how safe i had been within its walls why could i not have been content with what it represented of tradition of customof religion and what was it within me that had lured me away from these  i was miserable indeed but my misery was not of the kind i thought it ought to be at moments when my mother relapsed into weeping i glanced at her almost in wonder such sorrow as hers was incomprehensible once she surprised and discomfited me by lifting her head and gazing fixedly at me through her tears  i recall certain impressions of the funeral there among the pallbearers was my cousin robert breck tears in the furrows of his cheeks had he loved my father more than i the sight of his grief moved me suddenly and strongly it seemed an age since i had worked in his store and yet here he was still coming to town every morning and returning every evening to claremore loving his friends and mourning them one by one was this the spectacle presented by my cousin robert the reward of earthly existence were there no other prizes save those known as greatness of character and depth of human affections cousin robert looked worn and old the other pallbearers men of weight of long standing in the community were aged too mr blackwood and mr jules hollister and out of place somehow in this new church building it came to me abruptly that the old order was gonehad slipped away during my absence the church i had known in boyhood had been torn down to make room for a business building on boyne street the edifice in which i sat was expensive gave forth no distinctive note seemingly transitory with its hybrid interior its shiny oak and blue and red organpipes betokening a compromised and weakened faith nondescript likewise seemed the new minister mr randlett as he prayed unctuously in front of the flowers massed on the platform i vaguely resented his laudatory references to my father  the old church with its severity had actually stood for something it was the westminster catechism in wood and stone and dr pound had been the human incarnation of that catechism the fit representative of a wrathful god a militant shepherd who had guarded with vigilance his respectable flock who had protested vehemently against the sins of the world by which they were surrounded against the dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie how dr pound would have put the emphasis of the everlasting into those words  against what was mr randlett protesting  my glance wandered to the pews which held the committees from various organizations such as the chamber of commerce and the bar association which had come to do honour to my father and there differentiated from the others i saw the spruce alert figure of theodore watling he too represented a new type and a new notethis time a forceful note a secular note that had not belonged to the old church and seemed likewise anomalistic in the new  during the long slow journey in the carriage to the cemetery my mother did not raise her veil it was not until she reached out and seized my hand convulsively that i realized she was still a part of my existence  in the days that followed i became aware that my fathers death had removed a restrictive element that i was free now to take without criticism or opposition whatever course in life i might desire it may be that i had apprehended even then that his professional ideals would not have coincided with my own mingled with this sense of emancipation was a curious feeling of regret of mourning for something i had never valued something fixed and dependable for which he had stood a rock and a refuge of which i had never availed myself when his will was opened it was found that the property had been left to my mother during her lifetime it was larger than i had thought four hundred thousand dollars shrewdly invested for the most part in city real estate my father had been very secretive as to money matters and my mother had no interest in them  three or four days later i received in the mail a typewritten letter signed by theodore watling expressing sympathy for my bereavement and asking me to drop in on him down town before i should leave the city in contrast to the somewhat dingy offices where my father had practised in the blackwood block the quarters of watling fowndes and ripon on the eighth floor of the new durrett building were modern to a degree finished in oak and floored with marble with a railedoff space where young women with nimble fingers played ceaselessly on typewriters one of them informed me that mr watling was busy but on reading my card added that she would take it in meanwhile in company with two others who may have been clients i waited this then was what it meant to be a lawyer of importance to have like a chesterfield an anteroom where clients cooled their heels and awaited ones pleasure  the young woman returned and led me through a corridor to a door on which was painted mr wailing  i recall him tilted back in his chair in a debonnair manner beside his polished desk the hint of a smile on his lips and leaning close to him was a yellow owllike person whose eyes as they turned to me gave the impression of having stared for years into hard artificial lights mr watling rose briskly  how are you hugh he said the warmth of his greeting tempered by just the note of condolence suitable to my black clothes im glad you came i wanted to see you before you went back to cambridge i must introduce you to judge bering of our state supreme court judge this is mr parets boy  the judge looked me over with a certain slow impressiveness and gave me a soft and fleshy hand  glad to know you mr paret your father was a great loss to our bar he declared  i detected in his tone and manner a slight reservation that could not be called precisely judicial dignity it was as though in these few words he had gone to the limit of selfcommitment with a strangera striking contrast to the confidential attitude towards mr watling in which i had surprised him  judge said mr watling sitting down again do you recall that time we all went up to mr parets house and tried to induce him to run for mayor that was before you went on the lower bench  the judge nodded gloomily caressing his watch chain and suddenly rose to go  that will be all right then mr watling inquired cryptically with a smile the other made a barely perceptible inclination of the head and departed mr watling looked at me hes one of the best men we have on the bench today he added there was a trace of apology in his tone  he talked a while of my father to whom so he said he had looked up ever since he had been admitted to the bar  it would be a pleasure to me hugh as well as a matter of pride he said cordially but with dignity to have matthew parets son in my office i suppose you will be wishing to take your mother somewhere this summer but if you care to come here in the autumn you will be welcome you will begin of course as other young men beginas i began but i am a believer in blood and ill be glad to have you mr fowndes and mr ripon feel the same way he escorted me to the door himself  everywhere i went during that brief visit home i was struck by change by the crumbling and decay of institutions that once had held me in thrall by the superimposition of a new order that as yet had assumed no definite character some of the old landmarks had disappeared there were new and aggressive office buildings new and aggressive residences new and aggressive citizens who lived in them and of whom my mother spoke with gentle deprecation even claremore that paradise of my childhood had grown shrivelled and shabby even tawdry i thought when we went out there one sunday afternoon all that once represented the magic word country had vanished the old flat piano made in philadelphia ages ago the horsehair chairs and sofa had been replaced by a nondescript furniture of the sort displayed behind plateglass windows of the citys stores rockingchairs on stands upholstered in clashing colours their coiled springs only half hidden by tassels and ornamental electric fixtures instead of the polished coaloil lamps cousin jenny had grown white willie was a staid bachelor helen an old maid while mary had married a tall anaemic young man with glasses walter kinley whom cousin robert had taken into the store as i contemplated the brecks odd questions suggested themselves did honesty and warmheartedness necessarily accompany a lack of artistic taste and was virtue its own reward after all they drew my mother into the house took off her wraps set her down in the most comfortable rocker and insisted on making her a cup of tea  i was touched i loved them still and yet i was conscious of reservations concerning them they too seemed a little on the defensive with me and once in a while mary was caustic in her remarks  i guess nothing but new york will be good enough for hugh now hell be taking cousin sarah away from us  not at all my dear said my mother gently hes going into mr watlings office next autumn  theodore watling demanded cousin robert pausing in his carving  yes robert mr watling has been good enough to say that he would like to have hugh is there anything  oh im out of date sarah cousin robert replied vigorously severing the leg of the turkey these modern lawyers are too smart for me watlings no worse than the others i supposeonly hes got more ability  ive never heard anything against him said my mother in a pained voice only the other day mcalery willett congratulated me that hugh was going to be with him  you mustnt mind robert sarah put in cousin jennya remark reminiscent of other days  dad has a notion that his generation is the only honest one said helen laughingly as she passed a plate  i had gained a sense of superiority and i was quite indifferent to cousin roberts opinion of mr watling of modern lawyers in general more than once a wave of selfcongratulation surged through me that i had possessed the foresight and initiative to get out of the wholesale grocery business while there was yet time i looked at willie still freckled still literal still a plodder at walter kinley and i thought of the drabness of their lives at cousin robert himself as he sat smoking his cigar in the baywindow on that dark february day and suddenly i pitied him the suspicion struck me that he had not prospered of late and this deepened to a conviction as he talked  the republican party is going to the dogs he asserted  it used to be an honourable party but now it is no better than the other politics are only conducted now for the purpose of making unscrupulous men rich sir for years i furnished this city with good groceries if i do say it myself i took a pride in the fact that the inmates of the hospitals yes and the dependent poor in the citys institutions should have honest food you can get anything out of the city if you are willing to pay the politicians for it i lost my city contracts why because i refused to deal with scoundrels weill and company and other unscrupulous upstarts are willing to do so and poison the poor and the sick with adulterated groceries the first thing i knew was that the city auditor was holding back my bills for supplies and paying weills thats what politics and business yes sir and the law have come to in these days if a man wants to succeed he must turn into a rascal  i was not shocked but i was silent uncomfortable wishing that it were time to take the train back to the city cousin roberts face was more worn than i had thought and i contrasted him inevitably with the forceful person who used to stand in his worn alpaca coat on the pavement in front of his store greeting with cleareyed content his fellow merchants of the city willie breck too was silent and walter kinley took off his glasses and wiped them in the meanwhile helen had left the group in which my mother sat and approaching us laid her hands on her fathers shoulders  now dad she said in affectionate remonstrance youre excited about politics again and you know it isnt good for you and besides theyre not worth it  youre right helen he replied under the pressure of her hands he made a strong effort to control himself and turned to address my mother across the room  im getting to be a crotchety old man he said its a good thing i have a daughter to remind me of it  it is a good thing robert said my mother  during the rest of our visit he seemed to have recovered something of his former spirits and poise taking refuge in the past they talked of their own youth of families whose houses had been landmarks on the second bank  im worried about your cousin robert hugh my mother confided to me when we were at length seated in the train ive heard rumours that things are not so well at the store as they might be we looked out at the winter landscape so different from that one which had thrilled every fibre of my being in the days when the railroad on which we travelled had been a winding narrow gauge the orchardsthose that remainedwere bare stubble pricked the frozen ground where tassels had once waved in the hot summer wind we flew by row after row of gingerbread suburban houses built on villa plots and i read in large letters on a hideous signboard woodbine park  hugh have you ever heard anything againstmr watling  no mother i said so far as i knew he is very much looked up to by lawyers and business men he is counsel i believe for mr blackwoods street car line on boyne street and i told you i believe that i met him once at mr kymes  poor robert she sighed i suppose business trouble does make one bitterive seen it so often but i never imagined that it would overtake robert and at his time of life it is an old and respected firm and we have always had a pride in it  that night when i was going to bed it was evident that the subject was still in her mind she clung to my hand a moment  i too am afraid of the new hugh she said a little tremulously we all grow so as age comes on  but you are not old mother i protested  i have a feeling since your father has gone that i have lived my life my dear though id like to stay long enough to see you happily marriedto have grandchildren i was not young when you were born and she added after a little while i know nothing about business affairs and nownow that your father is no longer here sometimes im afraid  afraid of what mother  she tried to smile at me through her tears we were in the old sittingroom surrounded by the books  i know its foolish and it isnt that i dont trust you i know that the son of your father couldnt do anything that was not honourable and yet i am afraid of what the world is becoming the city is growing so fast and so many new people are coming in things are not the same robert is right there and i have heard your father say the same thing hugh promise me that you will try to remember always what he was and what he would wish you to be  i will mother i answered but i think you would find that cousin robert exaggerates a little makes things seem worse than they really are customs change you know and politics were never wellsunday schools i too smiled a little father knew that and he would never take an active part in them  he was too fine she exclaimed  and now i continued cousin robert has happened to come in contact with them through business that is what has made the difference in him before he always knew they were corrupt but he rarely thought about them  hugh she said suddenly after a pause you must remember one thingthat you can afford to be independent i thank god that your father has provided for that  i was duly admitted the next autumn to the bar of my own state and was assigned to a desk in the offices of watling fowndes and ripon larry weed was my immediate senior among the apprentices and larry was a heroworshipper i can see him now he suggested a bullfrog as he sat in the little room we shared in common his arms akimbo over a law book his little legs doubled under him his round eyes fixed expectantly on the doorway and even if i had not been aware of my good fortune in being connected with such a firm as theodore watlings larry would shortly have brought it home to me during those weeks when i was making my first desperate attempts at briefing up the law i was sometimes interrupted by his exclamations when certain figures went by in the corridor  say hugh do you know who that was  no  miller gorse  whos he  do you mean to say you never heard of miller gorse  ive been away a long time i would answer apologetically a person of some importance among my contemporaries at harvard i had looked forward to a residence in my native city with the complacency of one who has seen something of the worldonly to find that i was the least in the new kingdom and it was a kingdom larry opened up to me something of the significance and extent of it something of the identity of the men who controlled it  miller gorse he said impressively is the counsel for the railroad  what railroad you mean the i was adding when he interrupted me pityingly  after youve been here a while youll find out theres only one railroad in this state so far as politics are concerned the ashuela and northern the lake shore and the others dont count  i refrained from asking any more questions at that time but afterwards i always thought of the railroad as spelled with a capital  miller gorse isnt forty yet larry told me on another occasion thats doing pretty well for a man who comes near running this state  for the sake of acquiring knowledge i endured mr weeds patronage i inquired how mr gorse ran the state  oh youll find out soon enough he assured me  but mr barbours president of the railroad  sure once in a while they take something up to him but as a rule he leaves things to gorse  whereupon i resolved to have a good look at mr gorse at the first opportunity one day mr watling sent out for some papers  hes in there now said larry you take em  in there meant mr watlings sanctum and in there he was i had only a glance at the great man for with a kindly but preoccupied thank you hugh mr watling took the papers and dismissed me heaviness blackness and impassivitythese were the impressions of mr gorse which i carried away from that first meeting the very solidity of his flesh seemed to suggest the solidity of his position such say the psychologists is the effect of prestige  i remember well an oldfashioned picture puzzle in one of my boyhood books the scene depicted was to all appearances a sylvan peaceful one with two happy lovers seated on a log beside a brook but presently as one gazed at the picture the head of an animal stood forth among the branches and then the body more animals began to appear bit by bit a tiger a bear a lion a jackal a fox until at last whenever i looked at the page i did not see the sylvan scene at all but only the predatory beasts of the forest so one by one the figures of the real rulers of the city superimposed themselves for me upon the simple and democratic design of mayor council board of aldermen police force etc that filled the eye of a naive and trusting electorate which fondly imagined that it had something to say in government miller gorse was one of these rulers behind the screen and adolf scherer of the boyne iron works another there was leonard dickinson of the corn national bank frederick grierson becoming wealthy in city real estate judah b tallant who though outlawed socially was deferred to as the owner of the morning era and even ralph hambleton rapidly superseding the elderly and conservative mr lord who had hitherto managed the great hambleton estate ralph seemed to have become in a somewhat gnostic manner a fullfledged financier not having studied law he had been home for four years when i became a legal fledgling and during the early days of my apprenticeship i was beholden to him for many eye openers concerning the conduct of great affairs i remember him sauntering into my room one morning when larry weed had gone out on an errand  hello hughie he said with his air of having nothing to do grinding it out wheres watling  isnt he in his office  no  well what can we do for you i asked  ralph grinned  perhaps ill tell you when youre a little older youre too young and he sank down into larry weeds chair his long legs protruding on the other side of the table its a matter of taxes some time ago i found out that dickinson and tallant and others i could mention were paying a good deal less on their city property than we are we dont propose to do it any morethats all  how can mr watling help you i inquired  well i dont mind giving you a few tips about your profession hughie im going to get watling to fix it up with the city hall gang old lord doesnt like it ill admit and when i told him we had been contributing to the city long enough that i proposed swinging into line with other property holders he began to blubber about disgrace and what my grandfather would say if he were alive well he isnt alive a good deal of water has flowed under the bridges since his day its a mere matter of business of getting your respectable firm to retain a city hall attorney to fix it up with the assessor  how about the penitentiary i ventured not too seriously  i shant go to the penitentiary neither will watling what i do is to pay a lawyers fee there isnt anything criminal in that is there  for some time after ralph had departed i sat reflecting upon this new knowledge and there came into my mind the bitterness of cousin robert breck against this city hall gang and his remarks about lawyers i recalled the tone in which he had referred to mr watling but ralphs philosophy easily triumphed why not be practical and become master of a situation which one had not made and could not alter instead of being overwhelmed by it needless to say i did not mention the conversation to mr watling nor did he dwindle in my estimation these necessary transactions did not interfere in any way with his personal relationships and his days were filled with kindnesses and was not mr ripon the junior partner one of the evangelical lights of the community conducting advanced bible classes every week in the church of the redemption the unfolding of mysteries kept me alert and i understood that if i was to succeed certain esoteric knowledge must be acquired as it were unofficially i kept my eyes and ears open and applied myself with all industry to the routine tasks with which every young man in a large legal firm is familiar i recall distinctly my pride when the board of aldermen having passed an ordinance lowering the water rates i was intrusted with the responsibility of going before the court in behalf of mr ogilvys water company obtaining a temporary restricting order preventing the ordinance from going at once into effect here was an affair in point were it not for lawyers of the calibre of watling fowndes and ripon hardearned private property would soon be confiscated by the rapacious horde once in a while i was made aware that mr watling had his eye on me  well hugh he would say how are you getting along thats right stick to it and after a while well hand the drudgery over to somebody else  he possessed the supreme quality of a leader of men in that he took pains to inform himself concerning the work of the least of his subordinates and he had the gift of putting fire into a young man by a word or a touch of the hand on the shoulder it was not difficult for me therefore to comprehend larry weeds heroworship the loyalty of other members of the firm or of those occupants of the office whom i have not mentioned my first impression of him which i had got at jerry kymes deepened as time went on and i readily shared the belief of those around me that his legal talents easily surpassed those of any of his contemporaries i can recall at this time several noted cases in the city when i sat in court listening to his arguments with thrills of pride he made us all feelno matter how humble may have been our contributions to the preparationthat we had a share in his triumphs we remembered his manner with judges and juries and strove to emulate it he spoke as if there could be no question as to his being right as to the law and the facts and yet in some subtle way that bated analysis managed not to antagonize the court victory was in the air in that office i do not mean to say there were not defeats but frequently these defeats by resourcefulness by a neversaydie spirit by a consummate knowledge not only of the law but of other things at which i have hinted were turned into ultimate victories we fought cases from one court to another until our opponents were worn out or the decision was reversed we won and that spirit of winning got into the blood what was most impressed on me in those early years i think was the discovery that there was always a pathif one were clever enough to find itfrom one terrace to the next higher staying power was the most prized of all the virtues one could always by adroitness compel a legal opponent to fight the matter out all over again on new ground or at least on ground partially new if the court of appeals should fail one there was the supreme court there was the opportunity also to shift from the state to the federal courts and likewise the muchprized device known as a change of venue when a judge was supposed to be prejudiced     ix  as my apprenticeship advanced i grew more and more to the inhabitants of our city into two kinds the who were served and the inefficient who were separate efficient neglected but the mental process of which the classification was the result was not so deliberate as may be supposed sometimes when an important client would get into trouble the affair took me into the police court where i saw the riffraff of the city penned up waiting to have justice doled out to them weary women who had spent the night in cells indifferent now as to the front they presented to the world the finery rued that they had tended so carefully to catch the eyes of men on the darkened streets brazen young girls who blazed forth defiance to all order derelict men sodden and hopeless with scrubby beards shifty looking burglars and pickpockets all these i beheld at first with twinges of pity later to mass them with the ugly and inevitable with whom society had to deal somehow lawyers after all must be practical men i came to know the justices of these police courts as well as other judges and underlying my acquaintance with all of them was the knowledgethough not on the threshold of my consciousnessthat they depended for their living every man of them those who were appointed and those who were elected upon a political organization which derived its sustenance from the element whence came our clients thus by degrees the sense of belonging to a special priesthood had grown on me  i recall an experience with that same mr nathan weill the wholesale grocer of whose commerce with the city hall my cousin robert breck had so bitterly complained late one afternoon mr weills carriage ran over a child on its way uptown through one of the poorer districts the parents naturally were frantic and the coachman was arrested this was late in the afternoon and i was alone in the office when the telephone rang hurrying to the police station i found mr weill in a state of excitement and abject fear for an ugly crowd had gathered outside  could not mr watling or mr fowndes come demanded the grocer  with an inner contempt for the laymans state of mind on such occasions i assured him of my competency to handle the case he was impressed i think by the sergeants deference who knew what it meant to have such an office as ours interfere with the affair i called up the prosecuting attorney who sent to monahans saloon close by and procured a release for the coachman on his own recognizance one of many signed in blank and left there by the justice for privileged cases the coachman was hustled out by a back door and the crowd dispersed  the next morning while a score or more of delinquents sat in the anxious seats justice garry recognized me and gave me precedence and mr weill with a sigh of relief paid his fine  mr paret is it he asked as we stood together for a moment on the sidewalk outside the court you have managed this well i will remember  he was sued of course when he came to the office he insisted on discussing the case with mr watling who sent for me  that is a bright young man mr weill declared shaking my hand he will get on  some day said mr watling he may save you a lot of money weill  when my friend mr watling is united states senatoreh  mr watling laughed before that i hope i advise you to compromise this suit weill he added how would a thousand dollars strike you ive had paret look up the case and he tells me the little girl has had to have an operation  a thousand dollars cried the grocer what right have these people to let their children play on the streets its an outrage  where else have the children to play mr watling touched his arm weill he said gently suppose it had been your little girl the grocer pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his bald forehead but he rallied a little  you fight these damage cases for the street railroads all through the courts  yes mr watling agreed but there a principle is involved if the railroads once got into the way of paying damages for every careless employee they would soon be bankrupt through blackmail but here you have a child whose father is a poor janitor and cant afford sickness and your coachman i imagine will be more particular in the future  in the end mr weill made out a cheque and departed in a good humour convinced that he was well out of the matter here was one of many instances i could cite of mr watlings tenderness of heart i felt moreover as if he had done me a personal favour since it was i who had recommended the compromise for i had been to the hospital and had seen the child on the cota dark little thing lying still in her pain with the bewildered look of a wounded animal  not long after this incident of mr weills damage suit i obtained a more or less definite promotion by the departure of larry weed he had suddenly developed a weakness of the lungs mr watling got him a place in denver and paid his expenses west  the first six or seven years i spent in the office of wading fowndes and ripon were of importance to my future career but there is little to relate of them i was absorbed not only in learning law but in acquiring that esoteric knowledge at which i have hintednot to be had from my seniors and which i was convinced was indispensable to a successful and lucrative practice my former comparison of the organization of our city to a picture puzzle wherein the dominating figures become visible only after long study is rather inadequate a better analogy would be the human anatomy we lawyers of course were the brains the financial and industrial interests the body helpless without us the city hall politicians the stomach that must continually be fed all three law politics and business were interdependent united by a nervous system too complex to be developed here in these years though i worked hard and often late i still found time for convivialities for social gaieties yet little by little without realizing the fact i was losing zest for the companionship of my former intimates my mind was becoming polarized by the contemplation of one object success and to it human ties were unconsciously being sacrificed  tom peters began to feel this even at a time when i believed myself still to be genuinely fond of him considering our respective temperaments in youth it is curious that he should have been the first to fall in love and marry one day he astonished me by announcing his engagement to susan blackwood  that ends the liquor hughie he told me beamingly i promised her id eliminate it  he did eliminate it save for mild relapses on festive occasions a more seemingly incongruous marriage could scarcely be imagined and yet it was a success from the start from a slim silent selfwilled girl susan had grown up into a tall rather rawboned and energetic young woman she was what we called in those days intellectual and had gone in for kindergartens and after her marriage she turned out to be excessively domestic practising her theories with entire success upon a family that showed a tendency to increase at an alarming rate tom needless to say did not become intellectual he settled downprematurely i thoughtinto what is known as a family man curiously content with the income he derived from the commission business and with life in general and he developed a somewhat critical view of the tendencies of the civilization by which he was surrounded susan held it also but she said less about it in the comfortable but unpretentious house they rented on cedar street we had many discussions after the babies had been put to bed and the door of the livingroom closed in order that our voices might not reach the nursery perry blackwood now toms brotherinlaw was often there he too had lapsed into what i thought was an odd conservatism old josiah his father being dead he occupied himself mainly with looking after certain family interests among which was the boyne street car line among business men he was already getting the reputation of being a little difficult to deal with i was often the subject of their banter and presently i began to suspect that they regarded my career and beliefs with some concern this gave me no uneasiness though at limes i lost my temper i realized their affection for me but privately i regarded them as lacking in ambition in force in the fighting qualities necessary for achievement in this modern age perhaps unconsciously i pitied them a little  how is judah b today hughie tom would inquire i hear youve put him up for the boyne club now that mr watling has got him out of that libel suit  carter ives is dead perry would add sarcastically let bygones be bygones  it was well known that mr tallant in the early days of his newspaper had blackmailed mr ives out of some hundred thousand dollars and that this more than any other act stood in the way with certain recalcitrant gentlemen of his highest ambition membership in the boyne  the trouble with you fellows is that you refuse to deal with conditions as you find them i retorted we didnt make them and we cant change them tallants a factor in the business life of this city and he has to be counted with  tom would shake his head exasperatingly  why dont you get after ralph i demanded he doesnt antagonize tallant either  ralphs hopeless said tom he was born a pirate you werent hughie we think theres a chance for his salvation dont we perry  i refused to accept the remark as flattering  another object of their assaults was frederick grierson who by this time had emerged from obscurity as a small dealer in real estate into a manipulator of blocks and corners  i suppose you think its a lawyers business to demand an ethical bill of health of every client i said i wont stand up for all of tallants career of course but mr wading has a clear right to take his cases as for grierson it seems to me thats a matter of giving a dog a bad name just because his people werent known here and because he has worked up from small beginnings to get down to hardpan you fellows dont believe in democracyin giving every man a chance to show whats in him  democracy is good exclaimed perry if the kind of thing were coming to is democracy god save the state  on the other hand i found myself drawing closer to ralph hambleton sometimes present at these debates as the only one of my boyhood friends who seemed to be able to deal with conditions as he found them indeed he gave one the impression that if he had had the making of them he would not have changed them  what the deuce do you expect i once heard him inquire with goodnatured contempt business isnt charity its war  there are certain things maintained perry stoutly that gentlemen wont do  gentlemen exclaimed ralph stretching his slim six feet two we were sitting in the boyne club its ungentlemanly to kill or burn a town or sink a ship but we keep armies and navies for the purpose for a man with a good mind perry you show a surprising inability to think things out to a logical conclusion what the deuce is competition when you come down to it christianity not by a long shot if our nations are slaughtering men and starving populations in other countriesare carried on in fact for the sake of business if our churches are filled with business men and our sky pilots pray for the government you cant expect heathen individuals like me to do business on a christian basisif there is such a thing you can make rules for croquet but not for a game that is based on the natural law of the survival of the fittest the darned fools in the legislatures try it occasionally but we all know its a sop to the common people ask hughie here if there ever was a law put on the statute books that his friend watling couldnt get round why youve got competition even among the churches yours where i believe you teach in the sunday school would go bankrupt if it proclaimed real christianity and youll go bankrupt if you practise it perry my boy some early wideawake competitive redblooded bird will relieve you of the boyne street car line  it was one of this same new and fittest species who had already relieved poor mr mcalery willett of his fortune mr willett was a trusting soul who had never known how to take care of himself or his money people said and now that he had lost it they blamed him some had been saved enough for him and nancy to live on in the old house with careful economy it was nancy who managed the economy who accomplished remarkable things with a sum they would have deemed poverty in former days her mother had died while i was at cambridge reverses did not subdue mr willetts spirits and the fascination modern business had for him seemed to grow in proportion to the misfortunes it had caused him he moved into a tiny office in the durrett building where he appeared every morning about halfpast ten to occupy himself with heaven knows what short cuts to wealth with prospectuses of companies in mexico or central america or some other distant place once i remember it was a tea company in which he tried to interest his friends to raise in the south a product he maintained would surpass orange pekoe in the afternoon between three and four he would turn up at the boyne club as well groomed as spruce as ever generally with a flower in his buttonhole he never forgot that he was a gentleman and he had a gentlemans notions of the fitness of things and it was against his principles to use a gentlemans club for the furtherance of his various enterprises  drop into my office some day dickinson he would say i think ive got something there that might interest you  he reminded me when i met him that he had always predicted i would get along in life  the portrait of nancy at this period is not so easily drawn the decline of the family fortunes seemed to have had as little effect upon her as upon her father although their characters differed sharply something of that spontaneity of that love of life and joy in it she had possessed in youth she must have inherited from mcalery willett but these qualities had disappeared in her long before the coming of financial reverses she was nearing thirty and in spite of her beauty and the rarer distinction that can best be described as breeding she had never married men admired her but from a distance she kept them at arms length they said strangers who visited the city invariably picked her out of an assembly and asked who she was one man from new york who came to visit ralph and who had been madly in love with her she had amazed many people by refusing spurning all he might have given her this incident seemed a refutation of the charge that she was calculating as might have been foretold she had the social gift in a remarkable degree and in spite of the limitations of her purse the knack of dressing better than other women though at that time the organization of our social life still remained comparatively simple the custom of luxurious and expensive entertainment not having yet set in  the more i reflect upon those days the more surprising does it seem that i was not in love with her it may be that i was unconsciously for she troubled my thoughts occasionally and she represented all the qualities i admired in her sex the situation that had existed at the time of our first and only quarrel had been reversed i was on the highroad to the worldly success i had then resolved upon nancy was poor and for that reason perhaps prouder than ever if she was inaccessible to others she had the air of being peculiarly inaccessible to methe more so because some of the superficial relics of our intimacy remained or rather had been restored her very manner of camaraderie seemed paradoxically to increase the distance between us it piqued me had she given me the least encouragement i am sure i should have responded and i remember that i used occasionally to speculate as to whether she still cared for me and took this method of hiding her real feelings yet on the whole i felt a certain complacency about it all i knew that suffering was disagreeable i had learned how to avoid it and i may have had deep within me a feeling that i might marry her after all meanwhile my life was full and gave promise of becoming even fuller more absorbing and exciting in the immediate future  one of the most fascinating figures to me of that order being woven like a cloth of gold out of our hitherto drab civilizationan order into which i was ready and eager to be initiatedwas that of adolf scherer the giant german immigrant at the head of the boyne iron works his life would easily lend itself to riotous romance in the old country in a valley below the castle perched on the rack above he had begun life by tending his fathers geese what a contrast to steeltown with its smells and sickening summer heat to the shanty where mrs scherer took boarders and bent over the washtub she too was an immigrant but lived to hear her native wagner from her own box at covent garden and he to explain on the deck of an imperial yacht to the man who might have been his sovereign certain processes in the manufacture of steel hitherto untried on that side of the atlantic in comparison with adolf scherer citizen of a once despised democracy the minor prince in whose dominions he had once tended geese was of small account indeed  the adolf scherer of that daythough it is not so long ago as time flieswas even more solid and impressive than the man he afterwards became when he reached the dizzier heights from which he delivered to an eager press opinions on politics and war eugenics and womans suffrage and other subjects that are the despair of specialists had he stuck to steel he would have remained invulnerable but even then he was beginning to abandon the field of production for that of exploitation figuratively speaking he had taken to soap which with the aid of water may be blown into beautiful iridescent bubbles to charm the eye much good soap apparently has gone that way never to be recovered everybody who was anybody began to blow bubbles about that time and the bigger the bubble the greater its attraction for investors of hardearned savings outside of this love for financial iridescence let it be called mr scherer seemed to care little then for glitter of any sort shortly after his elevation to the presidency of the boyne iron works he had been elected a member of the boyne cluban honour of which some thought he should have been more sensible but generally when in town he preferred to lunch at a little german restaurant annexed to a saloon where i used often to find him literally towering above the clothfor he was a giant with short legshis napkin tucked into his shirt front engaged in lively conversation with the ministering heinrich the chef at the club mr scherer insisted could produce nothing equal to heinrichs sauerkraut and sausage my earliest relationship with mr scherer was that of an errand boy of bringing to him for his approval papers which might not be intrusted to a common messenger his gruffness and brevity disturbed me more than i cared to confess i was pretty sure that he eyed me with the disposition of the selfmade to believe that college educations and good tailors were the heaviest handicaps with which a young man could be burdened and i suspected him of an inimical attitude toward the older families of the city certain men possessed his confidence and he had built as it were a stockade about them sternly keeping the rest of the world outside in theodore watling he had a childlike faith  thus i studied him with a deliberation which it is the purpose of these chapters to confess though he little knew that he was being made the subject of analysis nor did i ever venture to talk with him but held strictly to my role of errand boyeven after the conviction came over me that he was no longer indifferent to my presence the day arrived after some years when he suddenly thrust toward me a big hairy hand that held the document he was examining  who drew this mr paret he demanded  mr ripon i told him  the boyne works were buying up coalmines and this was a contract looking to the purchase of one in putman county provided after a certain period of working the yield and quality should come up to specifications mr scherer requested me to read one of the sections which puzzled him and in explaining it an idea flashed over me  do you mind my making a suggestion mr scherer i ventured  what is it he asked brusquely  i showed him how by the alteration of a few words the difficulty to which he had referred could not only be eliminated but that certain possible penalties might be evaded while the apparent meaning of the section remained unchanged in other words it gave the boyne iron works an advantage that was not contemplated he seized the paper stared at what i had written in pencil on the margin and then stared at me abruptly he began to laugh  ask mr wading what he thinks of it  i intended to provided it had your approval sir i replied  you have my approval mr paret he declared rather cryptically and with the slight german hardening of the vs into which he relapsed at times bring it to the works this afternoon  mr wading agreed to the alteration he looked at me amusedly  yes i think thats an improvement hugh he said i had a feeling that i had gained ground and from this time on i thought i detected a change in his attitude toward me there could be no doubt about the new attitude of mr scherer who would often greet me now with a smile and a joke and sometimes went so far as to ask my opinions then about six months later came the famous ribblevale case that aroused the moral indignation of so many persons among whom was perry blackwood  you know as well as i do hugh how this thing is being manipulated he declared at toms one sunday evening there was nothing the matter with the ribblevale steel companyit was as right as rain before leonard dickinson and grierson and scherer and that crowd you train with began to talk it down at the club oh theyre very compassionate ive heard em dickinson privately doesnt think much of ribblevale paper and pugh the president of the ribblevale seems worried and looks badly its all very clever but id hate to tell you in plain words what id call it  go ahead i challenged him audaciously you havent any proof that the ribblevale wasnt in trouble  i heard mr pugh tell my father the other day it was a dd outrage he couldnt catch up with these rumours and some of his stockholders were liquidating  you dont suppose pugh would want to admit his situation do you i asked  pughs a straight man retorted perry thats more than i can say for any of the other gang saving your presence the unpleasant truth is that scherer and the boyne people want the ribblevale and you ought to know it if you dont he looked at me very hard through the glasses he had lately taken to wearing tom who was lounging by the fire shifted his position uneasily i smiled and took another cigar  i believe ralph is right perry when he calls you a sentimentalist for you theres a tragedy behind every ordinary business transaction the ribblevale people are having a hard time to keep their heads above water and immediately you smell conspiracy dickinson and scherer have been talking it down how about it tom  but tom in these debates was inclined to be noncommittal although it was clear they troubled him  oh dont ask me hughie he said  i suppose i ought to cultivate the scientific point of view and look with impartial interest at this industrial cannibalism returned perry sarcastically eat or be eaten thats what enlightened selfinterest has come to after all ralph would say it is nature the insect world over again the victim duped and crippled before he is devoured and the lawyerhow shall i put itfacilitating the processes of swallowing and digesting  there was no use arguing with perry when he was in this vein  since i am not writing a technical treatise i need not go into the details of the ribblevale suit since it to say that the affair after a while came apparently to a deadlock owing to the impossibility of getting certain definite information from the ribblevale books which had been taken out of the state the treasurer for reasons of his own remained out of the state also the ordinary course of summoning him before a magistrate in another state had naturally been resorted to but the desired evidence was not forthcoming  the trouble is mr wading explained to mr scherer that there is no law in the various states with a sufficient penalty attached that will compel the witness to divulge facts he wishes to conceal  it was the middle of a february afternoon and they were seated in deep leather chairs in one corner of the reading room of the boyne club they had the place to themselves fowndes was there also one leg twisted around the other in familiar fashion a bored look on his long and sallow face mr wading had telephoned to the office for me to bring them some papers bearing on the case  sit down hugh he said kindly  now we have present a genuine legal mind said mr scherer in the playful manner he had adopted of late while i grinned appreciatively and took a chair mr watling presently suggested kidnapping the ribblevale treasurer until he should promise to produce the books as the only way out of what seemed an impasse but mr scherer brought down a huge fist on his knee  i tell you it is no joke watling weve got to win that suit he asserted  thats all very well replied mr watling but were a respectable firm you know we havent had to resort to safeblowing as yet  mr scherer shrugged his shoulders as much as to say it were a matter of indifference to him what methods were resorted to mr watlings eyes met mine his glance was amused yet i thought i read in it a query as to the advisability in my presence of going too deeply into the question of ways and means i may have been wrong at any rate its sudden effect was to embolden me to give voice to an idea that had begun to simmer in my mind that excited me and yet i had feared to utter it this look of my chiefs and the lighter tone the conversation had taken decided me  why wouldnt it be possible to draw up a bill to fit the situation i inquired  mr wading started  what do you mean he asked quickly  all three looked at me i felt the blood come into my face but it was too late to draw back  wellthe legislature is in session and since as mr watling says there is no sufficient penalty in other states to compel the witness to produce the information desired why not draw up a bill andand have it passed i paused for breathimposing a sufficient penalty on home corporations in the event of such evasions the ribblevale steel company is a home corporation  i had shot my bolt there followed what was for me an anxious silence while the three of them continued to stare at me mr watling put the tips of his fingers together and i became aware that he was not offended that he was thinking rapidly  by george why not fowndes he demanded  well said fowndes theres an element of risk in such a proceeding i need not dwell upon  risk cried the senior partner vigorously theres risk in everything theyll howl of course but they howl anyway and nobody ever listens to them theyll say its special legislation and the pilot will print sensational editorials for a few days but what of it all of that has happened before i tell you if we cant see those books well lose the suit thats in black and white and as a matter of justice were entitled to know what we want to know  there might be two opinions as to that observed fowndes with his sardonic smile  mr watling paid no attention to this remark he was already deep in thought it was characteristic of his mind to leap forward seize a suggestion that often appeared chimerical to a man like fowndes and turn it into an accomplished fact i believe youve hit it hugh he said we neednt bother about the powers of the courts in other states well put into this bill an appeal to our court for an order on the clerk to compel the witness to come before the court and testify and well provide for a special commissioner to take depositions in the state where the witness is if the officers of a home corporation who are outside of the state refuse to testify the penalty will be that the ration goes into the hands of a receiver  fowndes whistled  thats going some he said  well weve got to go some how about it scherer  even mr scherers brown eyes were snapping  we have got to win that suit watling  we were all excited even fowndes i think though he remained expressionless ours was the tense excitement of primitive man in chase the quarry which had threatened to elude us was again in view and not unlikely to fall into our hands add to this feeling on my part the thrill that it was i who had put them on the scent i had all the sensations of an aspiring young brave who for the first time is admitted to the councils of the tribe  it ought to be a popular bill too mr schemer was saying with a smile of ironic appreciation at the thought of demagogues advocating it we should have one of lawlers friends introduce it  oh we shall have it properly introduced replied mr wading  it may come back at us suggested fowndes pessimistically the boyne iron works is a home corporation too if i am not mistaken  the boyne iron works has the firm of wading fowndes and ripon behind it asserted mr scherer with what struck me as a magnificent faith  you mustnt forget paret mr watling reminded him with a wink at me  we had risen mr scherer laid a hand on my arm  no no i do not forget him he will not permit me to forget him  a remark i thought that betrayed some insight into my character mr watling called for pen and paper and made then and there a draft of the proposed bill for no time was to be lost it was dark when we left the club and i recall the elation i felt and strove to conceal as i accompanied my chief back to the office the stenographers and clerks were gone alone in the library we got down the statutes and set to work to perfect the bill from the rough draft on which mr fowndes had written his suggestions i felt that a complete yet subtle change had come over my relationship with mr watling  in the midst of our labours he asked me to call up the attorney for the railroad mr gorse was still at his office  hello is that you miller mr watling said this is wading when can i see you for a few minutes this evening yes i am leaving for washington at nine thirty eight oclock all right ill be there  it was almost eight before he got the draft finished to his satisfaction and i had picked it out on the typewriter as i handed it to him my chief held it a moment gazing at me with an odd smile  you seem to have acquired a good deal of useful knowledge here and there hugh he observed  ive tried to keep my eyes open mr watling i said  well he said there are a great many things a young man practising law in these days has to learn for himself and if i hadnt given you credit for some cleverness i shouldnt have wanted you here theres only one way to look atat these matters we have been discussing my boy thats the commonsense way and if a man doesnt get that point of view by himself nobody can teach it to him i neednt enlarge upon it  no sir i said  he smiled again but immediately became serious  if mr gorse should approve of this bill im going to send you down to the capitaltonight can you go  i nodded  i want you to look out for the bill in the legislature of course there wont be much to do except to stand by but you will get a better idea of what goes on down there  i thanked him and told him i would do my best  im sure of that he replied now its time to go to see gorse  the legal department of the railroad occupied an entire floor of the corn bank building i had often been there on various errands having on occasions delivered sealed envelopes to mr gorse himself approaching him in the ordinary way through a series of offices but now following mr watling through the dimly lighted corridor we came to a door on which no name was painted and which was presently opened by a stenographer there was in the proceeding a touch of mystery that revived keenly my boyish love for romance brought back the days when i had been in turn captain kidd and ali baba  i have never realized more strongly than in that moment the psychological force of prestige little by little for five years an estimate of the extent of miller gorses power had been coming home to me and his features stood in my mind for his particular kind of power he was a tremendous worker and often remained in his office until ten and eleven at night he dismissed the stenographer by the wave of a hand which seemed to thrust her bodily out of the room  hello miller said mr watling  hello theodore replied mr gorse  this is paret of my office  i know said mr gorse and nodded toward me i was impressed by the felicity with which a cartoonist of the pilot had once caricatured him by the use of curved lines the circle of the heavy eyebrows ended at the wide nostrils the mouth was a crescent but bowed downwards the heavy shoulders were rounded indeed the only straight line to be discerned about him was that of his hair black as bitumen banged across his forehead even his polished porphyry eyes were constructed on some curvilinear principle and never seemed to focus it might be said of mr gorse that he had an overwhelming impersonality one could never be quite sure that ones words reached the mark  in spite of the intimacy which i knew existed between them in my presence at least mr gorses manner was little different with mr watling than it was with other men mr wading did not seem to mind he pulled up a chair close to the desk and began without any preliminaries to explain his errand  its about the ribblevale affair he said you know we have a suit  gorse nodded  weve got to get at the books millerthats all there is to it i told you so the other day well weve found out a way i think  he thrust his hand in his pocket while the railroad attorney remained impassive and drew out the draft of the bill mr gorse read it then read it over again and laid it down in front of him  well he said  i want to put that through both houses and have the governors signature to it by the end of the week  it seems a little raw at first sight theodore said mr gorse with the suspicion of a smile  my chief laughed a little  its not half so raw as some things i might mention that went through like greased lightning he replied what can they do i believe it will hold water tallants and most of the other newspapers in the state wont print a line about it and only socialists and populists read the pilot theyre disgruntled anyway the point is theres no other way out for us just think a moment bearing in mind what ive told you about the case and youll see it  mr gorse took up the paper again and read the draft over  you know as well as i do miller how dangerous it is to leave this ribblevale business at loose ends the carlisle steel people and the lake shore road are after the ribblevale company and we cant afford to run any risk of their getting it its logically a part of the boyne interests as scherer says and dickinson is ready with the money for the reorganization if the carlisle people and the lake shore get it the product will be shipped out by the l and g and the railroad will lose what would barbour say  mr barbour as i have perhaps mentioned was the president of the railroad and had his residence in the other great city of the state he was then i knew in the west  weve got to act now insisted mr watling thats open and shut if you have any other plan i wish youd trot it out if not i want a letter to paul varney and the governor im going to send paret down with them on the night train  it was clear to me then in the discussion following that mr watlings gift of persuasion though great was not the determining factor in mr gorses decision he too possessed boldness though he preferred caution nor did the friendship between the two enter into the transaction i was impressed more strongly than ever with the fact that a lawsuit was seldom a mere private affair between two persons or corporations but involved a chain of relationships and nine times out of ten that chain led up to the railroad which nearly always was vitally interested in these legal contests half an hour of masterly presentation of the situation was necessary before mr gorse became convinced that the introduction of the bill was the only way out for all concerned  well i guess youre right theodore he said at length whereupon he seized his pen and wrote off two notes with great rapidity these he showed to mr watling who nodded and returned them they were folded and sealed and handed to me one was addressed to colonel paul varney and the other to the hon w w trulease governor of the state  you can trust this young man demanded mr gorse  i think so replied mr watling smiling at me the bill was his own idea  the railroad attorney wheeled about in his chair and looked at me looked around me would better express it with his indefinite encompassing yet inclusive glance i had riveted his attention and from henceforth i knew i should enter into his calculations he had made for me a compartment in his mind  his own idea he repeated  i merely suggested it i was putting in when he cut me short  arent you the son of matthew paret  yes i said  he gave me a queer glance the significance of which i left untranslated my excitement was too great to analyze what he meant by this mention of my father  when we reached the sidewalk my chief gave me a few parting instructions  i need scarcely say hugh he added that your presence in the capital should not be advertised as connected with thislegislation they will probably attribute it to us in the end but if youre reasonably careful theyll never be able to prove it and theres no use in putting our cards on the table at the beginning  no indeed sir i agreed  he took my hand and pressed it  good luck he said i know youll get along all right     book 2     x  this was not my first visit to the state capital indeed some of that recondite knowledge in which i took a pride had been gained on the occasions of my previous visits rising and dressing early i beheld out of the car window the broad shallow river glinting in the morning sunlight the dome of the state house against the blue of the sky even at that early hour groups of the gentlemen who made our laws were scattered about the lobby of the potts house standing or seated within easy reach of the gaily coloured cuspidors that protected the marble floor heavyjawed workers from the cities mingled with moonfaced but astute countrymen who manipulated votes amongst farms and villages fat or cadaverous irish german or american all bore in common a certain indefinable stamp having eaten my breakfast in a large diningroom that resounded with the clatter of dishes i directed my steps to the apartment occupied from year to year by colonel paul barney generalissimo of the railroad on the legislative battlefielda position that demanded a certain uniqueness of genius  how do you do sir he said in a guarded but courteous tone as he opened the door i entered to confront a group of three or four figures silent and rather hostile seated in a haze of tobacco smoke around a marbletopped table on it reposed a bible attached to a chain  you probably dont remember me colonel i said my name is pared and im associated with the firm of watling fowndes and ripon  his air of marginalityheightened by a grey moustache and goatee a la napoleon thirdvanished instantly he became hospitable ingratiating  whywhy certainly you were down heah with mr fowndes two years ago the colonel spoke with a slight southern accent to be sure sir ive had the honour of meeting your father mr norris of north haven meet mr paretone of our rising lawyers i shook hands with them all and sat down opening his long coat colonel varney revealed two rows of cigars suggesting cartridges in a belt these he proceeded to hand out as he talked im glad to see you here mr paret you must stay awhile and become acquainted with the men whoahemare shaping the destinies of a great state it would give me pleasure to escort you about  i thanked him i had learned enough to realize how important are the amenities in politics and business the colonel did most of the conversing he could not have filled with efficiency and ease the important post that was his had it not been for the endless fund of humorous anecdotes at his disposal one by one the visitors left each assuring me of his personal regard the colonel closed the door softly turning the key in the lock there was a sly look in his black eyes as he took a chair in proximity to mine  well mr paret he asked softly whats up  without further ado i handed him mr gorses letter and another mr watling had given me for him which contained a copy of the bill he read these laid them on the table glancing at me again stroking his goatee the while he chuckled  by gum he exclaimed i take off my hat to theodore watling always did he became contemplative it can be done mr paret but its going to take some careful driving sir some reaching out and flicking em when they rar and buck paul varneys never been stumped yet just as soon as this is introduced well have gates and armstrong down heretheyre the ribblevale attorneys arent they i thought soand the best legal talent they can hire and theyll round up all the disgruntled fellows you knowthat aint friendly to the railroad weve got to do it quick mr paret gorse gave you a letter to the governor didnt he  yes i said  well come along ill pass the word around among the boys just to let em know what to expect his eyes glittered again ive been following this ribblevale business he added and i understand leonard dickinsons all ready to reorganize that company when the time comes he ought to let me in for a little on the ground floor  i did not venture to make any promises for mr dickinson  i reckon its just as well if you were to meet me at the governors office the colonel added reflectively and the hint was not lost on me its better not to let em find out any sooner than they have to where this thing comes fromyou understand he looked at his watch how would nine oclock do ill be there with trulease when you comeby accident you understand of course hell be reasonable but when they get to be governors they have little notions you know and youve got to indulge em flatter em a little it doesnt hurt for when they get their backs up it only makes more trouble  he put on a soft black felt hat and departed noiselessly  at nine oclock i arrived at the state house and was ushered into a great square room overlooking the park the governor was seated at a desk under an elaborate chandelier and sure enough colonel varney was there beside him making barely perceptible signals  it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance mr paret said mr trulease your name is a familiar one in your city sir and i gather from your card that you are associated with my good friend theodore watling  i acknowledged it i was not a little impressed by the perfect blend of cordiality democratic simplicity and impressiveness mr trulease had achieved for he had managed in the course of a long political career to combine in exact proportions these elements which in the public mind should up the personality of a chief executive momentarily he overcame the feeling of superiority with which i had entered his presence neutralized the sense i had of being associated now with the higher powers which had put him where he was for i knew all about his record  youre acquainted with colonel varney he inquired  yes governor ive met the colonel i said  well i suppose your firm is getting its share of business these days mr trulease observed i acknowledged it was and after discussing for a few moments the remarkable growth of my native city the governor tapped on his desk and inquired what he could do for me i produced the letter from the attorney for the railroad the governor read it gravely  ah he said from mr gorse a copy of the proposed bill was enclosed and the governor read that also hemmed and hawed a little turned and handed it to colonel varney who was sitting with a detached air smoking contemplatively a vacant expression on his face what do you think of this colonel  whereupon the colonel tore himself away from his reflections  whats that governor  mr gorse has called my attention to what seems to him a flaw in our statutes an inability to obtain testimony from corporations whose books are elsewhere and who may thus evade he says to a certain extent the sovereign will of our state  the colonel took the paper with an admirable air of surprise adjusted his glasses and became absorbed in reading clearing his throat once or twice and emitting an exclamation  well if you ask me governor he said at length all i can say is that i am astonished somebody didnt think of this simple remedy before now many times sir have i seen justice defeated because we had no such legislation as this  he handed it back the governor studied it once more and coughed  does the penalty he inquired seem to you a little severe  no sir replied the colonel emphatically perhaps it is because i am anxious as a citizen to see an evil abated i have had an intimate knowledge of legislation sir for more than twenty years in this state and in all that time i do not remember to have seen a bill more concisely drawn or better calculated to accomplish the ends of justice indeed i often wondered why this very penalty was not imposed foreign magistrates are notoriously indifferent as to affairs in another state than their own rather than go into the hands of a receiver i venture to say that hereafter if this bill is made a law the necessary testimony will be forthcoming  the governor read the bill through again  if it is introduced colonel he said the legislature and the people of the state ought to have it made clear to them that its aim is to remedy an injustice a misunderstanding on this point would be unfortunate  most unfortunate governor  and of course added the governor now addressing me it would be improper for me to indicate what course i shall pursue in regard to it if it should come to me for my signature yet i may go so far as to say that the defect it seeks to remedy seems to me a real one come in and see me mr paret when you are in town and give my cordial regards to mr watling  so gravely had the farce been carried on that i almost laughed despite the fact that the matter in question was a serious one for me the governor held out his hand and i accepted my dismissal  i had not gone fifty steps in the corridor before i heard the colonels voice in my ear  we had to give him a little rope to go through with his act he whispered confidentially but hell sign it all right and now if youll excuse me mr paret ill lay a few mines see you at the hotel sir  thus he indicated delicately that it would be better for me to keep out of sight on my way to the potts house the bizarre elements in the situation struck me again with considerable force it seemed so ridiculous so puerile to have to go through with this political farce in order that a natural economic evolution might be achieved without doubt the development of certain industries had reached a stage where the units in competition had become too small when a greater concentration of capital was necessary curiously enough in this mental argument of justification i left out all consideration of the size of the probable profits to mr scherer and his friends profits and brains went together and since the almighty did not limit the latter why should man attempt to limit the former we were playing for high but justifiable stakes and i resented the comedy which an hypocritical insistence on the forms of democracy compelled us to go through it seemed unworthy of men who controlled the destinies of state and nation the point of view however was consoling as the day wore on i sat in the colonels room admiring the skill with which he conducted the campaign a green country lawyer had been got to introduce the bill it had been expedited to the committee on the judiciary which would have an executive session immediately after dinner i had ventured to inquire about the hearings  there wont be any hearings sir the colonel assured me we own that committee from top to bottom  indeed by four oclock in the afternoon the message came that the committee had agreed to recommend the bill  shortly after that the first flurry occurred there came a knock at the door followed by the entrance of a stocky irish american of about forty years of age whose black hair was plastered over his forehead his seablue eyes had a stormy look  hello jim said the colonel i was just wondering where you were  sure you must have been replied the gentleman sarcastically  but the colonels geniality was unruffled  mr maker he said you ought to know mr paret mr maker is the representative from ward five of your city and we can always count on him to do the right thing even if he is a democrat how about it jim  mr maker relighted the stump of his cigar  take a fresh one jim said the colonel opening a bureau drawer  mr maker took two  say colonel he demanded whats this bill that went into the judiciary this morning  what bill asked the colonel blandly  so you think i aint on mr maker inquired  the colonel laughed  where have you been jim  ive been up to the city seem my wifethats where ive been  the colonel smiled as at a harmless fiction  well if you werent here i dont see what right youve got to complain i never leave my good democratic friends on the outside do i  thats all right replied mr maker doggedly im on im here now and that bill in the judiciary doesnt pass without me i guess i can stop it too how about a thousand apiece for five of us boys  youre pretty good at a joke jim remarked the colonel stroking his goatee  maybe youre looking for a little publicity in this here game retorted mr maker darkly say colonel aint we always treated the railroad on the level  jim asked the colonel gently didnt i always take care of you  he had laid his hand on the shoulder of mr maker who appeared slightly mollified and glanced at a massive silver watch  well ill be dropping in about eight oclock was his significant reply as he took his leave  i guess well have to grease the wheels a little the colonel remarked to me and gazed at the ceiling  the telegram apropos of the ward five leader was by no means the only cipher message i sent back during my stay i had not needed to be told that the matter in hand would cost money but mr watlings parting instruction to me had been to take the colonels advice as to specific sums and obtain confirmation from fowndes nor was it any surprise to me to find democrats on intimate terms with such a stout republican as the colonel some statesman is said to have declared that he knew neither easterners nor westerners northerners nor southerners but only americans so colonel varney recognized neither democrats nor republicans in our legislature party divisions were sunk in a greater loyalty to the railroad  at the colonels suggestion i had laid in a liberal supply of cigars and whiskey the scene in his room that evening suggested a session of a sublimated grand lodge of some secret order such were the mysterious comings and goings knocks and suspenses one after another the important men duly appeared and were introduced the colonel supplying the light touch  why cuss me if it isnt billy mr paret i want you to shake hands with mr donovan the floor leader of the opposition sir mr donovan has had the habit of coming up here for a friendly chat ever since he first came down to the legislature how long is it billy  i guess its nigh on to fifteen years colonel  fifteen years echoed the colonel and hes so good a democrat it hasnt changed his politics a particle  mr donovan grinned in appreciation of this thrust helped himself liberally from the bottle on the mantel and took a seat on the bed we had a friendly chat  thus i made the acquaintance also of the hon joseph mecklin speaker of the house who unbent in the most flattering way on learning my identity  mr parets here on that little matter representing watling fowndes and ripon the colonel explained and it appeared that mr mecklin knew all about the little matter and that the mention of the firm of watling fowndes and ripon had a magical effect in these parts the president of the senate the hon lafe giddings went so far as to say that he hoped before long to see mr watling in washington by no means the least among our callers was the hon fitch truesdale editor of the st helens messenger whose editorials were of the trite effectiveness that is taken widely for wisdom and were assiduously copied every week by other state papers and labeled mr truesdales common sense at countless firesides in our state he was known as the spokesman of the plain man who was blissfully ignorant of the fact that mr truesdale was owned body and carcass by mr cyrus ridden the principal manufacturer of st helens and a director in several subsidiary lines of the railroad in the legislature the hon fitchs function was that of the moderate counsellor and bellwether for new members hence nothing could have been more fitting than the choice of that gentleman for the honour of moving on the morrow that bill no 709 ought to pass  mr truesdale reluctantly consented to accept a small loan that would help to pay the mortgage on his new press  when the last of the gathering had departed about one oclock in the morning i had added considerably to my experience gained a pretty accurate idea of who was who in the legislature and politics of the state and established relationshipsas the colonel reminded melikely to prove valuable in the future it seemed only gracious to congratulate him on his management of the affairso far he appeared pleased and squeezed my hand  well sir it did require a little delicacy of touch and if i do say it myself it hasnt been botched he admitted there aint an outsider as far as i can learn who has caught on to the nigger in the woodpile thats the great thing to keep em ignorant as long as possible you understand they yell bloody murder when they do find out but generally its too late if a bills been handled right  i found myself speculating as to who the outsiders might be no ribblevale attorneys were on the spot as yetof that i was satisfied in the absence of these who were the opposition it seemed to me as though i had interviewed that day every man in the legislature  i was very tired but when i got into bed it was impossible to sleep my eyes smarted from the tobacco smoke and the events of the day in disorderly manner kept running through my head the tide of my exhilaration had ebbed and i found myself struggling against a revulsion caused apparently by the contemplation of colonel varney and his associates the instruments in brief by which our triumph over our opponents was to be effected and that same idea which when launched amidst the surroundings of the boyne club had seemed so brilliant now took on an aspect of tawdriness another thought intruded itselfthat of mr pugh the president of the ribblevale company my father had known him and some years before i had traveled halfway across the state in his company his kindliness had impressed me he had spent a large part of his business life i knew in building up the ribblevale and now it was to be wrested from him he was to be set aside perhaps forced to start all over again when old age was coming on in vain i accused myself of sentimentality and summoned all my arguments to prove that in commerce efficiency must be the only test the image of mr pugh would not down  i got up and turned on the light and took refuge in a novel i had in my bag presently i grew calmer i had chosen i had succeeded and now that i had my finger at last on the nerve of power it was no time to weaken  it was halfpast six when i awoke and went to the window relieved to find that the sun had scattered my morbid fancies with the darkness and i speculated as i dressed whether the thing called conscience were not after all a matter of nerves i went downstairs through the tobaccostale atmosphere of the lobby into the fresh air and sparkly sunlight of the mild february morning and leaving the business district i reached the residence portion of the little town the front steps of some of the comfortable houses were being swept by industrious servant girls and out of the chimneys twisted fantastically rich blue smoke the bare branches of the trees were silvergrey against the sky gaining at last an oldfashioned wooden bridge i stood for awhile gazing at the river over the shallows of which the spendthrift hand of nature had flung a shower of diamonds and i reflected that the world was for the strong for him who dared reach out his hand and take what it offered it was not money we coveted we americans but power the selfexpression conferred by power a single experience such as i had had the night before would since to convince any sane man that democracy was a failure that the worldold principle of aristocracy would assert itself that the attempt of our ancestors to curtail political power had merely resulted in the growth of another and greater economic power that bade fair to be limitless as i walked slowly back into town i felt a reluctance to return to the noisy hotel and finding myself in front of a little restaurant on a side street i entered it there was but one other customer in the place and he was seated on the far side of the counter with a newspaper in front of him and while i was ordering my breakfast i was vaguely aware that the newspaper had dropped and that he was looking at me in the slight interval that elapsed before my brain could register his identity i experienced a distinct shock of resentment a sense of the reintrusion of an antagonistic value at a moment when it was most unwelcome  the man had risen and was coming around the counter he was hermann krebs  paret i heard him say  you here i exclaimed  he did not seem to notice the lack of cordiality in my tone he appeared so genuinely glad to see me again that i instantly became rather ashamed of my ill nature  yes im herein the legislature he informed me  a solon  exactly he smiled and you he inquired  oh im only a spectator down here for a day or two  he was still lanky his clothes gave no evidence of an increased prosperity but his complexion was good his skin had cleared i was more than ever baked by a resolute good humour a simplicity that was not innocence a whimsical touch seemingly indicative of a state of mind that refused to take too seriously certain things on which i set store what right had he to be contented with life  well i too am only a spectator here he laughed im neither fish flesh nor fowl nor good red herring  you were going into the law werent you i asked i remember you said something about it that day we met at beverly farms  yes i managed it after all then i went back home to elkington to try to make a living  but somehow i have never thought of you as being likely to develop political aspirations krebs i said  i should say not he exclaimed  yet here you are launched upon a political career how did it happen  oh im not worrying about the career he assured me i got here by accident and im afraid it wont happen again in a hurry you see the hands in those big mills we have in elkington sprang a surprise on the machine and the first thing i knew i was nominated for the legislature a committee came to my boardinghouse and told me and there was the deuce to pay right off the railroad politicians turned in and worked for the democratic candidate of course and the hutchinses who own the mills tried through emissaries to intimidate their operatives  and then i asked  wellim here he said  wouldnt you be accomplishing more i inquired if you hadnt antagonized the hutchinses  it depends upon what you mean by accomplishment he answered so mildly that i felt more rued than ever  well from what you say i suppose youre going in for reform that these workmen up at elkington are not satisfied with their conditions and imagine you can help to better them now provided the conditions are not as good as they might be how are you going to improve them if you find yourself isolated here as you say  in other words i should cooperate with colonel varney and other disinterested philanthropists he supplied and i realized that i was losing my temper  well what can you do i inquired defiantly  i can find out whats going on he said i have already learned something by the way  and then i asked wondering whether the implication were personal  then i can helpdisseminate the knowledge i may be wrong but i have an idea that when the people of this country learn how their legislatures are conducted they will want to change things  thats right echoed the waiter who had come up with my griddlecakes and youre the man to tell em mr krebs  it will need several thousand of us to do that im afraid said krebs returning his smile  my distaste for the situation became more acute but i felt that i was thrown on the defensive i could not retreat now  i think you are wrong i declared when the waiter had departed to attend to another customer the people the great majority of them at least are indifferent they dont want to be bothered with politics there will always be labour agitation of coursethe more wages those fellows get the more they want we pay the highest wages in the world today and the standard of living is higher in this country than anywhere else theyd ruin our prosperity if wed let em  how about the thousands of families who dont earn enough to live decently even in times of prosperity inquired krebs  its hard ill admit but the inefficient and the shiftless are bound to suffer no matter what form of government you adopt  you talk about standards of livingi could show you some examples of standards to make your heart sick he said what you dont realize perhaps is that low standards help to increase the inefficient of whom you complain  he smiled rather sadly the prosperity you are advocating he added after a moment is a mere fiction it is gorging the few at the expense of the many and what is being done in this country is to store up an explosive gas that some day will blow your superstructure to atoms if you dont wake up in time  isnt that a rather onesided view too i suggested  ive no doubt it may appear so but take the proceedings in this legislature ive no doubt you know something about them and that you would maintain they are justified on account of the indifference of the public and of other reasons but i can cite an instance that is simply legalized thieving for the first time a note of indignation crept into krebss voice last night i discovered by a mere accident in talking to a man who came in on a late train that a bill introduced yesterday which is being rushed through the judiciary committee of the housean apparently innocent little billwill enable if it becomes a law the boyne iron works of your city to take possession of the ribblevale steel company lock stock and barrel and i am told it was conceived by a lawyer who claims to be a respectable member of his profession and who has extraordinary ability theodore watling  krebs put his hand in his pocket and drew out a paper heres a copy of ithouse bill 709 his expression suddenly changed perhaps mr watling is a friend of yours  im with his firm i replied  krebss fingers closed over the paper crumpling it  oh then you know about this he said he was putting the paper back into his pocket when i took it from him but my adroitness so carefully schooled seemed momentarily to have deserted me what should i say it was necessary to decide quickly  dont you take rather aprejudiced view of this krebs i said upon my word i cant see why you should accept a rumour running around the lobbies that mr watling drafted this bill for a particular purpose  he was silent but his eyes did not leave my face  why should any sensible man a member of the legislature take stock in that kind of gossip i insisted why not judge this bill by its face without heeding a cock and bull story as to how it may have originated it is a good bill or a bad bill lets see what it says  i read it  so far as i can see it is legislation which we ought to have had long ago and tends to compel a publicity in corporation affairs that is much needed to put a stop to practices which every decent citizen deplores  he drew the paper out of my hand  you neednt go on paret he told me its no use  well im sorry we dont agree i said and got up i left him twisting the paper in his fingers  beside the clerks desk in the potts house relating one of his anecdotes i spied colonel varney and managed presently to draw him upstairs to his room whats the matter he asked  do you know a man named krebs in the house i said  from elkington why thats the man the hutchinses let slip throughthe hutchinses who own the mills over there the agitators put up a job on them the colonel was no longer the genial and social purveyor of anecdotes he had become tense alert suspicious whats he up to  hes found out about this bill i replied  how  i dont know but someone told him that it originated in our office and that we were going to use it in our suit against the ribblevale  i related the circumstances of my running across krebs speaking of having known him at harvard colonel varney uttered an oath and strode across to the window where he stood looking down into the street from between the lace curtains  well have to attend to him right off he said  i was surprised to find myself resenting the imputation and deeply im afraid hes one of those who cant be attended to i answered  you mean that hes in the employ of the ribblevale people the colonel inquired  i dont mean anything of the kind i retorted with more heat perhaps than i realized the colonel looked at me queerly  thats all right mr paret of course i dont want to question your judgment sir and you say hes a friend of yours  i said i knew him at college  but you will pardon me the colonel went on when i tell you that ive had some experience with that breed and i have yet to see one of em you couldnt come to terms with in some wayin some way he added significantly i did not pause to reflect that the colonels attitude from his point of view yes and from minehad i not adopted it was the logical one in that philosophy every man had his price or his weakness yet such is the inconsistency of human nature i was now unable to contemplate this attitude with calmness  mr krebs is a lawyer has he accepted a pass from the railroad i demanded knowing the custom of that corporation of conferring this delicate favour on the promising young talent in my profession  i reckon hes never had the chance said mr varney  well has he taken a pass as a member of the legislature  noi remember looking that up when he first came down sent that back if i recall the matter correctly colonel varney went to a desk in the corner of the room unlocked it drew forth a black book and running his fingers through the pages stopped at the letter k yes sent back his legislative pass but ive known em to do that when they were holding out for something more there must be somebody who can get close to him  the colonel ruminated awhile then he strode to the door and called out to the group of men who were always lounging in the hall  tell alf young i want to see him fred  i waited by no means free from uneasiness and anxiety from a certain lack of selfrespect that was unfamiliar mr young the colonel explained was a legal light in galesburg near elkingtonthe railroad lawyer there and when at last mr young appeared he proved to be an oily gentleman of about forty inclining to stoutness with one of those blue shaven faces  want me colonel he inquired blithely when the door had closed behind him and added obsequiously when introduced to me glad to meet you mr paret my regards to mr watling when you go back  alf demanded the colonel what do you know of this fellow krebs  mr young laughed krebs was nutty he declaredthat was all there was to it  wont helisten to reason  its been tried colonel say he wouldnt know a hundreddollar bill if you showed him one  what does he want  oh somethingthats sure they all want something mr young shrugged his shoulder expressively and by a skillful manipulation of his lips shifted his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other without raising his hands but it aint money i guess hes got a notion that later on the labour unionsll send him to the united states senate some day hes no slouch either when it comes to law i can tell you that  nono flaw in hisrecord colonel varneys agate eyes sought those of mr young meaningly  thats been tried too declared the galesburg attorney say you can believe it or not but weve never dug anything up so far hes been too slick for us i guess  well exclaimed the colonel at length let him squeal and be dd he cant do any more than make a noise only i hoped wed be able to grease this thing along and slide it through the senate this afternoon before they got wind of it  hell squeal all right until you smother him mr young observed  well smother him some day replied the colonel savagely  mr young laughed  but as i made my way toward the state house i was conscious of a feeling of relief i had no sooner gained a front seat in the gallery of the house of representatives when the members rose the senate marched gravely in the speaker stopped jesting with the chaplain and over the chaplains face came suddenly an agonized expression folding his hands across his stomach he began to call on god with terrific fervour in an intense and resounding voice i was struck suddenly by the irony of it all why have a legislature when colonel paul varney was so efficient the legislature was a mere sop to democratic prejudice to pray over it heightened the travesty suppose there were a god after all not necessarily the magnified monarch to whom these pseudodemocrats prayed but an intelligent force that makes for righteousness how did he or it like to be trifled with in this way and if he existed would not his disgust be immeasurable as he contemplated that unctuous figure in the prince albert coat who pretended to represent him  as the routine business began i searched for krebs to find him presently at a desk beside a window in the rear of the hall making notes on a paper there was confessedly little satisfaction in the thought that the man whose gaunt features i contemplated was merely one of those impractical idealists who beat themselves to pieces against the forces that sway the world and must forever sway it i should be compelled to admit that he represented something unique in that assembly if he had the courage to get up and oppose house bill 709 i watched him narrowly the suggestion intruded itselfperhaps he had been seen as the colonel expressed it i repudiated it i grew impatient feverish the monotonous reading of the clerk was interrupted now and then by the sharp tones of the speaker assigning his various measures to this or that committee unless objection is offered while the members moved about and murmured among themselves krebs had stopped making notes he was looking out of the window at last without any change of emphasis in his droning voice the clerk announced the recommendation of the committee on judiciary that house bill 709 ought to pass  down in front a man had risen from his seatthe felicitous mr truesdale glancing around at his fellowmembers he then began to explain in the impressive but conversational tone of one whose counsels are in the habit of being listened to that this was merely a little measure to remedy a flaw in the statutes mr truesdale believed in corporations when corporations were good and this bill was calculated to make them good to put an end to jugglery and concealment our great state he said should be in the forefront of such wise legislation which made for justice and a proper publicity but the bill in question was of greater interest to lawyers than to laymen a committee composed largely of lawyers had recommended it unanimously and he was sure that no opposition would develop in the house in order not to take up their time he asked therefore that it be immediately put on its second and third reading and allowed to pass  he sat down and i looked at krebs could he could any man any lawyer have the presumption to question such an obviously desirable measure to arraign the united judgment of the committees legal talent such was the note mr truesdale so admirably struck as though fascinated i continued to gaze at krebs i hated him i desired to see him humiliated and yet amazingly i found myself wishing with almost equal vehemence that he would be true to himself he was risingslowly timidly i thought his hand clutching his desk lid his voice sounding wholly inadequate as he addressed the speaker the speaker hesitated his tone palpably supercilious  the gentleman fromfrom elkington mr krebs  there was a craning of necks a staring a tittering i burned with vicarious shame as krebs stood there awkwardly his hand still holding the desk there were cries of louder when he began some picked up their newspapers while others started conversations the speaker rapped with his gavel and i failed to hear the opening words krebs paused and began again his speech did not at first flow easily  mr speaker i rise to protest against this bill which in my opinion is not so innocent as the gentleman from st helens would have the house believe it is on a par indeed with other legislation that in past years has been engineered through this legislature under the guise of beneficent law no not on a par it is the most arrogant the most monstrous example of special legislation of them all and while i do not expect to be able to delay its passage much longer than the time i shall be on my feet  then why not sit down came a voice just audible  as he turned swiftly toward the offender his profile had an eaglelike effect that startled me seemingly realizing a new quality in the man it was as though he had needed just the stimulus of that interruption to electrify and transform him his awkwardness disappeared and if he was a little bombastic a little young he spoke with the fire of conviction  because he cried because i should lose my selfrespect for life if i sat here and permitted the political organization of a railroad the members of which are here under the guise of servants of the people to cow me into silence and if it be treason to mention the name of that railroad in connection with its political tyranny then make the most of it he let go of the desk and tapped the copy of the bill what are the facts the boyne iron works under the presidency of adolf scherer has been engaged in litigation with the ribblevale steel company for some years and this bill is intended to put into the hands of the attorneys for mr scherer certain information that will enable him to get possession of the property gentlemen that is what legal practice has descended to in the hands of respectable lawyers this device originated with the resourceful mr theodore watling and if it had not had the approval of mr miller gorse it would never have got any farther than the judiciary committee it was confided to the skillful care of colonel paul varney to be steered through this legislature as hundreds of other measures have been steered throughwithout unnecessary noise it may be asked why the railroad should bother itself by lending its political organization to private corporations i will tell you because corporations like the boyne corporation are a part of a network of interests these corporations aid the railroad to maintain its monopoly and in return receive rebates  krebs had raised his voice as the murmurs became louder at this point a sharpfaced lawyer from belfast got to his feet and objected that the gentleman from elkington was wasting the time of the house indulging in hearsay his remarks were not germane etc the speaker rapped again with a fine show of impartiality and cautioned the member from elkington  very well replied krebs i have said what i wanted to say on that score and i know it to be the truth and if this house does not find it germane the day is coming when its constituents will  whereupon he entered into a discussion of the bill dissecting it with more calmness with an ability that must have commanded even from some hostile minds an unwilling respect the penalty he said was outrageous hitherto unheard of in lawputting a corporation in the hands of a receiver at the mercy of those who coveted it because one of its officers refused or was unable to testify he might be in china in timbuctoo when the summons was delivered at his last or usual place of abode here was an enormity an exercise of tyrannical power exceeding all bounds a travesty on popular government he ended by pointing out the significance of the fact that the committee had given no hearings by declaring that if the bill became a law it would inevitably react upon the heads of those who were responsible for it  he sat down and there was a flutter of applause from the scattered audience in the gallery  by god thats the only man in the whole place  i was aware for the first time of a neighbour at my sidea solid redfaced man evidently a farmer his trousers were tucked into his boots and his gnarled and powerful hands ingrained with dirt clutched the arms of the seat as he leaned forward  didnt he just naturally lambaste em he cried excitedly theyll down him i guessbut say hes right a man would lose his selfrespect if he didnt let out his mind at them hoss thieves wouldnt he whats that fellows name  i told him  krebs he repeated i want to remember that durned if i dont shake hands with him  his excitement astonished me would the public feel like that if they only knew the speakers gavel had come down like a pistol shot  one warhossas my neighbour called themafter another proceeded to crush the member from elkington it was indeed very skillfully done and yet it was a process from which i did not derive somehow much pleasure colonel varneys army had been magnificently trained to meet just this kind of situation some employed ridicule others declared in impassioned tones that the good name of their state had been wantonly assailed and pointed fervently to portraits on the walls of patriots of the pastsentiments that drew applause from the fickle gallery one gentleman observed that the obsession of a railroad machine was a sure symptom of a certain kind of insanity of which the first speaker had given many other evidences the farmer at my side remained staunch  they cant fool me he said angrily i know em do you see that fellow gettin up to talk now well i could tell you a few things about him all right he comes from glasgow and his names letchworth hes done more harm in his life than all the criminals hes kept out of prisonbelongs to one of the old families down there too  i had indeed remarked letchworths face which seemed to me peculiarly evil its lividity enhanced by a shock of grey hair his method was withering sarcasm and he was clearly unable to control his animus  no champion appeared to support krebs who sat pale and tense while this denunciation of him was going on finally he got the floor his voice trembled a little whether with passion excitement or nervousness it was impossible to say but he contented himself with a brief defiance if the bill passed he declared the men who voted for it the men who were behind it would ultimately be driven from political life by an indignant public he had a higher opinion of the voters of the state than those who accused him of slandering it than those who sat silent and had not lifted their voices against this crime  when the bill was put to a vote he demanded a roll call ten members besides himself were recorded against house bill no 709  in spite of this overwhelming triumph my feelings were not wholly those of satisfaction when i returned to the hotel and listened to the exultations and denunciations of such politicians as letchworth young and colonel varney perhaps an image suggesting hermann krebs as some splendid animal at bay dragged down by the hounds is too strong he had been ingloriously crushed and defeat even for the sake of conviction was not an inspiring spectacle as the chase swept on over his prostrate figure i rapidly regained poise and a sense of proportion a master of life could not permit himself to be tossed about by sentimentality and gradually i grew ashamed of my bad quarter of an hour in the gallery of the house and of the effect of itwhich lingered awhileas of a weakness suddenly revealed which must at all costs be overcome i began to see something dramatic and sensational in krebss performance  the ribblevale steel company was the real quarry after all and such had been the expedition the skill and secrecy with which our affair was conducted that before the ribblevale lawyers could arrive alarmed and breathless the bill had passed the house and their only real chance of halting it had been lost for the railroad controlled the house not by owning the individuals composing it but through the leaders who dominated itmen like letchworth and truesdale these and colonel varney had seen to it that men who had any parliamentary ability had been attended to all save krebs who had proved a surprise there were indeed certain members who although they had railroad passes in their pockets which were regarded as just perquisitesthe railroad being so rich would have opposed the bill if they had felt sufficiently sure of themselves to cope with such veterans as letchworth many of these had allowed themselves to be won over or cowed by the oratory which had crushed krebs  nor did the ribblevale peoplebe it recordedscruple to fight fire with fire their existence of course was at stake and there was no public to appeal to a part of the legal army that rushed to the aid of our adversaries spent the afternoon and most of the night organizing all those who could be induced by one means or another to reverse their sentiments and in searching for the few who had grievances against the existing power the following morning a motion was introduced to reconsider and in the debate that followed krebs still defiant took an active part but the resolution required a twothirds vote and was lost  when the battle was shifted to the senate it was as good as lost the judiciary committee of the august body did indeed condescend to give hearings at which the ribblevale lawyers exhausted their energy and ingenuity without result with only two dissenting votes the bill was calmly passed in vain was the governor besieged entreated threatenedit was said mr trulease had informed protestersso colonel varney gleefully reportedthat he had become fully convinced of the inherent justice of the measure on saturday morning he signed it and it became a law  colonel varney as he accompanied me to the train did not conceal his jubilation  perhaps i ought not to say it mr paret but it couldnt have been done neater thats the art in these little affairs to get em runnin fast to get momentum on em before the other party wakes up and then he cant stop em as he shook hands in farewell he added with more gravity well see each other often sir i guess my very best regards to mr watling  needless to say i had not confided to him the part i had played in originating house bill no 709 now a law of the state but as the train rolled on through the sunny winter landscape a sense of wellbeing of importance and power began to steal through me i was victoriously bearing home my first scalpone which was by no means to be despised it was not until we reached rossiter about five oclock that i was able to get the evening newspapers such was the perfection of the organization of which i might now call myself an integral part that the best publications contained only the barest mentionand that in the legislative newsof the signing of the bill i read with complacency and even with amusement the flaring headlines i had anticipated in mr lawlers pilot  the governor signs it  special legislation forced through by the railroad lobby which will drive honest corporations from this state  ribblevale steel company the victim  it was common talk in the capital the article went on to say that theodore watling himself had drawn up the measure perusing the editorial page my eye fell on the name krebs one member of the legislature above all deserved the gratitude of the people of the statethe member from elkington an unknown man elected in spite of the opposition of the machine he had dared to raise his voice against this iniquity etc etc  we had won that was the essential thing and my legal experience had taught me that victory counts defeat is soon forgotten even the discontented halfbaked and heterogeneous element from which the pilot got its circulation had short memories     xi  the next morning which was sunday i went to mr watlings house in fillmore streeta new residence at that time being admired as the dernier cri in architecture it had a mediaeval look queer dormers in a steep roof of red tiles leaded windows buried deep in walls of rough stone emerging from the recessed vestibule on a level with the street were the watling twins aglow with health dressed in identical costumes of blue they had made their bow to society that winter  why heres hugh said frances doesnt he look pleased with himself  hes come to take us to church said janet  oh hes much too important said frances hes made a killing of some sorthavent you hugh  i rang the bell and stood watching them as they departed reflecting that i was thirtytwo years of age and unmarried mr watling surrounded with newspapers and seated before his library fire glanced up at me with a welcoming smile how had i borne the legislative baptism of fire such i knew was its implication  everything went through according to schedule eh well i congratulate you hugh he said  oh i didnt have much to do with it i answered smiling back at him i kept out of sight  thats an art in itself  i had an opportunity at close range to study the methods of our lawmakers  theyre not particularly edifying mr watling replied but they seem unfortunately to be necessary  such had been my own thought  who is this man krebs he inquired suddenly and why didnt varney get hold of him and make him listen to reason  im afraid it wouldnt have been any use i replied he was in my class at harvard i knew himslightly he worked his way through and had a pretty hard time of it i imagine it affected his ideas  what is he a socialist  something of the sort in theodore watlings vigorous sanityexhaling presence krebss act appeared fantastic ridiculous he has queer notions about a new kind of democracy which he says is coming i think he is the kind of man who would be willing to die for it  what in these days mr watling looked at me incredulously if thats so we must keep an eye on him a sincere fanatic is a good deal more dangerous than a reformer who wants something there are such men he added but they are rare how was the governor trulease he asked suddenly tractable  behaved like a lamb although he insisted upon going through with his little humbug i said  mr watling laughed they always do he observed and waste a lot of valuable time youll find some light cigars in the corner hugh  i sat down beside him and we spent the morning going over the details of the ribblevale suit mr watling delegating to me certain matters connected with it of a kind with which i had not hitherto been entrusted and he spoke again before i left of his intention of taking me into the firm as soon as the affair could be arranged walking homeward with my mind intent upon things to come i met my mother at the corner of lyme street coming from church her face lighted up at sight of me  have you been working today hugh she asked  i explained that i had spent the morning with mr watling  ill tell you a secret mother im going to be taken into the firm  oh my dear im so glad she exclaimed i often think if only your father were alive how happy he would be and how proud of you i wish he could know perhaps he does know  theodore watling had once said to me that the man who can best keep his own counsel is the best counsel for other men to keep i did not go about boasting of the part i had played in originating the now famous bill no 709 the passage of which had brought about the capitulation of the ribblevale steel company to our clients but ralph hambleton knew of it of course  that was a pretty good thing you pulled off hughie he said i didnt think you had it in you  it was rank patronage of course yet i was secretly pleased as the years went on i was thrown more and more with him though in boyhood there had been between us no bond of sympathy about this time he was beginning to increase very considerably the hambleton fortune and a little later i became counsel for the crescent gas and electric company in which he had shrewdly gained a controlling interest even toward the colossal game of modern finance his attitude was characteristically that of the dilettante of the amateur he played it as it were contemptuously even as he had played poker at harvard with a cynical audacity that had a peculiarly disturbing effect upon his companions he bluffed he raised the limit in spite of protests and when he lost one always had the feeling that he would ultimately get his money back twice over at the conferences in the boyne club which he often attended his manner toward mr dickinson and mr scherer and even toward miller gorse was frequently one of thinly veiled amusement at their seriousness i often wondered that they did not resent it but he was a privileged person  his cousin ham durrett whose inheritance was even greater than ralphs had been had also become a privileged person whose comings and goings and more reputable doings were often recorded in the newspapers ham had attained to what gene hollister aptly but inadvertently called notoriety as ralph wittily remarked ham gave to polo and women that which might have gone into high finance he spent much of his time in the east his conduct there and at home would once have created a black scandal in our community but we were gradually leaving our calvinism behind us and growing more tolerant we were ready to forgive much to wealth especially if it was inherited hostesses lamented the fact that ham was wild but they asked him to dinners and dances to meet their daughters  if some moralist better educated and more farseeing than perry blackwood for perry had become a moralist had told these hostesses that hambleton durrett was a victim of our new civilization they would have raised their eyebrows they deplored while they coveted if ham had been told he was a victim of any sort he would have laughed  he enjoyed life he was genial and jovial both lavish and parsimoniousthis latter characteristic being the curious survival of the trait of the ancestors to which he owed his millions he was growing even heavier and decidedly red in the face  perry used to take ralph to task for not saving ham from his iniquities and ralph would reply that ham was going to the devil anyway and not even the devil himself could stop him  you can stop him and you know it perry retorted indignantly  what do you want me to do with him asked ralph convert him to the saintly life i lead  this was a poser  thats a fact sand perry youre no better than he is  i dont know what you mean by better retorted ralph grinning im wiser thats all we had been talking about the ethics of business when perry had switched off to ham i believe at least in restraint of trade ham doesnt believe in restraint of any kind  when therefore the news suddenly began to be circulated in the boyne club that ham was showing a tendency to straighten up surprise and incredulity were genuine he was drinking lessmuch less and it was said that he had severed certain ties that need not again be definitely mentioned the theory of religious regeneration not being tenable it was naturally supposed that he had fallen in love the identity of the unknown lady becoming a fruitful subject of speculation among the feminine portion of society the announcement of the marriage of hambleton durrett would be news of the first magnitude to be absorbed eagerly by the many who had not the honour of his acquaintancecomparable only to that of a devastating flood or a murder mystery or a change in the tariff  being absorbed in affairs that seemed more important the subject did not interest me greatly but one cold sunday afternoon as i made my way in answer to her invitation to see nancy willett i found myself wondering idly whether she might not be by way of making a shrewd guess as to the object of hambletons affections it was well known that he had entertained a hopeless infatuation for her and some were inclined to attribute his later lapses to her lack of response he still called on her and her lectures which she delivered like a great aunt with a recondite knowledge of the world he took meekly but even she had seemed powerless to alter his habits  powell street that happy huntingground of my youth had changed its character become contracted and unfamiliar sooty the mcalerys and other older families who had not decayed with the neighbourhood were rapidly deserting it moving out to the new residence district known as the heights i came to the willett house that too had an air of shabbinessof welltended shabbiness to be sure the stone steps had been scrupulously scrubbed but one of them was cracked clear across and the silver on the polished nameplate was wearing off even the act of pulling the knob of a doorbell was becoming obsolete so used had we grown to pushing porcelain buttons in bright new vestibules as i waited for my summons to be answered it struck me as remarkable that neither nancy nor her father had been contaminated by the shabbiness that surrounded them  she had managed rather marvellously to redeem one room from the oldfashioned severity of the rest of the house the library behind the big parlour it was nancys room eloquent of her daintiness and taste of her essential modernity and luxuriousness and that evening as i was ushered into it this quality of luxuriousness of being able to shut out the disagreeable aspects of life that surrounded and threatened her particularly impressed me she had not lacked opportunities to escape i wondered uneasily as i waited why she had not embraced them i strayed about the room a coal fire burned in the grate the redshaded lamps gave a subdued but cheerful light some impulse led me to cross over to the windows and draw aside the heavy hangings dusk was gathering over that garden bleak and frozen now where we had romped together as children how queer the place seemed how shrivelled once it had had the wide range of a park there still weathering the elements was the oldfashioned latticed summerhouse but the fruittrees that i recalled as clouds of pink and white were gone a touch of poignancy was in these memories i dropped the curtain and turned to confront nancy who had entered noiselessly  well hugh were you dreaming she said  not exactly i replied embarrassed i was looking at the garden  the soot has ruined it my life seems to be one continual struggle against the sootthe blacks as the english call them its a more expressive term they are like an army you know overwhelming in their relentless invasion well do sit down it is nice of you to come youll have some tea wont you  the maid had brought in the tray afternoon tea was still rather a new custom with us more of a ceremony than a meal and as nancy handed me my cup and the thinnest of slices of bread and butter i found the intimacy of the situation a little disquieting her manner was indeed intimate and yet it had the odd and disturbing effect of making her seem more remote as she chatted i answered her perfunctorily while all the time i was asking myself why i had ceased to desire her whether the old longing for her might not returnwas not even now returning i might indeed go far afield to find a wife so suited to me as nancy she had beauty distinction and position she was a woman of whom any man might be proud  i havent congratulated you yet hugh she said suddenly now that you are a partner of mr watlings i hear on all sides that you are on the high road to a great success  of course im glad to be in the firm i admitted  it was a new tack for nancy rather a disquieting one this discussion of my affairs which she had so long avoided or ignored you are getting what you have always wanted arent you  i wondered in some trepidation whether by that word always she was making a deliberate reference to the past  always i repeated rather fatuously  nearly always ever since you have been a man  i was incapable of taking advantage of the opening if it were one she was baffling  a man likes to succeed in his profession of course i said  and you made up your mind to succeed more deliberately than most men i neednt ask you if you are satisfied hugh success seems to agree with youalthough i imagine you will never be satisfied  why do you say that i demanded  i havent known you all your life for nothing i think i know you much better than you know yourself  you havent acted as if you did i exclaimed  she smiled  have you been interested in what i thought about you she asked  that isnt quite fair nancy i protested you havent given me much evidence that you did think about me  have i received much encouragement to do so she inquired  but you havent seemed to inviteyouve kept me at arms length  oh dont fence she cried rather sharply  i had become agitated but her next words gave me a shock that was momentarily paralyzing  i asked you to come here today hugh because i wished you to know that i have made up my mind to marry hambleton durrett  hambleton durrett i echoed stupidly hambleton durrett  why not  have youhave you accepted him  no but i mean to do so  youyou love him  i dont see what right you have to ask  but you just said that you invited me here to talk frankly  no i dont love him  then why in heavens name are you going to marry him  she lay back in her chair regarding me her lips slightly parted all at once the full flavour of her the superfine quality was revealed after years of blindnessnor can i describe the sudden rebellion the revulsion that i experienced hambleton durrett it was an outrage a sacrilege i got up and put my hand on the mantel nancy remained motionless inert her head lying back against the chair could it be that she were enjoying my discomfiture there is no need to confess that i knew next to nothing of women had i been less excited i might have made the discovery that i still regarded them sentimentally certain romantic axioms concerning them garnered from victorian literature passed current in my mind for wisdom and one of these declared that they were prone to remain true to an early love did nancy still care for me the query coming as it did on top of my emotion brought with it a strange and overwhelming perplexity did i really care for her the many years during which i had practised the habit of caution began to exert an inhibiting pressure here was a situation an opportunity suddenly thrust upon me which might never return and which i was utterly unprepared to meet would i be happy with nancy after all her expression was still enigmatic  why shouldnt i marry him she demanded  because hes not good enough for you  good she exclaimed and laughed he loves me he wants me without reservation or calculation there was a sting in this and is he any worse she asked slowly than many others who might be mentioned  no i agreed i did not intend to be led into the thankless and disagreeable position of condemning hambleton durrett but why have you waited all these years if you did not mean to marry a man of ability a man who has made something of himself  a man like you hugh she said gently  i flushed  that isnt quite fair nancy  what are you working for she suddenly inquired straightening up  what any man works for i suppose  ah there you have hit itwhat any man works for in our world powerpersonal power you want to be somebodyisnt that it not the noblest ambition youll have to admitnot the kind of thing we used to dream about when we did dream well when we find we cant realize our dreams we take the next best thing and i fail to see why you should blame me for taking it when you yourself have taken it hambleton durrett can give it to me hell accept me on my own terms he wont interfere with me i shant be disillusionizedand i shall have a position which i could not hope to have if i remained unmarried a very marked position as hambleton durretts wife i am thirty you know  her frankness appalled me  the trouble with you hugh is that you still deceive yourself you throw a glamour over things you want to keep your cake and eat it too  i dont see why you say that and marriage especially  she took me up  marriage what other career is open to a woman unless she is married and married well according to the money standard you men have set up she is nobody we cant all be florence nightingales and i am unable to imagine myself a julia ward howe or a harriet beecher stowe what is left nothing but marriage im hard and cynical you will say but i have thought and im not afraid as i have told you to look things in the face there are very few women i think who would not take the real thing if they had the chance before it were too late who wouldnt be willing to do their own cooking in order to get it  she fell silent suddenly i began to pace the room  for gods sake dont do this nancy i begged  but she continued to stare into the fire as though she had not heard me  if you had made up your mind to do it why did you tell me i asked  sentiment i suppose i am paying a tribute to what i once was to what you once were she said aa sort of goodbye to sentiment  nancy i said hoarsely  she shook her head  no hugh surely you cant misjudge me so she answered reproachfully do you think i should have sent for you if i had meantthat  no no i didnt think so but why not youyou cared once and you tell me plainly you dont love him it was all a terrible mistake we were meant for each other  i did love you then she said you never knew how much and there is nothing i wouldnt give to bring it all back again but i cant its gone youre gone and im gone i mean what we were oh why did you change  it was you who changed i declared bewildered  couldnt you seecant you see now what you did but perhaps you couldnt help it perhaps it was just you after all  what i did  why couldnt you have held fast to your faith if you had you would have known what it was i adored in you oh i dont mind telling you now it was just that faith hugh that faith you had in life that faith you had in me you werent cynical and calculating like ralph hambleton you had imagination ii dreamed too and do you remember the time when you made the boat and we went to logans pond and you sank in her  and you stayed i went on when all the others ran away you ran down the hill like a whirlwind  she laughed  and then you came here one day to a party and said you were going to harvard and quarrelled with me  why did you doubt met i asked agitatedly why didnt you let me see that you still cared  because that wasnt you hugh that wasnt your real self do you suppose it mattered to me whether you went to harvard with the others oh i was foolish too i know i shouldnt have said what i did but what is the use of regrets she exclaimed weve both run after the practical gods and the others have hidden their faces from us it may be that we are not to blame either of us that the practical gods are too strong weve learned to love and worship them and now we cant do without them  we can try nancy i pleaded  no she answered in a low voice thats the difference between you and me i know myself better than you know yourself and i know you better she smiled again unless we could have it all back again i shouldnt want any of it you do not love me  i started once more to protest  no no dont say it she cried  you may think you do just this moment but its only becauseyouve been moved and what you believe you want isnt me its what i was but im not that any moreim simply recalling that dont you see and even then you wouldnt wish me now as i was that sounds involved but you must understand you want a woman who will be wrapped up in your career hugh and yet who will not share itwho will devote herself body and soul to what you have become a woman whom you can shape and you wont really love her but only just so much of her as may become the incarnation of you well im not that kind of woman i might have been had you been different im not at all sure certainly im not that kind now even though i know in my heart that the sort of career you have made for yourself and that i intend to make for myself is all dross but now i cant do without it  and yet you are going to marry hambleton durrett i said  she understood me although i regretted my words at once  yes i am going to marry him there was a shade of bitterness of defiance in her voice surely you are not offering me thethe other thing now oh hugh  i am willing to abandon it all nancy  no she said youre not and im not what you cant see and wont see is that it has become part of you oh you are successful you will be more and more successful and you think i should be somebody as your wife hugh more perhaps eventually than i shall be as hambletons but i should be nobody too i couldnt stand it now my dear you must realize that as soon as you have time to think it over we shall be friends  the sudden gentleness in her voice pierced me through and through she held out her hand something in her grasp spoke of a resolution which could not be shaken  and besides she added sadly i dont love you any more hugh im mourning for something thats gone i wanted to have just this one talk with you but we shant mention it againwell close the book  at that i fled out of the house and at first the thought of her as another mans wife as hambleton durretts wife was seemingly not to be borne it was incredible well close the book i found myself repeating the phrase and it seemed then as though something within me i had believed deadsomething that formerly had been all of mehad revived again to throb with pain  it is not surprising that the acuteness of my suffering was of short duration though i remember certain sharp twinges when the announcement of the engagement burst on the city there was much controversy over the question as to whether or not ham durretts reform would be permanent but most people were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt it was time he settled down and took the position in the community that was to be expected of one of his name and as for nancy it was generally agreed that she had done well for herself she was not made for povertyand who so well as she was fitted for the social leadership of our community  they were married in trinity church in the month of may and i was one of hams attendants ralph was best man for the last time the old willett mansion in powell street wore the gala air of former days carpets were spread over the sidewalk and red and white awnings rooms were filled with flowers and flung open to hundreds of guests i found the wedding something of an ordeal i do not like to dwell upon itespecially upon that moment when i came to congratulate nancy as she stood beside ham at the end of the long parlour she seemed to have no regrets i dont know what i expected of hercertainly not tears and tragedy she seemed taller than ever and very beautiful in her veil and white satin gown and the diamonds ham had given her very much mistress of herself quite a contrast to ham who made no secret of his elation she smiled when i wished her happiness  well be home in the autumn hugh and expect to see a great deal of you she said  as i paused in a corner of the room my eye fell upon nancys father mcalery willetts elation seemed even greater than hams with a gardenia in his frockcoat and a glass of champagne in his hand he went from group to group and his familiar laughter which once had seemed so full of merriment and fun gave me today a somewhat scandalized feeling i heard ralphs voice and turned to discover him standing beside me his long legs thrust slightly apart his hands in his pockets overlooking the scene with typical semicontemptuous amusement  this lets old mcalery out anyway he said  what do you mean i demanded  one or two little notes of his will be cancelled sooner or laterthats all  for a moment i was unable to speak  and do you think that shethat nancy found out i stammered  well id be willing to take that end of the bet he replied why the deuce should she marry ham you ought to know her well enough to understand how shed feel if she discovered some of mcalerys financial coups of course its not a thing i talk about you understand are you going to the club  no im going home i said i was aware of his somewhat compassionate smile as i left him     xii  one november day nearly two years after my admission as junior member of the firm of watling fowndes and ripon seven gentlemen met at luncheon in the boyne club mr barbour president of the railroad mr scherer of the boyne iron works and other corporations mr leonard dickinson of the corn national bank mr halsey a prominent banker from the other great city of the state mr grunewald chairman of the republican state committee and mr frederick grierson who had become a very important man in our community at four oclock they emerged from the club citizens in boyne street who saw them chatting amicably on the steps little suspected that in the last three hours these gentlemen had chosen and practically elected the man who was to succeed mr wade as united states senator in washington those were the days in which great affairs were simply and efficiently handled no democratic nonsense about leaving the choice to an electorate that did not know what it wanted  the man chosen to fill this high position was theodore watling he said he would think about the matter  in the nation at large through the defection of certain northern states neither so conservative nor fortunate as ours the democratic party was in power which naturally implies financial depression there was no question about our ability to send a republican senator the choice in the boyne club was final but before the legislature should ratify it a year or so hence it were just as well that the people of the state should be convinced that they desired mr watling more than any other man and surely enough in a little while such a conviction sprang up spontaneously in offices and restaurants and hotels men began to suggest to each other what a fine thing it would be if theodore watling might be persuaded to accept the toga at the banks when customers called to renew their notes and tight money was discussed and democrats excoriated it was generally agreed that the obvious thing to do was to get a safe man in the senate from the very first watling sentiment stirred like spring sap after a hard winter  the country newspapers watered by providential rains began to put forth tender little editorial shoots which mr judah b tallant presently collected and presented in a charming bouquet in the morning era the voice of the state press thus was the column headed and the remarks of the hon fitch truesdale of the st helens messenger were given a special prominence mr truesdale was the first in his section to be inspired by the happy thought that the one man preeminently fitted to represent the state in the present crisis when her great industries had been crippled by democratic folly was mr theodore watling the rossiter banner the elkington star the belfast recorder and i know not how many others simultaneously began to sing mr watlings praises  not since the troublous times of the civil war declared the morning era had the demand for any man been so unanimous as a proof of it there were the country newspapers which reflected the sober opinion of the firesides of the common people  there are certain industrious gentlemen to whom little credit is given and who unlike the average citizen who reserves his enthusiasm for election time are patriotic enough to labour for their countrys good all the year round when in town it was their habit to pay a friendly call on the counsel for the railroad mr miller gorse in the corn bank building he was never too busy to converse with them or it might better be said to listen to them converse let some legally and politically ambitious young man observe mr gorses method did he inquire what the party worker thought of mr watling for the senate not at all but before the party worker left he was telling mr gorse that public sentiment demanded mr watling after leaving mr gorse they wended their way to the durrett building and handed their cards over the rail of the offices of watling fowndes and ripon mr watling shook hands with scores of them and they departed well satisfied with the flavour of his cigars and intoxicated by his personality he had a marvellous way of cutting short an interview without giving offence some of them he turned over to mr paret whom he particularly desired they should know thus mr paret acquired many valuable additions to his acquaintance cultivated a memory for names and faces that was to stand him in good stead and kept besides an indexed notebook into which he put various bits of interesting information concerning each though not immediately lucrative it was all no doubt part of a lawyers education  during the summer and the following winter colonel paul varney came often to town and spent much of his time in mr parets office smoking mr watlings cigars and discussing the coming campaign in which he took a wholesouled interest  say hugh this is goin slick he would exclaim his eyes glittering like round buttons of jet i never saw a campaign where they fell in the way theyre doing now if it was anybody else but theodore watling it would scare me you ought to have been in jim broadhursts campaign he added referring to the junior senator they wouldnt wood up at all they was just listless but gorse and barbour and the rest wanted him and we had to put him over i reckon he is useful down there in washington but say do you know what he always reminded me of one of those mudturtles i used to play with as a boy up in columbia countyshuts up tight soon as he sees you coming now theodore watling aint like that any way of speaking we can get up some enthusiasm for a man of his sort hes liberal and big hes made his pile and he dont begrudge some of it to the fellows who do the work mark my words when you see a man who wants a big office cheap look out for him  this and much more wisdom i imbibed while assenting to my chiefs greatness for mr varney was rightone could feel enthusiasm for theodore watling and my growing intimacy with him the sense that i was having a part in his career a share in his success became for the moment the passion of my life as the campaign progressed i gave more and more time to it and made frequent trips of a confidential nature to the different counties of the state the whole of my being was energized the national fever had thoroughly pervaded my bloodthe national fever to win prosperitywrit largedemanded it and theodore watling personified incarnated the cause i had neither the time nor the desire to philosophize on this national fever which animated all my associates animated i might say the nation which was beginning to get into a fever about games if i remember rightly it was about this time that golf was introduced tennis had become a commonplace professional baseball was in full swing ham durrett had even organized a local polo team the man who failed to win something tangible in sport or law or business or politics was counted out such was the spirit of america in the closing years of the nineteenth century  and yet when one has said this one has failed to express the national geist in all its subtlety in brief the great american sport was not so much to win the game as to beat it the evasion of rules challenged our ingenuity and having won we set about devising methods whereby it would be less and less possible for us winners to lose in the future no better illustration of this tendency could be given than the development which had recently taken place in the field of our city politics hitherto the battleground of irish politicians who had fought one another for supremacy individualism had been rampant competition the custom you bought an alderman or a boss who owned four or five aldermen and then you never could be sure you were to get what you wanted or that the aldermen and the bosses would stay bought but now a genius had appeared an american genius who had arisen swiftly and almost silently who appealed to the imagination and whose name was often mentioned in a whisperthe hon judd jason sometimes known as the spider who organized the city hall and capitalized it an ultimate and logical effectif one had considered itof the manchester school of economics enlightened selfinterest stripped of sentiment ends on judd jasons he ran the city even as mr sherrill ran his department store you paid your price it was very convenient being a genius mr jason did not wholly break with tradition but retained those elements of the old muddled system that had their value chartering steamboats for outings on the river giving colossal picnics in lowry park the poor and the wanderer and the criminal of the male sex at least were cared for but he was not loved as the roughandtumble irishmen had been loved he did not make himself common he was surrounded by an aura of mystery which i confess had not failed of effect on me once and only once during my legal apprenticeship he had been pointed out to me on the street where he rarely ventured his appearance was not impressive  mr jason could not of course prevent mr watlings election even did he so desire but he did command the allegiance of several city candidatesboth democratic and republicanfor the state legislature who had as yet failed to announce their preferences for united states senator it was important that mr watlings vote should be large as indicative of a public reaction and repudiation of democratic national folly this matter among others was the subject of discussion one july morning when the republican state chairman was in the city mr grunewald expressed anxiety over mr jasons continued silence it was expedient that somebody should see the boss  why not paret suggested leonard dickinson mr watling was not present at this conference paret seems to be running watlings campaign anyway  it was settled that i should be the emissary with lively sensations of curiosity and excitement tempered by a certain anxiety as to my ability to match wits with the spider i made my way to his lair over monahans saloon situated in a district that was anything but respectable the saloon on the ground floor had two apartments the barroom proper where mike monahan chamberlain of the establishment was wont to stand red faced and smiling to greet the courtiers big and little the party workers the district leaders the hangerson ready to be hired the city officials the police judgesyes and the dignified members of state courts whose elections depended on mr jasons favour even judge bering whose acquaintance i had made the day i had come as a law student to mr watlings office unbent from time to time sufficiently to call there for a small glass of rye and water and to relate with his owllike gravity an anecdote to the boys the saloon represented democracy so dear to the american public here all were welcome even the lightfingered gentlemen who enjoyed the privilege of police protection and who sometimes through fortuitous circumstances were hauled before the very magistrates with whom they had rubbed elbows on the polished rail behind the barroom and separated from it by swinging doors only the elite ventured to thrust apart was an audience chamber whither mr jason occasionally descended anecdote and political reminiscence gave place here to matters of high policy  i had several times come to the saloon in the days of my apprenticeship in search of some judge or official and once i had run down here the city auditor himself mike monahan whose affair it was to know everyone recognized me it was part of his business also to understand that i was now a member of the firm of watling fowndes and ripon  good morning to you mr paret he said suavely we held a colloquy in undertones over the bar eyed by the two or three customers who were present mr monahan disappeared but presently returned to whisper sure hell see you to lead the way through the swinging doors and up a dark stairway i came suddenly on a room in the greatest disorder its tables and chairs piled high with newspapers and letters its windows streaked with soot from an open door on its farther side issued a voice  is that you mr paret come in here  it was little less than a command  heard of you mr paret glad to know you sit down wont you  the inner room was almost dark i made out a bed in the corner and propped up in the bed a man but for the moment i was most aware of a pair of eyes that flared up when the man spoke and died down again when he became silent they reminded me of those insects which in my childhood days we called lightning bugs mr jason gave me a hand like a womans i expressed my pleasure at meeting him and took a chair beside the bed  i believe youre a partner of theodore watlings now arent you smart man watling  hell make a good senator i replied accepting the opening  you think hell get electeddo you mr jason inquired  i laughed  well there isnt much doubt about that i imagine  dont knowdont know seen some deadsure things go wrong in my time  whats going to defeat him i asked pleasantly  i dont say anything mr jason replied but ive known funny things to happennever does to be dead sure  oh well were as sure as its humanly possible to be i declared the eyes continued to fascinate me they had a peculiar disquieting effect now they died down and it was as if the mans very presence had gone out as though i had been left alone and i found it exceedingly difficult under the circumstances to continue to address him suddenly he flared up again  watling send you over here he demanded  no as a matter of fact hes out of town some of mr watlings friends mr grunewald and mr dickinson mr gorse and others suggested that i see you mr jason  there came a grunt from the bed  mr watling has always valued your friendship and support i said  what makes him think he aint going to get it  he hasnt a doubt of it i went on diplomatically but we feltand i felt personally that we ought to be in touch with you to work along with you to keep informed how things are going in the city  what things  wellthere are one or two representatives friends of yours who havent come out for mr watling we arent worrying we know youll do the right thing but we feel that it would have a good deal of influence in some other parts of the state if they declared themselves and then you know as well as i do that this isnt a year when any of us can afford to recognize too closely party lines the democratic administration has brought on a panic the business men in that party are down on it and it ought to be rebuked and we feel too that some of the citys democrats ought to be loyal to mr watlingnot that we expect them to vote for him in caucus but when it comes to the joint ballot  who demanded mr jason  senator dowse and jim maher for instance i suggested  jim voted for bill 709 all rightdidnt he said mr jason abruptly  thats just it i put in boldly wed like to induce him to come in with us this time but we feel thatthe inducement would better come through you  i thought mr jason smiled by this time i had grown accustomed to the darkness the face and figure of the man in the bed had become discernible power i remember thinking chooses odd houses for itself here was no overbearing fullblooded ward ruffian brimming with vitality but a thin sallow little man in a cotton nightshirt with irongrey hair and a wiry moustache he might have been an overworked clerk behind a drygoods counter and yet somehow now that i had talked to him i realized that he never could have been those extraordinary eyes of his when they were functioning marked his individuality as unique it were almost too dramatic to say that he required darkness to make his effect but so it seemed i should never forget him he had in truth been well named the spider  of course we havent tried to get in touch with them we are leaving them to you i added  paret he said suddenly i dont care a damn about grunewaldnever did id turn him down for ten cents but you can tell theodore watling for me and dickinson that i guess the inducement can be fixed  i felt a certain relief that the interview had come to an end that the moment had arrived for amenities to my surprise mr jason anticipated me  ive been interested in you mr paret he observed know who you are of course knew you were in watlings office then some of the boys spoke about you when you were down at the legislature on that ribblevale matter guess you had more to do with that bill than came out in the newspaperseh  i was taken off my guard  oh thats talk i said  all right its talk then but i guess you and i will have some more talk after a whileafter theodore watling gets to be united states senator give him my regards andand come in when i can do anything for you mr paret  thanking him i groped my way downstairs and let myself out by a side door monahan had shown me into an alleyway thus avoiding the saloon as i walked slowly back to the office seeking the shade of the awnings the figure in the darkened room took on a sinister aspect that troubled me  the autumn arrived the campaign was on with a whoop and i had my first taste of stump politics the acrid smell of red fire brings it back to me it was a medley of railroad travel of committees provided with badgesand cigars of open carriages slowly drawn between lines of bewildered citizens of lincoln clubs and other clubs marching in serried ranks uniformed and helmeted stalwarts carrying torches and banners and then there were the draughty operahouses with the sylvan scenery pushed back and plush chairs and sofas pushed forward with an ominous table a pitcher of water on it and a glass near the footlights the houses were packed with more bewildered citizens what a wonderful study of mobpsychology it would have offered men who had not thought of the grand old republican party for two years and who had not cared much about it when they had entered the dooms after an hour or so went mad with fervour the hon joseph mecklin exspeaker of the house with whom i traveled on occasions had a speech referring to the martyred president ending with an appeal to the revolutionary fathers who followed washington with bleeding feet the hon joseph possessed that most valuable of political gifts presence and when with quivering voice he finished his peroration citizens wept with him what it all had to do with the tariff was not quite clear yet nobody seemed to miss the connection  we were all of us most concerned of course about the workingman and his dinner pailwhom the democrats had wantonly thrown out of employment for the sake of a doctrinaire theory they had put him in competition with the serf of europe such was the subjectmatter of my own modest addresses in this my maiden campaign i had the sense to see myself in perspective to recognize that not for me a dignified and substantial lawyer of affairs were the rhetorical flights of the hon joseph mecklin i spoke with a certain restraint not too dryly i hope but i sought to curb my sentiments my indignation at the manner in which the workingman had been treated to appeal to the common sense rather than to the passions of my audiences here were the statistics drawn by the way from the republican campaign book unscrupulous demagoguesdemocratic of coursehad sought to twist and evade them let this terrible record of lack of employment and misery be compared with the prosperity under republican rule  one of the most effective speakers in this campaign for the restoration of prosperity said the rossiter banner is mr hugh paret of the firm of watling fowndes and ripon mr parets speech at the operahouse last evening made a most favourable impression mr paret deals with facts and his thoughtful analysis of the situation into which the democratic party has brought this country should convince any saneminded voter that the time has come for a change  i began to keep a scrapbook though i locked it up in the drawer of my desk in it are to be found many clippings of a similarly gratifying tenor  mecklin and i were well contrasted in this way incidentally i made many valuable acquaintances among the solid men of the state the local capitalists and manufacturers with whom my manner of dealing with public questions was in particular favour these were practical men they rather patronized the hon joseph thus estimating to a nicety a mans value or solidity or specific gravity it might better be said since our universe was one of checks and balances the hon joseph and his like skyrocketing through the air were somehow necessary in the scheme of things but not to be taken too seriously me they did take seriously these provincial lords inviting me to their houses and opening their hearts thus when we came to elkington mr mecklin reposed in the commercial house on the noisy main street fortunately for him the clanging of trolley cars never interfered with his slumbers i slept in a wide chamber in the mansion of mr ezra hutchins there were many hutchinses in elkingtonbrothers and cousins and uncles and greatunclesand all were connected with the woollen mills but there is always one supreme hutchins and ezra was he tall selfcontained elderly but well preserved through frugal living essentially american and typical of his class when he entered the lobby of the commercial house that afternoon the babel of political discussion was suddenly hushed politicians traveling salesmen and the members of the local committee made a lane for him to him the hon joseph and i were introduced mr hutchins knew what he wanted he was cordial to mr mecklin but he took me we entered a most respectable surrey with tassels driven by a rawboned coachman in a black overcoat drawn by two sleek horses  how is this thing going paret he asked  i gave him mr grunewalds estimated majority  what do you think he demanded a shrewd humorous look in his blue eyes  well i think well carry the state i havent had grunewalds experience in estimating  ezra hutchins smiled appreciatively  what does watling think  he doesnt seem to be worrying much  ever been in elkington before  i said i hadnt  well a drive will do you good  it was about four oclock on a mild october afternoon the little town of fifteen thousand inhabitants or so had a wonderful setting in the widening valley of the scopanong whose swiftly running waters furnished the power for the mills we drove to these through a gateway over which the words no admittance were conspicuously painted past long brick buildings that bordered the canals and in the windows i caught sight of drab figures of men and women bending over the machines half of the buildings as mr hutchins pointed out were closedmute witnesses of tarifftinkering madness even more eloquent of democratic folly was that part of the town through which we presently passed streets lined with rows of dreary houses where the workers lived children were playing on the sidewalks but theirs seemed a listless play listless too were the men and women who sat on the stepslistless and somewhat sullen as they watched us passing ezra hutchins seemed to read my thought  since the unions got in here ive had nothing but trouble he said ive tried to do my duty by my people god knows but they wont see which side their breads buttered on they oppose me at every step they vote against their own interests some years ago they put up a job on us and sent a scatterbrained radical to the legislature  krebs  do you know him  slightly he was in my class at harvard is he still here i asked after a pause  oh yes but he hasnt gone to the legislature this time weve seen to that his father was a respectable old german who had a little shop and made eyeglasses the son is an example of too much education hes a notoriety seeker oh hes clever in a way hes given us a good deal of trouble too in the courts with damage cases  we came to a brighter more spacious welltodo portion of the town where the residences faced the river in a little while the waters widened into a lake which was surrounded by a park a gift to the city of the hutchins family facing it on one side was the hutchins library on the other across a wide street where the maples were turning were the hutchinses residences of various dates of construction from that of the younger george who had lately married a wife and built in bright yellow brick to the oldfashioned mansion of ezra himself this he told me had been good enough for his father and was good enough for him the picture of it comes back to me now with singular attractiveness it was of brick and i suppose a modification of the georgian the kind of house one still sees in outofthe way corners of london with a sort of dickensy flavour high and square and uncompromising with smallpaned windows with a flat roof surrounded by a low balustrade and many substantial chimneys the third storey was lower than the others separated from them by a distinct line on one side was a wide porch yellow and red leaves the days fall scattered the wellkept lawn standing in the doorway of the house was a girl in white and as we descended from the surrey she came down the walk to meet us she was young about twenty her hair was the colour of the russet maple leaves  this is mr paret maude mr hutchins looked at his watch as does a man accustomed to live by it if youll excuse me mr paret i have something important to attend to perhaps mr paret would like to look about the grounds he addressed his daughter  i said i should be delighted though i had no idea what grounds were meant as i followed maude around the house she explained that all the hutchins connection had a common back yard as she expressed it in reality there were about two blocks of the property extending behind all the houses there were great trees with swings groves orchards where the late apples glistened between the leaves an oldfashioned flower garden loath to relinquish its blooming in the distance the shadowed western ridge hung like a curtain of deep blue velvet against the sunset  what a wonderful spot i exclaimed  yes it is nice she agreed we were all brought up herei mean my cousins and myself there are dozens of us and dozens left she added as the shouts and laughter of children broke the stillness  a boy came running around the corner of the path he struck out at maude with a remarkably swift movement she retaliated  ouch he exclaimed  you got him that time i laughed and being detected she suddenly blushed it was this act that drew my attention to her that defined her as an individual before that i had regarded her merely as a shy and provincial girl now she was brimming with an unsuspected vitality a certain interest was aroused although her shyness towards me was not altered i found it rather a flattering shyness  its hugh she explained hes always trying to be funny speak to mr paret hugh  why thats my name too i said  is it  she knocked my hat off a little while ago said hugh i was only getting square  well you didnt get square did you i asked  are you going to speak in the tows hall tonight the boy demanded i admitted it he went off pausing once to stare back at me maude and i walked on  it must be exciting to speak before a large audience she said if i were a man i think i should like to be in politics  i cannot imagine you in politics i answered  she laughed  i said if i were a man  are you going to the meeting  oh yes father promised to take me he has a box  i thought it would be pleasant to have her there  im afraid youll find what i have to say rather dry i said  a woman cant expect to understand everything she answered quickly  this remark struck me favourably i glanced at her sideways she was not a beauty but she was distinctly wellformed and strong her face was oval her features not quite regulargiving them a certain charm her colour was fresh her eyes blue the lighter blue one sees on chinese ware not a poetic comparison but so i thought of them she was apparently not sophisticated as were most of the young women at home whom i knew intimately as were the watling twins for example with one of whom frances i had had by the way rather a lively flirtation the spring before she seemed refreshingly original impressionable and plastic  we walked slowly back to the house and in the hallway i met mrs hutchins a bustling housewifely lady inclined to stoutness whose creased and kindly face bore witness to long acquiescence in the discipline of matrimony to the contentment that results from an essentially circumscribed and comfortable life she was i learned later the second mrs hutchins and maude their only child the children of the first marriage all girls had married and scattered  supper was a decorous but heterogeneous meal of the oldfashioned sort that gives one the choice between tea and cocoa it was something of an occasion i suspected the minister was there the reverend mr doddridge who would have made in appearance at least a perfect puritan divine in a steeple hat and a tippet onlyhe was no longer the leader of the community and even in his grace he had the air of deferring to the man who provided the bounties of which we were about to partake rather than to the almighty young george was there mr hutchinss nephew who was daily becoming more and more of a factor in the management of the mills and had built the house of yellow brick that stood out so incongruously among the older hutchinses mansions and marked a transition i thought him rather a yellowbrick gentleman himself for his assumption of cosmopolitan manners his wife was a pretty discontented little woman who plainly deplored her environment longed for larger fields of conquest george she said must remain where he was for the present at leastuncle ezra depended on him but elkington was a prosy place and mrs george gave the impression that she did not belong here they went to the city on occasions both cities and when she told me we had a common acquaintance in mrs hambleton durrettwhom she thought so lovelyi knew that she had taken nancy as an ideal nancy the social leader of what was to mrs george a metropolis  presently the talk became general among the men the subject being the campaign and i the authority bombarded with questions i strove to answer judicially what was the situation in this county and in that the national situation george indulged in rather a vigorous arraignment of the demagogues national and state who were hurting business in order to obtain political power the reverend mr doddridge assented deploring the poverty that the local people had brought on themselves by heeding the advice of agitators and mrs hutchins who spent much of her time in charity work agreed with the minister when he declared that the trouble was largely due to a decline in christian belief ezra hutchins too nodded at this  take that man krebs for example the minister went on stimulated by this encouragement hes an atheist pure and simple a sympathetic shudder went around the table at the word george alone smiled old krebs was a freethinker i used to get my glasses of him he was at least a conscientious man a good workman which is more than can be said for the son young krebs has talent and if only he had devoted himself to the honest practice of law instead of stirring up dissatisfaction among these people he would be a successful man today  mr hutchins explained that i was at college with krebs  these people must like him i said or they wouldnt have sent him to the legislature  well a good many of them do like him the minister admitted you see he actually lives among them they believe his socialistic doctrines because hes a friend of theirs  he wont represent this town again thats sure exclaimed george you didnt see in the papers that he was nominateddid you paret  but if the mill people wanted him george how could it be prevented his wife demanded  george winked at me  there are more ways of skinning a cat than one he said cryptically  well its time to go to the meeting i guess remarked ezra rising once more he looked at his watch  we were packed into several family carriages and started off in front of the hall the inevitable red fire was burning its quivering light reflected on the faces of the crowd that blocked the street they stood silent strangely apathetic as we pushed through them to the curb and the red fire went out suddenly as we descended my temporary sense of depression however deserted me as we entered the hall which was well lighted and filled with people who clapped when the hon joseph and i accompanied by mr doddridge and the hon henry clay mellish from pottstown with the local chairman walked out on the stage a glance over the audience sufficed to ascertain that that portion of the population whose dinner pails we longed to fill was evidently not present in large numbers but the farmers had driven in from the hills while the merchants and storekeepers of elkington had turned out loyally  the chairman in introducing me proclaimed me as a coming man and declared that i had already achieved in the campaign considerable notoriety as i spoke i was pleasantly aware of maude hutchins leaning forward a little across the rail of the righthand stage boxfor the town hall was half operahouse her attitude was one of semiabsorbed admiration and the thought that i had made an impression on her stimulated me i spoke with more aplomb somewhat to my surprise i found myself making occasional unexpected witticisms that drew laughter and applause suddenly from the back of the hall a voice called outhow about house bill 709  there was a silence then a stirring and craning of necks it was my first experience of heckling and for the moment i was taken aback i thought of krebs he had indeed been in my mind since i had risen to my feet and i had scanned the faces before me in search of his but it was not his voice  well what about bill 709 i demanded  you ought to know something about it i guess the voice responded  put him out came from various portions of the hall  inwardly i was shaken notin orthodox language from any conviction of sin yet it was my first intimation that my part in the legislation referred to was known to any save a select few i blamed krebs and a hot anger arose within me against him after all what could they prove  no dont put him out i said let him come up here to the platform ill yield to him and im entirely willing to discuss with him and defend any measures passed in the legislature of this state by a republican majority perhaps i added the gentleman has a copy of the law in his pocket that i may know what he is talking about and answer him intelligently  at this there was wild applause i had the audience with me the offender remained silent and presently i finished my speech after that mr mecklin made them cheer and weep and mr mellish made them laugh the meeting had been highly successful  you polished him off all right said george hutchins as he took my hand  who was he  oh one of the local soreheads krebs put him up to it of course  was krebs here i asked  sitting in the corner of the balcony that meeting must have made him feel sick george bent forward and whispered in my ear i thought bill 709 was watlings idea  oh i happened to be in the potts house about that time i explained  george of whom it may be gathered that he was not wholly unsophisticated grinned at me appreciatively  say paret he replied putting his hand through my arm theres a little legal business in prospect down here that will require some handling and i wish youd come down after the campaign and talk it over with us ive just about made up my mind that youre he man to tackle it  all right ill come i said  and stay with me said george  we went to his yellowbrick house for refreshments salad and icecream and in the face of the hutchins traditions champagne others had been invited in some twenty persons once in a while when i looked up i met maudes eyes across the room i walked home with her slowly the length of the hutchinses block floating over the lake was a waning october moon that cast through the thinning maples a lacework of shadows at our feet i had the feeling of wellbeing that comes to heroes and the presence of maude hutchins was an incense a vestal incense far from unpleasing yet she had reservations which appealed to me hers was not a gushing provincialism like that of mrs george  i liked your speech so much mr paret she told me it seemed so sensible andcontrolled compared to the others i have never thought a great deal about these things of course and i never understood before why taking away the tariff caused so much misery you made that quite plain  if so im glad i said  she was silent a moment  the working people here have had a hard time during the last year she went on some of the mills had to be shut down you know it has troubled me indeed it has troubled all of us and what has made it more difficult more painful is that many of them seem actually to dislike us they think its fathers fault and that he could run all the mills if he wanted to ive been around a little with mother and sometimes the women wouldnt accept any help from us they said theyd rather starve than take charity that they had the right to work but father couldnt run the mills at a losscould he  certainly not i replied  and then theres mr krebs of whom we were speaking at supper and who puts all kinds of queer notions into their heads father says hes an anarchist i heard father say at supper that he was at harvard with you did you like him  well i answered hesitatingly i didnt know him very well  of course not she put in i suppose you couldnt have  hes got these notions i explained that are mischievous and crazybut i dont dislike him  im glad to hear you say that she answered quietly i like him toohe seems so kind so understanding  do you know him  well she hesitatedi feel as though i do ive only met him once and that was by accident it was the day the big strike began last spring and i had been shopping and started for the mills to get father to walk home with me as i used to do i saw the crowds blocking the streets around the canal at first i paid no attention to them but after a while i began to be a little uneasy there were places where i had to squeeze through and i couldnt help seeing that something was wrong and that the people were angry men and women were talking in loud voices one woman stared at me and called my name and said something that frightened me terribly i went into a doorwayand then i saw mr krebs i didnt know who he was he just said youd better come with me miss hutchins and i went with him i thought afterwards that it was a very courageous thing for him to do because he was so popular with the mill people and they had such a feeling against us yet they didnt seem to resent it and made way for us and mr krebs spoke to many of them as we passed after we got to state street i asked him his name and when he told me i was speechless he took off his hat and went away he had such a nice facenot at all ugly when you look at it twiceand kind eyes that i just couldnt believe him to be as bad as father and george think he is of course he is mistaken she added hastily but i am sure he is sincere and honestly thinks he can help those people by telling them what he does  the question shot at me during the meeting rankled still i wanted to believe that krebs had inspired it and her championship of him gave me a twinge of jealousythe slightest twinge to be sure yet a perceptible one at the same time the unaccountable liking i had for the man stirred to life the act she described had been so characteristic  hes one of the born rebels against society i said glibly yet i do think hes sincere  maude was grave i should be sorry to think he wasnt she replied after i had bidden her good night at the foot of the stairs and gone to my room i reflected how absurd it was to be jealous of krebs what was maude hutchins to me and even if she had been something to me she never could be anything to krebs all the forces of our civilization stood between the two nor was she of a nature to take plunges of that sort the next day as i lay back in my seat in the parlourcar and gazed at the autumn landscape i indulged in a luxurious contemplation of the picture she had made as she stood on the lawn under the trees in the early morning light when my carriage had driven away and i had turned to perceive that her eyes had followed me i was not in love with her of course i did not wish to return at once to elkington but i dwelt with a pleasant anticipation upon my visit when the campaign should be over with george     xiii  the good old days of the watling campaign as colonel paul varney is wont to call them are gone forever and the colonel himself who stuck to his gods has been through the burning fiery furnace of investigation and has come out unscathed and unrepentant the flames of investigation as a matter of fact passed over his head in their vain attempt to reach the man higher up whose feet they licked but him they did not devour either a veteran in retirement the colonel is living under his vine and fig tree on the lake at rossiter the vine bears catawba grapes of which he is passionately fond the fig tree the bartlett pears he gives to his friends he has saved something from the spoils of war but other veterans i could mention are not so fortunate the old warriors have retired and many are dead the good old methods are becoming obsolete we never bothered about those mischievous things called primaries our county committees our state committees chose the candidates for the conventions which turned around and chose the committees both the committees and the conventionsunder advicechose the candidates why pray should the people complain when they had everything done for them the benevolent parties both democratic and republican even undertook the expense of printing the ballots and generous ballots they were twenty inches long and five wide distributed before election in order that the voters might have the opportunity of studying and preparing them in order that democrats of delicate feelings might take the pains to scratch out all the democratic candidates and write in the names of the republican candidates patriotism could go no farther than this  i spent the week before election in the city where i had the opportunity of observing what may be called the charitable side of politics for a whole month or more the burden of existence had been lifted from the shoulders of the homeless no church or organization looked out for these frowsy bleareyed and ragged wanderers who had failed to find a place in the scale of efficiency for a whole month i say mr judd jason and his lieutenants made them their especial care supported them in lodginghouses induced the night clerks to give them attention took the greatest pains to ensure them the birthright which as american citizens was theirsthat of voting they were not only given homes for a period but they were registered and in the abundance of good feeling that reigned during this time of cheer even the foreigners were registered on election day they were driven like visiting notables in carryalls and carriages to the polls some of them as though in compensation for ills endured between elections voted not once but many times exercising judicial functions for which they should be given credit for instance they were convinced that the hon w w trulease had made a good governor and they were watling enthusiastsintent on sending men to the legislature who would vote for him for senator yet there were cases in which for the minor offices the democrat was the better man  it was a memorable day in spite of mr lawlers pilot which was as a voice crying in the wilderness citizens who had wives and homes and responsibilities business men and clerks went to the voting booths and recorded their choice for trulease watling and prosperity and workingmen followed suit victory was in the air even the policemen wore happy smiles and in some instances the election officers themselves in absentminded exuberance thrust bunches of ballots into the boxes  in response to an insistent demand from his fellowcitizens mr watling the saturday evening before had made a speech in the auditorium decked with bunting and filled with people for once the morning era did not exaggerate when it declared that the ovation had lasted fully ten minutes a remarkable proof it went on to say of the esteem and confidence in which our fellowcitizen is held by those who know him best his neighbours in the city where he has given so many instances of his public spirit where he has achieved such distinction in the practice of the law he holds the sound american conviction that the office should seek the man his address is printed in another column and we believe it will appeal to the intelligence and sober judgment of the state it is replete with modesty and wisdom  mr watling was introduced by mr bering of the state supreme court a candidate for reelection who spoke with deliberation with owllike impressiveness he didnt believe in judges meddling in politics but this was an unusual occasion loud applause most unusual he had come here as a man as an american to pay his tribute to another man a longtime friend whom he thought to stand somewhat aside and above mere party strife to represent values not merely political so accommodating and flexible is the human mind so practical may it become through dealing with men and affairs that in listening to judge bering i was able to ignore the little anomalies such a situation might have suggested to the theorist to the mere student of the institutions of democracy the friendly glasses of rye and water mr bering had taken in monahans saloon the cases he had arranged for the firm of watling fowndes and ripon were forgotten forgotten too when theodore watling stood up and men began to throw their hats in the airwere the cavilling charges of mr lawlers pilot that far from the office seeking the man our candidate had spent over a hundred thousand dollars of his own money to say nothing of the contributions of mr scherer mr dickinson and the railroad if i had been troubled with any weak ethical doubts mr watling would have dispelled them he had red blood in his veins a creed in which he believed a rare power of expressing himself in plain everyday language that was often colloquial but neveras the saying goescheap the dinnerpail predicament was real to him he would present a policy of our opponents charmingly even persuasively and then add after a moments pause there is only one objection to this my friendsthat it doesnt work it was all in the way he said it of course the audience would go wild with approval and shouts of thats right could be heard here and there then he proceeded to show why it didnt work he had the faculty of bringing his lessons home the imagination to put himself into the daily life of those who listened to himthe life of the storekeeper the clerk of the labourer and of the housewife the effect of this can scarcely be overestimated for the american hugs the delusion that there are no class distinctions even though his whole existence may be an effort to rise out of once class into another your wife he told them once needs a dress let us admit that the material for the dress is a little cheaper than it was four years ago but when she comes to look into the family stocking laughter i neednt go on if we could have things cheaper and more money to buy them with we should all be happy and the republican party could retire from business  he did not once refer to the united states senatorship  it was appropriate perhaps that many of us dined on the evening of election day at the boyne club there was early evidence of a republican landslide and when at ten oclock it was announced that mr trulease was reelected by a majority which exceeded mr grunewalds most hopeful estimate that the legislature was safe that theodore watling would be the next united states senator a scene of jubilation ensued within those hallowed walls which was unprecedented chairs were pushed back rugs taken up gene hollister played the piano and a virginia reel started in a burst of enthusiasm leonard dickinson ordered champagne for every member present the country was returning to its senses theodore watling had preferred on this eventful night to remain quietly at home but presently carriages were ordered and a delegation of enthusiastic friends departed to congratulate him dickinson of course grierson fowndes ogilvy and grunewald we found judah b tallant therein spite of the fact that it was a busy night for the era and adolf scherer himself in expansive mood was filling the largest of the library chairs mr watling was the least excited of them all remarkably calm i thought for a man on the verge of realizing his lifes high ambition he had some old brandy and a box of cigars he had been saving for an occasion he managed to convey to everyone his appreciation of the value of their cooperation  it was midnight before mr scherer arose to take his departure he seized mr watlings hand warmly in both of his own  i have never he said with a relapse into the german fs i have never had a happier moment in my life my friend than when i congratulate you on your success his voice shook with emotion alas we shall not see so much of you now  hell be on guard scherer said leonard dickinson putting his arm around my chief  good night senator said tallant and all echoed the word which struck me as peculiarly appropriate much as i had admired mr watling before it seemed indeed as if he had undergone some subtle change in the last few hours gained in dignity and greatness by the action of the people that day when it came my turn to bid him good night he retained my hand in his  dont go yet hugh he said  but you must be tired i objected  this sort of thing doesnt make a man tired he laughed leading me back to the library where he began to poke the fire into a blaze sit down awhile you must be tired i thinkyouve worked hard in this campaign a good deal harder than i have i havent said much about it but i appreciate it my boy mr watling had the gift of expressing his feelings naturally without sentimentality i would have given much for that gift  oh i liked it i replied awkwardly  i read a gentle amusement in his eyes and also the expression of something else difficult to define he had seated himself and was absently thrusting at the logs with the poker  youve never regretted going into law he asked suddenly to my surprise  why no sir i said  im glad to hear that i feel to a considerable extent responsible for your choice of a profession  my father intended me to be a lawyer i told him but its true that you gave me mymy first enthusiasm  he looked up at me at the word  i admired your father he seemed to me to be everything that a lawyer should be and years ago when i came to this city a raw country boy from upstate he represented and embodied for me all the fine traditions of the profession but the practice of law isnt what it was in his day hugh  no i agreed that could scarcely be expected  yes i believe you realize that he said ive watched you ive taken a personal pride in you and i have an idea that eventually you will succeed me hereneither fowndes nor ripon have the peculiar ability you have shown you and i are alike in a great many respects and i am inclined to think we are rather rare as men go we are able to keep one object vividly in view so vividly as to be able to work for it day and night i could mention dozens who had and have more natural talent for the law than i more talent for politics than i the same thing may be said about you i dont regard either of us as natural lawyers such as your father was he couldnt help being a lawyer  here was new evidence of his perspicacity  but surely i ventured you dont feel any regrets concerning your career mr watling  no he said thats just the point but no two of us are made wholly alike i hadnt practised law very long before i began to realize that conditions were changing that the new forces at work in our industrial life made the older legal ideals impracticable it was a case of choosing between efficiency and inefficiency and i chose efficiency well that was my own affair but when it comes to influencing others he paused i want you to see this as i do not for the sake of justifying myself but because i honestly believe there is more to it than expediencya good deal more theres a weak way of looking at it and a strong way and if i feel sure you understand it i shall be satisfied  because things are going to change in this country hugh they are changing but they are going to change more a man has got to make up his mind what he believes in and be ready to fight for it well have to fight for it sooner perhaps than we realize we are a nation divided against ourselves democracyjacksonian democracy at all events is a flat failure and we may as well acknowledge it we have a political system we have outgrown and which therefore we have had to nullify there are certain needs certain tendencies of development in nations as well as in individualsneeds stronger than the state stronger than the law or constitution in order to make our resources effective combinations of capital are more and more necessary and no more to be denied than a chemical process given the proper ingredients can be thwarted the men who control capital must have a free hand or the structure will be destroyed this compels us to do many things which we would rather not do which we might accomplish openly and unopposed if conditions were frankly recognized and met by wise statesmanship which sought to bring about harmony by the reshaping of laws and policies do you follow me  yes i answered but i have never heard the situation stated so clearly do you think the day will come when statesmanship will recognize this need  ah he said im afraid notin my time at least but we shall have to develop that kind of statesmen or go on the rocks public opinion in the old democratic sense is a myth it must be made by strong individuals who recognize and represent evolutionary needs otherwise its at the mercy of demagogues who play fast and loose with the prejudice and ignorance of the mob the people dont value the vote they know nothing about the real problems so far as i can see they are as easily swayed today as the crowd that listened to mark antonys oration about caesar youve seen how we have to handle them in this election andin other matters it isnt a pleasant practice something wed indulge in out of choice but the alternative is unthinkable wed have chaos in no time weve just got to keep hold you understandwe cant leave it to the irresponsible  yes i said in this mood he was more impressive than i had ever known him and his confidence flattered and thrilled me  in the meantime were criminals he continued from now on well have to stand more and more denunciation from the visionaries the dissatisfied the trouble makers we may as well make up our minds to it but weve got something on our side worth fighting for and the man who is able to make that clear will be great  but youyou are going to the senate i reminded him  he shook his head  the time has not yet come he said confusion and misunderstanding must increase before they can diminish but i have hopes of you hugh or i shouldnt have spoken i shant be here nowof course ill keep in touch with you i wanted to be sure that you had the right view of this thing  i see it now i said i had thought of it but nevernever as a wholenot in the large sense in which you have expressed it to attempt to acknowledge or deprecate the compliment he had paid me was impossible i felt that he must have read my gratitude and appreciation in my manner  i mustnt keep you up until morning he glanced at the clock and went with me through the hall into the open air a meteor darted through the november night were like that he observed staring after it a flash across the darkness and were gone  onlythere are many who havent the satisfaction of a flash i was moved to reply  he laughed and put his hand on my shoulder as he bade me good night  hugh you ought to get married ill have to find a nice girl for you he said with an elation not unmingled with awe i made my way homeward  theodore watling had given me a creed  a week or so after the election i received a letter from george hutchins asking me to come to elkington i shall not enter into the details of the legal matter involved many times that winter i was a guest at the yellowbrick house and i have to confess as spring came on that i made several trips to elkington which business necessity did not absolutely demand  i considered maude hutchins and found the consideration rather a delightful process as became an eligible and successful young man i was careful not to betray too much interest and i occupied myself at first with a review of what i deemed her shortcomings not that i was thinking of marriagebut i had imagined the future mrs paret as tall maude was up to my chin again the hair of the fortunate lady was to be dark and maudes was golden red my ideal had esprit lightness of touch the faculty of seizing just the aspect of a subject that delighted me and a knowledge of the world maude was simple direct and in a word provincial her provinciality however was negative rather than positive she had no disagreeable mannerisms her voice was not nasal her plasticity appealed to me i suppose i was lost without knowing it when i began to think of moulding her  all of this went on at frequent intervals during the winter and while i was organizing the elkington power and traction company for george i found time to dine and sup at maudes house and to take walks with her i thought i detected an incense deliciously sweet by no means overpowering like the lilys but more like the shy fragrance of the wood flower i recall her kind welcomes the faint deepening of colour in her cheeks when she greeted me and while i suspected that she looked up to me she had a surprising and tantalizing selfcommand  there came moments when i grew slightly alarmed as for instance one sunday in the early spring when i was dining at the ezra hutchinss house and surprised mrs hutchinss glance on me suspecting her of seeking to divine what manner of man i was i became selfconscious i dared not look at maude who sat across the table thereafter i began to feel that the hutchins connection regarded me as a suitor i had grown intimate with george and his wife who did not refrain from sly allusions and george himself once remarked with characteristic tact that i was most conscientious in my attention to the traction affair i have reason to believe they were even less delicate with maude this was the logical time to withdrawbut i dallied the experience was becoming more engrossingif i may so describe itand spring was approaching the stars in their courses were conspiring i was by no means as yet a selfacknowledged wooer and we discussed love in its lighter phases through the medium of literature heaven forgive me for calling it so about that period it will be remembered a mushroom growth of volumes of a certain kind sprang into existence little books with artistic bindings and wide margins sweetened essays some of them written in beautiful english by dilettante authors for drawingroom consumption and collections of short stories no doubt chiefly bought by philanderers like myself who were thus enabled to skate on thin ice over deep water it was a most delightful relationship that these helped to support and i fondly believed i could reach shore again whenever i chose  there came a sunday in early may one of those days when the feminine assumes a large importance i had been to the hutchinses church and maude as she sat and prayed decorously in the pew beside me suddenly increased in attractiveness and desirability her voice was very sweet and i felt a delicious and languorous thrill which i identified not only with love but also with a reviving spirituality how often the two seem to go hand in hand  she wore a dress of a filmy material mauve with a design in gold thread running through it of late it seemed she had had more new dresses and their modes seemed more cosmopolitan at least to the masculine eye how delicately her hair grew in little shining wisps around her white neck i could have reached out my hand and touched her and it was this desirealthough by no means overwhelmingthat startled me did i really want her the consideration of this vital question occupied the whole time of the sermon made me distrait at dinnera large family gathering later i found myself alone with heron a bench in the hutchinses garden where we had walked the day of my arrival during the campaign  the gardens were very different now the trees had burst forth again into leaf the spiraea bushes seemed weighted down with snow and with a note like that of the quivering bass string of a cello the bees hummed among the fruit blossoms and there beside me in her filmy dress was maude a part of it allthe meaning of all that set my being clamouring she was like some ripened delicious flower ready to be picked one of those pernicious makebelieve volumes had fallen on the bench between us for i could not read any more i could not think i touched her hand and when she drew it gently away i glanced at her reason made a valiant but hopeless effort to assert itself was i sure that i wanted herfor life no use i wanted her now no matter what price that future might demand an awkward silence fell between usawkward to me at leastand i her guide and mentor became banal apologetic confused i made some idiotic remark about being together in the garden of eden  i remember mr doddridge saying in bible class that it was supposed to be on the euphrates she replied but its been destroyed by the flood  lets make anotherone of our own i suggested  why how silly you are this afternoon  whats to prevent usmaude i demanded with a dry throat  nonsense she laughed in proportion as i lost poise she seemed to gain it  its not nonsense i faltered if we were married  at last the fateful words were pronouncedirrevocably and instead of qualms i felt nothing but relief joy that i had been swept along by the flood of feeling she did not look at me but gazed straight ahead of her  if i love you maude i stammered after a moment  but i dont love you she replied steadily  never in my life had i been so utterly taken aback  do you mean i managed to say that after all these months you dont like me a little  liking isnt loving she looked me full in the face i like you very much  but there i stopped paralyzed by what appeared to me the quintessence of feminine inconsistency and caprice yet as i stared at her she certainly did not appear capricious it is not too much to say that i was fairly astounded at this evidence of selfcommand and decision of the strength of mind to refuse me was it possible that she had felt nothing and i all i got to my feet  i hate to hurt your feelings i heard her say im very sorry she looked up at me afterwards when reflecting on the scene i seemed to remember that there were tears in her eyes i was not in a condition to appreciate her splendid sincerity i was overwhelmed and inarticulate i left her there on the bench and went back to georges announcing my intention of taking the five oclock train  maude hutchins had become at a stroke the most desirable of women i have often wondered how i should have felt on that fivehour journey back to the city if she had fallen into my arms i should have persuaded myself no doubt that i had not done a foolish thing in yielding to an impulse and proposing to an inexperienced and provincial young woman yet there would have been regrets in the background too deeply chagrined to see any humour in the situation i settled down in a pullman seat and went over and over again the event of that afternoon until the train reached the city  as the days wore on and i attended to my cases i thought of maude a great deal and in those moments when the pressure of business was relaxed she obsessed me she must love meonly she did not realize it that was the secret her value had risen amazingly become supreme the very act of refusing me had emphasized her qualifications as a wife and i now desired her with all the intensity of a nature which had been permitted always to achieve its objects the inevitable process of idealization began in dusty offices i recalled her freshness as she had sat beside me in the gardenthe freshness of a flower with berkeleyan subjectivism i clothed the flower with colour bestowed it with fragrance i conferred on maude all the gifts and graces that woman had possessed since the creation and i recalled with mingled bitterness and tenderness the turn of her head the down on her neck the halfrevealed curve of her arm in spite of the growing sordidness of lyme street my mother and i still lived in the old house for which she very naturally had a sentiment in vain i had urged her from time to time to move out into a brighter and fresher neighbourhood it would be time enough she said when i was married  if you wait for that mother i answered we shall spend the rest of our lives here  i shall spend the rest of my life here she would declare but youyou have your life before you my dear you would be so much more contented ifif you could find some nice girl i think you livetoo feverishly  i do not know whether or not she suspected me of being in love nor indeed how much she read of me in other ways i did not confide in her nor did it strike me that she might have yearned for confidences though sometimes when i dined at home i surprised her gentle faceframed now with white hairlifted wistfully toward me across the table our relationship indeed was a pathetic projection of that which had existed in my childhood we had never been confidants then the world in which i lived and fought of great transactions and merciless consequences frightened her her own world was more limited than ever she heard disquieting things i am sure from cousin robert breck who had become more and more querulous since the timehonoured firm of breck and company had been forced to close its doors and the home at claremore had been sold my mother often spent the day in the scrolled suburban cottage with the coloured glass front door where he lived with the kinleys and helen  if my mother suspected that i was anticipating marriage and said nothing nancy durrett suspected and spoke out  life is such a curious succession of contradictions and surprises that i record here without comment the fact that i was seeing much more of nancy since her marriage than i had in the years preceding it a comradeship existed between us i often dined at her house and had fallen into the habit of stopping there frequently on my way home in the evening ham did not seem to mind what was clear at any rate was that nancy before marriage had exacted some sort of an understanding by which her freedom was not to be interfered with she was the first among us of the modern wives  ham whose heartstrings and pursestrings were oddly intertwined had stipulated that they were to occupy the old durrett mansion but when nancy had made it livable as she expressed it he is said to have remarked that he might as well have built a new house and been done with it not even old nathaniel himself would have recognized his home when nancy finished what she termed furnishing out went the horsehair the hideous chandeliers the stuffy books the recamier statuary and an army of upholsterers woodworkers etc from boston and new york invaded the place the old mahogany doors were spared but matched now by chippendale and sheraton the new polished floors were covered with oriental rugs the dreary durrett pictures replaced by good canvases and tapestries nancy had what amounted to a genius for interior effects and she was the first to introduce among us the luxury that was to grow more and more prevalent as our wealth increased by leaps and bounds only nancys luxury though lavish was never vulgar and her house when completed had rather marvellously the fine distinction of some old london mansion filled with the best that generations could contribute it left mrs frederick griersonwhose residence on the heights had hitherto been our grandestbreathless with despair  with characteristic audacity nancy had chosen old nathaniels sanctum for her particular salon into which ham himself did not dare to venture without invitation it was hung in pompeiian red and had a little wroughtiron balcony projecting over the yard now transformed by an expert into a garden when i had first entered this room after the metamorphosis had taken place i inquired after the tombstone mantel  oh ive pulled it up by the roots she said  arent you afraid of ghosts i inquired  do i look it she asked and i confessed that she didnt indeed all ghosts were laid nor was there about her the slightest evidence of mourning or regret one was forced to acknowledge her perfection in the part she had chosen as the arbitress of social honours the candidates were rapidly increasing almost every month it seemed someone turned up with a fortune and the aspirations that go with it and it was mrs durrett who decided the delicate question of fitness with these and with the world at large her manner might best be described as difficult and i was often amused at the way in which she contrived to keep them at arms length and make them uncomfortable with her intimatesof whom there were fewshe was frank  i suppose you enjoy it i said to her once  of course i enjoy it or i shouldnt do it she retorted it isnt the real thing as i told you once but none of us gets the real thing its power just as you enjoy what youre doingsorting out the unfit its a game it keeps us from brooding over things we cant help and after all when we have good appetites and are fairly happy why should we complain  im not complaining i said taking up a cigarette since i still enjoy your favour  she regarded me curiously  and when you get married hugh  sufficient unto the day i replied  how shall i get along i wonder with that simple and unsophisticated lady when she appears  well i said you wouldnt marry me  she shook her head at me and smiled  no she corrected me you like me better as hams wife than you would have as your own  i merely laughed at this remark it would indeed have been difficult to analyze the new relationship that had sprung up between us to say what elements composed it the roots of it went back to the beginning of our lives and there was much of sentiment in it no doubt she understood me as no one else in the world understood me and she was fond of me in spite of it  hence when i became infatuated with maude hutchins after that sunday when she so unexpectedly had refused me i might have known that nancys suspicions would be aroused she startled me by accusing me out of a clear sky of being in love i denied it a little too emphatically  why shouldnt you tell me hugh if its so she asked i didnt hesitate to tell you  it was just before her departure for the east to spend the summer we were on the balcony shaded by the big maple that grew at the end of the garden  but theres nothing to tell i insisted  she lay back in her chair regarding me  did you think that id be jealous  theres nothing to be jealous about  ive always expected you to get married hugh ive even predicted the type  she had in truth with an accuracy almost uncanny  the only thing im afraid of is that she wont like me she lives in that place youve been going to so much latelydoesnt she  of course she had put two and two together my visits to elkington and my manner which i had flattered myself had not been distrait on the chance that she knew more from some source i changed my tactics  i suppose you mean maude hutchins i said  nancy laughed  so thats her name  its the name of a girl in elkington ive been doing legal work for the hutchinses and i imagine some idiot has been gossiping shes just a young girlmuch too young for me  men are queer creatures she declared did you think i should be jealous  it was exactly what i had thought but i denied it  why should you beeven if there were anything to be jealous about you didnt consult me when you got married you merely announced an irrevocable decision  nancy leaned forward and laid her hand on my arm  my dear she said strange as it may seem i want you to be happy i dont want you to make a mistake hugh too great a mistake  i was surprised and moved once more i had a momentary glimpse of the real nancy  our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of ralph hambleton     xiv  however thoughts of maude continued to possess me she still appeared the most desirable of beings and a fortnight after my repulse without any excuse at all i telegraphed the george hutchinses that i was coming to pay them a visit mrs george wearing a knowing smile met me at the station in a light buckboard  ive asked maude to dinner she said  thus with masculine directness i returned to the charge and maudes continued resistance but increased my ardour could not see why she continued to resist me  because i dont love you she said  this was incredible i suggested that she didnt know what love was and she admitted it was possible she liked me very very much i told her sagely that this was the best foundation for matrimony that might be but she had had other ideas for one thing she felt that she did not know me in short she was charming and maddening in her defensive ruses in her advances and retreats for i pressed her hard during the four weeks which followed and in them made four visits flinging caution to the winds i did not even pretend to george that i was coming to see him on business i had the hutchins family on my side for they had the sense to see that the match would be an advantageous one i even summoned up enough courage to talk to ezra hutchins on the subject  ill not attempt to influence maude mr paretive always said i wouldnt interfere with her choice but as you are a young man of sound habits sir successful in your profession i should raise no objection i suppose we cant keep her always  to conceal his emotion he pulled out the watch he lived by why its church time he said i attended church regularly at elkington  on a sunday night in june following a day during which victory seemed more distant than ever with startling unexpectedness maude capitulated she sat beside me on the bench obscured yet the warm night quivered with her presence i felt her tremble i remember the first exquisite touch of her soft cheek how strange it was that in conquest the tumult of my being should be stilled that my passion should be transmuted into awe that thrilled yet disquieted what had i done it was as though i had suddenly entered an unimagined sanctuary filled with holy flame  presently when we began to talk i found myself seeking more familiar levels i asked her why she had so long resisted me accusing her of having loved me all the time  yes i think i did hugh onlyi didnt know it  you must have felt something that afternoon when i first proposed to you  you didnt really want me hugh not then  surprised and a little uncomfortable at this evidence of intuition i started to protest it seemed to me then as though i had always wanted her  no no she exclaimed you didnt you were carried away by your feelingsyou hadnt made up your mind indeed i cant see why you want me now  you believe i do i said and drew her toward me  yes ii believe it now but i cant see why there must be so many attractive girls in the city who know so much more than i do  i sought fervidly to reassure her on this point at length when we went into the house she drew away from me at arms length and gave me one long searching look as though seeking to read my soul  hugh you will always love meto the very end wont you  yes i whispered always  in the library one on each side of the table under the lamp ezra hutchins and his wife sat reading mrs hutchins looked up and i saw that she had divined  mother i am engaged to hugh maude said and bent over and kissed her ezra and i stood gazing at them then he turned to me and pressed my hand  well i never saw the man who was good enough for her hugh but god bless you my son i hope you will prize her as we prize her  mrs hutchins embraced me and through her tears she too looked long into my face when she had released me ezra had his watch in his hand  if youre going on the ten oclock train hugh  father maude protested laughing i must say i dont call that very polite  in the train i slept but fitfully awakening again and again to recall the extraordinary fact that i was now engaged to be married to go over the incidents of the evening indifferent to the backings and the bumpings of the car the voices in the stations the clanging of locomotive bells and all the incomprehensible startings and stoppings exalted yet troubled i beheld maude luminous with the love i had amazingly awakened a love somewhere beyond my comprehension for her indeed marriage was made in heaven but for me could i rise now to the ideal that had once been mine thrust henceforth evil out of my life love forever live always in this sanctuary she had made for me would the time come when i should feel a sense of bondage  the wedding was set for the end of september i continued to go every week to elkington and in august maude and i spent a fortnight at the sea there could be no doubt as to my mothers happiness as to her approval of maude they loved each other from the beginning i can picture them now sitting together with their sewing on the porch of the cottage at mattapoisett out on the bay little whitecaps danced in the sunlight sailboats tacked hither and thither the strong cape breeze laden with invigorating salt stirred maudes hair and occasionally played havoc with my papers  she is just the wife for you hugh my mother confided to me if i had chosen her myself i could not have done better she added with a smile  i was inclined to believe it but maude would have none of this illusion  he just stumbled across me she insisted  we went on long sails together towards woods hole and the open sea the sprays washing over us her cheeks grew tanned sometimes when i praised her and spoke confidently of our future she wore a troubled expression  what are you thinking about i asked her once  you mustnt put me on a pedestal she said gently i want you to see me as i ami dont want you to wake up some day and be disappointed ill have to learn a lot of things and youll have to teach me i cant get used to the fact that you who are so practical and successful in business should be such a dreamer where i am concerned  i laughed and told her comfortably that she was talking nonsense  what did you think of me when you first knew me i inquired  well she answered with the courage that characterized her i thought you were rather calculating that you put too high a price on success of course you attracted me i own it  you hid your opinions rather well i retorted somewhat discomfited  she flushed  have you changed them i demanded  i think you have that side and i think it a weak side hugh its hard to tell you this but its better to say so now since you ask me i do think you set too high a value on success  well now that i know what success really is perhaps i shall reform i told her  i dont like to think that you fool yourself she replied with a perspicacity i should have found extraordinary  throughout my life there have been days and incidents some trivial some important that linger in my memory because they are saturated with atmosphere i recall for instance a gala occasion in youth when my mother gave one of her luncheon parties on my return from school the house and its surroundings wore a mysterious exciting and unfamiliar look somehow changed by the simple fact that guests sat decorously chatting in a diningroom shining with my mothers best linen and treasured family silver and china the atmosphere of my weddingday is no less vivid the house of ezra hutchins was scarcely recognizable its doors and windows were opened wide and all the morning people were being escorted upstairs to an allsignificant room that contained a collection like a jewellers exhibita bewildering display there was a massive punchbowl from which dangled the card of mr and mrs adolf scherer a really wonderful tea set of old english silver given by senator and mrs watling and nancy willett with her certainty of good taste had sent an old english tankard of the time of the second charles the secret was in that room and it magically transformed for me as i stood momentarily alone in the doorway where i had first beheld maude the accustomed scene and charged with undivined significance the blue shadows under the heavy foliage of the maples the september sunlight was heavy tinged with gold  so fragmentary and confused are the events of that day that a cubist literature were necessary to convey the impressions left upon me i had something of the feeling of a recruit who for the first time is taking part in a brilliant and complicated manoeuvre tom and susan peters flit across the view and gene hollister and perry blackwood and the ewansesall of whom had come up in a special car ralph hambleton was best man looking preternaturally tall in his frockcoat and his manner throughout the whole proceeding was one of goodnatured tolerance toward a folly none but he might escape  if you must do it hughie i suppose you must he had said to me ill see you through of course but dont blame me afterwards  maude was a little afraid of him  i dressed at georges then like one of those bewildering shifts of a cinematograph comes the scene in church the glimpse of my mothers wistful face in the front pew and i found myself in front of the austere mr doddridge standing beside maudeor rather beside a woman i tried hard to believe was maudeso veiled and generally encased was she i was thinking of this all the time i was mechanically answering mr doddridge and even when the wedding march burst forth and i led her out of the church it was as though they had done their best to disguise her to put our union on the otherworldly plane that was deemed to be its only justification to neutralize her sex at the very moment it should have been most enhanced well they succeeded if i had not been as conventional as the rest i should have preferred to have run away with her in the lavender dress she wore when i first proposed to her it was only when we had got into the carriage and started for the house and she turned to me her face from which the veil had been thrown back that i realized what a sublime meaning it all had for her her eyes were wet once more i was acutely conscious of my inability to feel deeply at supreme moments for months i had looked forward with anticipation and impatience to my weddingday  i kissed her gently but i felt as though she had gone to heaven and that the face i beheld enshrouded were merely her effigy commonplace words were inappropriate yet it was to these i resorted  wellit wasnt so bad after all was it  she smiled at me  you dont want to take it back  she shook her head  i think it was a beautiful wedding hugh im so glad we had a good day  she seemed shy at once very near and very remote i held her hand awkwardly until the carriage stopped  a little later we were standing in a corner of the parlour the atmosphere of which was heavy with the scent of flowers submitting to the onslaught of relatives then came the wedding breakfast croquettes champagne chicken salad icecream the weddingcake speeches and more kisses i remember tom peters holding on to both my hands  goodbye and god bless you old boy he was saying susan in view of the occasion had allowed him a little more champagne than usualenough to betray his feelings and i knew that these had not changed since our college days i resolved to see more of him i had neglected him and undervalued his loyalty he had followed me to my room in georges house where i was dressing for the journey and he gave it as his deliberate judgment that in maude i had struck gold  shes just the girl for you hughie he declared susan thinks so too  later in the afternoon as we sat in the stateroom of the car that was bearing us eastward maude began to cry i sat looking at her helplessly unable to enter into her emotion resenting it a little yet i tried awkwardly to comfort her  i cant bear to leave them she said  but you will see them often when we come back i reassured her it was scarcely the moment for reminding her of what she was getting in return this peculiar family affection she evinced was beyond me i had never experienced it in any poignant degree since i had gone as a freshman to harvard and yet i was struck by the fact that her emotions were so rightly placed it was natural to love ones family i began to feel vaguely as i watched her that the new relationship into which i had entered was to be much more complicated than i had imagined twilight was coming on the train was winding through the mountain passes crossing and recrossing a swift little stream whose banks were massed with alder here and there on the steep hillsides blazed the goldenrod presently i turned to surprise in her eyes a wide questioning lookthe look of a child even in this irrevocable hour she sought to grasp what manner of being was this to whom she had confided her life and with whom she was faring forth into the unknown the experience was utterly unlike my anticipation yet i responded the kiss i gave her had no passion in it  ill take good care of you maude i said  suddenly in the fading light she flung her arms around me pressing me tightly desperately  oh i know you will hugh dear and youll forgive me wont you for being so horrid today of all days i do love you  neither of us had ever been abroad and although it was before the days of swimmingpools and gymnasiums and a la carte cafes on ocean liners the atlantic was imposing enough maude had a more lasting capacity for pleasure than i a keener enjoyment of new experiences and as she lay beside me in the steamerchair where i had carefully tucked her she would exclaim  i simply cant believe it hugh it seems so unreal im sure i shall wake up and find myself back in elkington  dont speak so loud my dear i cautioned her there were some very formallooking new yorkers next us  no i wont she whispered but im so happy i feel as though i should like to tell everyone  theres no need i answered smiling  oh hugh i dont want to disgrace you she exclaimed in real alarm otherwise so far as i am concerned i shouldnt care who knew  people smiled at her women came up and took her hands and on the fourth day the formidable new yorkers unexpectedly thawed  i had once thought of maude as plastic then i had discovered she had a mind and will of her own once more she seemed plastic her love had made her so was it not what i had desired i had only to express a wish and it became her law nay she appealed to me many times a day to know whether she had made any mistakes and i began to drill her in my silly traditionsgently very gently  well i shouldnt be quite so familiar with people quite so ready to make acquaintances maude you have no idea who they may be some of them of course like the sardells i know by reputation  the sardells were the new yorkers who sat next us  ill try hugh to be more reserved more like the wife of an important man she smiled  it isnt that youre not reserved i replied ignoring the latter half of her remark nor that i want you to change i said i only want to teach you what little of the world i know myself  and i want to learn hugh you dont know how i want to learn  the sight of mistridden liverpool is not a cheering one for the american who first puts foot on the mother countrys soil a liverpool of yellowbrowns and dingy blacks of tilted funnels pouring out smoke into an atmosphere already charged with it the long wharves and shed roofs glistened with moisture  just think hugh its actually england she cried as we stood on the wet deck but i felt as though id been there before  no wonder theyre addicted to cold baths i replied they must feel perfectly at home in them especially if they put a little lampblack in the water  maude laughed  you grumpy old thing she exclaimed  nothing could dampen her ardour not the sight of the rainsoaked stone houses when we got ashore nor even the frigid luncheon we ate in the lugubrious hotel for her it was all quaint and new finally we found ourselves established in a compartment upholstered in light grey with tassels and armsupporters on the window of which was pasted a poster with the word reserved in large red letters the guard inquired respectfully as the porter put our new luggage in the racks whether we had everything we wanted the toy locomotive blew its toy whistle and we were off for the north past dingy yellow tenements of the smoking factory towns and stretches of orderly hedgespaced rainswept country the quaint cottages we glimpsed the sight of distant stately mansions on green slopes caused maude to cry out with raptureoh hugh theres a manorhouse  more vivid than were the experiences themselves of that journey are the memories of them we went to windswept sabbathkeeping edinburgh to high stirling and dark holyrood and to abbotsford it was through sir walters eyes we beheld melrose bathed in autumn light by his aid repeopled it with forgotten monks eating their fastday kale  and as we sat reading and dreaming in the still sunny corners i forgot that struggle for power in which i had been so furiously engaged since leaving cambridge legislatures politicians and capitalists receded into a dim background and the gift i had possessed in youth of living in a realm of fancy showed astonishing signs of revival  why hugh maude exclaimed you ought to have been a writer  youve only just begun to fathom my talents i replied laughingly did you think youd married just a dry old lawyer  i believe you capable of anything she said  i grew more and more to depend on her for little things  she was a born housewife it was pleasant to have her do all the packing while i read or sauntered in the queer streets about the inns and she took complete charge of my wardrobe  she had a talent for drawing and as we went southward through england she made sketches of the various houses that took our fancysuggestions for future homebuilding we spent hours in the evenings in the inn sittingrooms incorporating new features into our residence continually modifying our plans now it was a tudor house that carried us away now a jacobean and again an early georgian with enfolding wings and a wroughtiron grill a stage of bewilderment succeeded  maude i knew loved the cottages best she said they were more homelike but she yielded to my liking for grandeur  my i should feel lost in a palace like that she cried as we gazed at the marquis of soandsos countryseat  well of course we should have to modify it i admitted perhapsperhaps our family will be larger  she put her hand on my lips and blushed a fiery red  we examined with other tourists at a shilling apiece historic mansions with endless drawingrooms halls libraries galleries filled with family portraits elaborate formal bedrooms where famous sovereigns had slept all roped off and carpeted with canvas strips to protect the floors through mullioned windows we caught glimpses of gardens and geometrical parterres lakes fountains statuary fantastic topiary and distant stretches of park maude sighed with admiration but did not covet she had me but i was often uncomfortable resenting the vulgar gaping tourists with whom we were herded and the easy familiarity of the guides these did not trouble maude who often annoyed me by asking naive questions herself i would nudge her  one afternoon when with other compatriots we were being hurried through a famous castle the guide unwittingly ushered us into a drawingroom where the owner and several guests were seated about a teatable i shall never forget the stares they gave us before we had time precipitately to retreat nor the feeling of disgust and rebellion that came over me this was heightened by the remark of a heavy sixfoot ohioan with an infantile face and a genial manner  i notice that they didnt invite us to sit down and have a bite he said i call that kind of inhospitable  it was is lordship himself exclaimed the guide scandalized  you dont say drawled our fellowcountryman i guess i owe you another shilling my friend  the guide utterly bewildered accepted it the transatlantic point of view towards the nobility was beyond him  his lordship could make a nice little income if he set up as a side show added the ohioan  maude giggled but i was furious and no sooner were we outside the gates than i declared i should never again enter a private residence by the back door  why hugh how queer you are sometimes she said  i maybe queer but i have a sense of fitness i retorted  she asserted herself  i cant see what difference it makes they didnt know us and if they admit people for money  i cant help it and as for the man from ohio  but he was so funny she interrupted and he was really very nice  i was silent her point of view eminently sensible as it was exasperated me we were leaning over the parapet of a littlestone bridge her face was turned away from me but presently i realized that she was crying men and women villagers passing across the bridge looked at us curiously i was miserable and somewhat appalled resentful yet striving to be gentle and conciliatory i assured her that she was talking nonsense that i loved her but i did not really love her at that moment nor did she relent as easily as usual it was not until we were together in our sittingroom a few hours later that she gave in i felt a tremendous sense of relief  hugh ill try to be what you want you know i am trying but dont kill what is natural in me  i was touched by the appeal and repentant  it is impossible to say when the little worries annoyances and disagreements began when i first felt a restlessness creeping over me i tried to hide these moods from her but always she divined them and yet i was sure that i loved maude in a surprisingly short period i had become accustomed to her dependent on her ministrations and the normal cosy intimacy of our companionship i did not like to think that the keen edge of the enjoyment of possession was wearing a little while at the same time i philosophized that the divine fire when legalized settles down to a comfortable glow the desire to go home that grew upon me i attributed to the irritation aroused by the spectacle of a fixed social order commanding such unquestioned deference from the many who were content to remain resignedly outside of it before the setting in of the liberal movement and the american invasion england was a country in which from my point of view one must be somebody in order to be happy i was somebody at home or at least rapidly becoming so  london was shrouded parliament had risen and the great houses were closed day after day we issued forth from a musty and highly respectable hotel near piccadilly to a gloomy tower a soggy hampton court or a mournful british museum our native longing for luxuryor rather my native longingimpelled me to abandon smiths hotel for a huge hostelry where our suite overlooked the thames where we ran across a man i had known slightly at harvard and other americans with whom we made excursions and dined and went to the theatre maude liked these persons i did not find them especially congenial my lifelong habit of unwillingness to accept what life sent in its ordinary course was asserting itself but maude took her friends as she found them and i was secretly annoyed by her lack of discrimination in addition to this the sense of having been pulled up by the roots grew upon me  suppose maude surprised me by suggesting one morning as we sat at breakfast watching the river craft flit like phantoms through the yellowgreen fogsuppose we dont go to france after all hugh  not go to france i exclaimed are you tired of the trip  oh hugh her voice caught i could go on always if you were content  andwhat makes you think that im not content  her smile had in it just a touch of wistfulness  i understand you hugh better than you think you want to get back to your work andand i should be happier im not so silly and so ignorant as to think that i can satisfy you always and id like to get settled at homei really should  there surged up within me a feeling of relief i seized her hand as it lay on the table  well come abroad another time and go to france i said maude youre splendid  she shook her head  oh no im not  you do satisfy me i insisted it isnt that at all but i think perhaps it would be wiser to go back its rather a crucial time with me now that mr watlings in washington ive just arrived at a position where i shall be able to make a good deal of money and later on  it isnt the money hugh she cried with a vehemence which struck me as a little odd i sometimes think wed be a great deal happier withoutwithout all you are going to make  i laughed  well i havent made it yet  she possessed the frugality of the hutchinses and some times my lavishness had frightened her as when we had taken the suite of rooms we now occupied  are you sure you can afford them hugh she had asked when we first surveyed them  i began married life and carried it on without giving her any conception of the state of my finances she had an allowance from the first  as the steamer slipped westward my spirits rose to reach a climax of exhilaration when i saw the towers of new york rise gleaming like huge stalagmites in the early winter sun maude likened them more happilyto gigantic ivory chessmen well new york was americas chessboard and the great players had already begun to make moves that astonished the world as we sat at breakfast in a fifth avenue hotel i ran my eye eagerly over the stockmarket reports and the financial news and rallied maude for a lack of spirits  arent you glad to be home i asked her as we sat in a hansom  of course i am hugh she protested buti cant look upon new york as home somehow it frightens me  i laughed indulgently  youll get used to it i said well be coming here a great deal off and on  she was silent but later when we took a hansom and entered the streams of traffic she responded to the stimulus of the place the movement the colour the sight of the wellappointed carriages of the wellfed wellgroomed people who sat in them the enticement of the shops in which we made our purchases had their effect and she became cheerful again  in the evening we took the limited for home  we lived for a month with my mother and then moved into our own house it was one which i had rented from howard ogilvy and it stood on the corner of baker and clinton streets near that fashionable neighbourhood called the heights ogilvy who was some ten years older than i and who belonged to one of our old families had embarked on a career then becoming common but which at first was regarded as somewhat meteoric gradually abandoning the practice of law and perceiving the possibilities of the city of his birth he had gambled in real estate and other enterprises such as our local water company until he had quadrupled his inheritance he had built a mansion on grant avenue the wide thoroughfare bisecting the heights the house he had vacated was not large but essentially distinctive with the oddity characteristic of the revolt against the banal architecture of the 80s the curves of the tiled roof enfolded the upper windows the walls were thick the note one of mystery i remember maudes naive delight when we inspected it  youd never guess what the inside was like would you hugh she cried  from the panelled box of an entrance hall one went up a few steps to a drawingroom which had a bowed recess like an oriel and windowseats the diningroom was an odd shape and was wainscoted in oak it had a tiled fireplace and according to maude the sweetest china closet built into the wall there was a den for me and an octagonal receptionroom on the corner upstairs the bedrooms were quite as unusual the plumbing of the new pattern heavy and imposing maude expressed the air of seclusion when she exclaimed that she could almost imagine herself in one of the mediaeval towns we had seen abroad  its a dream hugh she sighed butdo you think we can afford it  this house i announced smiling is only a steppingstone to the palace i intend to build you some day  i dont want a palace she cried id rather live here like this always  a certain vehemence in her manner troubled me i was charmed by this disposition for domesticity and yet i shrank from the contemplation of its permanency i felt vaguely at the time the possibility of a future conflict of temperaments maude was docile now but would she remain docile and was it in her nature to take ultimately the position that was desirable for my wife well she must be moulded before it were too late her ultradomestic tendencies must be halted as yet blissfully unaware of the inability of the masculine mind to fathom the subtleties of feminine relationships i was particularly desirous that maude and nancy durrett should be intimates the very day after our arrival and while we were still at my mothers nancy called on maude and took her out for a drive maude told me of it when i came home from the office  dear old nancy i said i know you liked her  of course hugh i should like her for your sake anyway shesshes one of your oldest and best friends  but i want you to like her for her own sake  i think i shall said maude she was so scrupulously truthful i was a little afraid of her at first  afraid of nancy i exclaimed  well you know shes much older than i i think she is sweet but she knows so much about the worldso much that she doesnt say i cant describe it  i smiled  its only her manner youll get used to that when you know what she really is  oh i hope so answered maude im very anxious to like heri do like her but it takes me such a lot of time to get to know people  nancy asked us to dinner  i want to help maude all i canif shell let me nancy said  why shouldnt she let you i asked  she may not like me nancy replied  nonsense i exclaimed  nancy smiled  it wont be my fault at any rate if she doesnt she said i wanted her to meet at first just the right people your old friends and a few others it is hard for a womanespecially a young womancoming among strangers she glanced down the table to where maude sat talking to ham she has an air about hera great deal of selfpossession  i too had noticed this with pride and relief for i knew maude had been nervous  you are luckier than you deserve to be nancy reminded me but i hope you realize that she has a mind of her own that she will form her own opinions of people independently of you  i must have betrayed the fact that i was a little startled for the remark came as a confirmation of what i had dimly felt  of course she has i agreed somewhat lamely every woman has who is worth her salt  nancys smile bespoke a knowledge that seemed to transcend my own  you do like her i demanded  i like her very much indeed said nancy a little gravely shes simple shes real she has that which so few of us possess nowadayscharacter butive got to be prepared for the possibility that she may not get along with me  why not i demanded  there you are again with your old unwillingness to analyze a situation and face it for heavens sake now that you have married her study her dont take her for granted cant you see that she doesnt care for the things that amuse me that make my life  of course if you insist on making yourself out a hardened sophisticated woman i protested but she shook her head  her roots are deepershe is in touch though she may not realize it with the fundamentals she is one of those women who are racemakers  though somewhat perturbed i was struck by the phrase and i lost sight of nancys generosity she looked me full in the face  i wonder whether you can rise to her she said if i were you i should try you will be happierfar happier than if you attempt to use her for your own ends as a contributor to your comfort and an auxiliary to your career i was afraidi confess itthat you had married an aspiring simpering and emptyheaded provincial like that mrs george hutchins whom i met once and who would sell her soul to be at my table well you escaped that and you may thank god for it youve got a chance think it over  a chance i repeated though i gathered something of her meaning  think it over said nancy again and she smiled  butdo you want me to bury myself in domesticity i demanded without grasping the significance of my words  youll find her reasonable i think youve got a chance now hugh dont spoil it  she turned to leonard dickinson who sat on her other side  when we got home i tried to conceal my anxiety as to maudes impressions of the evening i lit a cigarette and remarked that the dinner had been a success  do you know what ive been wondering all evening maude asked why you didnt marry nancy instead of me  well i replied it just didnt come off and nancy was telling me at dinner how fortunate i was to have married you  maude passed this  i cant see why she accepted hambleton durrett it seems horrible that such a woman as she is could have marriedjust for money  nancy has an odd streak in her i said but then we all have odd streaks shes the best friend in the world when she is your friend  im sure of it maude agreed with a little note of penitence  you enjoyed it i ventured cautiously  oh yes she agreed and everyone was so nice to mefor your sake of course  dont be ridiculous i said i shant tell you what nancy and the others said about you  maude had the gift of silence  what a beautiful house she sighed presently i know youll think me silly but so much luxury as that frightens me a little in england in those places we saw it seemed natural enough but in america and they all your friendsseem to take it as a matter of course  theres no reason why we shouldnt have beautiful things and well served dinners too if we have the money to pay for them  i suppose not she agreed absently     xv  that winter many other entertainments were given in our honour but the conviction grew upon me that maude had no real liking for the social side of life that she acquiesced in it only on my account thus at the very outset of our married career an irritant developed signs of it indeed were apparent from the first when we were preparing the house we had rented for occupancy hurrying away from my office at odd times to furniture and department stores to help decide such momentous questions as curtains carpets chairs and tables i would often spy the tall uncompromising figure of susan peters standing beside maudes while an obliging clerk spread out anxiously rugs or wallpapers for their inspection  why dont you get nancy to help you too i ventured to ask her once  ours is such a little housecompared to nancys hugh  my attitude towards susan had hitherto remained undefined she was toms wife and toms affair in spite of her marked disapproval of the modern trend in business and social lifea prejudice she had communicated to tom as a bachelor i had not disliked her and it was certain that these views had not mitigated toms loyalty and affection for me susan had been my friend as had her brother perry and lucia perrys wife they made no secret of the fact that they deplored in me what they were pleased to call plutocratic obsessions nor had their disapproval always been confined to badinage nancy too they looked upon as a renegade i was able to bear their reproaches with the superior good nature that springs from success to point out why the american tradition to which they so fatuously clung was a things of the past the habit of taking dinner with them at least once a week had continued and their arguments rather amused me if they chose to dwell in a backwater out of touch with the current of great affairs this was a matter to be deplored but i did not feel strongly enough to resent it so long as i remained a bachelor the relationship had not troubled me but now that i was married i began to consider with some alarm its power to affect my welfare  it had remained for nancy to inform me that i had married a woman with a mind of her own i had flattered myself that i should be able to control maude to govern her predilections and now at the very beginning of our married life she was showing a disquieting tendency to choose for herself to be sure she had found my intimacy with the peterses and blackwoods already formed but it was an intimacy from which i was growing away i should not have quarrelled with her if she had not discriminated nancy made overtures and maude drew back susan presented herself and with annoying perversity and in an extraordinarily brief time maude had become her intimate it seemed to me that she was always at susans lunching or playing with the children who grew devoted to her or with susan choosing carpets and clothes while more and more frequently we dined with the peterses and the blackwoods or they with us with perrys wife maude was scarcely less intimate than with susan this was the more surprising to me since lucia blackwood was a dyedinthewool intellectual a graduate of radcliffe the daughter of a harvard professor perry had fallen in love with her during her visit to susan lucia was perhaps the most influential of the group she scorned the world she held strong views on the higher education of women she had long discarded orthodoxy for what may be called a cambridge stoicism of simple living and high thinking while maude was a strict presbyterian and not in the least given to theories when some months after our homecoming i ventured to warn her gently of the dangers of confining ones self to a coterieespecially one of such narrow viewsher answer was rather bewildering  but isnt tom your best friend she asked  i admitted that he was  and you always went there such a lot before we were married  this too was undeniable at the same time i replied i have other friends im fond of the blackwoods and the peterses im not advocating seeing less of them but their point of view if taken without any antidote is rather narrowing we ought to see all kinds i suggested with a fine restraint  you meanmore worldly people she said with her disconcerting directness  not necessarily worldly i struggled on people who know more of the worldyes who understand it better  maude sighed  i do try hughi return their callsi do try to be nice to them but somehow i dont seem to get along with them easilyim not myself they make me shy its because im provincial  nonsense i protested youre not a bit provincial and it was true her dignity and selfpossession redeemed her  nancy was not once mentioned but i think she was in both our minds  since my marriage too i had begun to resent a little the attitude of tom and susan and the blackwoods of humorous yet affectionate tolerance toward my professional activities and financial creed though maude showed no disposition to take this seriously i did suspect however that they were more and more determined to rescue maude from what they would have termed a frivolous career and on one of these occasionsso exasperating in married life when a slight cause for pique tempts husband or wife to try to ask myself whether this affair were only a squall something to be looked for once in a while on the seas of matrimony and weathered or whether maude had not after all been right when she declared that i had made a mistake and that we were not fitted for one another in this gloomy view endless years of incompatibility stretched ahead and for the first time i began to rehearse with a certain cold detachment the chain of apparently accidental events which had led up to my marriage to consider the gradual blindness that had come over my faculties and finally to wonder whether judgment ever entered into sexual selection would maude have relapsed into this senseless fit if she had realized how fortunate she was for i was prepared to give her what thousands of women longed for position and influence my resentment rose again against perry and tom and i began to attribute their lack of appreciation of my achievements to jealousy they had not my ability this was the long and short of it i pondered also regretfully on my bachelor days and for the first time i who had worked so hard to achieve freedom felt the pressure of the yoke i had fitted over my own shoulders i had voluntarily though unwittingly returned to slavery this was what had happened and what was to be done about it i would not consider divorce  well i should have to make the best of it whether this conclusion brought on a mood of reaction i am unable to say i was still annoyed by what seemed to the masculine mind a senseless and dramatic performance on maudes part an incomprehensible case of nerves nevertheless there stole into my mind many recollections of maudes affection many passages between us and my eye chanced to fall on the inkwell she had bought me out of the allowance i gave her an unanticipated pity welled up within me for her loneliness her despair in that room upstairs i got upand hesitated a counteracting inhibiting wave passed through me i hardened i began to walk up and down a prey to conflicting impulses something whispered go to her another voice added for your own peace of mind at any rate i rejected the intrusion of this motive as unworthy turned out the light and groped my way upstairs the big clock in the hall struck twelve  i listened outside the door of the bedroom but all was silent within i knocked  maude i said in a low voice  there was no response  maudelet me in i didnt mean to be unkindim sorry  after an interval i heard her say id rather stay heretonight  but at length after more entreaty and selfabasement on my part she opened the door the room was dark we sat down together on the windowseat and all at once she relaxed and her head fell on my shoulder and she began weeping again i held her the alternating moods still running through me  hugh she said at length how could you be so cruel when you know i love you and would do anything for you  i didnt mean to be cruel maude i answered  i know you didnt but at times you seem soindifferent and you cant understand how it hurts i havent anybody but you now and its in your power to make me happy oror miserable  later on i tried to explain my point of view to justify myself  all i mean i concluded at length is that my position is a little different from perrys and toms they can afford to isolate themselves but im thrown professionally with the men who are building up this city some of them like ralph hambleton and mr ogilvy ive known all my life life isnt so simple for us maudewe cant ignore the social side  i understand she said contentedly you are more of a man of affairsmuch more than tom or perry and you have greater responsibilities and wider interests im really very proud of you onlydont you think you are a little too sensitive about yourself when you are teased  i let this pass  i give a paragraph from a possible biography of hugh paret which as then seemed not improbable might in the future have been written by some aspiring young worshipper of success  on his return from a brief but delightful honeymoon in england mr paret took up again with characteristic vigour the practice of the law he was entering upon the prime years of manhood golden opportunities confronted him as indeed they confronted other menbut paret had the foresight to take advantage of them and his training under theodore watling was now to produce results the reputations had already been made of some of that remarkable group of financial geniuses who were chiefly instrumental in bringing about the industrial evolution begun after the civil war at the same time as is well known a political leadership developed that gave proof of a deplorable blindness to the logical necessity of combinations in business the lawyer with initiative and brains became an indispensable factor etc etc  the biography might have gone on to relate my association with and important services to adolf scherer in connection with his constructive dream shortly after my return from abroad in answer to his summons i found him at heinrichs his napkin tucked into his shirt front and a dish of his favourite sausages before him  so the honeymoon is over he said and pressed my hand you are right to come back to business and after awhile you can have another honeymoon eh i have had many since i married and how long do you think was my first a day i was a foreman then and the wedding was at six oclock in the morning we went into the country the wife and i  he laid down his knife and fork possessed by the memory i have grown rich since and weve been to europe and back to germany and travelled on the best ships and stayed at the best hotels but i never enjoyed a holiday more than that day it wasnt long afterwards i went to mr durrett and told him how he could save much money he was always ready to listen mr durrett when an employee had anything to say he was a big manan ironmaster ah he would be astonished if only he could wake up now  he would not only have to be an ironmaster i agreed but a financier and a railroad man to boot  a jack of all trades laughed mr scherer thats what we aremen in my position well it was comparatively simple then when we had no sherman law and crazy statutes such as some of the states are passing to bother us what has got into the politicians that they are indulging in such foolishness he exclaimed more warmly we try to build up a trade for this country and theyre doing their best to tie our hands and tear it down when i was in washington the other day i was talking with one of those western senators whose state has passed those laws he said to me mr scherer ive been making a study of the boyne iron works you are clever men but you are building up monopolies which we propose to stop by what means i asked rebates for one said he you get preferential rates from your railroad which give you advantages over your competitors foolishness mr scherer exclaimed i tell him the railroad is a private concern built up by private enterprise and it has a right to make special rates for large shippers norailroads are public carriers with no right to make special rates i ask him what else he objects to and he says patented processes as if we dont have a right to our own patents we buy them i buy them when other steel companies wont touch em what is that but enterprise and business foresight and taking risks and then he begins to talk about the tariff taking money out of the pockets of american consumers and making men like me rich i have come to washington to get the tariff raised on steel rails and watling and other senators we send down there are raising it for us we are building up monopolies well suppose we are we cant help it even if we want to has he ever made a study of the other side of the questionthe competition side of course he hasnt  he brought down his beer mug heavily on the table in times of excitement his speech suggested the german idiom abruptly his air grew mysterious he glanced around the room now becoming empty and lowered his voice  i have been thinking a long time i have a little scheme he said and i have been to washington to see watling to talk over it well he thinks much of you fowndes and ripon are good lawyers but they are not smart like you see paret he says and he can come down and talk to me so i ask you to come here that is why i say you are wise to get home honeymoons can waiteh  i smiled appreciatively  they talk about monopoly those populist senators but i ask you what is a man in my place to do if you dont eat somebody eats youis it not so like the boaconstrictorsthat is modern business look at the keystone plate people over there at morris for years we sold them steel billets from which to make their plates and three months ago they serve notice on us that they are getting ready to make their own billets they buy mines north of the lakes and are building their plant here is a big customer gone next year maybe the empire tube company goes into the business of making crude steel and many more thousands of tons go from us what is left for us paret  obviously youve got to go into the tube and plate business yourselves i said  so cried mr scherer triumphantly or it is close up we are not fools no we will not lie down and be eaten like lambs for any law dickinson can put his hand on the capital and ii have already bought a tract on the lakes at bolivar i have already got a plant designed with the latest modern machinery i can put the ore right there i can send the coke back from here in cars which would otherwise be empty and manufacture tubes at eight dollars a ton less than they are selling if we can make tubes we can make plates and if we can make plates we can make boilers and beams and girders and bridges it is not like it was but where is it all leading my friend the time will comeis right on us now in respect to many productswhen the market will be flooded with tubes and plates and girders and then well have to find a way to limit production and the inefficient mills will all be forced to shut down  the logic seemed unanswerable even had i cared to answer it he unfolded his campaign the boyne iron works was to become the boyne iron works ltd owner of various subsidiary companies some of which were as yet blissfully ignorant of their fate all had been thought out as calmly as the partition of polandonly lawyers were required and ultimately after the process of acquisition should have been completed a delicate document was to be drawn up which would pass through the meshes of that annoying statutory net the sherman antitrust law new mines were to be purchased extending over a certain large area wide coal deposits little strips of railroad to tap them the competition of the keystone plate people was to be met by acquiring and bringing up to date the plate mills of king and son over the borders of a sister state the somersworth bridge and construction company and the gring steel and wire company were to be absorbed when all of this should have been accomplished there would be scarcely a process in the steel industry from the smelting of the ore to the completion of a bridge which the boyne iron works could not undertake such was the beginning of the lateral extension period  two can play at that game mr scherer said and if those fellows could only be content to let well enough alone to continue buying their crude steel from us there wouldnt be any trouble  it was evident however that he really welcomed the trouble that he was going into battle with enthusiasm he had already picked out his points of attack and was marching on them life for him would have been a poor thing without new conflicts to absorb his energy and he had already made of the boyne iron works with its openhearth furnaces a marvel of modern efficiency that had opened the eyes of the steel world and had drawn the attention of a personality in new yorka personality who was one of the new and dominant type that had developed with such amazing rapidity the bankerdinosaur preying upon and superseding the industrialdinosaur conquering type of the preceding age builder of the railroads mills and manufactories the bankerdinosaurs the gigantic ones were in wall street and strove among themselves for the industrial spoils accumulated by their predecessors it was characteristic of these monsters that they never fought in the open unless they were forced to then the earth rocked huge economic structures tottered and fell and much dust arose to obscure the vision of smaller creatures who were bewildered and terrified such disturbances were called panics and were blamed by the newspapers on the democratic party or on the reformers who had wantonly assailed established institutions these dominant bankers had contrived to gain control of the savings of thousands and thousands of fellowcitizens who had deposited them in banks or paid them into insurance companies and with the power thus accumulated had sallied forth to capture railroads and industries the railroads were the strategic links with these in hand certain favoured industrial concerns could be fed and others starved into submission  adolf scherer might be said to represent a transitional type for he was not only an ironmaster who knew every detail of his business who kept it ahead of the times he was also a strategist wise in his generation making friends with the railroad while there had yet been time at length securing rebates and favours and when that railroad which had been constructed through the enterprise and courage of such men as nathaniel durrett had passed under the control of the bankerpersonality to whom i have referred and had become part of a system adolf scherer remained in alliance and continued to receive favours i can well remember the time when the ultimate authority of our railroad was transferred quietly to wall street alexander barbour its president had been a great man but after that he bowed in certain matters to a greater one  i have digressed mr scherer unfolded his scheme talking about units as calmly as though they were checkers on a board instead of huge fiery reverberating mills where thousands and thousands of human beings toiled day and nightbeings with families and hopes and fears whose destinies were to be dominated by the will of the man who sat opposite me butdid not he in his own person represent the triumph of that american creed of opportunity he too had been through the fire had sweated beside the blasts had handled the ingots of steel he was one of the fittest who had survived and looked it had he no memories of the terrors of that struggle adolf scherer had grown to be a giant and yet without me without my profession he was a helpless giant at the mercy of those alert and vindictive lawmakers who sought to restrain and hamper him to check his growth with their webs how stimulating the idea of his dependence how exhilarating too the thought that that vision which had first possessed me as an undergraduateon my visit to jerry kymewas at last to be realized i had now become the indispensable associate of the few who divided the spoils i was to have a share in these myself  youre young paret mr scherer concluded but watling has confidence in you and you will consult him frequently i believe in the young men and i have already seen something of youso  when i returned to the office i wrote theodore watling a letter expressing my gratitude for the position he had so to speak willed me of confidential legal adviser to adolf scherer though the opportunity had thrust itself upon me suddenly and sooner than i expected it i was determined to prove myself worthy of it i worked as i had never worked before making trips to new york to consult leading members of this new branch of my profession there trips to washington to see my former chief there were too numerous conferences with local personages with mr dickinson and mr grierson and judah b tallantwhose newspaper was most useful there were consultations and negotiations of a delicate nature with the owners and lawyers of other companies to be taken in nor was it all legal work in the older and narrower sense men who are playing for principalities are making war some of our operations had all the excitement of war there was information to be got and it was gotsomehow modern war involves a spy system and a friendly telephone company is not to be despised and all of this work from first to last had to be done with extreme caution moribund distinctions of right and wrong did not trouble me for the modern man labours religiously when he knows that evolution is on his side  for all of these operations a corps of counsel had been employed including the firm of harrington and bowes next to theodore watling joel harrington was deemed the ablest lawyer in the city we organized in due time the corporation known as the boyne iron works limited a trust agreement was drawn up that was a masterpiece of its kind one that caused first and last meddling officials in the department of justice at washington no little trouble and perplexity i was proud of the fact that i had taken no small part in its composition in short in addition to certain emoluments and opportunities for investment i emerged from the affair firmly established in the good graces of adolf scherer and with a reputation practically made  a year or so after the boyne company ltd came into existence i chanced one morning to go down to the new ashuela hotel to meet a new yorker of some prominence and was awaiting him in the lobby when i overheard a conversation between two commercial travellers who were sitting with their backs to me  did you notice that fellow who went up to the desk a moment ago asked one  the young fellow in the grey suit sure who is he he looks as if he was pretty well fixed  i guess he is replied the first thats paret hes scherers confidential counsel he used to be senator watlings partner but they say hes even got something on the old man  in spite of the feverish life i led i was still undoubtedly younglooking and in this i was true to the incoming type of successful man our fathers appeared staid at six and thirty clothes of course made some difference and my class and generation did not wear the sombre and cumbersome kind with skirts and tails i patronized a tailor in new york my chestnut hair a little darker than my fathers had been showed no signs of turning grey although it was thinning a little at the crown of the forehead and i wore a small moustache clipped in a straight line above the mouth this made me look less like a college youth thanks to a strong pigment in my skin derived probably from scotchirish ancestors my colour was fresh i have spoken of my life as feverish and yet i am not so sure that this word completely describes it it was full to overflowingone side of it and i did not miss save vaguely in rare moments of weariness any other side that might have been developed i was busy all day long engaged in affairs i deemed to be alone of vital importance in the universe i was convinced that the welfare of the city demanded that supreme financial power should remain in the hands of the group of men with whom i was associated and whose battles i fought in the courts in the legislature in the city council and sometimes in washingtonalthough they were well cared for there by every means ingenuity could devise their enemies were to be driven from the field and they were to be protected from blackmail  a sense of importance sustained me and i remember in that first flush of a success for which i had not waited too longwhat a secret satisfaction it was to pick up the era and see my name embedded in certain dignified notices of board meetings transactions of weight or cases known to the initiated as significant mr scherers interests were taken care of by mr hugh paret the fact that my triumphs were modestly set forth gave me more pleasure than if they had been trumpeted in headlines although i might have started out in practice for myself my affection and regard for mr watling kept me in the firm which became watling fowndes and paret and a new arrangement was entered into mr ripon retired on account of ill health  there were instances however when a certain amount of annoying publicity was inevitable such was the famous galligan case which occurred some three or four years after my marriage aloysius galligan was a brakeman and his legs had become paralyzed as the result of an accident that was the result of defective sills on a freight car he had sued and been awarded damages of 15000 to the amazement and indignation of miller gorse the supreme court to which the railroad had appealed affirmed the decision it wasnt the single payment of 15000 that the railroad cared about of course a precedent might be established for compensating maimed employees which would be expensive in the long run carelessness could not be proved in this instance gorse sent for me i had been away with maude at the sea for two months and had not followed the case  youve got to take charge paret and get a rehearing see bering and find out who in the deuce is to blame for this chesleys one of course we ought never to have permitted his nomination for the supreme bench it was against my judgment but varney and gill assured me that he was all right  i saw judge bering that evening we sat on a plush sofa in the parlour of his house in baker street  i had a notion gorsed be mad he said but it looked to me as if they had it on us paret i didnt see how we could do anything else but affirm without being too rank of course if he feels that way and you want to make a motion for a rehearing ill see what can be done  somethings got to be done i replied cant you see what such a decision lets them in for  all right said the judge who knew an order when he heard one i guess we can find an error he was not a little frightened by the report of mr gorses wrath for electionday was approaching say you wouldnt take me for a sentimental man now would you  i smiled at the notion of it  well ill own up to you this kind of got under my skin that galligan is a finelooking fellow if there ever was one and hell never be of a bit of use any more of course the case was plain sailing and they ought to have had the verdict but that lawyer of his handled it to the queens taste if i do say so he made me feel real bad by godas if it was my own son ed whod been battered up lord i cant forget the look in that man galligans eyes i hate to go through it again and reverse it but i guess ill have to now  the judge sat gazing at the flames playing over his gas log  who was the lawyer i asked  a man by the name of krebs he replied never heard of him before hes just moved to the city  this city i ejaculated  the judge glanced at me interestedly  this city of course what do you know about him  well i answered when i had recovered a little from the shockfor it was a distinct shockhe lived in elkington he was the man who stirred up the trouble in the legislature about bill 709  the judge slapped his knee  that fellow he exclaimed and ruminated why didnt somebody tell me he added complainingly why didnt miller gorse let me know about it instead of licking up a fuss after its all over  of all men of my acquaintance i had thought the judge the last to grow maudlin over the misfortunes of those who were weak or unfortunate enough to be defeated and crushed in the struggle for existence and it was not without food for reflection that i departed from his presence to make mr bering feel bad was no small achievement and krebs had been responsible for it of coursenot galligan krebs had turned up once more it seemed as though he were destined to haunt me well i made up my mind that he should not disturb me again at any rate i at least had learned to eliminate sentimentality from business and it was not without deprecation i remembered my experience with him at the capital when he had made me temporarily ashamed of my connection with bill 709 i had got over that and when i entered the court room the tribunal having graciously granted a rehearing on the ground that it had committed an error in the law my feelings were of lively curiosity and zest i had no disposition to underrate his abilities but i was fortified by the consciousness of a series of triumphs behind me by a sense of association with prevailing forces against which he was helpless i could afford to take a superior attitude in regard to one who was destined always to be dramatic  as the case proceeded i was rather disappointed on the whole that he was not dramaticnot even as dramatic as he had been when he defied the powers in the legislature he had changed but little he still wore illfitting clothes but i was forced to acknowledge that he seemed to have gained in selfcontrol in presence he had nodded at me before the case was called as he sat beside his maimed client and i had been on the alert for a hint of reproach in his glance there was none i smiled back at him  he did not rant he seemed to have rather a remarkable knowledge of the law in a conversational tone he described the sufferings of the man in the flannel shirt beside him but there could be no question of the fact that he did produce an effect the spectators were plainly moved and it was undeniable that some of the judges wore rather a sheepish look as they toyed with their watch chains or moved the stationery in front of them they had seen maimed men before they had heard impassioned sentimental lawyers talk about wives and families and god and justice krebs did none of this just how he managed to bring the thing home to those judges to make them ashamed of their role just how he managedin spite of my fortified attitude to revive something of that sense of discomfort i had experienced at the state house is difficult to say it was because i think he contrived through the intensity of his own sympathy to enter into the body of the man whose cause he pleaded to feel the despair in galligans soulan impression that was curiously conveyed despite the dignified limits to which he confined his speech it was strange that i began to be rather sorry for him that i felt a certain reluctant regret that he should thus squander his powers against overwhelming odds what was the use of it all  at the end his voice became more vibrantthough he did not raise itas he condemned the railroad for its indifference to human life for its contention that men were cheaper than rollingstock  i encountered him afterward in the corridor i had made a point of seeking him out perhaps from some vague determination to prove that our last meeting in the little restaurant at the capital had left no traces of embarrassment in me i was in fact rather aggressively anxious to reveal myself to him as one who has thriven on the views he condemned as one in whose unity of mind there is no rift he was alone apparently waiting for someone leaning against a steam radiator in one of his awkward angular poses looking out of the courthouse window  how are you i said blithely so youve left elkington for a wider field i wondered whether my alert cousininlaw george hutchins had made it too hot for him  he turned to me unexpectedly a face of profound melancholy his expression had in it oddly a trace of sternness and i was somewhat taken aback by this evidence that he was still bearing vicariously the troubles of his client so deep had been the thought i had apparently interrupted that he did not realize my presence at first  oh its you paret yes ive left elkington he said  something of a surprise to run up against you suddenly like this  i expected to see you he answered gravely and the slight emphasis he gave the pronoun implied not only a complete knowledge of the situation and of the part i had taken in it but also a greater rebuke than if his accusation had been direct but i clung to my affability  if i can do anything for you let me know i told him he said nothing he did not even smile at this moment he was opportunely joined by a man who had the appearance of a labour leader and i walked away i was resentful my mood in brief was that of a man who has done something foolish and is inclined to talk to himself aloud but the mood was complicated made the more irritating by the paradoxical fact that that last look he had given me seemed to have borne the traces of affection  it is perhaps needless to add that the court reversed its former decision     xvi  the pilot published a series of sensational articles and editorials about the galligan matter a picture of galligan an account of the destitute state of his wife and family the time had not yet arrived when such newspapers dared to attack the probity of our courts but a system of law that permitted such palpable injustice because of technicalities was bitterly denounced what chance had a poor man against such a moloch as the railroad even with a lawyer of such ability as had been exhibited by hermann krebs krebs was praised and the attention of mr lawlers readers was called to the fact that krebs was the man who some years before had opposed singlehanded in the legislature the notorious bill no 709 it was well known in certain circlesthe editorial went on to saythat this legislation had been drawn by theodore watling in the interests of the boyne iron works etc etc hugh paret had learned at the feet of an able master this first sight of my name thus opprobriously flung to the multitude gave me an unpleasant shock i had seen mr scherer attacked mr gorse attacked and mr watling i had all along realized vaguely that my turn would come and i thought myself to have acquired a compensating philosophy i threw the sheet into the waste basket presently picked it out again and reread the sentence containing my name well there were certain penalties that every career must pay i had become at last a marked man and i recognized the fact that this assault would be the forerunner of many  i tried to derive some comfort and amusement from the thought of certain operations of mine that mr lawler had not discovered that would have been matters of peculiar interest to his innocent public certain extralegal operations at the time when the bovine corporation was being formed for instance and how they would have licked their chops had they learned of that manoeuvre by which i had managed to have one of mr scherers subsidiary companies in another state with property and assets amounting to more than twenty millions reorganized under the laws of new jersey and the pending case thus transferred to the federal court where we won hands down this galligan affair was nothing to that nevertheless it was annoying as i sat in the street car on my way homeward a man beside me was reading the pilot i had a queer sensation as he turned the page and scanned the editorial and i could not help wondering what he and the thousands like him thought of me what he would say if i introduced myself and asked his opinion perhaps he did not think at all undoubtedly he and the public at large were used to mr lawlers daily display of injustices nevertheless like slow acid they must be eating into the public consciousness it was an outragethis freedom of the press  with renewed exasperation i thought of krebs of his disturbing and almost uncanny faculty of following me up why couldnt he have remained in elkington why did he have to follow me here to make capital out of a case that might never have been heard of except for him i was still in this disagreeable frame of mind when i turned the corner by my house and caught sight of maude in the front yard bending bareheaded over a bed of late flowers which the frost had spared the evening was sharp the dusk already gathering  youll catch cold i called to her  she looked up at the sound of my voice  theyll soon be gone she sighed referring to the flowers i hate winter  she put her hand through my arm and we went into the house the curtains were drawn a fire was crackling on the hearth the lamps were lighted and as i dropped into a chair this livingroom of ours seemed to take on the air of a refuge from the vague threatening sinister things of the world without i felt i had never valued it before maude took up her sewing and sat down beside the table  hugh she said suddenly i read something in the newspaper  my exasperation flared up again  where did you get that disreputable sheet i demanded  at the dressmakers she answered ii just happened to see the name paret  its just politics i declared stirring up discontent by misrepresentation jealousy  she leaned forward in her chair gazing into the flames  then it isnt true that this poor man galliganisnt that his namewas cheated out of the damages he ought to have to keep himself and his family alive  you must have been talking to perry or susan i said they seem to be convinced that i am an oppressor of the poor  hugh the tone in which she spoke my name smote me how can you say that how can you doubt their loyalty and mine do you think they would undermine you and to me behind your back  i didnt mean that of course maude i was annoyed about something else and tom and perry have an air of deprecating most of the enterprises in which i am professionally engaged its very well for them to talk all perry has to do is to sit back and take in receipts from the boyne street car line and tom is content if he gets a few commissions every week theyre like militiamen criticizing soldiers under fire i know theyre good friends of mine but sometimes i lose patience with them  i got up and walked to the window and came back again and stood before her  im sorry for this man galligan i went on i cant tell you how sorry but few people who are not on the inside so to speak grasp the fact that big corporations like the railroad are looked upon as fair game for every kind of parasite not a day passes in which attempts are not made to bleed them some of these cases are pathetic it had cost the railroad many times fifteen thousand dollars to fight galligans case but if they had paid it they would have laid themselves open to thousands of similar demands dividends would dwindle the stockholders have a right to a fair return on their money galligan claims that there was a defective sill on the car which is said to have caused the wreck if damages are paid on that basis it means the daily inspection of every car which passes over their lines and more than that there are certain defects as in the present case which an inspection would not reveal when a man accepts employment on a railroad he assumes a certain amount of personal riskits not precisely a chambermaids job and the lawyer who defends such cases whatever his personal feelings may be cannot afford to be swayed by them he must take the larger view  why didnt you tell me about it before she asked  well i didnt think it of enough importancethese things are all in the days work  but mr krebs how strange that he should be here connected with the case  i made an effort to control myself  your old friend i said i believe you have a sentiment about him  she looked up at me  scarcely that she replied gravely with the literalness that often characterized her but he isnt a person easily forgotten he may be queer one may not agree with his views but after the experience i had with him ive never been able to look at him in the way george does for instance or even as father does  or even as i do i supplied  well perhaps not even as you do she answered calmly i believe you once told me however that you thought him a fanatic but sincere  hes certainly a fanatic i exclaimed  but sincere hughyou still think him sincere  you seem a good deal concerned about a man youve laid eyes on but once  she considered this  yes it is surprising she admitted but its true i was sorry for him but i admired him i was not only impressed by his courage in taking charge of me but also by the trust and affection the workpeople showed he must be a good man however mistaken he may be in the methods he employs and life is cruel to those people  life islife i observed neither you nor i nor krebs is able to change it  has he come here to practice she asked after a moment  yes do you want me to invite him to dinner and seeing that she did not reply i continued in spite of my explanation i suppose you think because krebs defended the man galligan that a monstrous injustice has been done  that is unworthy of you she said bending over her stitch  i began to pace the room again as was my habit when overwrought  well i was going to tell you about this affair if you had not forestalled me by mentioning it yourself it isnt pleasant to be vilified by rascals who make capital out of vilification and a man has a right to expect some sympathy from his wife  did i ever deny you that hugh she asked only you dont ever seem to need it to want it  and there are things i pursued things in a mans province that a woman ought to accept from her husband things which in the very nature of the case she can know nothing about  but a woman must think for herself she declared she shouldnt become a mere automatonand these questions involve so much people are discussing them the magazines and periodicals are beginning to take them up  i stared at her somewhat appalled by this point of view there had indeed been signs of its development before now but i had not heeded them and for the first time i beheld maude in a new light  oh its not that i dont trust you she continued im open to conviction but i must be convinced your explanation of this galligan case seems a sensible one although its depressing but life is hard and depressing sometimes ive come to realize that i want to think over what youve said i want to talk over it some more why wont you tell me more of what you are doing if you only would confide in meas you have now i cant help seeing that we are growing farther and farther apart that business your career is taking all of you and leaving me nothing she faltered and went on again its difficult to tell you thisyou never give me the chance and its not for my sake alone but for yours too you are growing more and more selfcentred surrounding yourself with a hard shell you dont realize it but tom notices it perry notices it it hurts them its that they complain of hugh she cried appealingly sensing my resentment forestalling the words of defence ready on my lips i know that you are busy that many men depend on you it isnt that im not proud of you and your success but you dont understand what a woman cravesshe doesnt want only to be a good housekeeper a good mother but she wants to share a little at any rate in the life of her husband in his troubles as well as in his successes she wants to be of some little use of some little help to him  my feelings were reduced to a medley  but you are a help to mea great help i protested  she shook her head i wish i were she said  it suddenly occurred to me that she might be i was softened and alarmed by the spectacle she had revealed of the widening breach between us i laid my hand on her shoulder  well ill try to do better maude  she looked up at me questioningly yet gratefully through a mist of tears but her replywhatever it might have beenwas forestalled by the sound of shouts and laughter in the hallway she sprang up and ran to the door  its the children she exclaimed theyve come home from susans party  it begins indeed to look as if i were writing this narrative upside down for i have said nothing about children perhaps one reason for this omission is that i did not really appreciate them that i found it impossible to take the same minute interest in them as tom for instance who was apparently not content alone with the six which he possessed but had adopted mine one of them little sarah said uncle tom before father i do not mean to say that i had not occasional moments of tenderness toward them but they were out of my thoughts much of the time i have often wondered since how they regarded me how in their little minds they defined the relationship generally when i arrived home in the evening i liked to sit down before my study fire and read the afternoon newspapers or a magazine but occasionally i went at once to the nursery for a few moments to survey with complacency the medley of toys on the floor and to kiss all three they received my caresses with a certain shynessthe two younger ones at least as though they were at a loss to place me as a factor in the establishment they tumbled over each other to greet maude and even tom if i were an enigma to them what must they have thought of him sometimes i would discover him on the nursery floor with one or two of his own children building towers and castles and railroad stations or forts to be attacked and demolished by regiments of lead soldiers he was growing comfortablelooking if not exactly stout prematurely paternal oddly willing to renounce the fiercer joys of life the joys of acquisition of conquest of youth  youd better come home with me chickabiddy he would say that father of yours doesnt appreciate you hes too busy getting rich  chickabiddy was his name for little sarah half of the name stuck to her and when she was older we called her biddy  she would gaze at him questioningly her eyes like blue flower cups a strange little mixture of solemnity and bubbling mirth of shyness and impulsiveness she had fat legs that creased above the tops of the absurd little boots that looked to be too tight sometimes she rolled and tumbled in an ecstasy of abandon and again she would sit motionless as though absorbed in dreams her hair was like corn silk in the sun twisting up into soft curls after her bath when she sat rosily presiding over her supper table  as i look back over her early infancy i realize that i loved her although it is impossible for me to say how much of this love is retrospective why i was not mad about her every hour of the day is a puzzle to me now why indeed was i not mad about all three of them there were moments when i held and kissed them when something within me melted moments when i was away from them and thought of them but these moments did not last the something within me hardened again i became indifferent my family was wiped out of my consciousness as though it had never existed  there was matthew for instance the oldest when he arrived he was to maude a neverending miracle she would have his crib brought into her room and i would find her leaning over the bedside gazing at him with a rapt expression beyond my comprehension to me he was just a brickred morsel of humanity all folds and wrinkles and not at all remarkable in any way maude used to annoy me by getting out of bed in the middle of the night when he cried and at such times i was apt to wonder at the odd trick the lifeforce had played me and ask myself why i got married at all it was a queer method of carrying on the race later on i began to take a cursory interest in him to watch for signs in him of certain characteristics of my own youth which in the philosophy of my manhood i had come to regard as defects and it disturbed me somewhat to see these signs appear i wished him to be what i had become by force of willa fighter but he was a sensitive child anxious for approval not robust though spiritual rather than delicate even in comparative infancy he cared more for books than toys and his greatest joy was in being read to in spite of these traitsperhaps because of themthere was a sympathy between us from the time that he could talk the child seemed to understand me occasionally i surprised him gazing at me with a certain wistful look that comes back to me as i write  moreton tom used to call alexander the great because he was a fighter from the cradle beating his elder brother too considerate to strike back and likewisewhen opportunity offeredhis sister and appropriating their toys a selfsufficient doughty young man with the round head that withstands many blows taking by nature to competition and buccaneering in general i did not love him half so much as i did matthewif such intermittent emotions as mine may be called love it was a standing joke of minewhich maude strongly resentedthat moreton resembled cousin george of elkington  imbued with the highest ambition of my time i had set my barque on a great circle and almost before i realized it the barque was burdened with a wife and family and the steering had insensibly become more difficult for maude cared nothing about the destination and when i took any hand off the wheel our ship showed a tendency to make for a quiet harbour thus the social initiative which i believed should have been the womans was thrust back on me it was almost incredible yet indisputable in a day when most american women were credited with a craving for social ambition that i of all men should have married a wife in whom the craving was wholly absent she might have had what other women would have given their souls for there were many reasons why i wished her to take what i deemed her proper place in the community as my wifenot that i cared for what is called society in the narrow sense with me it was a logical part of a broader scheme of life an auxiliary rather than an essential but a needful auxiliary a means of dignifying and adorning the position i was taking not only that but i felt the need of intercourseof intercourse of a lighter and more convivial nature with men and women who saw life as i saw it in the evenings when we did not go out into that world our city afforded ennui took possession of me i had never learned to care for books i had no resources outside of my profession and when i was not working on some legal problem i dawdled over the newspapers and went to bed i dont mean to imply that our existence outside of our continued intimacy with the peterses and the blackwoods was socially isolated we gave little dinners that maude carried out with skill and taste but it was i who suggested them we went out to other dinners sometimes to nancysthough we saw less and less of hersometimes to other houses but maude had given evidence of domestic tastes and a disinclination for gaiety that those who entertained more were not slow to sense i should have liked to take a larger house but i felt the futility of suggesting it the children were still small and she was occupied with them meanwhile i beheld and at times with considerable irritation the social world changing growing larger and more significant a more important function of that higher phase of american existence the new century seemed definitely to have initiated a segregative process was away to which maude was wholly indifferent our city was throwing off its social conservatism wealth which implied ability and superiority was playing a greater part entertainments were more luxurious lines more strictly drawn we had an elaborate country club for those who could afford expensive amusements much of this transformation had been due to the initiative and leadership of nancy durrett  great and sudden wealth however if combined with obscure antecedents and questionable qualifications was still looked upon askance in spite of the fact that adolf scherer had put us on the map the family of the great ironmaster still remained outside of the social pale he himself might have entered had it not been for his wife who was supposed to be queer who remained at home in her house opposite gallatin park and made little german cakesa huge house which an unknown architect had taken unusual pains to make pretentious and hideous for it was rhenish moorish and victorian by turns its geometric grounds matched those of the park itself a monument to bad taste in landscape the neighbourhood was highly respectable and inhabited by families of german extraction there were two flaxenhaired daughters who had just graduated from an expensive boardingschool in new york where they had received the polish needful for future careers but the careers were not forthcoming  i was thrown constantly with adolf scherer i had earned his gratitude i had become necessary to him but after the great coup whereby he had fulfilled mr watlings prophecy and become the chief factor in our business world he began to show signs of discontent of an irritability that seemed foreign to his character and that puzzled me one day however i stumbled upon the cause of this fermentation to wonder that i had not discovered it before in many ways adolf scherer was a child we were sitting in the boyne club  moneyyes he exclaimed apropos of some demand made upon him by a charitable society they come to me for my moneythere is always scherer they say he will make up the deficit in the hospitals but what is it they do for me nothing do they invite me to their houses to their parties  this was what he wanted thensocial recognition i said nothing but i saw my opportunity i had the clew now to a certain attitude he had adopted of late toward me an attitude of reproach as though in return for his many favours to me there were something i had left undone and when i went home i asked maude to call on mrs scherer  on mrs scherer she repeated  yes i want you to invite them to dinner the proposal seemed to take away her breath i owe her husband a great deal and i think he feels hurt that the wives of the men he knows down town havent taken up his family i felt that it would not be wise with maude to announce my rather amazing discovery of the ironmasters social ambitions  but hugh they must be very happy they have their friends and after all this time wouldnt it seem like an intrusion  i dont think so i said im sure it would please him and them you know how kind hes been to us how he sent us east in his private car last year  of course ill go if you wish it if youre sure they feel that way she did make the call that very week and somewhat to my surprise reported that she liked mrs scherer and the daughters maudes likes and dislikes needless to say were not governed by matters of policy  you were right hugh she informed me almost with enthusiasm they did seem lonely and they were so glad to see me it was rather pathetic mr scherer it seems had talked to them a great deal about you they wanted to know why i hadnt come before that was rather embarrassing fortunately they didnt give me time to talk i never heard people talk as they do they all kissed me when i went away and came down the steps with me and mrs scherer went into the conservatory and picked a huge bouquet there it is she said laughingly pointing to several vases i separated the colours as well as i could when i got home we had coffee and the most delicious german cakes in the turkish room or the moorish room whichever it is im sure i shant be able to eat anything more for days when do you wish to have them for dinner  well i said we ought to have time to get the right people to meet them well ask nancy and ham  maude opened her eyes  nancy do you think nancy would like them  im going to give her a chance anyway i replied  it was in some ways a memorable dinner i dont know what i expected in mrs schererfrom maudes description a benevolent and somewhat stupid blueeyed german woman of peasant extraction there could be no doubt about the peasant extraction but when she hobbled into our little parlour with the aid of a stout goldheaded cane she dominated it her very lameness added to a distinction that evinced itself in a dozen ways her nose was hooked her colour highdespite the years in steelvilleher peculiar costume heightened the effect of her personality her firelit black eyes bespoke a spirit accustomed to rule and instead of being an aspirant for social honours she seemed to confer them conversation ceased at her entrance  im sorry we are late my dear she said as she greeted maude affectionately but we have far to come and this is your husband she exclaimed as i was introduced she scrutinized me i have heard something of you mr paret you are smart shall i tell you the smartest thing you ever did she patted maudes shoulder when you married your wifethat was it i have fallen in love with her if you do not know it i tell you  next nancy was introduced  so you are mrs hambleton durrett  nancy acknowledged her identity with a smile but the next remark was a bombshell  the leader of society  alas exclaimed nancy i have been accused of many terrible things  their glances met nancys was amused baffling like a spark in amber each in its way was redoubtable a greater contrast between two women could scarcely have been imagined it was well said and not snobbishly that generations had been required to make nancys figure she wore a dress of blue sheen the light playing on its ripples and as she stood apparently wholly at ease looking down at the wife of adolf scherer she reminded me of an expert swordsman who with remarkable skill was keeping a too pressing and determined aspirant at arms length i was keenly aware that maude did not possess this gift and i realized for the first time something of the similarity between nancys career and my own she too in her feminine sphere exercised and subtly a power in which human passions were deeply involved  if nancy durrett symbolized aristocracy established order and prestige what did mrs scherer represent not democracy mob rulecertainly the stocky german peasant woman with her tightly drawn hair and heavy jewels seemed grotesquely to embody something that ultimately would have its way a lusty and terrible force in the interests of which my own services were enlisted to which the old american element in business and industry the male counterpart of nancy willett had already succumbed and now it was about to storm the feminine fastnesses i beheld a woman who had come to this country with a shawl aver her head transformed into a new species of duchess sure of herself scorning the delicate euphemisms in which fancys kind were wont to refer to asocial realm that was no less real because its boundaries had not definitely been defined she held her stick firmly and gave nancy an indomitable look  i want you to meet my daughters gretchen anna come here and be introduced to mrs durrett  it was not without curiosity i watched these of the second generation as they made their bows noted the differentiation in the type for which an american environment and a finishing school had been responsible gretchen and anna had learnedin crises such as the presentto restrain the superabundant vitality they had inherited if their cheekbones were a little too high their delft blue eyes a little too small their colour was of the proverbial roseleaves and cream gene hollisters difficulty was to know which to marry they were nice girlsof that there could be no doubt there was no false modesty in their attitude toward society nor did they pretendas so many silly people did that they were not attempting to get anywhere in particular that it was less desirable to be in the centre than on the dubious outer walks they too were so glad to meet mrs durrett  nancys eyes twinkled as they passed on  you see what i have let you in for i said  my dear hugh she replied sooner or later we should have had to face them anyhow i have recognized that for some time with their money and mr scherers prestige and the will of that lady with the stick in a few years we should have had nothing to say why shes a female napoleon hildas the man of the family  after that nancy invariably referred to mrs scherer as hilda  if mrs scherer was a surprise to us her husband was a still greater one and i had difficulty in recognizing the adolf scherer who came to our dinner party as the personage of the business world before whom lesser men were wont to cringe he seemed rather mysteriously to have shed that personality become an awkward ingratiating rather too exuberant ordinary man with a marked german accent from time to time i found myself speculating uneasily on this phenomenon as i glanced down the table at his great torso white waistcoated for the occasion he was plainly making up to nancy and to mrs ogilvy who sat opposite him on the whole the atmosphere of our entertainment was rather electric hilda was chiefly responsible for this her frankness was of the breathtaking kind far from attempting to hide or ignore the struggle by which she and her husband had attained their present position she referred with the utmost naivete to incidents in her career while the whole table paused to listen  before we had a carriage yes it was hard for me to get about i had to be helped by the conductors into the streetcars i broke my hip when we lived in steelville and the doctor was a numbskull he should be put in prison is what i tell adolf i was standing on a clotheshorse when it fell i had much washing to do in those days  andcan nothing be done mrs scherer asked leonard dickinson sympathetically  for an old woman i am fiftyfive i have had many doctors i would put them all in prison how much was it you paid dr stickney in new york adolf five thousand dollars and he did nothingnothing id rather be poor again and work but it is well to make the best of it  your grandfather was a fine man mr durrett she informed hambleton it is a pity for you i think that you do not have to work  ham who sat on her other side was amused  my grandfather did enough work for both of us he said  if i had been your grandfather i would have started you in puddling she observed as she eyed with disapproval the filling of his third glass of champagne i think there is too much gay life too much games for rich young men nowadays you will forgive me for saying what i think to young men  ill forgive you for not being my grandfather at any rate replied ham with unaccustomed wit  she gazed at him with grim humour  it is bad for you i am not she declared  there was no gainsaying her what can be done with a lady who will not recognize that morality is not discussed and that personalities are tabooed save between intimates hilda was a personage as well as a tartar laws conventions usagesto all these she would conform when it pleased her she would have made an admirable inquisitorial judge and quite as admirable a sick nurse a rare criminal lawyer likewise was wasted in her she was one of those individuals i perceived whose loyalties dominate them and who in behalf of those loyalties carry chips on their shoulders  it is a long time that i have been wanting to meet you she informed me you are smart  i smiled yet i was inclined to resent her use of the word though i was by no means sure of the shade of meaning she meant to put into it i had indeed an uneasy sense of the scantiness of my fund of humour to meet and turn such a situation for i was experiencing now with her the same queer feeling i had known in my youth in the presence of cousin robert breckthe suspicion that this extraordinary person saw through me it was as though she held up a mirror and compelled me to look at my soul features i tried to assure myself that the mirror was distorted i lost nevertheless the sureness of touch that comes from the conviction of being all of a piece she contrived to resolve me again into conflicting elements i was for the moment no longer the selfconfident and triumphant young attorney accustomed to carry all before him to command respect and admiration but a complicated being whose unity had suddenly been split i glanced around the table at ogilvy at dickinson at ralph hambleton these men were functioning truly but was i if i were not might not this be the reason for the lack of synthesisof which i was abruptly though vaguely aware between my professional life my domestic relationships and my relationships with friends the loyalty of the woman beside me struck me forcibly as a supreme trait where she had given she did not withdraw she had conferred it instantly on maude did i feel that loyalty towards a single human being towards maude herselfmy wife or even towards nancy i pulled myself together and resolved to give her credit for using the word smart in its unobjectionable sense after all dickens had so used it  a lawyer must needs know something of what he is about mrs scherer if he is to be employed by such a man as your husband i replied  her black eyes snapped with pleasure  ah i suppose that is so she agreed i knew he was a great man when i married him and that was before mr nathaniel durrett found it out  but surely you did not think in those days that he would be as big as he has become that he would not only be president of the boyne iron works but of a boyne iron works that has exceeded mr durretts wildest dreams  she shook her head complacently  do you know what i told him when he married me i said adolf it is a pity you are born in germany and when he asked me why i told him that some day he might have been president of the united states  well that wont be a great deprivation to him i remarked mr scherer can do what he wants and the president cannot  adolf always does as he wants she declared gazing at him as he sat beside the brilliant wife of the grandson of the man whose redshirted foreman he had been he does what he wants and gets what he wants he is getting what he wants now she added with such obvious meaning that i found no words to reply she is pretty that mrs durrett and cleveris it not so  i agreed a new and indescribable note had come into mrs scherers voice and i realized that she too was aware of that flaw in the redoubtable mr scherer which none of his associates had guessed it would have been strange if she had not discovered it she is beautiful yes the lady continued critically but she is not to compare with your wife she has not the heartit is so with all your people of society for them it is not what you are but what you have done and what you have  the banality of this observation was mitigated by the feeling she threw into it  i think you misjudge mrs durrett i said incautiously she has never before had the opportunity of meeting mr scherer of appreciating him  mrs durrett is an old friend of yours she asked  i was brought up with her  ah she exclaimed and turned her penetrating glance upon me i was startled could it be that she had discerned and interpreted those renascent feelings even then stirring within me and of which i myself was as yet scarcely conscious at this moment fortunately for me the women rose the men remained to smoke and scherer as they discussed matters of finance became himself again i joined in the conversation but i was thinking of those instants when in flashes of understanding my eyes had met nancys instants in which i was lifted out of my humdrum deadly serious self and was able to look down objectively upon the life i led the life we all ledand nancy herself to see with her the comic irony of it all nancy had the power to give me this exquisite sense of detachment that must sustain her and was it not just this sustenance she could give that i needed for want of it i was hardening crystallizing growing blind to the joy and variety of existence nancy could have saved me she brought it home to me that i needed salvation i was struck by another thought in spite of our separation in spite of her marriage and mine she was still nearer to mefar nearerthan any other being  later i sought her out she looked up at me amusedly from the windowseat in our livingroom where she had been talking to the scherer girls  well how did you get along with hilda she asked i thought i saw you struggling  shes somewhat disconcerting i said i felt as if she were turning me inside out  nancy laughed  hildas a discoverya genius im going to have them to dinner myself  and adolf i inquired i believe she thought you were preparing to run away with him you seemed to have him hypnotized  im afraid your great man wont be able to standelevation she declared hell have vertigo hes even got it now at this little height and when he builds his palace on grant avenue and later moves to new york im afraid hell wobble even more  is he thinking of doing all that i asked  i merely predict new yorkits inevitable she replied grant avenue yes he wants me to help him choose a lot he gave me ten thousand dollars for our orphans home but on the whole i think i prefer hilda even if she doesnt approve of me  nancy rose the scherers were going while mr scherer pressed my hand in a manner that convinced me of his gratitude hilda was bidding an affectionate good night to maude a few moments later she bore her husband and daughters away and we heard the taptap of her cane on the walk outside     xvii  the remembrance of that dinner when with my connivance the scherers made their social debut is associated in my mind with the coming of the fulness of that era mad and brief when gold rained down like manna from our sooty skies even the church was prosperous the rev carey heddon our new minister was well abreast of the times typical of the new and efficient christianity that has finally buried the hatchet with enlightened selfinterest he looked like a young and prosperous man of business and indeed he was one  the fame of our city spread even across the atlantic reaching obscure hamlets in europe where villagers gathered up their lares and penates mortgaged their homes and bought steamship tickets from philanthropistsphilanthropists in diamonds our huns began to arrive their attilas unrecognized among them to drive our honest americans and irish and germans out of the mills by lowering the standard of living stillaccording to the learned economists in our universities enlightened selfinterest triumphed had not the honest americans and germans become foremen and even presidents of corporations what greater vindication for their philosophy could be desired  the very aspect of the city changed like magic new buildings sprang high in the air the reliance trust mr griersons the scherer building the hambleton building a stew hotel the ashuela took proper care of our visitors from the easta massive grey stone thousandawninged affair on boyne street with a grill where it became the fashion to go for supper after the play and a head waiter who knew in a few weeks everyone worth knowing  to return for a moment to the huns maude had expressed a desire to see a mill and we went one afternoon in mr scherers carriage to steelville with mr scherer himselfa bewildering educative almost terrifying experience amidst fumes and flames gigantic forces and titanic weights it seemed a marvel that we escaped being crushed or burned alive in those huge steel buildings reverberating with sound they appeared a very bedlam of chaos instead of the triumph of order organization and human skill mr scherer was very proud of it all and ours was a sort of triumphal procession accompanied by superintendents managers and other factotums i thought of my childhood image of shadrach meshach and abednego and our progress through the flames seemed no less remarkable and miraculous  maude with alarm in her eyes kept very close to me as i supplemented the explanations they gave her i had been there many times before  why hugh she exclaimed you seem to know a lot about it  mr scherer laughed  hes had to talk about it once or twice in courteh hugh you didnt realize how clever your husband was did you mrs paret  but this is socomplicated she replied it is overwhelming  when i found out how much trouble he had taken to learn about my business added mr scherer there was only one thing to do make him my lawyer hugh you have the floor and explain the openhearth process  i had almost forgotten the huns i saw maude gazing at them with a new kind of terror and when we sat at home that evening they still haunted her  somehow i cant bear to think about them she said im sure well have to pay for it some day  pay for what i asked  for making them work that way and twelve hours it cant be right while we have so much and are so comfortable  dont be foolish i exclaimed theyre used to it they think themselves lucky to get the workand they are besides you give them credit for a sensitiveness that they dont possess they wouldnt know what to do with such a house as this if they had it  i never realized before that our happiness and comfort were built on such foundations she said ignoring my remark  you must have seen your fathers operatives in elkington many times a week  i suppose i was too young to think about such things she reflected besides i used to be sorry for them sometimes but these men at the steel millsi cant tell you what i feel about them the sight of their great bodies and their red sullen faces brought home to me the cruelty of life did you notice how some of them stared at us as though they were but half awake in the heat with that glow on their faces it made me afraidafraid that theyll wake up some day and then they will be terrible i thought of the children it seems not only wicked but mad to bring ignorant foreigners over here and make them slaves like that and so many of them are hurt and maimed i cant forget them  youre talking socialism i said crossly wondering whether lucia had taken it up as her latest fad  oh no im not said maude i dont know what socialism is im talking about something that anyone who is not dazzled by all this luxury we are living in might be able to see about something which when it comes we shant be able to help  i ridiculed this the prophecy itself did not disturb me half as much as the fact that she had made it as this new evidence that she was beginning to think for herself and along lines so different from my own development  while it lasted before novelists playwrights professors and ministers of the gospel abandoned their proper sphere to destroy it that golden age was heaven the new jerusalemin which we had ceased to believewould have been in the nature of an anticlimax to any of our archangels of finance who might have attained it the streets of our own city turned out to be gold gold likewise the acres of unused scrubby land on our outskirts as the incident of the riverside franchisewhich i am about to relateamply proved  that scheme originated in the alert mind of mr frederick grierson and in spite of the fact that it has since become notorious in the eyes of a virtuestricken public it was entered into with all innocence at the time most of the men who were present at the magnates table at the boyne club the day mr grierson broached it will vouch for this he casually asked mr dickinson if he had ever noticed a tract lying on the river about two miles beyond the heights opposite what used to be in the old days a road house  this city is growing so fast leonard said grierson lighting a special cigar the club kept for him that it might pay a few of us to get together and buy that tract have the city put in streets and sewers and sell it in building lots i think i can get most of it at less than three hundred dollars an acre  mr dickinson was interested so were mr ogilvy and ralph hambleton and mr scherer who chanced to be there anything fred grierson had to say on the question of real estate was always interesting he went on to describe the tract its size and location  thats all very well fred dickinson objected presently but how are your prospective householders going to get out there  just what i was coming to cried grierson triumphantly well get a franchise and build a streetrailroad out maplewood avenue an extension of the park street line we can get the franchise for next to nothing if we work it right mr griersons eye fell on me and sell it out to the public if you underwrite it for two million or so  well youve got your nerve with you fred as usual said dickinson but he rolled his cigar in his mouth an indication to those who knew him well that he was considering the matter when leonard dickinson didnt say no at once there was hope what do you think the property holders on maplewood avenue would say wasnt it understood when that avenue was laid out that it was to form part of the system of boulevards  what difference does it make what they say ralph interposed  dickinson smiled he too had an exaggerated respect for ralph we all thought the proposal daring but in no way amazing the public existed to be sold things to and what did it matter if the maplewood residents as ralph said and the city improvement league protested  perry blackwood was the secretary of the city improvement league the object of which was to beautify the city by laying out a system of parkways  the next day some of us gathered in dickinsons office and decided that grierson should go ahead and get the options this was done not of course in griersons name the next move before the formation of the riverside company was to see mr judd jason the success or failure of the enterprise was in his hands mahomet must go to the mountain and i went to monahans saloon first having made an appointment it was not the first time i had been there since i had made that first memorable visit but i never quite got over the feeling of a neophyte before buddha though i did not go so far as to analyze the reasonthat in mr jason i was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy i had adopted the logical consequence of enlightened selfinterest if he had ever heard of it he would have made no pretence of being anything else greatness declares some modern philosopher has no connection with virtue it is the continued strong and logical expression of some instinct in mr jasons case the predatory instinct and like a true artist he loved his career for itselfnot for what its fruits could buy he might have built a palace on the heights with the tolls he took from the disreputable houses of the city he was contented with monahans saloon nor did he seek to propitiate a possible god by endowing churches and hospitals with a portion of his income try though i might i never could achieve the perfection of this mans contempt for all other philosophies the very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place of his from out of the bright respectable region in which i lived was in itself an acknowledgment of this i thought him a thiefa necessary thiefand he knew it he was indifferent to it and it amused him i think to see clinging to me when i entered his presence shreds of that morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for the sake of decency  he was in bed reading newspapers as usual an empty coffeecup and a plate were on the littered table  sit down sit down paret he said what do you hear from the senator  i sat down and gave him the news of mr watling he seemed as usual distrait betraying no curiosity as to the object of my call his lean brown fingers playing with the newspapers on his lap suddenly he flashed out at me one of those remarks which produced the uncanny conviction that so far as affairs in the city were concerned he was omniscient  i hear somebody has been getting options on that tract of land beyond the heights on the river  he had focussed  how did you hear that i asked  he smiled  its grierson aint it  yes its grierson i said  how are you going to get your folks out there he demanded  thats what ive come to see you about we want a franchise for maplewood avenue  maplewood avenue he lay back with his eyes closed as though trying to visualize such a colossal proposal  when i left him two hours later the details were all arranged down to mr jasons consideration from riverside company and the fee which his lawyer mr bitter was to have for presenting the case before the board of aldermen i went back to lunch at the boyne club and to receive the congratulations of my friends the next week the riverside company was formed and i made out a petition to the board of aldermen for a franchise mr bitter appeared and argued in short the procedure so familiar to modern students of political affairs was gone through the maplewood avenue residents rose en masse supported by the city improvement league perry blackwood as soon as he heard of the petition turned up at my office by this time i was occupying mr watlings room  look here he began as soon as the officeboy had closed the door behind him this is going it a little too strong  what is i asked leaning back in my chair and surveying him  this proposed maplewood avenue franchise hugh he said you and i have been friends a good many years lucia and i are devoted to maude  i did not reply  ive seen all along that weve been growing apart he added sadly youve got certain ideas about things which i cant share i suppose im old fashioned i cant trust myself to tell you what i thinkwhat tom and i think about this deal  go ahead perry i said  he got up plainly agitated and walked to the window then he turned to me appealingly  get out of it for gods sake get out of it before its too late for your own sake for maudes for the childrens you dont realize what you are doing you may not believe me but the time will come when these fellows you are in with will be repudiated by the communitytheir money wont help them tom and i are the best friends you have he added a little irrelevantly  and you think im going to the dogs  now dont take it the wrong way he urged  what is it you object to about the maplewood franchise i asked if youll look at a map of the city youll see that development is bound to come on that side maplewood avenue is the natural artery somebody will build a line out there and if youd rather have eastern capitalists  why are you going to get this franchise he demanded because we havent a decent city charter and a healthy public spirit you fellows are buying it from a corrupt city boss and bribing a corrupt board of aldermen thats the plain language of it and its only fair to warn you that im going to say so openly  be sensible i answered weve got to have street railroadsyour family has one we know what the aldermen are what political conditions are if you feel this way about it the thing to do is to try to change them but why blame me for getting a franchise for a company in the only manner in which under present conditions a franchise can be got do you want the city to stand still if not we have to provide for the new population  every time you bribe these rascals for a franchise you entrench them he cried you make it more difficult to oust them but you mark my words we shall get rid of them some day and when that fight comes i want to be in it  he had grown very much excited and it was as though this excitement suddenly revealed to me the full extent of the change that had taken place in him since he had left college as he stood facing me almost glaring at me through his eyeglasses i beheld a slim nervous faultfinding doctrinaire incapable of understanding the world as it was lacking the force of his pioneer forefathers i rather pitied him  im sorry we cant look at this thing alike perry i told him youve said solve pretty hard things but i realize that you hold your point of view in good faith and that you have come to me as an old friend i hope it wont make any difference in our personal relations  i dont see how it can help making a difference he answered slowly his excitement had cooled abruptly he seemed dazed at this moment my private stenographer entered to inform me that i was being called up on the telephone from new york well you have more important affairs to attend to i wont bother you any more he added  hold on i exclaimed this call can wait id like to talk it over with you  im afraid it wouldnt be any use hugh he said and went out  after talking with the new york client whose local interests i represented i sat thinking over the conversation with perry considering maudes intimacy with and affection for the blackwoods the affair was awkward opening up many uncomfortable possibilities and it was the prospect of discomfort that bothered me rather than regret for the probable loss of perrys friendship i still believed myself to have an affection for him undoubtedly this was a sentimental remnant  that evening after dinner tom came in alone and i suspected that perry had sent him he was fidgety ill at ease and presently asked if i could see him a moment in my study maudes glance followed us  say hugh this is pretty stiff he blurted out characteristically when the door was closed  i suppose you mean the riverside franchise i said he looked up at me miserably from the chair into which he had sunk his hands in his pockets  youll forgive me for talking about it wont you you used to lecture me once in a while at cambridge you know  thats all rightgo ahead i replied trying to speak amiably  you know ive always admired you hughi never had your ability he began painfully youve gone ahead pretty fastthe truth is that perry and i have been worried about you for some time weve tried not to be too serious in showing it but weve felt that these modern business methods were getting into your system without your realizing it there are some things a mans friends can tell him and its their duty to tell him good god havent you got enough hughenough success and enough money without going into a thing like this riverside scheme  i was intensely annoyed if not angry and i hesitated a moment to calm myself  tom you dont understand my position i said im willing to discuss it with you now that youve opened up the subject perrys been talking to you i can see that i think perrys got queer ideasto be plain with you and theyre getting queerer  he sat down again while with what i deemed a rather exemplary patience i went over the arguments in favour of my position and as i talked it clarified in my own mind it was impossible to apply to business an individual code of ethicseven to perrys business to toms business the two were incompatible and the sooner one recognized that the better the whole structure of business was built up on natural as opposed to ethical law we had arrived at an era of franknessthat was the truthand the sooner we faced this truth the better for our peace of mind much as we might deplore the political system that had grown up we had to acknowledge if we were consistent that it was the base on which our prosperity was built i was rather proud of having evolved this argument it fortified my own peace of mind which had been disturbed by toms attitude i began to pity him he had not been very successful in life and with the little he earned added to susans income i knew that a certain ingenuity was required to make both ends meet he sat listening with a troubled look a passing phase of feeling clouded for a brief moment my confidence when there arose in my mind an unbidden memory of my youth of my father he too had mistrusted my ingenuity i recalled how i had outmanoeuvred him and gone to college i remembered the march day so long ago when tom and i had stood on the corner debating how to deceive him and it was i who had suggested the nice distinction between a boat and a raft well my fathers illogical attitude towards boyhood nature towards human nature had forced me into that lie just as the senseless attitude of the public today forced business into a position of hypocrisy  well thats clever he said slowly and perplexedly when i had finished its damned clever but somehow it looks to me all wrong i cant pick it to pieces he got up rather heavily ii guess i ought to be going susan doesnt know where i am  i was exasperated it was clear though he did not say so that he thought me dishonest the pain in his eyes had deepened  if you feel that way i said  oh god i dont know how i feel he cried youre the oldest friend i have hughi cant forget that well say nothing more about it he picked up his hat and a moment later i heard the front door close behind him i stood for a while stockstill and then went into the livingroom where maude was sewing  why wheres tom she inquired looking up  oh he went home he said susan didnt know where he was  how queer hugh was there anything the matter is he in trouble she asked anxiously  i stood toying with a bookmark reflecting she must inevitably come to suspect that something had happened and it would be as well to fortify her  the trouble is i said after a moment that perry and tom would like to run modern business on the principle of a charitable institution unfortunately it is not practical theyre upset because i have been retained by a syndicate whose object is to develop some land out beyond maplewood avenue theyve bought the land and we are asking the city to give us a right to build a line out maplewood avenue which is the obvious way to go perry says it will spoil the avenue thats nonsense in the first place the avenue is wide and the tracks will be in a grass plot in the centre for the sake of keeping tracks off that avenue he would deprive people of attractive homes at a small cost of the good air they can get beyond the heights he would stunt the citys development  that does seem a little unreasonable maude admitted is that all he objects to  no he thinks it an outrage because in order to get the franchise we have to deal with the city politicians well it so happens and always has happened that politics have been controlled by leaders whom perry calls bosses and they are not particularly attractive men you wouldnt care to associate with them my father once refused to be mayor of the city for this reason but they are necessities if the people didnt want them theyd take enough interest in elections to throw them out but since the people do want them and they are there every time a new streetcar line or something of that sort needs to be built they have to be consulted because without their influence nothing could be done on the other hand these politicians cannot afford to ignore men of local importance like leonard dickinson and adolf scherer and miller gorse who represent financial substance and responsibility if a new streetrailroad is to be built these are the logical ones to build it you have just the same situation in elkington on a smaller scale  your family the hutchinses own the mills and the streetrailroads and any new enterprise that presents itself is done with their money because they are reliable and sound  it isnt pleasant to think that there are such people as the politicians is it said maude slowly  unquestionably not i agreed it isnt pleasant to think of some other crude forces in the world but they exist and they have to be dealt with suppose the united states should refuse to trade with russia because from our republican point of view we regarded her government as tyrannical and oppressive or to cooperate with england in some undertaking for the worlds benefit because we contended that she ruled india with an iron hand in such a case our president and senate would be scoundrels for making and ratifying a treaty yet here are perry and tom and no doubt susan and lucia accusing me a lifetime friend of dishonesty because i happen to be counsel for a syndicate that wishes to build a streetrailroad for the convenience of the people of the city  oh no not of dishonesty she exclaimed i canti wont believe they would do that  pretty near it i said if i listened to them i should have to give up the law altogether  sometimes she answered in a low voice sometimes i wish you would  i might have expected that you would take their point of view  as i was turning away she got up quickly and put her hand on my shoulder  hugh please dont say such thingsyouve no right to say them  and you i asked  dont you see she continued pleadingly dont you see that we are growing apart thats the only reason i said what i did it isnt that i dont trust you that i dont want you to have your work that i demand all of you i know a woman cant ask thatcant have it but if you would only give megive the children just a little if i could feel that we meant something to you and that this other wasnt gradually becoming everything wasnt absorbing you more and more killing the best part of you its poisoning our marriage its poisoning all your relationships  in that appeal the real maude the maude of the early days of our marriage flashed forth again so vividly that i was taken aback i understood that she had had herself under control had worn a maska mask i had forced on her and the revelation of the continued existence of that other maude was profoundly disturbing was it true as she said that my absorption in the great game of modern business in the modern american philosophy it implied was poisoning my marriage or was it that my marriage had failed to satisfy and absorb me i was touchedbut sentimentally touched i felt that this was a situation that ought to touch me i didnt wish to face it as usual i couldnt acknowledge to myself that anything was really wrong i patted her on the shoulder i bent over and kissed her  a man in my position cant altogether choose just how busy he will be i said smiling matters are thrust upon me which i have to accept and i cant help thinking about some of them when i come home but well go off for a real vacation soon maude to europeand take the children  oh i hope so she said  from this time on as may be supposed our intercourse with both the blackwoods began to grow less frequent although maude continued to see a great deal of lucia and when we did dine in their company or they with us it was quite noticeable that their former raillery was suppressed even tom had ceased to refer to me as the young napoleon of the law he clung to me but he too kept silent on the subject of business maude of course must have noticed this must have sensed the change of atmosphere have known that the blackwoods at least were maintaining appearances for her sake she did not speak to me of the change nor i to her but when i thought of her silence it was to suspect that she was weighing the question which had led up to the difference between perry and me and i had a suspicion that the fact that i was her husband would not affect her ultimate decision this faculty of hers of thinking things out instead of accepting my views and decisions was as the saying goes getting a little on my nerves that she of all women should have developed it was a recurring and unpleasant surprise i began at times to pity myself a little to feel the need of sympathetic companionshipfeminine companionship  i shall not go into the details of the procurement of what became known as the riverside franchise in spite of the maplewood residents of the city improvement league and individual protests we obtained it with absurd ease indeed perry blackwood himself appeared before the public utilities committee of the board of aldermen and was listened to with deference and gravity while he discoursed on the defacement of a beautiful boulevard to satisfy the greed of certain private individuals mr otto bitter and myself who appeared for the petitioners had a similar reception that struggle was a tempest in a teapot the reformer raged but he was feeble in those days and the great public believed what it read in the respectable newspapers in mr judah b tallants newspaper for instance the morning era there were semiplayful editorials about obstructionists mr perry blackwood was a wellmeaning able gentleman of an old family etc but with a sentiment for horsecars the era published also the resolutions which with interesting spontaneity had been passed by our board of trade and chamber of commerce and other influential bodies in favour of the franchise the ideaunknown to the publicof mr hugh paret who wrote drafts of the resolutions and suggested privately to mr leonard dickinson that a little enthusiasm from these organizations might be helpful mr dickinson accepted the suggestion eagerly wondering why he hadnt thought of it himself the resolutions carried some weight with a public that did not know its right hand from its left  after fitting deliberation one evening in february the board of aldermen met and granted the franchise not unanimously oh no mr jason was not so simple as that no further visits to monahans saloon on my part in this connection were necessary but mr otto bitter met me one day in the hotel with a significant message from the boss  its all fixed he informed me murphy and scott and ottheimer and grady and loth are the decoys you understand  i think i gather your meaning i said  mr bitter smiled by pulling down one corner of a crooked mouth  theyll vote against it on principle you know he added we get a little something from the maple avenue residents  ive forgotten what the riverside franchise cost the sum was paid in a lump sum to mr bitter as his feeso to their chagrin a grand jury discovered in later years when they were barking around mr jasons hole with an eager district attorney snapping his whip over them i remember the cartoon the municipal geese were gone but it was impossible to prove that this particular fox had used his enlightened reason in their procurement mr bitter was a legally authorized fox and could take fees how mr jason was to be rewarded by the land companys lefthand unknown to the land companys right hand became a problem worthy of a genius the genius was found but modesty forbids me to mention his name and the problem was solved to wit the land company bought a piece of downtown property frommr ryerson who was mr griersons real estate man and the agent for the land company for a consideration of thirty thousand dollars an unconfirmed rumour had it that mr ryerson turned over the thirty thousand to mr jason then the riverside company issued a secret deed of the same property back to mr ryerson and this deed was not recorded until some years later  such are the elaborate transactions progress and prosperity demand nature is the great teacher and we know that her ways are at times complicated and clumsy likewise under the natural laws of economics new enterprises are not born without travail without the aid of legal physicians well versed in financial obstetrics one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand let us say for the right to build tracks on maplewood avenue and we sold nearly two million dollars worth of the securities back to the public whose aldermen had sold us the franchise is there a man so dead as not to feel a thrill at this achievement and let no one who declares that literary talent and imagination are nonexistent in america pronounce final judgment until he reads that prospectus in which was combined the best of realism and symbolism for the labours of alonzo cheyne were not to be wasted after all mr dickinson who was a director in the maplewood line got a handsome underwriting percentage and mr berringer also a director on the bonds and preferred stock he sold mr paret who entered both companies on the ground floor likewise got fees everybody was satisfied except the trouble makers who were ignored in short the episode of the riverside franchise is a triumphant proof of the contention that business men are the best fitted to conduct the politics of their country  we had learned to pursue our happiness in packs we knew that the happy huntinggrounds are here and now while the reverend carey heddon continued to assure the maimed the halt and the blind that their kingdom was not of this world that their time was coming later could there have been a more idyl arrangement everybody should have been satisfied but everybody was not otherwise these pages would never have been written     book 3     xviii  as the name of our city grew to be more and more a byword for sudden and fabulous wealth not only were the huns and the slavs the czechs and the greeks drawn to us but it became the fashion for distinguished englishmen and frenchmen and sometimes germans and italians to pay us a visit when they made the grand tour of america they had been told that they must not miss us scarcely a week went by in our communityso it was saidin which a fullfledged millionaire was not turned out our visitors did not always remain a weeksince their rapid journeyings from the atlantic to the pacific from canada to the gulf rarely occupied more than fourbut in the books embodying their mature comments on the manners customs and crudities of american civilization no less than a chapter was usually devoted to us and most of the adjectives in their various languages were exhausted in the attempt to prove how symptomatic we were of the ambitions and ideals of the republic the fact that many of these gentlemenliterary and otherwisereturned to their own shores better fed and with larger balances in the banks than when they departed is neither here nor there egyptians are proverbially created to be spoiled  the wiser and more fortunate of these travellers and students of life brought letters to mr and mrs hambleton durrett that household was symptomaticif they likedof the new order of things and it was rare indeed when both members of it were at home to entertain them if mr durrett were in the city and they did not happen to be britons with sporting proclivities they simply were not entertained when mrs durrett received them dinners were given in their honour on the durrett gold plate and they spent cosey and delightful hours conversing with her in the little salon overlooking the garden to return to their hotels and jot down paragraphs on the superiority of the american women over the men these particular foreigners did not lay eyes on mr durrett who was in florida or in the east playing polo or engaged in some other pursuit one result of the lavishness and luxury that amazed them they wrotehad been to raise the standard of culture of the women who were our leisure class but the travellers did not remain long enough to arrive at any conclusions of value on the effect of luxury and lavishness on the sacred institution of marriage  if mr nathaniel durrett could have returned to his native city after fifteen years or so in the grave not the least of the phenomena to startle him would have been that which was taking place in his own house for he would have beheld serenely established in that former abode of calvinism one of the most reprehensible of exotic abominations a mariage de convenance nor could he have failed to observe moreover the complacency with which the descendants of his friends the pew holders in dr pounds church regarded the matter and not only these but the city at large the stronghold of scotch presbyterianism had become a london or a paris a gomorrah  mrs hambleton durrett went her way and mr durrett his the less said about mr durretts wayeven in this suddenly advanced agethe better as for nancy she seemed to the distant eye to be walking through life in a stately and triumphant manner i read in the newspapers of her doings her comings and goings sometimes she was away for months together often abroad and when she was at home i saw her but infrequently under conditions more or less formal not that she was formalor i our intercourse seemed eloquent of an intimacy in a tantalizing state of suspense would that intimacy ever be renewed this was a question on which i sometimes speculated the situation that had suspended or put an end to it as the case might be was never referred to by either of us  one afternoon in the late winter of the year following that in which we had given a dinner to the scherers where the durretts had rather marvellously appeared together i left my office about three oclocka most unusual occurrence i was restless unable to fix my mind on my work filled with unsatisfied yearnings the object of which i sought to keep vague and yet i directed my steps westward along boyne street until i came to the art museum where a loan exhibition was being held i entered bought a catalogue and presently found myself standing before number 103 designated as a portrait of mrs hambleton durrettpainted in paris the autumn before by a polish artist then much in vogue stanislaus czesky nancywas it nancywas standing facing me tall superb in the maturity of her beauty with one hand resting on an antique table a smile upon her lips a gentle mockery in her eyes as though laughing at the world she adorned with the smile and the mockerysomehow significant too of an achieved inaccessibilitywent the sheen of her clinging gown and the glint of the heavy pearls drooping from her high throat to her waist these caught the eye but failed at length to hold it for even as i looked the smile faded the mockery turned to wistfulness so i thought and looked againto see the wistfulness the smile had gone the pearls seemed heavier was it a trick of the artist had he seen what i saw or thought i saw or was it that imagination which by now i might have learned to suspect and distrust wild longings took possession of me for the portrait had seemed to emphasize at once how distant now she was from me and yet how near i wanted to put that nearness to the test had she really changed did anyone really change and had i not been a fool to accept the presentment she had given me i remembered those moments when our glances had met as across barriers in flashes of understanding after all the barriers were mere relics of the superstition of the past what if i went to her now i felt that i needed her as i never had needed anyone in all my life i was aroused by the sound of lowered voices beside me  thats mrs hambleton durrett i heard a woman say isnt she beautiful  the note of envy struck me sharplyhorribly without waiting to listen to the comment of her companion i hurried out of the building into the cold white sunlight that threw into bold relief the mediocre houses of the street here was everyday life but the portrait had suggested that which might have beenmight be yet what did i mean by this i didnt know i didnt care to define ita renewal of her friendship of our intimacy my being cried out for it and in the world in which i lived we took what we wantedwhy not this and yet for an instant i stood on the sidewalk to discover that in new situations i was still subject to unaccountable qualms of that thing i had been taught to call conscience whether it were conscience or not must be left to the psychologists i was marriedterrible word the shadow of that institution fell athwart me as the sun went under a cloud but the sun came out again as i found myself walking toward the durrett house reflecting that numbers of married men called on nancy and that what i had in mind in regard to her was nothing that the court would have pronounced an infringement upon the institution i reached her steps the long steps still guarded by the curved wroughtiron railings reminiscent of nathaniels day though the portals were gone a modern vestibule having replaced them i rang the bell the butler flung open the doors he at any rate did not seem surprised to see me here he greeted me with respectful cordiality and led me as a favoured guest through the big drawingroom into the salon  mr paret madam  nancy rose quickly from the low chair where she sat cutting the pages of a french novel  hugh she exclaimed im out if anyone calls bring tea she added to the man who retired for a moment we stood gazing at each other questioningly well wont you sit down and stay awhile she asked  i took a chair on the opposite side of the fire  i just thought id drop in i said  i am flattered said nancy that a person so affaire should find time to call on an old friend why i thought you never left your office until seven oclock  i dont as a rule but today i wasnt particularly busy and i thought id go round to the art museum and look at your portrait  more flattery hugh youre getting quite human what do you think of it  i like it i think it quite remarkable  have a cigarette  i took one  so you really like it she said  dont you  oh i think its a trifleromantic she replied but thats czesky he made me quite crossthe feminine presentation of america the spoiled woman who has shed responsibilities and is beginning to have a glimpsejust a little oneof the emptiness of it all  i was stirred  then why do you accept it if it isnt you i demanded one doesnt refuse czeskys canvases she replied and what difference does it make it amused him and he was fairly subtle about it only those who are looking for romance like you are able to guess what he meant and they would think they saw it anyway even if he had painted meextinct  extinct i repeated  she laughed  hugh youre a silly old goose  thats why i came here i think to be told so i said  tea was brought in a sense of athomeness stole over mei was more at home here in this room with nancy than in any other place in the world here where everything was at once soothing yet stimulating expressive of her even the smaller objects that caught my eyethe crystal inkstand tipped with gold the racks for the table books her papercutter nancys was a discriminating luxury and her talk the lightness with which she touched life the unexplored depths of her guessed at but never fathomed did she feel a little the need of me as i felt the need of her  why i believe youre incurably romantic hugh she said laughingly when the men had left the room here you are what they call a paragon of success a future senator ambassador to england i hear of those remarkable things you have doneeven in new york the other day a man was asking me if i knew mr paret and spoke of you as one of the coming men i suppose you will be moving there soon a practical success it always surprises me when i think of it i find it difficult to remember what a dreamer you were and here you turn out to be still a dreamer have you discovered too the emptiness of it all she inquired provokingly i must say you dont look itshe gave me a critical quizzical glanceyou look quite prosperous and contented as though you enjoyed your power  i laughed uneasily  and then she continued and then one day when your luncheon has disagreed with youyou walk into a gallery and see a portrait ofof an old friend for whom in youth when you were a dreamer you professed a sentimental attachment and you exclaim that the artist is a discerning man who has discovered the secret that she has guarded so closely shes sorry that she ever tried to console herself with baubles its what youve suspected all along but youll just run around to see for yourselfto be sure of it and she handed me my tea come now confess where are your witsi hear you dont lack them in court  well i said if that amuses you  it does amuse me said nancy twining her fingers across her knee and regarding me smilingly with parted lips it amuses me a lotits so characteristic  but its not true its unjust i protested vigorously smiling too because the attack was so characteristic of her  what then she demanded  well in the first place my luncheon didnt disagree with me it never does  she laughed but the sentimentcome nowthe sentiment do you perceive any hint of emptinessdespair  our chairs were very close and she leaned forward a little  emptiness or no emptiness i said a little tremulously i know that i havent been so contented so happy for a long time  she sat very still but turned her gaze on the fire  you really wouldnt want to find that hugh she said in another voice at which i exclaimed no im not being sentimental but to be serious i really shouldnt care to think that of you id like to think of you as a frienda good friendalthough we dont see very much of one another  but thats why i came nancy i explained it wasnt just an impulsethat is ive been thinking of you a great deal all along i miss you i miss the way you look at thingsyour point of view i cant see any reason why we shouldnt see something of each othernow  she continued to stare into the fire  no she said at length i suppose there isnt any reason her mood seemed suddenly to change as she bent over and extinguished the flame under the kettle after all she added gaily we live in a tolerant age weve reached the years of discretion and were both too conventional to do anything sillyeven if we wanted towhich we dont were neither of us likely to quarrel with the world as it is i think and we might as well make fun of it together well begin with our friends what do you think of mr scherers palace  i hear youre building it for him  i told him to get eyre said nancy laughingly i was afraid hed repeat the gallatin park monstrosity on a larger scale and eyres the only man in this country who understands the french its been rather amusing she went on ive had to fight hilda and shes no mean antagonist how she hates me she wanted a monstrosity of course a modernized german rockgrotto sort of an affair i can imagine shes been so funny when ive met her at dinner i understand you take a great interest in the house mrs durrett cant you hear her  well you did get ahead of her i said  i had to i couldnt let our first citizen build a modern rhine castle could i i have some public spirit left and besides i expect to build on grant avenue myself  and leave here  oh its too grubby its in the slums said nancy but i really owe you a debt of gratitude hugh for the scherers  im told adolfs lost his head over you  its not only over me but over everything hes so ridiculously proud of being on the board of the childrens hospital you ought to hear him talking to old mrs ogilvy who of course cant get used to him at allshe always has the air of inquiring what hes doing in that galley she still thinks of him as mr durretts foreman  the time flew her presence was like a bracing tingling atmosphere in which i felt revived and exhilarated selfrestored for nancy did not questionshe took me as i was we looked out on the world as it were from the same window and i could not help thinking that ours after all was a large view the topics didnt matterour conversation was fragrant with intimacy and we were so close to each other it seemed incredible that we ever should be parted again at last the little clock on the mantel chimed an hour she started and looked up  why its seven hugh she exclaimed rising id no idea it was so late and im dining with the dickinsons ive only just time to dress  its been like a reunion hasnt ita reunion after many years i said i held her hand unconsciouslyshe seemed to be drawing me to her i thought she swayed and a sudden dizziness seized me then she drew away abruptly with a little cry i couldnt be sure about the cry whether i heard it or not a note was struck in the very depths of me  come in again she said whenever youre not too busy and a minute later i found myself on the street  this was the beginning of a new intimacy with nancy resembling the old intimacy yet differing from it the emotional note of our parting on the occasion i have just related was not again struck and when i went eagerly to see her again a few days later i was conscious of limitationsnot too conscious the freedom she offered and which i gladly accepted was a large freedom nor am i quite sure that even i would have wished it larger though there were naturally moments when i thought so when i asked myself what i did wish i found no answer though i sometimes chafed it would have been absurd of me to object to a certain timidity or caution i began to perceive in her that had been absent in the old nancy but the old nancy had ceased to exist and here instead was a highly developed highly specialized creature in whom i delighted and after taking thought i would not have robbed her of fine acquired attribute as she had truly observed we were both conventional conventionality was part of the price we had willingly paid for membership in that rarer world we had both achieved it was a world to be sure in which we were rapidly learning to take the law into our own hands without seeming to defy it in order that the fear of it might remain in those less fortunately placed and endowed we had begun with the appropriation of the material property of our fellowcitizens which we took legally from this point it was of course merely a logical step to takelegally too other gentlemens human propertytheir wives in short the more progressive east had set us our example but as yet we had been chary to follow it  about this time rebellious voices were beginning to make themselves heard in the literary wilderness proclaiming libertyliberty of the sexes there were russian novels and french novels and pioneer english novels preaching liberty with nietzschean stridency or taking it for granted i picked these up on nancys table  reading them she said in answer to my query of course im reading them i want to know what these clever people are thinking even if i dont always agree with them and you ought to read them too its quite true what foreigners say about our menthat they live in a groove that they havent any range of conversation  im quite willing to be educated i replied i havent a doubt that i need it  she was leaning back in her chair her hands behind her head a posture she often assumed she looked up at me amusedly  ill acknowledge that youre more teachable than most of them she said do you know hugh sometimes you puzzle me greatly when you are here and were talking together i can never think of you as you are out in the world fighting for powerand getting it i suppose its part of your charm that there is that side of you but i never consciously realize it youre what they call a dual personality  thats a pretty hard name i exclaimed  she laughed  i cant help ityou are oh not disagreeably so quite normallythats the odd thing about you sometimes i believe that you were made for something different that in spite of your success you have missed your metier  what ought i to have been  how can i tell a goethe perhapsa goethe smothered by a twentiethcentury environment your love of adventure isnt dead its been merely misdirected real adventure i mean forth faring straying into unknown paths perhaps you havent yet found yourself  how uncanny i said stirred and startled  you have a taste for literature you know though youve buried it give me turgeniev well begin with him  her reading and the talks that followed it were exciting amazingly stimulating once nancy gave me an amusing account of a debate which had taken place in the newly organized womans discussion club to which she belonged over a rather daring book by an english novelist mrs dickinson had revolted  no she wasnt really shocked not in the way she thought she was said nancy in answer to a query of mine  how was she shocked then  as you and i are shocked  but im not shocked i protested  oh yes you are and so am inot on the moral side nor is it the moral aspect that troubles lula dickinson she thinks its the moral aspect but its really the revolutionary aspect the menace to those precious institutions from which we derive our privileges and comforts  i considered this and laughed  whats the use of being a humbug about it said nancy  but youre talking like a revolutionary i said  i may be talking like one but im not one i once had the makings of oneof a good onea proper one as the english would say she sighed  you regret it i asked curiously  of course i regret it she cried what woman worth her salt doesnt regret it doesnt want to live even if she has to suffer for it and those peoplethe revolutionaries i mean the rebelsthey live theyre the only ones who do live the rest of us degenerate in a painless paralysis we think of as pleasure look at me im incapable of committing a single original act even though i might conceive one well there was a time when i should have been equal to anything and wouldnt have cared aa damn  i believed her  i fell into the habit of dropping in on nancy at least twice a week on my way from the office and i met her occasionally at other houses i did not tell maude of that first impulsive visit but one evening a few weeks later she asked me where i had been and when i told her she made no comment i came presently to the conclusion that this renewed intimacy did not trouble herwhich was what i wished to believe of course i had gone to nancy for a stimulation i failed to get at home and it is the more extraordinary therefore that i did not become more discontented and restless i suppose this was because i had grown to regard marriage as most of the world regarded it as something inevitable and humdrum as a kind of habit it is useless to try to shake off but life is so full of complexities and anomalies that i still had a real affection for maude and i liked her the more because she didnt expect too much of me and because she didnt complain of my friendship with nancy although i should vehemently have denied there was anything to complain of i respected maude if she was not a squaw she performed religiously the traditional squaw duties and made me comfortable and the fact that we lived separate mental existences did not trouble me because i never thought of hersor even that she had one she had the children and they seemed to suffice she never renewed her appeal for my confidence and i forgot that she had made it  nevertheless i always felt a tug at my heartstrings when june came around and it was time for her and the children to go to mattapoisett for the summer when i accompanied them on the evening of their departure to the smoky noisy station and saw deposited in the sleepingcar their luggage and shawls and bundles they always took the evening train to boston it was the best tom and susan were invariably there with candy and toys to see them offif susan and her children had not already goneand at such moments my heart warmed to tom and i was astonished as i clung to matthew and moreton and little biddy at the affection that welled up within me saddened when i kissed maude goodbye she too was sad and always seemed to feel compunctions for deserting me  i feel so selfish in leaving you all alone she would say if it werent for the childrenthey need the sea air but i know you dont miss me as i miss you a man doesnt i suppose please dont work so hard and promise me youll come on and stay a long time you can if you want to we shant starve she smiled that nice room which is yours at the southeast corner is always waiting for you and you do like the sea and seeing the sailboats in the morning  i felt an emptiness when the train pulled out i did love my family after all i would go back to the deserted house and i could not bear to look in at the nursery door at the little beds with covers flung over them why couldnt i appreciate these joys when i had them  one evening as we went home in an open streetcar together after such a departure tom blurted outhugh i believe i care for your family as much as for my own i often wonder if you realize how wonderful these children are my boys are just plain ruffiansalthough i think theyre pretty decent ruffians but matthew has a mindhes thoughtfuland an imagination hell make a name for himself some day if hes steered properly and allowed to develop naturally moretons more like my boys and as for chickabiddy words failed him  i put my hand on his knee i actually loved him again as i had loved and yearned for him as a childhe was so human so dependable and why couldnt this feeling last he disapprovedfoolishly i thoughtof my professional career and this was only one of his limitations but i knew that he was loyal why hadnt i been able to breathe and be reasonably happy in that atmosphere of friendship and love in which i had been placedor rather in which i had placed myself before the summer was a day or two older i had grown accustomed to being alone and enjoyed the liberty and when maude and the children returned in the autumn similarly it took me some days to get used to the restrictions imposed by a household i run the risk of shocking those who read this by declaring that if my family had been taken permanently out of my life i should not long have missed them but on the whole in those years my marriage relation might be called a negative one there were moments as i have described when i warmed to maude moments when i felt something akin to a violent antagonism aroused by little mannerisms and tricks she had the fact that we got along as well as we did was probably due to the orthodox teaching with which we had been inoculatedto the effect that matrimony was a moral trial a shakingdown process but moral trials were ceasing to appeal to people and more and more of them were refusing to be shaken down we didnt cut the gordian knot but we managed to loosen it considerably  i have spoken of a new species of titans who inhabited the giant buildings in wall street new york and fought among themselves for possession of the united states of america it is interesting to note that in these struggles a certain chivalry was observed among the combatants no matter how bitter the rivalry for instance it was deemed very bad form for one of the groups of combatants to take the public into their confidence cities were upset and stirred to the core by these conflicts and the citizens never knew who was doing the fighting but imagined that some burning issue was at stake that concerned them as a matter of fact the issue always did concern them but not in the way they supposed  gradually out of the chaotic melee in which these titans were engaged had emerged one group more powerful than the rest and more respectable whose leader was the personality to whom i have before referred he and his group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in various cities such as the corn national bank and the ashuela telephone companyto mention two of many adolf scherer was his ally and the boyne iron works limited was soon to be merged by him into a greater corporation still leonard dickinson might be called his local governorgeneral we manned the parapets and kept our ears constantly to the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks but sometimes they burst upon us fiercely and suddenly without warning such was the assault on the ashuela which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly of the citys telephone service which had been able to ignore with complacency the shrillest protests of unreasonable subscribers through the pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent eastern capitalists were ready to rescue them from their thraldom if the city would grant them a franchise mr lawler the disinterestedness of whose newspaper could not be doubted fanned the flame day by day sent his reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the ashuela proclaiming its instruments antiquated compared with those used in more progressive cities as compared with the very latest inventions which the automatic company was ready to install provided they could get their franchise and the prices these too would fallunder competition it was a clever campaign if the city would give them a franchise that automatic companyso well named would provide automatic instruments each subscriber by means of a numerical disk could call up any other subscriber there would be no central operator no listening no tapping of wires the number of calls would be unlimited as a proof of the confidence of these eastern gentlemen in our city they were willing to spend five millions and present more than six hundred telephones free to the city departments what was fairer more generous than this there could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in behalf of the eastern capitalists who were made to appear in the light of crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of monopoly the excitement approached that of a presidential election and became the dominant topic at quicklunch counters and in streetcars cheap and efficient service down with the bastille of monopoly  as counsel for the ashuela mr ogilvy sent for me and by certain secret conduits of information at my disposal i was not long in discovering the disquieting fact that a mr orthwein who was described as a gentleman with fat fingers and a plausible manner had been in town for a week and had been twice seen entering and emerging from monahans saloon in short mr jason had already been seen nevertheless i went to him myself to find him for the first time in my experience absolutely noncommittal  whats the ashuela willing to do he demanded  i mentioned a sum and he shook his head i mentioned another and still he shook his head  come round again he said  i was compelled to report this alarming situation to ogilvy and dickinson and a few chosen members of a panicky board of directors  its that damned grannis crowd said dickinson mentioning an aggressive gentleman who had migrated from chicago to wall street some five years before in a pink collar  but whats to be done demanded ogilvy playing nervously with a gold pencil on the polished table he was one of those americans who in a commercial atmosphere become prematurely white and today his boyish smoothshaven face was almost as devoid of colour as his hair even leonard dickinson showed anxiety which was unusual for him  youve got to fix it hugh he said  i did not see my way but i had long ago learned to assume the unruffled air and judicial manner of speaking that inspires the layman with almost superstitious confidence in the lawyer  well find a way out i said  mr jason of course held the key to the situation and just how i was to get around him was problematical in the meantime there was the public to permit the other fellow to capture that was to be lacking in ordinary prudence if its votes counted for nothing its savings were desirable and it was fast getting into a state of outrage against monopoly the chivalry of finance did not permit of a revelation that mr grannis and his buccaneers were behind the automatic but it was possible to direct and strengthen the backfire which the era and other conservative newspapers had already begun mr tallant for delicate reasons being persona non grata at the boyne club despite the fact that he had so many friends there we met for lunch in a private room at the new hotel and as we sipped our coffee and smoked our cigars we planned a series of editorials and articles that duly appeared they made a strong appeal to the loyalty of our citizens to stand by the home company and home capital that had taken generous risks to give them service at a time when the future of the telephone business was by no means assured they belittled the charges made by irresponsible and interested parties and finally pointed out not without effect that one logical consequence of having two telephone companies would be to compel subscribers in selfdefence to install two telephones instead of one and where was the saving in that  say paret said judah b when we had finished our labours if you ever get sick of the law ill give you a job on the eras staff this is fine the way you put it itll do a lot of good but how in hell are you going to handle judd  for three days the inspiration was withheld and then as i was strolling down boyne street after lunch gazing into the store windows it came suddenly without warning like most inspirations worth anything it was very simple within half an hour i had reached monahans saloon and found mr jason out of bed but still in his bedroom seated meditatively at the window that looked over the alley  you know the crowd in new york behind this automatic company as well as i do jason i said why do you want to deal with them when weve always been straight with you when were ready to meet them and go one better name your price  suppose i dowhat then he replied this things gone pretty far under that damned new charter the franchise has got to be bid forhasnt it and the people want this company therell be a howl from one end of this town to the other if we throw em down  well look out for the public i assured him smiling  well he said with one of his glances that were like flashes what you got up your sleeve  suppose another telephone company steps in and bids a little higher for the franchise that relieves your aldermen of all responsibility doesnt it  another telephone company he repeated  i had already named it on my walk  the interurban i said  a dummy company said mr jason  lively enough to bid something over a hundred thousand to the city for its franchise i replied  judd jason with a queer look got up and went to a desk in a dark corner and after rummaging for a few moments in one of the pigeonholes drew forth a glass cylinder which he held out as he approached me  you get it mr paret he said  what is it i asked a bomb  that he announced as he twisted the tube about in his long fingers holding it up to the light is the finest brand of cigars ever made in cuba a gentleman who had every reason to be grateful to mei wont say who he wasgave me that once well the lord made me sos i cant appreciate any better tobacco than those fivecent bobtails monahans got downstairs and i saved it i saved it for the man who would put something over me some day andyou get it  thank you i said unconsciously falling in with the semiceremony of his manner i do not flatter myself that the solution i have suggested did not also occur to you  youll smoke it he asked  surely  now here with me  certainly i agreed a little puzzled as i broke the seal pulled out the cork and unwrapped the cigar from its gold foil he took a stick and rapped loudly on the floor after a brief interval footsteps were heard on the stairs and mike monahan white aproned and scarlet faced appeared at the door  bobtails said mr jason laconically  its them i thought yed be wanting said the saloonkeeper holding out a handful judd jason lighted one and began smoking reflectively  i gazed about the mean room with its litter of newspapers and reports its shabby furniture and these seemed to have become incongruous out of figure in the chair facing me keeping with the thoughtful figure in the chair facing me  you had a college education mr paret he remarked at length  yes  lifes a queer thing now if id had a college education like you and youd been thrown on the world like me maybe id be livin up there on grant avenue and youd be down here over the saloon  maybe i said wondering uneasily whether he meant to imply a similarity in our gifts but his manner remained impassive speculative  ever read carlyles french revolution he asked suddenly  why yes part of it a good while ago  when you was in college  yes  ive got a little library here he said getting up and raising the shades and opening the glass doors of a bookcase which had escaped my attention he took down a volume of carlyle bound in half calf  wouldnt think i cared for such things would you he demanded as he handed it to me  well you never can tell what a mans real tastes are until you know him i observed to conceal my surprise  thats so he agreed i like bookssome books if id had an education id have liked more of em known more about em now i can read this one over and over that feller carlyle was a genius he could look right into the bowels of the volcano and he was on to how men and women feet down there how they hate how they square emselves when they get a chance  he had managed to bring before me vividly that terrible volcanic flow on versailles of the paris mob he put back the book and resumed his seat  and i know how these people fed down here below the crust he went on waving his cigar out of the window as though to indicate the whole of that mean district they hate and their hate is molten hell ive been through it  but youve got on top i suggested  sure ive got on top do you know why its because i hatedthats why a mans feelings if theyre strong enough have a lot to do with what he becomes  but he has to have ability too i objected  sure he has to have ability but his feeling is the driving power if he feels strong enough he can make a little ability go a long way  i was struck by the force of this remark i scarcely recognized judd jason the man as he revealed himself had become at once more sinister and more fascinating  i can guess how some of those jacobins felt when they had the aristocrats in the dock theyd got on topthe jacobins i mean its human nature to want to get on topaint it he looked at me and smiled but he did not seem to expect a reply well what you call society rich respectable society like you belong to would have made a bum and a criminal out of me if i hadnt been too smart for em and its a kind of satisfaction to have em coming down here to monahans for things they cant have without my leave ive got a half nelson on em i wouldnt live up on grant avenue if you gave me scherers new house  i was silent  instead of starting my career in college i started in jail he went on apparently ignoring any effect he may have produced so subtly so dispassionately indeed was he delivering himself of these remarks that it was impossible to tell whether he meant their application to be personal to me or general to my associates i went to jail when i was fourteen because i wanted a knife to make kite sticks and i stole a razor from a barber i was bitter when they steered me into a lockup in hickory street it was full of bugs and crooks and they put me in the same cell with an oldtimer named red waters who was one of the slickest safeblowers around in those days red took a shine to me found out i had a head piece and said their gang could use a clever boy if id go in with him i could make all kinds of money i guess i might have joined the gang if red hadnt kept talkingabout how the boss of his district named gallagher would come down and get him outand sure enough gallagher did come down and get him out i thought id rather be gallagher than redred had to serve time once in a while soon as he got out i went down to gallaghers saloon and there was red leaning over the bar heres a smart kid he says he and me were roommates over in hickory street he got to gassing me and telling me id better come along with him when gallagher came in what is it yed like to be my son says he a politician i told him i was through going to jail gallagher had a laugh you could hear all over the place he took me on as a kind of handy boy around the establishment and by and by i began to run errands and find out things for him i was boss of that ward myself when i was twentysix howd you like that cigar  i praised it  it ought to have been a good one he declared well i dont want to keep you here all afternoon telling you my life story  i assured him i had been deeply interested  pretty slick idea of yours that dummy company mr paret go ahead and organize it he rose which was contrary to his custom on the departure of a visitor drop in again well talk about the books  i walked slowly back reflecting on this conversation upon the motives impelling mr jason to become thus confidential nor was it the most comforting thought in the world that the artist in me had appealed to the artist in him that he had hailed me as a breather but for the grace of god i might have been mr jason and he mr paret undoubtedly that was what he had meant to imply and i was forced to admit that he had succeededdeliberately or notin making the respectable mr paret just a trifle uncomfortable  in the marble vestibule of the corn national bank i ran into tallant holding his brown straw hat in his hand and looking a little more motheaten than usual  hello paret he said how is that telephone business getting along  is dickinson in i asked  tallant nodded  we went through the cool bank with its shining brass and red mahogany its tiled floor its busy tellers attending to files of clients to the presidents sanctum in the rear leonard dickinson very spruce and dignified in a black cutaway coat was dictating rapidly to a woman stenographer whom he dismissed when he saw us the door was shut  i was just asking paret about the telephone affair said mr tallant  well have you found a way out leonard dickinson looked questioningly at me  its all right i answered ive seen jason  all right they both ejaculated at once  we win i said  they stood gazing at me even dickinson who was rarely ruffled seemed excited  do you mean to say youve fixed it he demanded  i nodded they stared at me in amazement  how the deuce did you manage it  we organize the interurban telephone company and bid for the franchisethats all  a dummy company cried tallant why its simple as abc  dickinson smiled he was tremendously relieved and showed it  thats true about all great ideas tallant he said theyre simple only it takes a clever man to think of them  and jason agrees tallant demanded  i nodded again well have to outbid the automatic people i havent seen bitter yet about theabout the fee  thats all right said leonard dickinson quickly i take off my hat to you youve saved us you can ask any fee you like he added genially lets go over toto the ashuela and get some lunch he had been about to say the club but he remembered mr tallants presence in time nothings worrying you hugh he added as we went out followed by the glances of his employees  nothing i said     xvix  making money in those days was so ridiculously easy the trouble was to know how to spend it one evening when i got home i told maude i had a surprise for her  a surprise she asked looking up from a little pink smock she was making for chickabiddy  ive bought that lot on grant avenue next to the ogilvys  she dropped her sewing and stared at me  arent you pleased i asked at last we are going to have a house of our very own whats the matter  i cant bear the thought of leaving here im so used to it ive grown to love it its part of me  but i exclaimed a little exasperated you didnt expect to live here always did you the house has been too small for us for years i thought youd be delighted this was not strictly true for i had rather expected some such action on her part most women would of course if its going to make such a difference to you as that ill sell the lot that wont be difficult  i got up and started to go into my study she half rose and her sewing fell to the floor  oh why are we always having misunderstandings do sit down a minute hugh dont think im not appreciative she pleaded it wassuch a shock  i sat down rather reluctantly  i cant express what i think she continued rather breathlessly but sometimes im actually frightened were going through life so fast in these days and it doesnt seem as if we were getting the real things out of it im afraid of your success and of all the money youre making  i smiled  im not so rich yet as riches go in these days that you need be alarmed i said  she looked at me helplessly a moment  i feel that it isntright somehow that youll pay for it that well pay for it goodness knows we have everything we want and more too this housethis house is real and im afraid that wont be a home wont be real that well be overwhelmed withwith things  she was interrupted by the entrance of the children but after dinner when she had seen them to bed as was her custom she came downstairs into my study and said quietlyi was wrong hugh if you want to build a house if you feel that youd be happier i have no right to object of course my sentiment for this house is natural the children were born here but ive realized we couldnt live here always  im glad you look at it that way i replied why were already getting cramped maude and now youre going to have a governess i dont know where youd put her  not too large a house she pleaded i know you think im silly but this extravagance we see everywhere does make me uneasy perhaps its because im provincial and always shall be  well we must have a house large enough to be comfortable in i said theres no reason why we shouldnt be comfortable i thought it as well not to confess my ambitions and i was greatly relieved that she did not reproach me for buying the lot without consulting her indeed i was grateful for this unanticipated acquiescence i felt nearer to her than i had for a long time i drew up another chair to my desk  sit down and well make a few sketches just for fun i urged  hugh she said presently as we were blacking out prospective rooms do you remember all those drawings and plans we made in england on our wedding trip and how we knew just what we wanted and changed our minds every few days and now were ready to build and havent any ideas at all  yes i answeredbut i did not look at her  i have the book stillits in the attic somewhere packed away in a box i suppose those plans would seem ridiculous now  it was quite truenow that we were ready to build the home that had been deferred so long now that i had the money to spend without stint on its construction the irony of life had deprived me of those strong desires and predilections i had known on my wedding trip what a joy it would have been to build then but now i found myself wholly lacking in definite ideas as to style and construction secretly i looked forward to certain luxuries such as a bedroom and dressingroom and warm tiled bathroom all to myself bachelor privacies for which i had longed two mornings later at the breakfast table maude asked me if i had thought of an architect  why archie lammerton i suppose who else is there have you anyone else in mind  nno said maude but i heard of such a clever man in boston who doesnt charge mr lammertons prices and who designs such beautiful private houses  but we can afford to pay lammertons prices i replied smiling and why shouldnt we have the best  are you surehe is the best hugh  everybody has him i said  maude smiled in return  i suppose thats a good reason she answered  of course its a good reason i assured her these peoplethe people we knowwouldnt have had lammerton unless he was satisfactory whats the matter with his houses  well said maude theyre not very original i dont say theyre not good in away but they lack a certain imagination its difficult for me to express what i mean machine made isnt precisely the idea but there should be a certain irregularity in artshouldnt there i saw a reproduction in one of the architectural journals of a house in boston by a man named frey that seemed to me to have great charm  here was lucia unmistakably  thats all very well i said impatiently but when one has to live in a house one wants something more than artistic irregularity lammerton knows how to build for everyday existence hes a practical man as well as a man of taste he may not be a christopher wrenn but he understands conveniences and comforts his chimneys dont smoke his windows are tight he knows what systems of heating are the best and whom to go to he knows what good plumbing is im rather surprised you dont appreciate that maude youre so particular as to what kind of rooms the children shall have and you want a schoolroomnursery with all the latest devices with sun and ventilation the berringers wouldnt have had him the hollisters and dickinsons wouldnt have had him if his work lacked taste  and nancy wouldnt have had him added maude and she smiled once more  well i havent consulted nancy or anyone else i replieda little tartly perhaps you dont seem to realize that some fashions may have a basis of reason they are not all silly as lucia seems to think if lammerton builds satisfactory houses he ought to be forgiven for being the fashion he ought to have a chance i got up to leave lets see what kind of a plan hell draw up at any rate  her glance was almost indulgent  of course hugh i want you to be satisfied to be pleased she said  and you i questioned you are to live in the house more than i  oh im sure it will turn out all right she replied now youd better run along i know youre late  i am late i admitted rather lamely if you dont care for lammertons drawings well get another architect  several years before mr lammerton had arrived among us with a beaux arts moustache and letters of introduction to mrs durrett and others we found him the most adaptable the most accommodating of young men always ready to donate his talents and his services to private theatricals tableaux and fancydress balls to take a place at a table at the last moment one of his most appealing attributes was his belief in our citya form of patriotism that culminated in later years in million population clubs i have often heard him declare when the ladies had left the diningroom that there was positively no limit to our future growth and incidentally to our future wealth such sentiments as these could not fail to add to any mans popularity and his success was a foregone conclusion almost before we knew it he was building the new union station of which he had foreseen the need to take care of the millions to which our population was to be swelled building the new post office that the unceasing efforts of theodore watling finally procured for us building indeed nancys new house the largest of our private mansions save mr scherers a commission that had immediately brought about others from the dickinsons and the berringers that very day i called on him in his offices at the top of one of our new buildings where many young draftsmen were bending over their boards i was ushered into his private studio  i suppose you want something handsome hugh he said looking at me over his cigarette something commensurate with these fees i hear you are getting  well i want to be comfortable i admitted  we lunched at the club together where we talked over the requirements  when he came to dinner the next week and spread out his sketch on the livingroom table maude drew in her breath  why hugh she exclaimed in dismay its as big asas big as the white house  not quite i answered laughing with archie we may as well take our ease in our old age  take our ease echoed maude well rattle round in it ill never get used to it  after a month mrs paret ill wager youll be wondering how you ever got along without it said archie  it was not as big as the white house yet it could not be called small i had seen to that the long facade was imposing dignified with a touch of conventionality and solidity in keeping with my standing in the city it was georgian of plumcoloured brick with marble trimmings and marble wedges over the ample windows some years later i saw the house by ferguson of new york from which archie had cribbed it at one end off the diningroom was a semicircular conservatory there was a small portico with marble pillars and in the ample swift sloping roof many dormers servants rooms archie explained the look of anxiety on maudes face deepened as he went over the floor plans the receptionroom dining room to seat thirty the servants hall and upstairs maudes room boudoir and bath and dress closet my apartments adjoining on one side and the childrens on the other and the guestrooms with baths  maude surrendered as one who gives way to the inevitable when the actual building began we both of us experienced i think a certain mild excitement and walked out there sometimes with the children in the spring evenings and on sunday afternoons excitement is perhaps too strong a word for my feelings there was a pleasurable anticipation on my part a looking forward to a more decorous a more luxurious existence a certain impatience at the delays inevitable in building but a new legal commercial enterprise of magnitude began to absorb me at his time and somehow the building of this homethe first that we possessed was not the event it should have been there were moments when i felt cheated when i wondered what had become of that capacity for enjoyment which in my youth had been so keen i remember indeed one grey evening when i went there alone after the workmen had departed and stood in the litter of mortar and bricks and boards gazing at the completed front of the house it was even larger than i had imagined it from the plans in the summer twilight there was an air about itif not precisely menacing at least portentous with its gaping windows and towering roof i was a little tired from a hard day i had the odd feeding of having raised up something with whichmomentarily at leasti doubted my ability to cope something huge impersonal something that ought to have represented a fireside a sanctuary and yet was the embodiment of an element quite alien to the home a restless element with which our american atmosphere had by invisible degrees become charged as i stared at it the odd fancy seized me that the building somehow typified my own career i had gained something in truth but had i not also missed something something a different home would have embodied  maude and the children had gone to the seaside  with a vague uneasiness i turned away from the contemplation of those walls the companion mansions were closed their blinds tightly drawn the neighbourhood was as quiet as the country save for a slight but persistent noise that impressed itself on my consciousness i walked around the house to spy in the back yard a young girl rather stealthily gathering laths and fragments of joists and flooring and loading them into a childs expresswagon she started when she saw me she was little more than a child and the loose calico dress she wore seemed to emphasize her thinness she stood stockstill staring at me with frightened yet defiant eyes i too felt a strange timidity in her presence  why do you stop i asked at length  say is this your heap she demanded  i acknowledged it a hint of awe widened her eyes then site glanced at the halffilled wagon  this stuff aint no use to you is it  no im glad to have you take it  she shifted to the other foot but did not continue her gathering an impulse seized me i put down my walkingstick and began picking up pieces of wood flinging them into the wagon i looked at her again rather furtively she had not moved her attitude puzzled me for it was one neither of surprise nor of protest the spectacle of the millionaire owner of the house engaged in this menial occupation gave her no thrills i finished the loading  there i said and drew a dollar bill out of my pocket and gave it to her even then she did not thank me but took up the wagon tongue and went off leaving on me a disheartening impression of numbness of life crushed out i glanced up once more at the mansion i had built for myself looming in the dusk and walked hurriedly away  one afternoon some three weeks after we had moved into the new house i came out of the club where i had been lunching in conference with scherer and two capitalists from new york it was after four oclock the day was fading the street lamps were beginning to cast sickly streaks of jadecoloured light across the slush of the pavements it was the sight of this slush which for a brief half hour that morning had been pure snow and had sent matthew and moreton and biddy into ecstasies at the notion of a real christmas that brought to my mind the immanence of the festival and the fact that i had as yet bought no presents such was the predicament in which i usually found myself on christmas eve and it was not without a certain sense of annoyance at the task thus abruptly confronting me that i got into my automobile and directed the chauffeur to the shopping district the crowds surged along the wet sidewalks and overflowed into the street and over the heads of the people i stared at the blazing shopwindows decked out in christmas greens my chauffeur a bristlyhaired parisian blew his horn insolently men and women jostled each other to get out of the way their holiday mood giving place to resentment as they stared into the windows of the limousine with the american inability to sit still i shifted from one corner of the seat to another impatient at the slow progress of the machine and i felt a certain contempt for human beings that they should make all this fuss burden themselves with all these senseless purchases for a tradition the automobile stopped and i fought my way across the sidewalk into the store of that timehonoured firm elgin yates and garner pausing uncertainly before the very counter where some ten years before i had bought an engagement ring young mr garner himself spied me and handing over a customer to a tired clerk hurried forward to greet me his manner implying that my entrance was in some sort an event i had become used to this aroma of deference  what can i show you mr paret he asked  i dont knowim looking around i said vaguely bewildered by the glittering baubles by which i was confronted what did maude want while i was gazing into the case mr garner opened a safe behind him laying before me a large sapphire set with diamonds in a platinum brooch a beautiful stone in the depths of it gleaming a fire like a star in an arctic sky i had not given maude anything of value of late decidedly this was of value mr garner named the price glibly if mrs paret didnt care for it it might be brought back or exchanged i took it with a sigh of relief leaving the store i paused on the edge of the rushing stream of humanity with the problem of the childrens gifts still to be solved i thought of my own childhood when at christmastide i had walked with my mother up and down this very street so changed and modernized now recalling that i had had definite desires desperate ones but my imagination failed me when i tried to summon up the emotions connected with them i had no desires now i could buy anything in reason in the whole street what did matthew and moreton want and little biddy maude had not spoiled them but they didnt seem to have any definite wants the children made me think with a sudden softening of tom peters and i went into a tobacconists and bought him a box of expensive cigars then i told the chauffeur to take me to a toyshop where i stood staring through a plateglass window at the elaborate playthings devised for the modern children of luxury in the centre was a toy manofwar three feet in length with turrets and guns and propellers and a real steamengine as a boy i should have dreamed about it schemed for it bartered my immortal soul for it butif i gave it to matthew what was there for moreton a steam locomotive caught my eye almost as elaborate forcing my way through the doors i captured a salesman and from a state bordering on nervous collapse he became galvanized into an intense alertness and respect when he understood my desires he didnt know the price of the objects in question he brought the proprietor an obsequious little german who on learning my name repeated it in every sentence for biddy i chose a doll that was all but human when held by a young woman for my inspection it elicited murmurs of admiration from the women shoppers by whom we were surrounded the proprietor promised to make a special delivery of the three articles before seven oclock  presently the automobile after speeding up the asphalt of grant avenue stopped before the new house in spite of the change that house had made in my life in three weeks i had become amazingly used to it yet i had an odd feeling that christmas eve as i stood under the portico with my key in the door the same feeling of the impersonality of the place which i had experienced before not that for one moment i would have exchanged it for the smaller house we had left i opened the door how often in that other house i had come in the evening seeking quiet my brain occupied with a problem only to be annoyed by the romping of the children on the landing above a noise in one end of it echoed to the other but here as i entered the hall all was quiet a dignified deepcarpeted stairway swept upward before me and on either side were wide empty rooms and in the subdued light of one of them i saw a dark figure moving silently aboutthe butler he came forward to relieve me deftly of my hat and overcoat well i had it at last this establishment to which i had for so long looked forward and yet that evening as i hesitated in the hall i somehow was unable to grasp that it was real and permanent the very solidity of the walls and doors paradoxically suggested transientness the butler a flitting ghost how still the place was almost oppressively still i recalled oddly a story of a peasant who yearning for the great life had stumbled upon an empty palace its tables set with food in golden dishes before two days had passed he had fled from it in horror back to his crowded cottage and his drudgery in the fields never once had the sense of possession of the palace been realized nor did i feel that i possessed this house though i had the deeds of it in my safe and the receipted bills in my files it eluded me seemed in my bizarre mood of that evening almost to mock me you have built me it seemed to say but i am stronger than you because you have not earned me ridiculous when the years of my labour and the size of my bank account were considered such however is the verbal expression of my feeling was the house empty after all had something happened with a slight panicky sensation i climbed the stairs with their endless shallow treads to hurry through the silent hallway to the schoolroom reassuring noises came faintly through the heavy door i opened it little biddy was careening round and round crying outtomorrows chrismas santa claus is coming tonight  matthew was regarding her indulgently sympathetically moreton rather scornfully the myth had been exploded for both but matthew still hugged it that was the difference between them maude seated on the floor perceived me first and glanced up at me with a smile  its father she said  biddy stopped in the midst of a pirouette at the age of seven she was still shy with me and retreated towards maude  arent we going to have a tree father demanded moreton aggressively mother wont tell usneither will miss allsop  miss allsop was their governess  why do you want a tree i asked  oh for biddy he said  it wouldnt be christmas without a tree matthew declared and santa claus he added for his sisters benefit  perhaps santa claus when he sees weve got this big house will think we dont need anything and go on to some poorer children said maude you wouldnt blame him if he did thatwould you  the response to this appeal cannot be said to have been enthusiastic  after dinner when at last all of them were in bed we dressed the tree it might better be said that maude and miss allsop dressed it while i gave a perfunctory aid both the women took such a joy in the process vying with each other in getting effects and as i watched them eagerly draping the tinsel and pinning on the glittering ornaments i wondered why it was that i was unable to find the same joy as they thus it had been every christmas eve i was always tired when i got home and after dinner relaxation set in  an electrician had come while we were at the table and had fastened on the little electric bulbs which did duty as candles  oh said maude as she stood off to survey the effect isnt it beautiful come miss allsop lets get the presents  they flew out of the room and presently hurried back with their arms full of the usual parcels parcels from maudes family in elkington from my own relatives from the blackwoods and the peterses from nancy in the meantime i had had my own contributions brought up the man of war the locomotive the big doll maude stood staring  hugh theyll be utterly ruined she exclaimed  the boys might as well have something instructive i replied and as for biddynothings too good for her  i might have known you wouldnt forget them although you are so busy  we filled the three stockings hung by the great fireplace then with a last lingering look at the brightness of the tree she stood in the doorway and turned the electric switch  not before seven tomorrow morning miss allsop she said hugh you will get up wont you you mustnt miss seeing them you can go back to bed again  i promised  evidently this was reality to maude and had it not been one of my dreams of marriage this preparing for the childrens christmas remembering the fierce desires of my own childhood it struck me after i had kissed her good night and retired to my dressingroom that fierce desires burned within me still but the objects towards which their flames leaped out differed that was all had i remained a child since my idea of pleasure was still that of youth the craving far excitement adventure was still unslaked the craving far freedom as keen as ever during the whole of my married life i had been conscious of an inner protest against settling down as tom peters had settled down the smaller house from which we had moved with its enforced propinquity hard emphasized the bondage of marriage now i had two rooms to myself in the undisputed possession of which i had taken a puerile delight on one side of my dressingroom archie lammerton had provided a huge closet containing the latest devices for the keeping of a multitudinous wardrobe there was a readinglamp and the easiest of easychairs imported from england while between the windows were shelves of italian walnut which i had filled with the books i had bought while at cambridge and had never since opened as i sank down in my chair that odd feeling of uneasiness of transience and unreality of unsatisfaction i had had ever since we had moved suddenly became intensified and at the very moment when i had gained everything i had once believed a man could desire i was successful i was rich my health had not failed i had a wife who catered to my wishes lovable children who gave no trouble and yetthere was still the void to be filled the old void i had felt as a boy the longing for something beyond me i knew not what there was the strange inability to taste any of these things the need at every turn for excitement for a stimulus my marriage had been a disappointment though i strove to conceal this from myself a disappointment because it had not filled the requirements of my categoryexcitement and mystery i had provided the setting and lacked the happiness another woman nancymight have given me the needed stimulation and yet my thoughts did not dwell on nancy that night my longings were not directed towards her but towards the vision of a calm contented married happiness i had looked forward to in youtha vision suddenly presented once more by the sight of maudes simple pleasure in dressing the christmas tree what restless fiendish element in me prevented my enjoying that i had something of the fearful feeling of a ghost in my own house and among my own family of a spirit doomed to wander unable to share in what should have been my own in what would have saved me were i able to partake of it was it too late to make that effort presently the strains of music pervaded my consciousness the chimes of trinity ringing out in the damp night the christmas hymn adeste fideles it was midnight it was christmas how clear the notes rang through the wet air that came in at my window back into the dim centuries that music led me into candlelit gothic chapels of monasteries on windswept heights above the firs and cathedrals in mediaeval cities twilight ages of war and scourge and stress and stormand faith oh come all ye faithful what a strange thing that faith whose flame so marvellously persisted piercing the gloom the christmas myth as i had heard someone once call it did it possess the power to save me save me from what ah in this hour i knew in the darkness the danger loomed up before me vague yet terrible and i trembled why was not this thing ever present to chasten and sober me the thing was myself  into my remembrance by what suggestion i know not came that march evening when i had gone to holder chapel at harvard to listen to a preacher a personality whose fame and influence had since spread throughout the land some dim fear had possessed me then i recalled vividly the man and the face of hermann krebs as i drew back from the doorway  when i awoke my disquieting retrospective mood had disappeared and yet there clung to me minus the sanction of fear or reward or revealed truth a certain determination to behave on this day at least more like a father and a husband to make an effort to enter into the spirit of the festival and see what happened i dressed in cheerful haste took the sapphire pendant from its velvet box tiptoed into the still silent schoolroom and hung it on the tree flooding on the electric light that set the tinsel and globes ablaze no sooner had i done this than i heard the patter of feet in the hallway and a highpitched voicebiddyscrying outits santa claus  three small flannelwrappered figures stood in the doorway  why its father exclaimed moreton  and hes all dressed said matthew  ohhh cried biddy staring at the blazing tree isnt it beautiful  maude was close behind them she gave an exclamation of delighted surprise when she saw me and then stood gazing with shining eyes at the children especially at biddy who stood dazzled by the glory of the constellation confronting her matthew too wished to prolong the moment of mystery it was the practical moreton who criedlets see what weve got  the assault and the sacking began i couldnt help thinking as i watched them of my own wildly riotous christmasmorning sensations when all the gifts had worn the aura of the supernatural but the arrival of these toys was looked upon by my children as a part of the natural order of the universe at maudes suggestion the night before we had placed my presents pieces de resistance at a distance from the tree in the hope that they would not be spied at once that they would be in some sort a climax it was matthew who first perceived the ship and identified it by the card as his property to him it was clearly wonderful but no miracle he did not cry out or call the attention of the others to it but stood with his feet apart examining it his first remark being a query as to why it didnt fly the american flag its ensign was british then moreton saw the locomotive was told that it was his and took possession of it violently why wasnt there more track wouldnt i get more track i explained that it would go by steam and he began unscrewing the cap on the little boiler until he was distracted by the manofwar and with natural acquisitiveness started to take possession of that biddy was bewildered by the doll which maude had taken up and was holding in her lap she had had talking dolls before and dolls that closed their eyes she recognized this one indeed as a sort of superdoll but her little mind was modern too and set no limits on what might be accomplished she patted it but was more impressed by the raptures of miss allsop who had come in and was admiring it with some extravagance suddenly the child caught sight of her stocking until now forgotten and darted for the fireplace  i turned to maude who stood beside me watching them  but you havent looked on the tree yourself i reminded her  she gave me an odd questioning glance and got up and set down the doll as she stood for a moment gazing at the lights she seemed very girlish in her dressinggown with her hair in two long plaits down her back  oh hugh she lifted the pendant from the branch and held it up her gratitude her joy at receiving a present was deeper than the childrens  you chose it for me  i felt something like a pang when i thought how little trouble it had been  if you dont like it i said or wish to have it changed  changed she exclaimed reproachfully do you think id change it onlyits much too valuable  i smiled miss allsop deftly undid the clasp and hung it around maudes neck  how it suits you mrs paret she cried  this pendant was by no means the only present i had given maude in recent years and though she cared as little for jewels as for dress she seemed to attach to it a peculiar value and significance that disturbed and smote me for the incident had revealed a love unchanged and unchangeable had she taken my gift as a sign that my indifference was melting  as i went downstairs and into the library to read the financial page of the morning newspaper i asked myself with a certain disquiet whether in the formal complicated and luxurious conditions in which we now lived it might be possible to build up new ties and common interests i reflected that this would involve confessions and confidences on my part since there was a whole side of my life of which maude knew nothing i had convinced myself long ago that a mans business career was no affair of his wifes i had justified that career to myself yet i had always had a vague feeling that maude had she known the details would not have approved of it impossible indeed for a woman to grasp these problems they were outside of her experience  nevertheless something might be done to improve our relationship something which would relieve me of that uneasy lack of unity i felt when at home of the lassitude and ennui i was wont to feel creeping over me on sundays and holidays     xx  i find in relating those parts of my experience that seem to be of most significance i have neglected to tell of my mothers death which occurred the year before we moved to grant avenue she had clung the rest of her days to the house in which i had been born of late years she had lived in my children and maudes devotion to her had been unflagging truth compels me to say that she had long ceased to be a factor in my life i have thought of her in later years  coincident with the unexpected feeling of fruitlessness that came to me with the grant avenue house of things achieved but not realized or appreciated was the appearance of a cloud on the business horizon or rather on the political horizon since it is hard to separate the two realms there were signs for those who could read of a rising popular storm during the earliest years of the new century the political atmosphere had changed the public had shown a tendency to grow restless and everybody knows how important it is for financial operations for prosperity that the people should mind their own business in short our commercialromantic pilgrimage began to meet with unexpected resistance it was as though the nation were entering into a senseless conspiracy to kill prosperity  in the first place in regard to the presidency of the united states a cog had unwittingly been slipped it had always been recognizedas i have saidby responsible financial personages that the impulses of the majority of americans could not be trusted that thesewho had inherited illusions of freedommust be governed firmly yet with delicacy unknown to them their presidents must be chosen for them precisely as mr watling had been chosen for the people of our state and the popular enthusiasm manufactured later there were informal meetings in new york in washington where candidates were discussed not that such and such a man was settled uponit was a process of elimination usually the affair had gone smoothly for instance a while before a benevolent capitalist of the middle west an intimate of adolf scherer had become obsessed with the idea that a friend of his was the safest and sanest man for the head of the nation had convinced his fellowcapitalists of this whereupon he had gone ahead to spend his energy and his money freely to secure the nomination and election of this gentleman  the republican national committee the republican national convention were allowed to squabble to their hearts content as to whether smith jones or brown should be nominated but it was clearly understood that if robinson or white were chosen there would be no corporation campaign funds this applied also to the democratic party on the rare occasions when it seemed to have an opportunity of winning now however through an unpardonable blunder there had got into the white house a president who was inclined to ignore advice who appealed over the heads of the advisers to the populace who went about tilting at the industrial structures we had so painfully wrought and in frequent blasts of presidential messages enunciated new and heretical doctrines who attacked the railroads encouraged the brazen treason of labour unions inspired an army of muckrakers to fill the magazines with the wildest and most violent of language state legislatures were emboldened to pass mischievous and restrictive laws and much of my time began to be occupied in inducing by various means our courts to declare these unconstitutional how we sighed for a business man or a lawyer in the white house the country had gone mad the stockmarket trembled the cry of corporation control resounded everywhere and everywhere demagogues arose to inaugurate reform campaigns in an abortive attempt to clean up politics down with the bosses who were the tools of the corporations  in our own city which we fondly believed to be proof against the prevailing madness a slight epidemic occurred slight yet momentarily alarming accidents will happen even in the best regulated political organizationsand accidents in these days appeared to be the rule a certain mr edgar greenhalge a middleaged mildmannered and inoffensive man who had made a moderate fortune in wholesale drugs was elected to the school board later on some of us had reason to suspect that perry blackwoodwith more astuteness than he had been given credit forwas responsible for mr greenhalges candidacy at any rate he was not a man to oppose and in his previous life had given no hint that he might become a trouble maker nothing happened for several months but one day on which i had occasion to interview mr jason on a little matter of handing over to the railroad a piece of land belonging to the city which was known as billings bowl he inferred that mr greenhaige might prove a disturber of that profound peace with which the city administration had for many years been blessed  who the hell is he was mr jasons question  it appeared that mr gs private life had been investigated with disappointingly barren results he was seemingly an anomalistic being in our nietzschean age an unaggressive man he had never sold any drugs to the city he was not a church member nor could it be learned that he had ever wandered into those byways of the town where mr jason might easily have got trace of him if he had any vices he kept them locked up in a safedeposit box that could not be located he was very genial and had a way of conveying disturbing factswhen he wished to convey themunder cover of the most amusing stories mr jason was not a man to get panicky greenhalge could be handled all right onlywhat was there in it for greenhalgea nut difficult for mr jason to crack the two other members of the school board were solid here again the wisest of men was proved to err for mr greenhalge turned out to have powers of persuasion he made what in religious terms would have been called a conversion in the case of another member of the board an hitherto staunch old reprobate by the name of muller an exsaloonkeeper in comfortable circumstances to whom the idea of public office had appealed  mr greenhalge having got wind of certain transactions that interested him extremely brought them in his goodnatured way to the knowledge of mr gregory the district attorney suggesting that he investigate mr gregory smiled undertook as delicately as possible to convey to mr greenhalge the ways of the world and of the political world in particular wherein it seemed everyone was a good fellow mr greenhalge was evidently a good fellow and didnt want to make trouble over little things no mr greenhalge didnt want to make trouble he appreciated a comfortable life as much as mr gregory he told the district attorney a funny story which might or might not have had an application to the affair and took his leave with the remark that he had been happy to make mr gregorys acquaintance on his departure the district attorneys countenance changed he severely rebuked a subordinate for some trivial mistake and walked as rapidly as he could carry his considerable weight to monahans saloon one of the things mr gregory had pointed out incidentally was that mr greenhalges evidence was vague and that a grand jury wanted facts which might be difficult to obtain mr greenhalge thinking over the suggestion sent for krebs in the course of a month or two the investigation was accomplished greenhalge went back to gregory who repeated his homilies whereupon he was handed a hundred or so typewritten pages of evidence  it was a dramatic moment  mr gregory resorted to pleading he was sure that mr greenhalge didnt want to be disagreeable it was true and unfortunate that such things were so but they would be amended he promised all his influence to amend them the public conscience said mr gregory was being aroused now how much better for the party for the reputation the fair name of the city if these things could be corrected quietly and nobody indicted or tried between sensible and humane men wasnt that the obvious way after the election suit could be brought to recover the money but mr greenhalge appeared to be one of those hopeless individuals without a spark of party loyalty he merely continued to smile and to suggest that the district attorney prosecute mr gregory temporized and presently left the city on a vacation a day or two after his second visit to the district attorneys office mr greenhalge had a call from the city auditor and the purchasing agent who talked about their familieswhich was very painful it was also intimated to mr greenhalge by others who accosted him that he was just the man for mayor he smiled and modestly belittled his qualifications  suddenly one fine morning a part of the evidence krebs had gathered appeared in the columns of the mail and state a new and enterprising newspaper for which the growth and prosperity of our city were responsible the sort of revelations that stirred to amazement and wrath innocent citizens of nearly every city in our country politics and graft infesting our entire educational system teachers and janitors levied upon prices that took the breath away paid to favoured firms for supplies specifications so worded that reasonable bids were barred the respectable firm of ellery and knowles was involved in spite of our horror we were americans and saw the humour of the situation and laughed at the caricature in the mail and state representing a scholar holding up a pencil and a legend under it no its not gold but it ought to be  here i must enter into a little secret history any affair that threatened the integrity of mr jasons organization was of serious moment to the gentlemen of the financial world who found that organization invaluable and who were also concerned about the fair name of their community a conference in the boyne club decided that the city officials were being persecuted and entitled therefore to the very best of counselin this instance mr hugh paret it was also thought wise by mr dickinson mr gorse and mr grierson and by mr paret himself that he should not appear in the matter an aspiring young attorney mr arbuthnot was retained to conduct the case in public thus capital came to the assistance of mr jason a fund was raised and i was given carte blanche to defend the miserable city auditor and purchasing agent both of whom elicited my sympathy for they were stout men and rapidly losing weight our first care was to create a delay in the trial of the case in order to give the public excitement a chance to die down for the public is proverbially unable to fix its attention for long on one object continually demanding the distraction that our newspapers make it their business to supply fortunately a murder was committed in one of our suburbs creating a mystery that filled the extras for some weeks and this was opportunely followed by the embezzlement of a considerable sum by the cashier of one of our state banks public interest was divided between baseball and the tracking of this criminal to new zealand  our resentment was directed not so much against commissioner greenhalge as against krebs it is curious how keen is the instinct of men like grierson dickinson tallant and scherer for the really dangerous opponent who the deuce was this man krebs well i could supply them with some information they doubtless recalled the galligan case and miller gorse who forgot nothing also remembered his opposition in the legislature to house bill 709 he had continued to be the obscure legal champion of oppressed labour but how he had managed to keep body and soul together i knew not i had encountered him occasionally in court corridors or on the street he did not seem to change much nor did he appear in our brief and perfunctory conversations to bear any resentment against me for the part i had taken in the galligan affair i avoided him when it was possible i had to admit that he had done a remarkably good piece of work in collecting greenhalges evidence and how the erring city officials were to be rescued became a matter of serious concern gregory the district attorney was in an abject funk in any case a mediocre lawyer after the indictment he was no help at all i had to do all the work and after we had selected the particular railroad judge before whom the case was to be tried i talked it over with him his name was notting he understood perfectly what was required of him and that he was for the moment the chief bulwark on which depended the logical interests of capital and sane government for their defence also his reelection was at stake it was indicated to newspapers such as the mail and state showing a desire to keep up public interest in the affair that their advertising matter might decrease mr sherrills great department store for instance did not approve of this sort of agitation certain stationers booksellers and other business men had got cold feet as mr jason put it the prospect of bankruptcy suddenly looming ahead of themsince the corn national bank held certain paper  in short when the case did come to trial it blew up as one of our ward leaders dynamically expressed it several important witnesses were mysteriously lacking and two or three schoolteachers had suddenly decidedto take a trip to europe the district attorney was ill and assigned the prosecution to a mild assistant while a sceptical jurycomposed largely of gentlemen who had the business interests of the community and of themselves at heart returned a verdict of not guilty this was the signal for severely dignified editorials in mr tallants and other conservative newspapers hinting that it might be well in the future for all wellmeaning but misguided reformers to think twice before subjecting the city to the cost of such trials and uselessly attempting to inflame public opinion and upset legitimate business the era expressed the opinion that no city in the united states was more efficiently and economically governed than our own irregularities might well occur in every large organization and it would better have become mr greenhalge if instead of hiring an unknown lawyer thirsting for notoriety to cook up charges he had called the attention of the proper officials to the matter etc etc the pilot alone which relied on sensation for its circulation kept hammering away for a time with veiled accusations but our citizens had become weary  as a topic however this effective suppression of reform was referred to with some delicacy by my friends and myself our interference had been necessary and therefore justified but we were not particularly proud of it and our triumph had a temporarily sobering effect it was about this time if i remember correctly that mr dickinson gave the beautiful stainedglass window to the church  months passed one day having occasion to go over to the boyne iron works to get information at first hand from certain officials and having finished my business i boarded a south side electric car standing at the terminal just before it started krebs came down the aisle of the car and took the seat in front of me  well i said how are you he turned in surprise and thrust his big bony hand across the back of the seat come and sit here he came do you ever get back to cambridge in these days i asked cordially  not since i graduated from newspaper work in boston thats a good many years ago by the way our old landlady died this year  do you mean granite face i was about to say i had forgotten her name but that homesick scene when tom and i stood before our open trunks when krebs had paid us a visit came back to me youve kept in touch with her i asked in surprise  well said krebs she was one of the few friends i had at cambridge i had a letter from the daughter last week shes done very well and is an instructor in biology in one of the western universities  i was silent a moment  and youyou never married did you i inquired somewhat irrelevantly  his semihumorous gesture seemed to deny that such a luxury was for him the conversation dragged a little i began to feel the curiosity he invariably inspired what was his life what were his beliefs and i was possessed by a certain militancy a desire to smoke him out i did not stop to reflect that mine was in reality a defensive rather than an aggressive attitude  do you live down here in this part of the city i asked  no he boarded in fowler street i knew it as in a district given over to the small houses of workingmen  i suppose you are still a socialist  i suppose i am he admitted and added at any rate that is as near as you can get to it  isnt it fairly definite  fairly if my notions are taken in general as the antithesis of what you fellows believe  the abolition of property for instance  the abolition of too much property  what do you mean by too much  when it ceases to be real to a man when it represents more than his need when it drives him and he becomes a slave to it  involuntarily i thought of my new housenot a soothing reflection  but who is going to decree how much property a man should have  nobodyeverybody that will gradually tend to work itself out as we become more sensible and better educated and understand more clearly what is good for us  i retorted with the stock commonsense phrase  if we had a division tomorrow within a few years or so the most efficient would contrive to get the bulk of it back in their hands  thats so he admitted but were not going to have a division tomorrow  thank god i exclaimed  he regarded me  the efficient will have to die or be educated first that will take time  educated  paret have you ever read any serious books on what you call socialism he asked  i threw out an impatient negative i was going on to protest that i was not ignorant of the doctrine  oh what you call socialism is merely what you believe to be the more or less crude and utopian propaganda of an obscure political party that isnt socialism nor is the anomalistic attempt that the christian socialists make to unite modern socialistic philosophy with christian orthodoxy socialism  what is socialism then i demanded somewhat defiantly  lets call it education science he said smilingly economics and government based on human needs and a rational view of religion it has been taught in german universities and it will be taught in ours whenever we shall succeed in inducing your friends by one means or another not to continue endowing them socialism in the proper sense is merely the application of modern science to government  i was puzzled and angry what he said made sense somehow but it sounded to me like so much gibberish  but germany is a monarchy i objected  it is a modern scientific system with monarchy as its superstructure it is anomalous but frank the monarchy is there for all men to see and some day it will be done away with we are supposedly a democracy and our superstructure is plutocratic our people feel the burden but they have not yet discovered what the burden is  and when they do i asked a little defiantly  when they do replied krebs they will set about making the plutocrats happy now plutocrats are discontented and never satisfied the more they get the more they want the more they are troubled by what other people have  i smiled in spite of myself  your interest inin plutocrats is charitable then  why yes he said my interest in all kinds of people is charitable however improbable it may seem i have no reason to dislike or envy people who have more than they know what to do with and the worst of it was he looked it he managed somehow simply by sitting there with his strange eyes fixed upon mein spite of his ridiculous philosophyto belittle my ambitions to make of small worth my achievements to bring home to me the fact that in spite of these i was neither contented nor happy though he kept his humour and his poise he implied an experience that was far deeper more tragic and more significant than mine i was goaded into making an injudicious remark  well your campaign against ennerly and jackson fell through didnt it ennerly and jackson were the city officials who had been tried  it wasnt a campaign against them he answered and considering the subordinate part i took in it it could scarcely be called mine  greenhalge turned to you to get the evidence  well i got it he said  what became of it  you ought to know  what do you mean  just what i say paret he answered slowly you ought to know if anyone knows  i considered this a moment more soberly i thought i might have counted on my fingers the number of men cognizant of my connection with the case i decided that he was guessing  i think you should explain that i told him  the time may come when youll have to explain it  is that a threat i demanded  a threat he repeated not at all  but you are accusing me  of what he interrupted suddenly  he had made it necessary for me to define the nature of his charges  of having had some connection with the affair in question  whatever else i may be im not a fool he said quietly neither the district attorneys office nor young arbuthnot had brains enough to get them out of that scrape jason didnt have influence enough with the judiciary and as i happen to know there was a good deal of money spent  you may be called upon to prove it i retorted rather hotly  so i may  his tone far from being defiant had in it a note of sadness i looked at him what were his potentialities was it not just possible that i should have to revise my idea of him acknowledge that he might become more formidable than i had thought  there was an awkward silence  you mustnt imagine paret that i have any personal animus against you or against any of the men with whom youre associated he went on after a moment im sorry youre on that side thats alli told you so once before im not calling you names im not talking about morality and immorality immorality when you come down to it is often just the opposition to progress that comes from blindness i dont make the mistake of blaming a few individuals for the evils of modern industrial society and on the other hand you mustnt blame individuals for the discomforts of what you call the reform movement for that movement is merely a symptoma symptom of a disease due to a change in the structure of society well never have any happiness or real prosperity until we cure that disease i was inclined to blame you once at the capital that time because it seemed to me that a man with all the advantages you have had and a mind like yours didnt have much excuse but ive thought about it since i realize now that ive had a good many more advantages than you and to tell you the truth i dont see how you could have come out anywhere else than where you areall your surroundings and training were against it that doesnt mean that you wont grasp the situation some dayi have an idea you will its just an idea the man who ought to be condemned isnt the man that doesnt understand whats going on but the man who comes to understand and persists in opposing it he rose and looked down at me with the queer disturbing smile i remembered i get off at this corner he added rather diffidently i hope youll forgive me for being personal i didnt mean to be but you rather forced it on me  oh thats all right i replied the car stopped and he hurried off i watched his tall figure as it disappeared among the crowd on the sidewalk  i returned to my office in one of those moods that are the more disagreeable because conflicting today in particular i had been aroused by what tom used to call krebss crust and as i sat at my desk warm waves of resentment went through me at the very notion of his telling me that my view was limited and that therefore my professional conduct was to be forgiven it was he the fanatic who saw things in the larger scale an assumption the more exasperating because at the moment he made it he almost convinced me that he did and i was unable to achieve for him the measure of contempt i desired for the incident the measure of ridicule it deserved my real animus was due to the fact that he had managed to shake my selfconfidence to take the flavour out of my achievementsa flavour that was in the course of an hour to be completely restored by one of those interesting coincidences occasionally occurring in life a young member of my staff entered with a telegram i tore it open and sat staring at it a moment before i realized that it brought to me the greatest honour of my career  the bankerpersonality in new york had summoned me for consultation to be recognized by him conferred indeed an ennoblement the star and garter so to speak of the only great realm in america that of high finance and the yellow piece of paper i held in my hand instantly remagnetized me renewed my energy and i hurried home to pack my bag in order to catch the seven oclock train i announced the news to maude  i imagine its because he knows i have made something of a study of the coal roads situation i added  im glad hugh she said i suppose its a great compliment  never had her inadequacy to appreciate my career been more apparent i looked at her curiously to realize once more with peculiar sharpness how far we were apart but now the resolutions i had madeand never carried outon that first christmas in the new home were lacking indeed it was the futility of such resolutions that struck me at this moment if her manner had been merely one of indifference it would in a way have been easier to bear she was simply incapable of grasping the significance of the event the meaning to me of the years of unceasing ambitious effort it crowned  yes it is something of a recognition i replied is there anything i can get for you in new york i dont know how long i shall have to stayill telegraph you when im getting back i kissed her and hurried out to the automobile as i drove off i saw her still standing in the doorway looking after me in the station i had a few minutes to telephone nancy  if you dont see me for a few days its because ive gone to new york i informed her  something important im sure  how did you guess i demanded and heard her laugh  come back soon and tell me about it she said and i walked exhilarated to the train as i sped through the night staring out of the window into the darkness i reflected on the man i was going to see but at that time although he represented to me the quintessence of achievement and power i did not by any means grasp the many sided significance of the phenomenon he presented though i was keenly aware of his influence and that men spoke of him with bated breath presidents came and went kings and emperors had responsibilities and were subject daily to annoyances but this man was a law unto himself he did exactly what he chose and compelled other men to do it wherever commerce reignedand where did it nothe was king and head of its holy empire pope and emperor at once for he had his code of ethics his religion and those who rebelled who failed to conform he excommunicated a code something like the map of europeapparently inconsistent in places what i did not then comprehend was that he was the american principle personified the supreme individual assertion of the conviction that government should remain modestly in the background while the efficient acquired the supremacy that was theirs by natural right nor had i grasped at that time the crowning achievement of a unity that fused christianity with those acquisitive dispositions said to be inherent in humanity in him the lion and the lamb the eagle and the dove dwelt together in amity and power  new york always a congenial place to gentlemen of vitality and means and influential connections had never appeared to me more sparkling more inspiring winter had relented spring had not as yet begun and as i sat in a corner of the diningroom of my hotel looking out on the sunlit avenue i was conscious of partaking of the vigour and confidence of the welldressed cleareyed people who walked or drove past my window with the air of a conquering race what else was there in the world more worth having than this conquering sense religion might offer charms to the weak yet here religion itself became sensible and wore the garb of prosperity the stonework of the tall church on the corner was all lace and the very saints in their niches who had known martyrdom and poverty seemed to have renounced these as foolish and to look down complacently on the procession of wealth and power across the street behind a sheet of glass was a carrosserie where were displayed the shining yellow and black panels of a closed automobile the cost of which would have built a farmhouse and stocked a barn  at eleven oclock the appointed hour i was in wall street sending in my name i was speedily ushered into a room containing a table around which were several men but my eyes were drawn at once to the figure of the great banker who sat massive and preponderant at one end smoking a cigar and listening in silence to the conversation i had interrupted he rose courteously and gave me his hand and a glance that is unforgettable  it is good of you to come mr paret he said simply as though his summons had not been a command perhaps you know some of these gentlemen  one of them was our united states senator theodore watling he as it turned out had been summoned from washington of course i saw him frequently having from time to time to go to washington on various errands connected with legislation though spruce and debonnair as ever in the black morning coat he invariably wore he appeared older than he had on the day when i had entered his office he greeted me warmly as always  hugh im glad to see you here he said with a slight emphasis on the last word my legal career was reaching its logical climax the climax he had foreseen and he added to the banker that he had brought me up  then he was trained in a good school remarked that personage affably  mr barbour the president of our railroad was present and nodded to me kindly also a president of a smaller road in addition there were two new york attorneys of great prominence whom i had met the bankers own special lieutenant of the law mr clement t grolier for whom i looked was absent but it was forthwith explained that he was offering that morning a resolution of some importance in the convention of his church but that he would be present after lunch  i have asked you to come here mr paret said the banker not only because i know something personally of your legal ability but because i have been told by mr scherer and mr barbour that you happen to have considerable knowledge of the situation we are discussing as well as some experience with cases involving that statute somewhat hazy to lay minds the sherman antitrust law  a smile went around the table mr watling winked at me i nodded but said nothing the banker was not a man to listen to superfluous words the keynote of his character was despatch  the subject of the conference like many questions bitterly debated and fought over in their time has in the year i write these words come to be of merely academic interest indeed the very situation we discussed that day has been cited in some of our modern textbooks as a classic consequence of that archaic school of economics to which the name of manchester is attached some half dozen or so of the railroads running through the anthracite coal region had pooled their interestsan extremely profitable proceeding the public paid we deemed it quite logical that the public should payhaving been created largely for that purpose and very naturally we resented the fact that the meddling person who had got into the white house without asking anybodys leavewho apparently did not believe in the infallibility of our legal bible the constitutionshould maintain that the anthracite roads had formed a combination in restraint of trade should lay down the preposterous doctrineso subversive of the rights of manthat railroads should not own coal mines congress had passed a law to meet this contention suit had been brought and in the lower court the government had won  as the day wore on our numbers increased we were joined by other lawyers of renown not the least of whom was mr grolier himself fresh from his triumph over religious heresy in his church convention the note of the conference became tinged with exasperation and certain gentlemen seized the opportunity to relieve their pentup feelings on the subject of the president and his slavish adviserssome of whom before they came under the spell of his sorcery had once been sound lawyers and sensible men with the exception of the great banker himself who made few comments theodore watling was accorded the most deference as one of the leaders of that indomitable group of senators who had dared to stand up against popular clamour his opinions were of great value and his tactical advice was listened to with respect i felt more pride than ever in my former chief who had lost none of his charm while in no way minimizing the seriousness of the situation his wisdom was tempered as always with humour he managed as it were to neutralize the acid injected into the atmosphere by other gentlemen present he alone seemed to bear no animus against the author of our troubles suave and calm good natured he sometimes brought the company into roars of laughter and even succeeded in bringing occasional smiles to the face of the man who had summoned uswhen relating some characteristic story of the queer genius whom the fates undoubtedly as a practical joke had made the chief magistrate of the united states of america all geniuses have weaknesses mr wading had made a study of the presidents and more than once had lured him into an impasse the case had been appealed to the supreme court and mr wading with remarkable conciseness and penetration reviewed the characteristics of each and every member of that tribunal all of whom he knew intimately they were of course not subject to advice as were some of the gentlemen who sat on our state courts no sane and selfrespecting american would presume to approach them nevertheless they were human and it were wise to take account in the conduct of the case of the probable bias of each individual  the president overstepping his constitutional newtonian limits might propose laws congress might acquiesce in them but the supreme court after listening to lawyers like grolier and he bowed to the attorney made them made them he might have added without responsibility to any man in our unique republic that scorned kings and apotheosized lawyers a martian with a sense of humour witnessing a stormy session of congress would have giggled at the thought of a few tranquil gentlemen in another room of the capitol waiting to decide what the peoples representatives meantor whether they meant anything  for the first time since i had known theodore watling however i saw him in the shadow of another individual a man who like a powerful magnet continually drew our glances when we spoke we almost invariably addressed him his rare words fell like bolts upon the consciousness there was no apparent rift in that personality  when about five oclock the conference was ended and we were dismissed united states senator railroad presidents fieldmarshals of the law the great banker fell into an eager conversation with grolier over the canon on divorce the subject of warm debate in the convention that day grolier it appeared had led his party against the theological liberals he believed that law was static but none knew better its plasticity that it was infallible but none so well as he could find a text on either side his reputation was not of the popular newspaper sort but was known to connoisseurs editors financiers statesmen and judgesto those in short whose business it is to make themselves familiar with the instruments of power he was the bankers chief legal adviser the bankers rapier of tempered steel sheathed from the vulgar view save when it flashed forth on a swift errand  im glad to be associated with you in this case mr paret mr grolier said modestly as we emerged into the maelstrom of wall street if you can make it convenient to call at my office in the morning well go over it a little and ill see you in a day or two in washington watling keep your eye on the bull he added with a twinkle and dont let him break any more china than you can help i dont know where wed be if it werent for you fellows  by you fellows he meant mr watlings distinguished associates in the senate  mr watling and i dined together at a new york club it was not a dinner of herbs there was something exceedingly comfortable about that club where the art of catering to those who had earned the right to be catered to came as near perfection as human things attain from the great heavily curtained diningroom the noises of the city had been carefully excluded the dust of the avenue the squalour and smells of the brown stone fronts and laddered tenements of those gloomy districts lying a pistolshot east and west we had a vintage champagne and afterwards a cigar of the clubs special importation  well said mr watling mow that youre a member of the royal council what do you think of the king  ive been thinking a great deal about him i said and indeed it was true he had made perhaps his greatest impression when i had shaken his hand in parting the manner in which he had looked at me then had puzzled me it was as though he were seeking to divine something in me that had escaped him why doesnt the government take him over i exclaimed  mr watling smiled  you mean instead of his mines and railroads and other properties  yes but thats your idea dont you remember you said something of the kind the night of the election years ago it occurred to me today when i was looking at him  yes he agreed thoughtfully if some american genius could find a way to legalize that power and utilize the men who created it the worst of our problems would be solved a man with his ability has a right to power and none would respond more quickly or more splendidly to a call of the government than he all this fight is waste hugh damned waste of the nations energy mr watling seldom swore look at the president theres a man of remarkable ability too and those two oughtnt to be fighting each other the presidents right in a way yes he is though ive got to oppose him  i smiled at this from theodore watling though i admired him the more for it and suddenly oddly i happened to remember what krebs had said that our troubles were not due to individuals but to a disease that had developed in industrial society if the day should come when such men as the president and the great banker would be working together was it not possible too that the idea of mr watling and the vision of krebs might coincide i was struck by a certain seeming similarity in their views but mr watling interrupted this train of thought by continuing to express his own  welltheyre running right into a gale when they might be sailing with it he said  you think well have more trouble i asked  more and more he replied itll be worse before its better im afraid at this moment a club servant announced his cab and he rose well goodbye my son he said ill hope to see you in washington soon and remember theres no one thinks any more of you than i do  i escorted him to the door and it was with a real pang i saw him wave to me from his cab as he drove away my affection for him was never more alive than in this hour when for the first time in my experience he had given real evidence of an inner anxiety and lack of confidence in the future     xxi  in spite of that unwonted note of pessimism from mr watling i went home in a day or two flushed with my new honours and it was impossible not to be conscious of the fact that my aura of prestige was increasedtremendously increasedby the recognition i had received a certain subtle deference in the attitude of the small minority who owed allegiance to the personage by whom i had been summoned was more satisfying than if i had been acclaimed at the station by thousands of my fellowcitizens who knew nothing of my journey and of its significance even though it might have a concern for them to men like berringer grierson and tallant and our lesser great lights the banker was a semimythical figure and many times on the day of my return i was stopped on the street to satisfy the curiosity of my friends as to my impressions had he for instance let fall any opinions prognostications on the political and financial situation dickinson and scherer were the only other men in the city who had the honour of a personal acquaintance with him and scherer was away abroad gathering furniture and pictures for the house in new york nancy had predicted and which he had already begun to build with dickinson i lunched in private in order to give him a detailed account of the conference by five oclock i was ringing the doorbell of nancys new mansion on grant avenue it was several blocks below my own  well how does it feel to be sent for by the great sultan she asked as i stood before her fire of course i have always known that ultimately he couldnt get along without you  even if he has been a little late in realizing it i retorted  sit down and tell me all about him she commanded  i met him once when ham had the yacht at bar harbor  and how did he strike you  as somewhat wrapped up in himself said nancy  we laughed together  oh i fell a victim she went on i might have sailed off with him if he had asked me  im surprised he didnt ask you  i suspect that it was not quite convenient she said women are secondary considerations to sultans were all very well when they havent anything more serious to occupy them of course thats why they fascinate us what did he want with you hugh  he was evidently afraid that the government would win the coal roads suit unless i was retained  more laurels she sighed i suppose i ought to be proud to know you  thats exactly what ive been trying to impress on you all these years i declared ive laid the laurels at your feet in vain  she sat with her head back on the cushions surveying me  your dress is very becoming i said irrelevantly  i hoped it would meet your approval she mocked  ive been trying to identify the shade its elusivelike you  dont be banal what is the colour  poinsetta  pretty nearly she agreed critically  i took the soft crepe between my fingers  poet she smiled no it isnt quite poinsetta its nearer the redorange of a tree i remember one autumn in the white mountains with the setting sun on it but that wasnt what we were talking about laurels your laurels  my laurels i repeated such as they are i fling them into your lap  do you think they increase your value to me hugh  i dont know i said thickly  she shook her head  no its you i likenot the laurels  but if you care for me i began  she lifted up her hands and folded them behind the knot of her hair  its extraordinary how little you have changed since we were children hugh you are still sixteen years old thats why i like you if you got to be the sultan of sultans yourself i shouldnt like you any better or any worse  and yet you have just declared that power appeals to you  poweryes but a womana woman like mewants to be first or nothing  you are first i asserted you always have been if you had only realized it  she gazed up at me dreamily  if you had only realized it if you had only realized that all i wanted of you was to be yourself it wasnt what you achieved i didnt want you to be like ralph or the others  myself what are you trying to say  yourself yes that is what i like about you if you hadnt been in such a hurryif you hadnt misjudged me so it was the power in you the craving the ideal in you that i cared fornot the fruits of it the fruits would have come naturally but you forced them hugh for quicker results  what kind of fruits i asked  ah she exclaimed how can i tell what they might have been you have striven and striven you have done extraordinary things but have they made you any happier have you got what you want  i stooped down and seized her wrists from behind her head  i want you nancy i said i have always wanted you youre more wonderful today than you have ever been i could find myselfwith you  she closed her eyes a dreamy smile was on her face and she lay unresisting very still in that tremendous moment for which it seemed i had waited a lifetime i could have taken her in my armsand yet i did not i could not tell why perhaps it was because she seemed to have passed beyond mefar beyondin realization and she was so still  we have missed the way hugh she whispered at last  but we can find it again if we seek it together i urged  ah if i only could she said i could have once but now im afraidafraid of getting lost slowly she straightened up her hands falling into her lap i seized them again i was on my knees in front of her before the fire and she intent looking down at me into me through me it seemedat something beyond which yet was me  hugh she asked what do you believe anything  what do i believe  yes i dont mean any cant cutanddried morality the world is getting beyond that but have you in your secret soul any religion at all do you ever think about it im not speaking about anything orthodox but some religioneven a tiny speck of it a germharmonizing with life with that power we feel in us we seek to express and continually violate  nancy i exclaimed  answer meanswer me truthfully she said  i was silent my thoughts whirling like dust atoms in a storm  you have always taken thingstaken what you wanted but they havent satisfied you convinced you that that is all of life  do you meanthat we should renounce i faltered  i dont know what i mean i am asking hugh asking havent you any clew isnt there any voice in you anywhere deep down that can tell me give me a hint just a little one  i was wracked my passion had not left me it seemed to be heightened and i pressed her hands against her knees it was incredible that my hands should be there in hers feeling her her beauty seemed as fresh as unwasted as the day long since when i despaired of her and yet and yet against the tumult and beating of this passion striving to throb down thought thought strove though i saw her as a woman my senses and my spirit commingled and swooned together  this is life i murmured scarcely knowing what i said  oh my dear she cried and her voice pierced me with pain are we to be lost overpowered engulfed swept down its stream to come up below driftingwreckage where then would be your power im not speaking of myself isnt life more than that isnt it in us tooin you think hugh is there no god anywhere but this force we feel restlessly creating only to destroy you must answeryou must find out  i cannot describe the pleading passion in her voice as though hell and heaven were wrestling in it the woman i saw tortured yet uplifted did not seem to be nancy yet it was the woman i loved more than life itself and always had loved  i cant think i answered desperately i can only feeland i cant express what i feel its mixed its dim and yet bright and shiningits you  no its you she said vehemently you must interpret it her voice sank could it be god she asked  god i exclaimed sharply  her hands fell away from mine the silence was broken only by the crackling of the wood fire as a log turned over and fell never before in all our intercourse that i could remember had she spoken to me about religion with that apparent snap in continuity incomprehensible to the masculine mindher feminine mood had changed elements i had never suspected in nancy awe even a hint of despair entered into it and when my hand found hers again the very quality of its convulsive pressure seemed to have changed i knew then that it was her soul i loved most i had been swept all unwittingly to its very altar  i believe it is god i said but she continued to gaze at me her lips parted her eyes questioning  why is it she demanded that after all these centuries of certainty we should have to start out to find him again why is it when something happens likelike this that we should suddenly be torn with doubts about him when we have lived the best part of our lives without so much as thinking of him  why should you have qualms i said isnt this enough and doesnt it promiseall  i dont know theyre not qualmsin the old sense she smiled down at me a little tearfully hugh do you remember when we used to go to sundayschool at dr pounds church and mrs ewan taught us i really believed something thenthat moses brought down the ten commandments of god from the mountain all written out definitely for ever and ever and i used to think of marriage i felt a sharp twinge of marriage as something sacred and inviolablesomething ordained by god himself it ought to be sooughtnt it that is the ideal  yesbut arent you confusing i began  i am confusing and confused i shouldnt bei shouldnt care if there werent something in you in me in ourfriendship something i cant explain something that shines still through the fog and the smoke in which we have lived our livessomething which i think we saw clearer as children we have lost it in our hasty groping oh hugh i couldnt bear to think that we should never find it that it doesnt really exist because i seem to feel it but can we find it this way my dear her hand tightened on mine  but if the force drawing us together that has always drawn us together is god i objected  i asked you she said the time must come when you must answer hugh it may be too late but you must answer  i believe in taking life in my own hands i said  it ought to be life said nancy itit might have been life it is only when a moment a moment like this comes that the quality of what we have lived seems so tarnished that the atmosphere which we ourselves have helped to make is so sordid when i think of the intrigues and divorces the selfindulgenceswhen i think of my own marriage her voice caught how are we going to better it hugh this way am i to get that part of you i love and are you to get what you crave in me can we just seize happiness will it not elude us just as much as though we believed firmly in the ten commandments  no i declared obstinately  she shook her head  what im afraid of is that the world isnt made that wayfor youfor me were permitted to seize those other things because theyre just baubles weve both found out how worthless they are and the worst of it is theyve made me a coward hugh it isnt that i couldnt do without them ive come to depend on them in another way its because they give me a certain protectiondo you see theyve come to stand in the place of the real convictions weve lost andwell weve taken the baubles can we reach out our hands and takethis wont we be punished for it frightfully punished  i dont care if we are i said and surprised myself  but i care its weak its cowardly but its so and yet i want to face the situationim trying to get you to face it to realize how terrible it is  i only know that i want you above everything else in the worldill take care of you  i seized her arms i drew her down to me  dont she cried oh dont and struggled to her feet and stood before me panting you must go away nowplease hugh i cant bear any morei want to think  i released her she sank into the chair and hid her face in her hands  as may be imagined the incident i have just related threw my life into a tangle that would have floored a less persistent optimist and romanticist than myself yet i became fairly accustomed to treading what the old moralists called the devious paths of sin in my passion i had not hesitated to lay down the doctrine that the courageous and the strong took what they wanteda doctrine of which i had been a consistent disciple in the professional and business realm a logical buccaneer superman master of life would promptly have extended this doctrine to the realm of sex nancy was the mate for me and nancy and i our development was all that mattered especially my development let every man and woman look out for his or her development and in the end the majority of people would be happy this was going adam smith one better when it came to putting that theory into practice however one needed convictions nancy had been right when she had implied that convictions were precisely what we lacked what our world in general lacked we had desires yes convictions no what we wanted we got not by defying the world but by conforming to it we were ready to defy only when our desires overcame the resistance of our synapses and even then not until we should have exhausted every legal and conventional means  a superman with a wife and family he had acquired before a great passion has made him a superman is in rather a predicament especially if he be one who has achieved such superhumanity as he possesses not by challenging laws and conventions but by getting around them my wife and family loved me and paradoxically i still had affection for them or thought i had but the superman creed is be yourself realize yourself no matter how cruel you may have to be in order to do so one trouble with me was that remnants of the christian element of pity still clung to me i would be cruel if i had to but i hoped i shouldnt have to something would turn up something in the nature of an intervening miracle that would make it easy for me perhaps maude would take the initiative and relieve me nancy had appealed for a justifying doctrine and it was just what i didnt have and couldnt evolve in the meanwhile it was quite in character that i should accommodate myself to a situation that might well be called anomalous  this accommodation was not unaccompanied by fever my longing to realize my love for nancy kept me in a constant state of tensionof nerves for our relationship had merely gone one step farther we had reached a point where we acknowledged that we loved each other and paradoxically halted there nancy clung to her demand for new sanctions with a tenacity that amazed and puzzled and often irritated me and yet when i look back upon it all i can see that some of the difficulty lay with me if she had her weaknesswhich she acknowledgedi had mineand kept it to myself it was part of my romantic nature not to want to break her down perhaps i loved the ideal better than the woman herself though that scarcely seems possible  we saw each other constantly and though we had instinctively begun to be careful i imagine there was some talk among our acquaintances it is to be noted that the gossip never became riotous for we had always been friends and nancy had a saving reputation for coldness it seemed incredible that maude had not discovered my secret but if she knew of it she gave no sign of her knowledge often as i looked at her i wished she would i can think of no more expressive sentence in regard to her than the trite one that she pursued the even tenor of her way and i found the very perfection of her wifehood exasperating our relationship would i thought have been more endurable if we had quarrelled and yet we had grown as far apart in that big house as though we had been separated by a continent i lived in my apartments she in hers she consulted me about dinner parties and invitations for since we had moved to grant avenue we entertained and went out more than before it seemed as though she were making every effort consistent with her integrity and selfrespect to please me outwardly she conformed to the mould but i had long been aware that inwardly a person had developed it had not been a spontaneous development but one in resistance to pressure and was probably all the stronger for that reason at times her will revealed itself in astonishing and unexpected flashes as when once she announced that she was going to change matthews school  hes old enough to go to boardingschool i said ill look up a place for him  i dont wish him to go to boardingschool yet hugh she said quietly  but thats just what he needs i objected he ought to have the rubbingup against other boys that boardingschool will give him matthew is timid he should have learned to take care of himself and he will make friendships that will help him in a larger school  i dont intend to send him maude said  but if i think it wise  you ought to have begun to consider such things many years ago you have always been toobusy to think of the children you have left them to me i am doing the best i can with them  but a man should have something to say about boys he understands them  you should have thought of that before  they havent been old enough  if you had taken your share of responsibility for them i would listen to you  maude i exclaimed reproachfully  no hugh she went on you have been too busy making money you have left them to me it is my task to see that the money they are to inherit doesnt ruin them  you talk as though it were a great fortune i said  but i did not press the matter i had a presentiment that to press it might lead to unpleasant results  it was this sense of not being free of having gained everything but freedom that was at times galling in the extreme this sense of living with a woman for whom i had long ceased to care a woman with a baffling will concealed beneath an unruffled and serene exterior at moments i looked at her across the table she did not seem to have aged much her complexion was as fresh apparently as the day when i had first walked with her in the garden at elkington her hair the same wonderful colour perhaps she had grown a little stouter there could be no doubt about the fact that her chin was firmer that certain lines had come into her face indicative of what is called character beneath her pliability she was now all firmness the pliability had become a mockery it cannot be said that i went so far as to hate her for thiswhen it was in my mindbut my feelings were of a strong antipathy and then again there were rare moments when i was inexplicably drawn to her not by love and passion i melted a little in pity perhaps when my eyes were opened and i saw the tragedy yet i am not referring now to such feelings as these i am speaking of the times when i beheld her as the blameless companion of the years the mother of my children the woman i was used to and shouldby all canons i had knownhave loved  and there were the children days and weeks passed when i scarcely saw them and then some little incident would happen to give me an unexpected wrench and plunge me into unhappiness one evening i came home from a long talk with nancy that had left us both wrought up and i had entered the library before i heard voices maude was seated under the lamp at the end of the big room reading from don quixote matthew and biddy were at her feet and moreton less attentive at a little distance was taking apart a mechanical toy i would have tiptoed out but biddy caught sight of me  its father she cried getting up and flying to me  oh father do come and listen the storys so exciting isnt it matthew  i looked down into the boys eyes shining with an expression that suddenly pierced my heart with a poignant memory of myself matthew was far away among the mountains and castles of spain  matthew demanded his sister why did he want to go fighting with all those people  because he was dotty supplied moreton who had an interesting habit of picking up slang  it wasnt at all cried matthew indignantly interrupting maudes rebuke of his brother  what was it then moreton demanded  you wouldnt understand if i told you matthew was retorting when maude put her hand on his lips  i think thats enough for tonight she said as she closed the book there are lessons to doand father wants to read his newspaper in quiet  this brought a protest from biddy  just a little more mother cant we go into the schoolroom we shant disturb father there  ill read to thema few minutes i said  as i took the volume from her and sat down maude shot at me a swift look of surprise even matthew glanced at me curiously and in his glance i had as it were a sudden revelation of the boys perplexity concerning me he was twelve rather tall for his age and the delicate modelling of his face resembled my fathers he had begun to think what did he think of me  biddy clapped her hands and began to dance across the carpet  fathers going to read to us fathers going to read to us she cried finally clambering up on my knee and snuggling against me  where is the place i asked  but maude had left the room she had gone swiftly and silently  ill find it said moreton  i began to read but i scarcely knew what i was reading my fingers tightening over biddys little knee  presently miss allsop the governess came in she had been sent by maude there was wistfulness in biddys voice as i kissed her good night  father if you would only read oftener she said i like it when you readbetter than anyone else  maude and i were alone that night as we sat in the library after our somewhat formal perfunctory dinner i ventured to ask her why she had gone away when i had offered to read  i couldnt bear it hugh she answered  why i asked intending to justify myself  she got up abruptly and left me i did not follow her in my heart i understood why  some years had passed since ralphs prophecy had come true and perry and the remaining blackwoods had been relieved of the boyne street line the process need not be gone into in detail being the timehonoured one employed in the ribblevale affair of running down the line or perhaps it would be better to say showing it up it had not justified its survival in our efficient days it had held outthanks to perrywith absurd and anachronous persistence against the inevitable consolidation mr tallants newspaper had published many complaints of the age and scarcity of the cars etc and alarmed holders of securities in whose vaults they had lain since time immemorial began to sell i saw little of perry in those days as i have explained but one day i met him in the hambleton building and he was white  your friends are doing thus hugh he said  doing what  undermining the reputation of a company as sound as any in this city a company thats not overcapitalized either and were giving better service right now than any of your consolidated lines  he was in no frame of mind to argue with the conversation was distinctly unpleasant i dont remember what i said something to the effect that he was excited that his language was extravagant but after he had walked off and left me i told dickinson that he ought to be given a chance and one of our younger financiers murphree went to perry and pointed out that he had nothing to gain by obstruction if he were only reasonable he might come into the new corporation on the same terms with the others  all that murphree got for his pains was to be ordered out of the office by perry who declared that he was being bribed to desert the other stockholders  he utterly failed to see the point of view murphree reported in some astonishment to dickinson  what else did he say mr dickinson asked  murphree hesitated  wellwhat the banker insisted  he wasnt quite himself said murphree who was a comparative newcomer in the city and had a respect for the blackwood name he said that that was the custom of thieves when they were discovered they offered to divide he swore that he would get justice in the courts  mr dickinson smiled  thus perry through his obstinacy and inability to adapt himself to new conditions had gradually lost both caste and money he resigned from the boyne club i was rather sorry for him tom naturally took the matter to heart but he never spoke of it i found that i was seeing less of him though we continued to dine there at intervals and he still came to my house to see the children maude continued to see lucia for me the situation would have been more awkward had i been less occupied had my relationship with maude been a closer one neither did she mention perry in those days the income that remained to him being sufficient for him and his family to live on comfortably he began to devote most of his time to various societies of a semipublic nature untilin the spring of which i write his activities suddenly became concentrated in the organization of a citizens union whose avowed object was to make a campaign against graft and political corruption the following autumn this announcement and the call for a massmeeting in kingdon hall was received by the newspapers with a goodnatured ridicule and in influential quarters it was generally hinted that this was mr blackwoods method of getting square for having been deprived of the boyne street line it was quite characteristic of ralph hambleton that he should go out of curiosity to the gathering at kingdon hall and drop into my office the next morning  well hughie theyre after you he said with a grin  after me why not include yourself  he sat down and stretched his long legs and his long arms and smiled as he gaped  oh theyll never get me he said and i knew as i gazed at him that they never would  what sort of things did they say i asked  havent you read the pilot and the mail and state  i just glanced over them did they call names  call names i should say they did they got drunk on it worked themselves up like dervishes they didnt cuss you personallythatll come later of course judd jason got the heaviest shot but they said he couldnt exist a minute if it wasnt for the respectable crowdcapitalists financiers millionaires and their legal tools fact is they spoke a good deal of truth first and last in a fool kind of way  truth i exclaimed irritatedly  ralph laughed he was evidently enjoying himself  is any of it news to you hughie old boy  its an outrage  i think its funny said ralph we havent had such a circus for years never had of course i shouldnt like to see you go behind the barsnot that but you fellows cant expect to go on forever skimming off the cream without having somebody squeal sometime you ought to be reasonable  youve skimmed as much cream as anybody else  youve skimmed the cream hughieyou and dickinson and scherer and grierson and the restive only filled my jug well these fellows are going to have a regular roofraising campaign take the lid off of everything dump out the redlight district some of our friends are so fond of  dump it where i asked curiously  oh answered ralph they didnt say out into the country anywhere  but thats damned foolishness i declared  didnt say it wasnt ralph admitted they talked a lot of that too incidentally theyre going to close the saloons and dance halls and make this city sadder than heaven when they get through itll all be over but the inquest  what did perry do i asked  well he opened the meetingmade a nice precise gentlemanly speech greenhalge and a few young highbrows and a reformed crook named harrod did most of the hairraising theyre going to nominate greenhalge for mayor and he told em something about that little matter of the school board and said he would talk more later on if one of the ablest lawyers in the city hadnt been hired by the respectable crowd and a lot of other queer work done the treasurer and purchasing agent would be doing time they seemed to be interested all right  i turned over some papers on my desk just to show ralph that he hadnt succeeded in disturbing me  who was in the audience anyone you ever heard of i asked  sure thing your cousin robert breck and that soninlaw of hiswhats his name and some other representatives of our oldest familiesalec pound hes a reformer now you know they put him on the resolutions committee sam ogilvy was there hed be classed as respectably conservative and one of the ewanses i could name a few others if you pressed me that brother of fowndes who looks like an upstate minister a lot of womenmiller gorses sister mrs datchet who never approved of miller quite a genteel gathering i give you my word and all astonished and mad as hell when the speaking was over mrs datchet said she had been living in a den of iniquity and vice and didnt know it  it must have been amusing i said  it was said ralph itll be more amusing later on oh yes there was another fellow who spoke i forgot to mentionthat queer dick who was in your class krebs got the school board evidence looked as if hed come in by freight he wasnt as popular as the rest but hes got more sense than all of them put together  why wasnt he popular  well he didnt crack up the american peoplesaid they deserved all they got that theyd have to learn to think straight and be straight before they could expect a square deal the truth was they secretly envied these rich men who were exploiting their city and just as long as they envied them they hadnt any right to complain of them he was going into this campaign to tell the truth but to tell all sides of it and if they wanted reform theyd have to reform themselves first i admired his nerve i must say  he always had that i remarked how did they take it  well they didnt like it much but i think most of them had a respect for him i know i did he has a whole lot of assurance an air of knowing what hes talking about and apparently he doesnt give a continental whether hes popular or not besides greenhalge had cracked him up to the skies for the work hed done for the school board  you talk as if hed converted you i said  ralph laughed as he rose and stretched himself  oh im only the intelligent spectator you ought to know that by this time hughie but i thought it might interest you since youll have to go on the stump and refute it all thatll be a nice job so long  and he departed of course i knew that he had been baiting me his scent for the weaknesses of his friends being absolutely fiendish i was angry because he had succeededbecause he knew he had succeeded all the morning uneasiness possessed me and i found it difficult to concentrate on the affairs i had in hand i felt premonitions which i tried in vain to suppress that the tide of the philosophy of power and might were starting to ebb i scented vague calamities ahead calamities i associated with krebs and when i went out to the club for lunch this sense of uneasiness instead of being dissipated was increased dickinson was there and scherer who had just got back from europe the talk fell on the citizens union which scherer belittled with an air of consequence and pompousness that struck me disagreeably and with an eye newly critical i detected in him a certain disintegration deterioration having dismissed the reformers he began to tell of his experiences abroad referring in one way or another to the people of consequence who had entertained him  hugh said leonard dickinson to me as we walked to the bank together scherer will never be any good any more too much prosperity and hes begun to have his nails manicured  after i had left the bank president an uncanny fancy struck me that in adolf scherer i had before me a concrete example of the effect of my philosophy on the individual  nothing seemed to go right that spring and yet nothing was absolutely wrong at times i became irritated bewildered out of tune and unable to understand why the weather itself was uneasy tepid with long spells of hot wind and dust i no longer seemed to find refuge in my work i was unhappy at home after walking for many years in confidence and security along what appeared to be a certain path i had suddenly come out into a vague country in which it was becoming more and more difficult to recognize landmarks i did not like to confess this and yet i heard within me occasional whispers could it be that i hugh paret who had always been so positive had made a mess of my life there were moments when the pattern of it appeared to have fallen apart resolved itself into pieces that refused to fit into each other  of course my relationship with nancy had something to do with this  one evening late in the spring after dinner maude came into the library  are you busy hugh she asked  i put down my newspapers  because she went on as she took a chair near the table where i was writing i wanted to tell you that i have decided to go to europe and take the children  to europe i exclaimed the significance of the announcement failed at once to register in my brain but i was aware of a shock  yes  when i asked  right away the end of this month  for the summer  i havent decided how long i shall stay  i stared at her in bewilderment in contrast to the agitation i felt rising within me she was extraordinarily calm unbelievably so  but where do you intend to go in europe  i shall go to london for a month or so and after that to some quiet place in france probably at the sea where the children can learn french and german after that i have no plans  butyou talk as if you might stay indefinitely  i havent decided she repeated  but whywhy are you doing this  i would have recalled the words as soon as i had spoken them there was the slightest unsteadiness in her voice as she repliedis it necessary to go into that hugh wouldnt it be useless as well as a little painful surely going to europe without ones husband is not an unusual thing in these days let it just be understood that i want to go that the children have arrived at an age when it will do them good  i got up and began to walk up and down the room while she watched me with a silent calm which was incomprehensible in vain i summoned my faculties to meet it  i had not thought her capable of such initiative  i cant see why you want to leave me i said at last though with a full sense of the inadequacy of the remark and a suspicion of its hypocrisy  that isnt quite true she answered in the first place you dont need me i am not of the slightest use in your life i havent been a factor in it for years you ought never to have married meit was all a terrible mistake i began to realize that after we had been married a few monthseven when we were on our wedding trip but i was too inexperiencedperhaps too weak to acknowledge it to myself in the last few years i have come to see it plainly i should have been a fool if i hadnt i am not your wife in any real sense of the word i cannot hold you i cannot even interest you its a situation that no woman with selfrespect can endure  arent those rather modern sentiments for you maude i said  she flushed a little but otherwise retained her remarkable composure  i dont care whether they are modern or not i only know that my position has become impossible  i walked to the other end of the room and stood facing the carefully drawn curtains of the windows fantastically they seemed to represent the impasse to which my mind had come did she intend ultimately to get a divorce i dared not ask her the word rang horribly in my ears though unpronounced and i knew then that i lacked her courage and the knowledge was part of my agony  i turned  dont you think youve overdrawn things maude exaggerated them no marriages are perfect youve let your mind dwell until it has become inflamed on matters which really dont amount to much  i was never saner hugh she replied instantly and indeed i was forced to confess that she looked it that new maude i had seen emerging of late years seemed now to have found herself she was no longer the woman i had marriedyielding willing to overlook anxious to please living in me  i dont influence you or help you in any way i never have  oh thats not true i protested  but she cut me short going on inexorablyi am merely your housekeeper and rather a poor one at that from your point of view you ignore me i am not blaming you for ityou are made that way its true that you have always supported me in luxurythat might have been enough for another woman it isnt enough for mei too have a life to live a soul to be responsible for its not for my sake so much as for the childrens that i dont want it to be crushed  crushed i repeated  yes you are stifling it i say again that im not blaming you hugh you are made differently from me all you care for really is your career you may think that you care at times forother things but it isnt so  i took involuntarily a deep breath would she mention nancy was it in reality nancy who had brought about this crisis and did maude suspect the closeness of that relationship  suddenly i found myself begging her not to go the more astonishing since if at any time during the past winter this solution had presented itself to me as a possibility i should eagerly have welcomed it but should i ever have had the courage to propose a separation i even wished to delude myself now into believing that what she suggested was in reality not a separation i preferred to think of it as a trip a vision of freedom thrilled me and yet i was wracked and torn i had an idea that she was suffering that the ordeal was a terrible one for her and at that moment there crowded into my mind melting me incident after incident of our past  it seems to me that we have got along pretty well together maude i have been negligentill admit it but ill try to do better in the future andif youll wait a month or so ill go to europe with you and well have a good time  she looked at me sadlypityingly i thought  no hugh ive thought it all out you really dont want me you only say this because you are sorry for me because you dislike to have your feelings wrung you neednt be sorry for me i shall be much happier away from you  think it over maude i pleaded i shall miss you and the children i havent paid much attention to them either but i am fond of them and depend upon them too  she shook her head  its no use hugh i tell you ive thought it all out you dont care for the children you were never meant to have any  arent you rather severe in your judgments  i dont think so she answered im willing to admit my faults that i am a failure so far as you are concerned your ideas of life and mine are far apart  i suppose i exclaimed bitterly that you are referring to my professional practices  a note of weariness crept into her voice i might have known that she was near the end of her strength  no i dont think its that she said dispassionately i prefer to put it down that part of it to a fundamental difference of ideas i do not feel qualified to sit in judgment on that part of your life although ill admit that many of the things you have done in common with the men with whom you are associated have seemed to me unjust and inconsiderate of the rights and feelings of others you have alienated some of your best friends if i were to arraign you at all it would be on the score of heartlessness but i suppose it isnt your fault that you havent any heart  thats unfair i put in  i dont wish to be unfair she replied only since you ask me i have to tell you that that is the way it seems to me i dont want to introduce the question of right and wrong into this hugh im not capable of unravelling it i cant put myself into your life and see things from your point of view weigh your problems and difficulties in the first place you wont let me i think i understand you partlybut only partly you have kept yourself shut up but why discuss it i have made up my mind  the legal aspect of the matter occurred to me what right had she to leave me i might refuse to support her yet even as these thoughts came i rejected them i knew that it was not in me to press this point and she could always take refuge with her father without the children of course but the very notion sickened me i could not bear to think of maude deprived of the children i had seated myself again at the table i put my hand to my forehead  dont make it hard hugh i heard her say gently believe me it is best i know there wont be any talk about itright away at any rate people will think it natural that i should wish to go abroad for the summer and laterwell the point of view about such affairs has changed they are better understood  she had risen she was pale still outwardly composedbut i had a strange hideous feeling that she was weeping inwardly  arent you coming backever i cried  she did not answer at once  i dont know she said i dont know and left the room abruptly  i wanted to follow her but something withheld me i got up and walked around the room in a state of mind that was near to agony taking one of the neglected books out of the shelves glancing at its meaningless print and replacing it i stirred the fire opened the curtains and gazed out into the street and closed them again i looked around me a sudden intensity of hatred seized me for this big silent luxurious house i recalled maudes presentiment about it then thinking i might still dissuade her i went slowly up the padded stairwayto find her door locked and a sense of the finality of her decision came over me i knew then that i could not alter it even were i to go all the lengths of abjectness nor could i i knew have brought myself to have feigned a love i did not feel  what was it i felt i could not define it amazement for one thing that maude with her traditional christian view of marriage should have come to such a decision i went to my room undressed mechanically and got into bed  she gave no sign at the breakfast table of having made the decision of the greatest moment in our lives she conversed as usual asked about the news reproved the children for being noisy and when the children had left the table there were no tears reminiscences recriminations in spite of the slight antagonism and envy of which i was consciousthat she was thus superbly in command of the situation that she had developed her pinions and was thus splendidly able to use themmy admiration for her had never been greater i made an effort to achieve the frame of mind she suggested since she took it so calmly why should i be tortured by the tragedy of it perhaps she had ceased to love me after all perhaps she felt nothing but relief at any rate i was grateful to her and i found a certain consolation a sop to my pride in the reflection that the initiative must have been hers to take i could not have deserted her  when do you think of leaving i asked  two weeks from saturday on the olympic if that is convenient for you her manner seemed one of friendly solicitude you will remain in the house this summer as usual i suppose  yes i said  it was a sunny warm morning and i went downtown in the motor almost blithely it was the best solution after all and i had been a fool to oppose it at the office there was much business awaiting me yet once in a while during the day when the tension relaxed the recollection of what had happened flowed back into my consciousness maude was going  i had telephoned nancy making an appointment for the afternoon sometimesnot too frequentlywe were in the habit of going out into the country in one of her motors a sort of landaulet i believe in which we were separated from the chauffeur by a glass screen she was waiting for me when i arrived at four and as soon as we had shot clear of the city maude is going away i told her  going away she repeated struck more by the tone of my voice than by what i had said  she announced last night that she was going abroad indefinitely  i had been more than anxious to see how nancy would take the news a flush gradually deepened in her cheeks  you mean that she is going to leave you  it looks that way in fact she as much as said so  why said nancy  well she explained it pretty thoroughly apparently it isnt a sudden decision i replied trying to choose my words to speak composedly as i repeated the gist of our conversation nancy with her face averted listened in silencea silence that continued some time after i had ceased to speak  she didntshe didnt mention the sentence remained unfinished  no i said quickly she didnt she must know of course but im sure that didnt enter into it  nancys eyes as they returned to me were wet and in them was an expression i had never seen beforeof pain reproach of questioning it frightened me  oh hugh how little you know she cried  what do you mean i demanded  that is what has brought her to this decisionyou and i  you mean thatthat maude loves me that she is jealous i dont know how i managed to say it  no woman likes to think that she is a failure murmured nancy  well but she isnt really i insisted she could have made another man happya better man it was all one of those terrible mistakes our modern life seems to emphasize so  she is a woman nancy said with what seemed a touch of vehemence its useless to expect you to understand do you remember what i said to you about her how i appealed to you when you married to try to appreciate her  it wasnt that i didnt appreciate her i interrupted surprised that nancy should have recalled this she isnt the woman for me we arent made for each other it was my mistake my fault i admit but i dont agree with you at all that we had anything to do with her decision it is just thethe culmination of a long period of incompatibility she has come to realize that she has only one life to live and she seems happier more composed more herself than she has ever been since our marriage of course i dont mean to say it isnt painful for her but i am sure she isnt well that it isnt because of our seeing one another i concluded haltingly  she is finer than either of us hughfar finer  i did not relish this statement  shes fine i admit but i cant see how under the circumstances any of us could have acted differently and nancy not replying i continued she has made up her mind to goi suppose i could prevent it by taking extreme measuresbut what good would it do isnt it after all the most sensible the only way out of a situation that has become impossible times have changed nancy and you yourself have been the first to admit it marriage is no longer what it was and people are coming to look upon it more sensibly in order to perpetuate the institution as it was segregation insulation was the only course men segregated their wives women their husbandsthe only logical method of procedure but it limited the individual our mothers and fathers thought it scandalous if husband or wife paid visits alone it wasnt done but our modern life has changed all that a marriage to be a marriage should be proof against disturbing influences should leave the individuals free the binding element should be love not the force of an imposed authority you seemed to agree to all this  yes i know she admitted but i cannot think that happiness will ever grow out of unhappiness  but maude will not be unhappy i insisted she will be happier far happier now that she has taken the step  oh i wish i thought so nancy exclaimed hugh you always believe what you want to believe and the children how can you bear to part with them  i was torn i had a miserable sense of inadequacy  i shall miss them i said i have never really appreciated them i admit i dont deserve to have them and i am willing to give them up for you for maude  we had made one of our favourite drives among the hills on the far side of the ashuela and at six were back at nancys house i did not go in but walked slowly homeward up grant avenue it had been a trying afternoon i had not expected indeed that nancy would have rejoiced but her attitude her silences betraying as they did compunctions seemed to threaten our future happiness     xxii  one evening two or three days later i returned from the office to gaze up at my house to realize suddenly that it would be impossible for me to live there in those great empty rooms alone and i told maude that i would go to the clubduring her absence i preferred to keep up the fiction that her trip would only be temporary she forbore from contradicting me devoting herself efficiently to the task of closing the house making it seem somehow a ritethe final rite in her capacity as housewife the drawingroom was shrouded and the library the books wrapped neatly in paper a smell of camphor pervaded the place the cheerful schoolroom was dismantled trunks and travelling bags appeared the solemn butler packed my clothes and i arranged for a room at the club in the wing that recently had been added for the accommodation of bachelors and deserted husbands one of the ironies of those days was that the children began to suggest again possibilities of happiness i had missedespecially matthew with all his gentleness the boy seemed to have a precocious understanding of the verities and the capacity for suffering which as a child i had possessed but he had more selfcontrol though he looked forward to the prospect of new scenes and experiences with the anticipation natural to his temperament i thought he betrayed at moments a certain intuition as to what was going on  when are you coming over father he asked once how soon will your business let you  he had been brought up in the belief that my business was a tyrant  oh soon matthewsometime soon i said  i had a feeling that he understood me not intellectually but emotionally what a companion he might have been moreton and biddy moved me less they were more robust more normal less introspective and imaginative europe meant nothing to them but they were frankly delighted and excited at the prospect of going on the ocean asking dozens of questions about the great ship impatient to embark  i shant need all that hugh maude said when i handed her a letter of credit ii intend to live quite simply and my chief expenses will be the childrens education i am going to give them the best of course  of course i replied but i want you to live over there as you have been accustomed to live here its not exactly generosity on my parti have enough and more than enough  she took the letter  another thingid rather you didnt go to new york with us hugh i know you are busy  of course im going i started to protest  no she went on firmly id rather you didnt the hotel people will put me on the steamer very comfortablyand there are other reasons why i do not wish it i did not insist on the afternoon of her departure when i came uptown i found her pinning some roses on her jacket  perry and lucia sent them she informed me she maintained the friendly impersonal manner to the very end but my soul as we drove to the train was full of unprobed wounds i had had roses put in her compartments in the car tom and susan peters were there with more roses and little presents for the children their cheerfulness seemed forced and i wondered whether they suspected that maudes absence would be prolonged  write us often and tell us all about it dear said susan as she sat beside maude and held her hand tom had biddy on his knee maude was pale but smiling and composed  i hope to get a little villa in france near the sea she said ill send you a photograph of it susan  and chickabiddy when she comes back will be rattling off french like a native exclaimed tom giving her a hug  i hate french said biddy and she looked at him solemnly i wish you were coming along uncle tom  bells resounded through the great station the porter warned us off i kissed the children one by one scarcely realizing what i was doing i kissed maude she received my embrace passively  goodbye hugh she said  i alighted and stood on the platform as the train pulled out the children crowded to the windows but maude did not appear i found myself walking with tom and susan past hurrying travellers and porters to the decatur street entrance where my automobile stood waiting  ill take you home susan i said  were ever so much obliged hugh she answered but the streetcars go almost to ferrys door were dining there  her eyes were filled with tears and she seemed taller more ungainly than everolder a sudden impression of her greatness of heart was borne home to me and i grasped the value of such rugged friendship as hersas toms  we shouldnt know how to behave in an automobile he said as though to soften her refusal and i stood watching their receding figures as they walked out into the street and hailed the huge electric car that came to a stop beyond them above its windows was painted the ashuela traction company a label reminiscent of my professional activities then i heard the chauffeur askwhere do you wish to go sir  to the club i said  my room was ready my personal belongings my clothes had been laid out my photographs were on the dressingtable i took up mechanically the evening newspaper but i could not read it i thought of maude of the children memories flowed in upon mea flood not to be dammed presently the club valet knocked at my door he had a dinner card  will you be dining here sir he inquired  i went downstairs fred grierson was the only man in the diningroom  hello hugh he said come and sit down i hear your wifes gone abroad  yes i answered she thought shed try it instead of the south shore this summer  perhaps i imagined that he looked at me queerly i had made a great deal of money out of my association with grierson i had valued very highly being an important member of the group to which he belonged but tonight as i watched him eating and drinking greedily i hated him even as i hated myself and after dinner when he started talking with a ridicule that was a thinly disguised bitterness about the citizens union and their preparations for a campaign i left him and went to bed  before a week had passed my painful emotions had largely subsided and with my accustomed resiliency i had regained the feeling of selfrespect so essential to my happiness i was free my only anxiety was for nancy who had gone to new york the day after my last talk with her and it was only by telephoning to her house that i discovered when she was expected to return i found her sitting beside one of the open french windows of her salon gazing across at the wooded hills beyond the ashuela she was serious a little pale more exquisite more desirable than ever but her manner implied the pressure of control and her voice was not quite steady as she greeted me  youve been away a long time i said  the dressmakers she answered her colour rose a little i thought theyd never get through  but why didnt you drop me a line let me know when you were coming i asked taking a chair beside her and laying my hand on hers she drew it gently away  whats the matter i asked  ive been thinking it all overwhat were doing it doesnt seem right it seems terribly wrong  but i thought wed gone over all that i replied as patiently as i could youre putting it on an oldfashioned moral basis  but there must be same basis she urged there are responsibilities obligationsthere must bethat we cant get away from i cant help feeling that we ought to stand by our mistakes and by our bargains we made a choiceits cheating somehow and if we take thiswhat we wantwe shall be punished for it  but im willing to be punished to suffer as i told you if you loved me  hugh she exclaimed and i was silent you dont understand she went on a little breathlessly what i mean by punishment is deterioration do you remember once long ago when you came to me before i was married i said wed both run after false gods and that we couldnt do without them well and now this has come it seems so wonderful to me coming again like that after we had passed it by after we thought it had gone forever its opened up visions for me that i never hoped to see again it ought to restore us dearthats what im trying to sayto redeem us to make us capable of being what we were meant to be if it doesnt do that if it isnt doing so its the most horrible of travesties of mockeries if we gain life only to have it turn into deathslow death if we go to pieces again utterly for now theres hope the more i think the more clearly i see that we cant take any step without responsibilities if we take this youll have me and ill have you and if we dont save each other  but we will i said  ah she exclaimed if we could start new without any past i married ham with my eyes open  you couldnt know that he would becomewell as flagrant as he is you didnt really know what he was then  theres no reason why i shouldnt have anticipated it i cant claim that i was deceived that i thought my marriage was made in heaven i entered into a contract and ham has kept his part of it fairly well he hasnt interfered with my freedom that isnt putting it on a high plane but there is an obligation involved you yourself in your law practice are always insisting upon the sacredness of contract as the very basis of our civilization  here indeed would have been a home thrust had i been vulnerable at the time so intent was i on overcoming her objections that i resorted unwittingly to the modern argument i had more than once declared in court to be anathemathe argument of the new reform in reference to the common law and the constitution  a contract no matter how seriously entered into at the time it was made that later is seen to violate the principles of humanity should be void and not only this but you didnt consent that he should disgrace you  nancy winced  i never told you that he paid my fathers debts i never told anyone she said in a low voice  even then i answered after a moment you ought to see that its too terrible a price to pay for your happiness and ham hasnt ever pretended to consider you in any way its certain you didnt agree that he should dowhat he is doing  suppose i admitted it she said there remain maude and your children their happiness their future becomes my responsibility as well as yours  but i dont love maude and maude doesnt love me i grant its my fault that i did her a wrong in marrying her but she is right in leaving me i should be doing her a double wrong and the children will be happy with her they will be well brought up i too have thought this out nancy i insisted and the fact is that in our respective marriages we have been each of us victims of our time of our education we were born in a period of transition we inherited views of life that do not fit conditions today it takes courage to achieve happiness initiative to emancipate ones self from a morality that begins to hamper and bind to stay as we are to refuse to take what is offered us is to remain between wind and water i dont mean that we should do anythinghastily we can afford to take a reasonable time to be dignified about it but i have come to the conclusion that the only thing that matters in the world is a love like ours and its fulfilment achievement success are empty and meaningless without it and you do love meyouve admitted it  oh i dont want to talk about it she exclaimed desperately  but we have to talk about it i persisted we have to thrash it out to see it straight as you yourself have said  you speak of convictions hughnew convictions in place of the old we have discarded but what are they and is there no such thing as conscienceeven though it be only an intuition of happiness or unhappiness i do care for you i do love you  then why not let that suffice i exclaimed leaning towards her  she drew back  but i want to respect you too she said  i was shocked too shocked to answer  i want to respect you she repeated more gently i dont want to think thatthat what we feel for each other isunconsecrated  it consecrates itself i declared  she shook her head  surely it has its roots in everything that is fine in both of us  we both went wrong said nancy we both sought to wrest power and happiness from the world to make our own laws how can we assert thatthis is not merely a continuation of it  but cant we work out our beliefs together i demanded wont you trust me trust our love for one another  her breath came and went quickly  oh you know that i want you hugh as much as you want me and more the time may come when i cant resist you  why do you resist me i cried seizing her hands convulsively and swept by a gust of passion at her confession  try to understand that i am fighting for both of us she pleadedan appeal that wrung me in spite of the pitch to which my feelings had been raised hugh dear we must think it out dont now  i let her hands drop  beyond the range of hills rising from the far side of the ashuela was the wide valley in which was situated the cloverdale country club with its polo field golf course and tennis courts and in this same valley some of our wealthy citizens such as howard ogilvy and leonard dickinson had bought farms weekend playthings for spring and autumn hambleton durrett had started the fashion capriciously as he did everything else he had become the owner of several hundred acres of pasture woodland and orchard acquired some seventyfive head of blooded stock and proceeded to house them in model barns and milk by machinery for several months he had bored everyone in the boyne club whom he could entice into conversation on the subject of the records of pedigreed cows and spent many bibulous nights on the farm in company with those parasites who surrounded him when he was in town then another interest had intervened a feminine one of course and his energies were transferred so we understood to the reconstruction and furnishing of a little residence in new york not far from fifth avenue the farm continued under the expert direction of a superintendent who was a graduate of the state agricultural college and a select clientele which could afford to pay the prices consumed the milk and cream and butter quite consistent with their marital relations was the fact that nancy should have taken a fancy to the place after hams interest had waned not that she cared for the guernseys or jerseys or whatever they may have been she evinced a sudden passion for simplicityoccasional simplicity at leastfor a contrast to and escape from a complicated life of luxury she built another house for the superintendent banished him from the little farmhouse where ham had kept two rooms banished along with the superintendent the stiff plush furniture the yellowred carpets the easels and the melodeon and decked it out in bright chintzes with wallpapers to match dainty muslin curtains and ragcarpet rugs on the hardwood floors the pseudoclassic porch over the doorway which had suggested a cemetery was removed and a wide piazza added furnished with wicker lounging chairs and tables and shaded with gay awnings  here to the farm accompanied by a maid she had been in the habit of retiring from time to time and here she came in early july here dressed in the simplest linen gowns of pink or blue or white i found a nancy magically restored to girlhoodanew nancy betraying only traces of the old a new nancy in a new eden we had all the setting all the illusion of that perfect ideal of domesticity love in a cottage nancy and i who all our lives had spurned simplicity laughed over the joy we found in it she made a high art of it of course we had our simple dinners which mrs olsen cooked and served in the open air sometimes on the porch sometimes under the great butternut tree spreading its shade over what in a more elaborate countryplace would have been called a lawnan uneven plot of grass of ridges and hollows that ran down to the orchard nancys eyes would meet mine across the little table and often our gaze would wander over the pastures below lucent green in the level evening light to the darkening woods beyond gilttipped in the setting sun there were fields of ripening yellow grain of lusty young corn that grew almost as we watched it the warm winds of evening were heavy with the acrid odours of fecundity fecundity in that lay the elusive yet insistent charm of that country and nancys of course was the transforming touch that made it paradise it was thus in the country i suggested that we should spend the rest of our existence what was the use of amassing money when happiness was to be had so simply  how long do you think you could stand it she asked as she handed me a plate of blackberries  forever with the right woman i announced  how long could the woman stand it she humoured smilingly my crystalgazing into our future as though she had not the heart to deprive me of the pleasure  i simply cant believe in it hugh she said when i pressed her for an answer  why not  i suppose its because i believe in continuity i havent the romantic temperamenti always see the angel with the flaming sword it isnt that i want to see him  but we shall redeem ourselves i said it wont be curiosity and idleness we are not just taking this thing and expecting to give nothing for it in return  what can we give that is worth it she exclaimed with one of her revealing flashes  we wont take it lightly but seriously i told her we shall find something to give and that something will spring naturally out of our love well read together and think and plan together  oh hugh you are incorrigible was all she said  the male tendency in me was forever strained to solve her to deduce from her conversation and conduct a body of consistent law the effort was useless here was a realm that of nancys soul in which there was apparently no such thing as relevancy in the twilight after dinner we often walked through the orchard to a grassy bank beside the little stream where we would sit and watch the dying glow in the sky after a rain its swollen waters were turbid opaque yellowred with the clay of the hills at other times it ran smoothly temperately almost clear between the pasture grasses and wild flowers nancy declared that it reminded her of me we sat there into the lush warm nights and the moon shone down on us or again through long silences we searched the bewildering starry chart of the heavens with the undertones of the nightchorus of the fields in our ears sometimes she let my head rest upon her knee but when throbbing at her touch with the lifeforce pulsing around us i tried to take her in my arms to bring her lips to mine she resisted me with an energy of will and body that i could not overcome i dared not overcome she acknowledged her love for me she permitted me to come to her she had the air of yielding but never yielded why then did she allow the words of love to pass and how draw the line between caresses i was maddened and disheartened by that elusive resistance in herapparently so frail a thingthat neither argument nor importunity could break down was there something lacking in me or was it that i feared to mar or destroy the love she had this surely had not been the fashion of other loves called unlawful the classic instances celebrated by the poets of all ages rose to mock me  incurably romantic she had called me in calmer moments when i was able to discuss our affair objectively and once she declared that i had no sense of tragedy we read macbeth together i remember one rainy sunday the modern world which was our generation would seem to be cut off from all that preceded it as with a descending knife it was precisely from the sense of tragedy that we had been emancipated from the agonized conscience i should undoubtedly have said had i been acquainted then with mr santayanas later phrase consciencethe old kind of conscienceand nothing inherent in the deeds themselves made the tragedy conscience was superstition the fear of the wrath of the gods conscience was the wrath of the gods eliminate it and behold there were no consequences the gods themselves that kind of gods became as extinct as the deities of the druids the greek fates the terrible figures of german mythology yes and as the god of christian orthodoxy  had any dire calamities overtaken the modern macbeths of whose personal lives we happened to know something had not these great ones broken with impunity all the laws of traditional morality they ground the faces of the poor played golf and went to church with serene minds untroubled by criticism they appropriated quite freely other mens money and some of them other mens wives and yet they were not haggard with remorse the gods remained silent christian ministers regarded these modern transgressors of ancient laws benignly and accepted their contributions here indeed were the supermen of the mad german prophet and philosopher come to life refuting all classic tragedy it is true that some of these supermen were occasionally swept away by disease which in ancient days would have been regarded as a retributive scourge but was in fact nothing but the logical working of the laws of hygiene the result of overwork such though stated more crudely were my contentions when desire did not cloud my brain and make me incoherent and i did not fail to remind nancy constantly that this was the path on which her feet had been set that to waver now was to perish she smiled yet she showed concern  but suppose you dont get what you want she objected what then suppose one doesnt become a superman or a superwoman whats to happen to one is there no god but the supermans god which is himself are there no gods for those who cant be supermen or for those who may refuse to be supermen  to refuse i maintained were a weakness of the will  but there are other wills she persisted wills over which the superman may conceivably have no control suppose for example that you dont get me that my will intervenes granting it to be conceivable that your future happiness and welfare as you insist depend upon your getting mewhich i doubt  youve no reason to doubt it  well granting it then suppose the orthodoxies and superstitions succeed in inhibiting me i may not be a superwoman but my will or my conscience if you choose may be stronger than yours if you dont get what you want you arent happy in other words you fail where are your gods then the trouble with you my dear hugh is that you have never failed she went on youve never had a good hard fall youve always been on the winning side and youve never had the world against you no wonder you dont understand the meaning and value of tragedy  and you i asked  no she agreed nor i yet i have come to feel instinctively that somehow concealed in tragedy is the central fact of life the true reality that nothing is to be got by dodging it as we have dodged it your superman at least the kind of superman you portray is petrified something vital in him that should be plastic and sensitive has turned to stone  since when did you begin to feel this i inquired uneasily  sincewell since we have been together again in the last month or two something seems to warn me that if we takewhat we want we shant get it thats an irish saying i know but it expresses my meaning i may be little i may be superstitious unlike the great women of history who have dared but its more than mere playing safemy instinct i mean you see you are involved i believe i shouldnt hesitate if only myself were concerned but you are the uncertain quantitymore uncertain than you have any idea you think you know yourself you think you have analyzed yourself but the truth is hugh you dont know the meaning of struggle against real resistance  i was about to protest  i know that you have conquered in the world of men and affairs she hurried on against resistance but it isnt the kind of resistance i mean it doesnt differ essentially from the struggle in the animal kingdom  i bowed thank you i said  she laughed a little  oh i have worshipped success too perhaps i still dothat isnt the point an animal conquers his prey he is in competition in constant combat with others of his own kind and perhaps he brings to bear a certain amount of intelligence in the process intelligence isnt the point either i know what im saying is trite its banal it sounds like moralizing and perhaps it is but there is so much confusion today that i think we are in danger of losing sight of the simpler verities and that we must suffer for it your superanimal your supremestag subdues the other stags but he never conquers himself he never feels the need of it and therefore he never comprehends what we call tragedy  i gather your inference i said smiling  well she admitted i havent stated the case with the shade of delicacy it deserves but i wanted to make my meaning clear we have raised up a class in america but we have lost sight a littleconsiderably i thinkof the distinguishing human characteristics the men you were eulogizing are lords of the forest more or less and we women who are of their own kind what they have made us surrender ourselves in submission and adoration to the lordly stag in the face of all the sacraments that have been painfully inaugurated by the race for the very purpose of distinguishing us from animals it is equivalent to saying that there is no moral law or if there is nobody can define it we deny inferentially a human realm as distinguished from the animal and in the denial it seems to me we are cutting ourselves off from what is essential human development we are reverting to the animal i have lost and you have lostnot entirely perhaps but still to a considerable extentthe bloom of that fervour of that idealism we may call it that both of us possessed when we were in our teens we had occasional visions we didnt know what they meant or how to set about their accomplishment but they were not at least mere selfish aspirations they implied unconsciously no doubt an element of service and certainly our ideal of marriage had something fine in it  isnt it for a higher ideal of marriage that we are searching i asked  if that is so nancy objected then all the other elements of our lives are sadly out of tune with it even the most felicitous union of the sexes demands sacrifice an adjustment of wills and these are the very things we balk at and the trouble with our entire class in this country is that we wont acknowledge any responsibility theres no sacrifice in our eminence we have no sense of the whole  where did you get all these ideas i demanded  she laughed  well she admitted ive been thrashing around a little and ive read some of the moderns you know do you remember my telling you i didnt agree with them and now this thing has come on me like a judgment ive caught their mania for liberty for selfrealizationwhatever they call itbut their remedies are vague they fail to convince me that individuals achieve any quality by just taking what they want regardless of others  i was unable to meet this argument and the result was that when i was away from her i too began to thrash around among the books in a vain search for a radical with a convincing and satisfying philosophy thus we fly to literature in crises of the heart there was no lack of writers who sought to dealand deal triumphantly with the very situation in which i was immersed i marked many passages to read them over to nancy who was interested but who accused me of being willing to embrace any philosophy ancient or modern that ran with the stream of my desires it is worth recording that the truth of this struck home on my way back to the city i reflected that in spite of my protests against maudes goingprotests wholly sentimental and impelled by the desire to avoid giving pain on the spoti had approved of her departure because i didnt want her on the other hand i had to acknowledge if i hadnt wanted nancy or rather if i had become tired of her i should have been willing to endorse her scruples it was not a comforting thought  one morning when i was absently opening the mail i found at my office i picked up a letter from theodore watling written from a seaside resort in maine the contents of which surprised and touched me troubled me and compelled me to face a situation with which i was wholly unprepared to cope he announced that this was to be his last term in the senate he did not name the trouble his physician had discovered but he had been warned that he must retire from active life the specialist whom i saw in new york he went on wished me to resign at once but when i pointed out to him how unfair this would be to my friends in the state to my party as a wholeespecially in these serious and unsettled timeshe agreed that i might with proper care serve out the remainder of my term i have felt it my duty to write to barbour and dickinson and one or two others in order that they might be prepared and that no time may be lost in choosing my successor it is true that the revolt within the party has never gained much headway in our state but in these days it is difficult to tell when and where a conflagration may break out or how far it will go i have ventured to recommend to them the man who seems to me the best equipped to carry on the work i have been trying to do herein short my dear hugh yourself the senate as you know is not a bed of roses just now for those who think as we do but i have the less hesitancy in making the recommendation because i believe you are not one to shun a fight for the convictions we hold in common and because you would regard with me the election of a senator with the new views as a very real calamity if sound business men and lawyers should be eliminated from the senate i could not contemplate with any peace of mind what might happen to the country in thus urging you i know you will believe me when i say that my affection and judgment are equally involved for it would be a matter of greater pride than i can express to have you follow me here as you have followed me at home and i beg of you seriously to consider it i understand that maude and the children are abroad remember me to them affectionately when you write if you can find it convenient to come here to maine to discuss the matter you may be sure of a welcome in any case i expect to be in washington in september for a meeting of our special committee sincerely and affectionately yours theodore watling  it was characteristic of him that the tone of the letter should be uniformly cheerful that he should say nothing whatever of the blow this must be to his ambitions and hopes and my agitation at the new and disturbing prospect thus opened up for me was momentarily swept away by feelings of affection and sorrow a sharp realization came to me of how much i admired and loved this man and this was followed by a pang at the thought of the disappointment my refusal would give him complications i did not wish to examine were then in the back of my mind and while i still sat holding the letter in my hand the telephone rang and a message came from leonard dickinson begging me to call at the bank at once  miller gorse was there and tallant waving a palmleaf while sitting under the electric fan they were all very grave and they began to talk about the suddenness of mr watlings illness and to speculate upon its nature leonard dickinson was the most moved of the three but they were all distressed and showed iteven tallant whom i had never credited with any feelings they spoke about the loss to the state at length gorse took a cigar from his pocket and lighted it the smoke impelled by the fan drifted over the panelled partition into the bank  i suppose mr watling mentioned to you what he wrote to us he said  yes i admitted  well he asked what do you think of it  i attribute it to mr watlings friendship i replied  no said gorse in his businesslike manner watlings right theres no one else considering the number of inhabitants of our state this remark had its humorous aspect  thats true dickinson put in theres no one else available who understands the situation as you do hugh no one else we can trust as we trust you i had a wire from mr barbour this morninghe agrees well miss you here but now that watling will be gone well need you there and hes rightits something weve got to decide on right away and get started on soon we cant afford to wobble and run any chances of a revolt  it isnt everybody the senatorship comes to on a platterespecially at your age said tallant  to tell you the truth i answered addressing dickinson im not prepared to talk about it now i appreciate the honour but im not at all sure im the right man and ive been considerably upset by this news of mr watling  naturally you would be said the banker sympathetically and we share your feelings i dont know of any man for whom i have a greater affection than i have for theodore wading we shouldnt have mentioned it now hugh if watling hadnt started the thing himself if it werent important to know where we stand right away we cant afford to lose the seat take your time but remember youre the man we depend upon  gorse nodded i was aware all the time dickinson was speaking of being surrounded by the strange disquieting gaze of the counsel for the railroad  i went back to my office to spend an uneasy morning my sorrow for mr watling was genuine but nevertheless i found myself compelled to consider an honour no man lightly refuses had it presented itself at any other time had it been due to a happier situation than that brought about by the illness of a man whom i loved and admired i should have thought the prospect dazzling indeed part and parcel of my amazing luck but nownow i was in an emotional state that distorted the factors of life all those things i hitherto had valued even such a prize as this i weighed in terms of one supreme desire how would the acceptance of the senatorship affect the accomplishment of this desire that was the question i began making rapid calculations the actual election would take place in the legislature a year from the following january provided i were able to overcome nancys resistancewhich i was determined to donothing in the way of divorce proceedings could be thought of for more than a year and i feared delay on the other hand if we waited until after i had been duly elected to get my divorce and marry nancy my chances of reelection would be small what did i care for the senatorship anywayif i had her and i wanted her now as soon as i could get her shea life with her represented new values new values i did not define that made all i had striven for in the past of little worth this was a bauble compared with the companionship of the woman i loved the woman intended for me who would give me peace of mind and soul and develop those truer aspirations that had long been thwarted and starved for lack of her gradually as she regained the ascendency over my mind she ordinarily heldand from which she had been temporarily displaced by the arrival of mr watlings letter and the talk in the banki became impatient and irritated by the intrusion but what answer should i give to dickinson and gorse what excuse for declining such an offer i decided as may be imagined to wait to temporize  the irony of circumstancesof what might have beenprevented now my laying this trophy at nancys feet for i knew i had only to mention the matter to be certain of losing her     xxiii  i had bought a small automobile which i ran myself and it was my custom to arrive at the farm every evening about five oclock but as i look back upon those days they seem to have lost succession to be fused together as it were into one indeterminable period by the intense pressure of emotion unsatisfied emotionand the state of physical and mental disorganization set up by it is in the retrospect not a little terrifying the world grew more and more distorted its affairs were neglected things upon which i had set high values became as nothing and even if i could summon back something of the sequence of our intercourse it would be a mere repetitiongrowing on my part more irrational and insistentof what i have already related there were long troubled and futile silences when we sat together on the porch or in the woods and fields when i wondered whether it were weakness or strength that caused nancy to hold out against my importunities the fears she professed of retribution the benumbing effects of the conventional years or the deeprooted remnants of a calvinism whichas she proclaimedhad lost definite expression to persist as an intuition i recall something she said when she turned to me after one of these silences  do you know how i feel sometimes as though you and i had wandered together into a strange country and lost our way we have lost our way hughits all so clandestine so feverish so unnatural so unrelated to life this existence were leading i believe it would be better if it were a mere case of physical passion i cant help it she went on when i had exclaimed against this we are tootoo complicated you are too complicated its because we want the morning stars dont you see she wound her fingers tightly around mine we not only want this but all of life besidesyou wouldnt be satisfied with anything less oh i know it thats your temperament you were made that way and i shouldnt be satisfied if you werent the time would come when you would blame me i dont mean vulgarlyand i couldnt stand that if you werent that way if that werent your nature i mean i should have given way long ago  i made some sort of desperate protest  no if i didnt know you so well i believe i should have given in long ago im not thinking of you alone but of myself too im afraid i shouldnt be happy that i should begin to thinkand then i couldnt stop the plain truth as ive told you over and over again is that im not big enough she continued smiling at me a smile on which i could not bear to look i was wrong not to have gone away i heard her say i will go away  i was at the time too profoundly discouraged to answer  one evening after an exhausting talk we sat inert on the grass hummock beside the stream heavy clouds had gathered in the sky the light had deepened to amethyst the valley was still swooning with expectancy louder and louder the thunder rolled from behind the distant hills and presently a veil descended to hide them from our view great drops began to fall unheeded  we must go in said nancy at length  i followed her across the field and through the orchard from the porch we stood gazing out at the whitening rain that blotted all save the nearer landscape and the smell of wet midsummer grasses will always be associated with the poignancy of that moment at dinner between the intervals of silence our talk was of trivial things we made a mere pretence of eating and i remember having my attention arrested by the sight of a strange pitying expression on the face of mrs olsen who waited on us before that the woman had been to me a mere ministering automaton but she must have had ideas and opinions this transported swedish peasant presently having cleared the table she retired the twilight deepened to dusk to darkness the storm having spent the intensity of its passion in those first moments of heavy downpour and wind had relaxed to a gentle rain that pattered on the roof and from the stream came recurringly the dirge of the frogs all i could see of nancy was the dim outline of her head and shoulders she seemed fantastically to be escaping me to be fading to be going in sudden desperation i dropped on my knees beside her and i felt her hands straying with a light yet agonized touch over my head  do you think i havent suffered too that i dont suffer i heard her ask  some betraying note for which i had hitherto waited in vain must have pierced to my consciousness yet the quiver of joy and the swift convulsive movement that followed it seemed one her strong lithe body was straining in my arms her lips returning my kisses clinging to her hands i strove to summon my faculties of realization and i began to speak in broken endearing sentences  its stronger than we arestronger than anything else in the world she said  but youre not sorry i asked  i dont want to thinki dont care she replied i only know that i love you i wonder if you will ever know how much  the moments lengthened into hours and she gently reminded me that it was late the lights in the little farmhouses near by had long been extinguished i pleaded to linger i wanted her more of her all of her with a fierce desire that drowned rational thought and i feared that something might still come between us and cheat me of her  no no she cried with fear in her voice we shall have to think it out very carefullywhat we must do we cant afford to make any mistakes  well talk it all over tomorrow i said  with a last reluctant embrace i finally left her walked blindly to where the motor car was standing and started the engine i looked back outlined in the light of the doorway i saw her figure in what seemed an attitude of supplication  i drove cityward through the rain mechanically taking the familiar turns in the road barely missing a man in a buggy at a fourcorners he shouted after me but the world to which he belonged didnt exist i lived again those moments that had followed nancys surrender seeking to recall and fix in my mind every word that had escaped from her lipsthe trivial things that to lovers are so fraught with meaning i lived it all over again as i say but the reflection of it though intensely emotional differed from the reality in that now i was somewhat able to regard the thing to regard myself objectively to define certain feelings that had flitted in filmy fashion through my consciousness delicate shadows i recognized at the time as related to sadness when she had so amazingly yielded the thought for which my mind had been vaguely groping was that the woman who lay there in my arms obscured by the darkness was not nancy at all it was as if this one precious woman i had so desperately pursued had in the capture lost her identity had mysteriously become just woman in all her significance yes and helplessness the particular had merged inevitably i might have known into the general the temporary had become the lasting with a chain of consequences vaguely implied that even in my joy gave me pause for the first time in my life i had a glimpse of what marriage might meanmarriage in a greater sense than i had ever conceived it a sort of cosmic sense implying obligations transcending promises and contracts calling for greatness of soul of a kind i had not hitherto imagined was there in me a grain of doubt of my ability to respond to such a high call i began to perceive that such a union as we contemplated involved more obligations than one not opposed to traditional views of morality i fortified myself howeverif indeed i really needed fortification in a mood prevailingly triumphant and exaltedwith the thought that this love was different the real thing the love of maturity steeped in the ideals of youth here was a love for which i must be prepared to renounce other things on which i set a high value prepared in case the world for some reason should not look upon us with kindliness it was curious that such reflections as these should have been delayed until after the achievement of my absorbing desire more curious that they should have followed so closely on the heels of it the affair had shifted suddenly from a basis of adventure of uncertainty to one of fact of commitment i am exaggerating my concern in order to define it i was able to persuade myself without much difficulty that these little cloudy currents in the stream of my joy were due to a natural reaction from the tremendous strain of the past weeks mere morbid fancies  when at length i reached my room at the club i sat looking out at the rain falling on the shining pavements under the arclights though waves of heat caused by some sudden recollection or impatient longing still ran through my body a saner joy of anticipation was succeeding emotional tumult and i reflected that nancy had been right in insisting that we walk circumspectly in spite of passion after all i had outwitted circumstance i had gained the prize i could afford to wait a little we should talk it over tomorrowno today the luminous face of the city hall clock reminded me that midnight was long past  i awoke with the consciousness of a new joy suddenly to identify it with nancy she was mine i kept repeating it as i dressed summoning her not as she had lain in my arms in the darknessthough the intoxicating sweetness of that pervaded mebut as she had been before the completeness of her surrender dainty surrounded by things expressing an elusive uniquely feminine personality i could afford to smile at the weather at the obsidian sky at the rain still falling persistently and yet as i ate my breakfast i felt a certain impatience to verify what i knew was a certainty and hurried to the telephone booth i resented the instrument its possibilities of betrayal her voice sounded so matteroffact as she bade me good morning and deplored the rain  ill be out as soon as i can get away i said i have a meeting at three but it should be over at four and then i added irresistibly nancy youre not sorry youyou still  yes dont be foolish i heard her reply and this time the telephone did not completely disguise the note for which i strained i said something more but the circuit was closed  i shall not attempt to recount the details of our intercourse during the week that followed there were moments of stress and strain when it seemed to me that we could not wait moments that strengthened nancys resolution to leave immediately for the east there were other calmer periods when the wisdom of her going appealed to me since our ultimate union would be hastened thereby we overcame by degrees the distastefulness of the discussion of ways and means we spent an unforgettable sunday among the distant high hills beside a little lake of our own discovery its glinting waters sapphire and chrysoprase a grassy wood road at the inviting entrance to which we left the automobile led down through an undergrowth of laurel to a pebbly shore and there we lunched there we lingered through the long summer afternoon nancy with her back against a tree i with my head in her lap gazing up at filmy clouds drifting imperceptibly across the sky listening to the droning notes of the bees notes that sometimes rose in a sharp crescendo and again were suddenly hushed the smell of the woodmould mingled with the fainter scents of wild flowers she had brought along a volume by a modern poet the verses as nancy read them moved methey were filled with a new faith to which my being responded the faith of the forthfarer not the faith of the anchor but of the sail i repeated some of the lines as indications of a creed to which i had long been trying to convert her though lacking the expression she had let the book fall on the grass i remember how she smiled down at me with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes seeking my hand with a gesture that was almost maternal  you and the poets she said you never grow up i suppose thats the reason why we love youand these wonderful visions of freedom you have anyway its nice to dream to recreate the world as one would like to have it  but thats what you and i are doing i insisted  we think were doing itor rather you think so she replied and sometimes i admit that you almost persuade me to think so never quite what disturbs me she continued is to find you and the poets founding your new freedom on new justifications discarding the old law only to make a new oneas though we could ever get away from necessities escape from disagreeable things except in dreams and then this delusion of believing that we are masters of our own destiny she paused and pressed my fingers  there you goback to predestination i exclaimed  i dont go back to anything or forward to anything she exclaimed women are elemental but i dont expect you to understand it laws and codes are foreign to us philosophies and dreams may dazzle us for the moment but what we feel underneath and what we yield to are the primal forces the great necessities when we refuse joys its because we know these forces by a sort of instinct when were overcome its with a full knowledge that theres a price youve talked a great deal hugh about carving out our future i listened to you but i resisted you it wasnt the morality that was taught me as a child that made me resist it was something deeper than that more fundamental something i feel but cant yet perceive and yet shall perceive some day it isnt that im clinging to the hard and fast rules because i fail to see any others it isnt that i believe that all people should stick together whether they are happily married or not buti must say it even nowi have a feeling i cant define that divorce isnt for us im not talking about right and wrong in the ordinary senseits just what i feel ive ceased to think  nancy i reproached her  i cant help iti dont want to be morbid do you remember my asking you about godthe first day this began and whether you had a god well thats the trouble with us all today we havent any god were wanderers drifters and now its just life thats got hold of us my dear and swept us away together thats our justificationif we needed oneits been too strong for us she leaned back against the tree and closed her eyes were like chips in the torrent of it hugh  it was not until the shadow of the forest had crept far across the lake and the darkening waters were still that we rose reluctantly to put the dishes in the tea basket and start on our homeward journey the tawny fires of the sunset were dying down behind us the mist stealing ghostlike into the valleys below in the sky a little moon curled like a freshly cut silver shaving that presently turned to gold the white star above it to fire  where the valleys widened we came to silent decorous little towns and villages where yellowlit windows gleaming through the trees suggested refuge and peace while we were wanderers in the night it was nancys mood and now in the evenings chill it recurred to me poignantly in one of these villages we passed a church its doors flung open the congregation was singing a familiar hymn i slowed down the car i felt her shoulder pressing against my own and reached out my hand and found hers  are you warm enough i asked  we spoke but little on that drive we had learned the futility of words to express the greater joys and sorrows the love that is compounded of these  it was late when we turned in between the white dates and made our way up the little driveway to the farmhouse i bade her good night on the steps of the porch  you do love me dont you she whispered clinging to me with a sudden straining passion you will love me always no matter what happens  why of course nancy i answered  i want to hear you say it i love you i shall love you always  i repeated it fervently  no matter what happens  no matter what happens as if i could help it nancy why are you so sad tonight  ah hugh it makes me sadi cant tell why it is so great it is so terrible and yet its so sweet and beautiful  she took my face in her hands and pressed a kiss against my forehead  the next day was dark at two oclock in the afternoon the electric light was still burning over my desk when the telephone rang and i heard nancys voice  is that you hugh  yes  i have to go east this afternoon  why i asked her agitation had communicated itself to me i thought you werent going until thursday whats the matter  ive just had a telegram she said hams been hurti dont know how badlyhe was thrown from a polo pony this morning at narragansett in practice and theyre taking him to boston to a private hospital the telegrams from johnny shephard ill be at the house in town at four  filled with forebodings i tried in vain to suppress i dropped the work i was doing and got up and paced the room pausing now and again to gaze out of the window at the wet roofs and the grey skies i was aghast at the idea of her going to ham now even though he were hurt badly hurt and yet i tried to think it was natural that it was fine of her to respond to such a call and she couldnt very well refuse his summons but it was not the news of her husbands accident that inspired the greater fear which was quelled and soothed only to rise again when i recalled the note i had heard in her voice a note eloquent of tragedyof tragedy she had foreseen at length unable to remain where i was any longer i descended to the street and walked uptown in the rain the durrett house was closed the blinds of its many windows drawn but nancy was watching for me and opened the door so used had i grown to seeing her in the simple linen dresses she had worn in the country a costume associated with exclusive possession that the sight of her travelling suit and hat renewed in me an agony of apprehension the unforeseen event seemed to have transformed her once more her veil was drawn up her face was pale in her eyes were traces of tears  youre going i asked as i took her hands  hugh i have to go  she led me through the dark shrouded drawing room into the little salon where the windows were open on the silent citygarden i took her in my arms she did not resist as i half expected but clung to me with what seemed desperation  i have to go dearyou wont make it too hard for me its onlyordinary decency and theres no one else to go to him  she drew me to the sofa her eyes beseeching me  listen dear i want you to see it as i see it i know that you will that you do i should never be able to forgive myself if i stayed away now ineither of us could ever be happy about it you do see dont you she implored  yes i admitted agitatedly  her grasp on my hand tightened  i knew you would but it makes me happier to hear you say it  we sat for a moment in helpless silence gazing at one another slowly her eyes had filled  have you heard anything more i managed to ask  she drew a telegram from her bag as though the movement were a relief  this is from the doctor in bostonhis name is magruder they have got ham there it seems a horse kicked him in the head after he fellhe had just recovered consciousness  i took the telegram the wordy seemed meaningless all save those of the last sentence the situation is serious but by no means hopeless nancy had not spoken of that the ignorant cruelty of its convention the man must have known what hambleton durrett was nancy read my thoughts and took the paper from my hand  hugh dear if its hard for you try to understand that its terrible for me to think that he has any claim at all i realize now as i never did before how wicked it was in me to marry him i hate him i cant bear the thought of going near him  she fell into wild weeping i tried to comfort her who could not comfort myself i dont remember my inadequate words we were overwhelmed obliterated by the sense of calamity it was she who checked herself at last by an effort that was almost hysterical  i mustnt yield to it she said its time to leave and the train goes at six no you mustnt come to the station hughi dont think i could stand it ill send you a telegram she rose you must go nowyou must  youll come back to me i demanded thickly as i held her  hugh i am yours now and always how can you doubt it  at last i released her when she had begged me again and i found myself a little later walking past the familiar empty houses of those streets  the front pages of the evening newspapers announced the accident to hambleton durrett and added that mrs durrett who had been lingering in the city had gone to her husbands bedside the morning papers contained more of biography and ancestry but had little to add to the bulletin and there was no lack of speculation at the club and elsewhere as to hams ability to rally from such a shock i could not bear to listen to these comments they were violently distasteful to me the unforeseen accident and nancys sudden departure had thrown my life completely out of gear i could not attend to business i dared not go away lest the news from nancy be delayed i spent the hours in an exhausting mental state that alternated between hope and fear a state of unmitigated intense desire of balked realization sometimes heightening into that sheer terror i had felt when i had detected over the telephone that note in her voice that seemed of despair had she had a presentiment all along that something would occur to separate us as i went back over the hours we had passed together since she had acknowledged her love in spite of myself the conviction grew on me that she had never believed in the reality of our future indeed she had expressed her disbelief in words had she been looking all along for a signa sign of wrath and would she accept this accident of hams as such  retrospection left me trembling and almost sick  it was not until the second morning after her departure that i received a telegram giving the name of her boston hotel and saying that there was to be a consultation that day and as soon as it had taken place she would write such consolation as i could gather from it was derived from four words at the endshe missed me dreadfully some tremor of pity for her entered into my consciousness without mitigating greatly the wildness of my resentment of my forebodings  i could bear no longer the city the club the office the daily contact with my associates and clients six hours distant near rossiter was a small resort in the mountains of which i had heard i telegraphed nancy to address me there notified the office packed my bag and waited impatiently for midday when i boarded the train at seven i reached a little station where a stage was waiting to take me to callenders mill  it was not until morning that i beheld my retreat when little wisps of vapour were straying over the surface of the lake and the steep green slopes that rose out of the water on the western side were still in shadow the hotel a much overgrown and altered farmhouse stood surrounded by great trees in an ancient clearing that sloped gently to the waters edge where an oldfashioned octagonal summerhouse overlooked a landing for rowboats the resort indeed was a survival of simpler times  in spite of the thirtyodd guests people of very moderate incomes who knew the place and had come here year after year i was as much alone as if i had been the only sojourner the place was so remote so peaceful in contrast to the city i had left which had become intolerable and at night during hours of wakefulness the music of the waters falling over the dam was soothing i used to walk down there and sit on the stones of the ruined mill or climb to the crests on the far side of the pond to gaze for hours westward where the green billows of the alleghenies lost themselves in the haze i had discovered a new country here when our trials should be over i would bring nancy and i found distraction in choosing sites for a bungalow in my soul hope flowered with little watering uncertain news was good news after two days of an impatience all but intolerable her first letter arrived i learned that the specialists had not been able to make a diagnosis and i began to take heart again at times she said ham was delirious and difficult to manage at other times he sank into a condition of coma and again he seemed to know her and ralph who had come up from southampton where he had been spending the summer one doctor thought that hams remarkable vitality would pull him through in spite of what his life had been the shockas might have been surmisedhad affected the brain the letters that followed contained no additional news she did not dwell on the depressing reactions inevitable from the situation in which she found herselfone so much worse than mine she expressed a continual longing for me and yet i had trouble to convince myself that they did not lack the note of reassurance for which i strained as i eagerly scanned themof reassurance that she had no intention of permitting her husbands condition to interfere with that ultimate happiness on which it seemed my existence depended i tried to account for the absence of this note by reflecting that the letters were of necessity brief hurriedly scratched off at odd moments and a natural delicacy would prevent her from referring to our future at such a time they recorded no change in hams condition save that the periods of coma had ceased the doctors were silent awaiting the arrival in this country of a certain new york specialist who was abroad she spent most of her days at the hospital returning to the hotel at night exhausted the people she knew in the various resorts around boston had been most kind sending her flowers and calling when in town to inquire at length came the news that the new york doctor was home again and coming to boston in that letter was a sentence which rang like a cry in my ears oh hugh i think these doctors know now what the trouble is i think i know they are only waiting for dr jameson to confirm it  it was always an effort for me to control my impatience after the first rattling was heard in the morning of the stage that brought the mail and i avoided the waiting group in front of the honeycombed partition of boxes beside the office on the particular morning of which i am now writing the proprietor himself handed me a letter of ominous thickness which i took with me down to the borders of the lake before tearing open the flap in spite of the calmness and restraint of the first lines because of them i felt creeping over me an unnerving sensation i knew for dread  hugh the new york doctor has been here it is as i have feared for some weeks but i couldnt tell you until i was sure ham is not exactly insane but he is childish sometimes i think that is even worse i have had a talk with dr jameson who has simply confirmed the opinion which the other physicians have gradually been forming the accident has precipitated a kind of mental degeneration but his health otherwise will not be greatly affected  jameson was kind but very frank for which i was grateful he did not hesitate to say that it would have been better if the accident had been fatal ham wont be helpless physically of course he wont be able to play polo or take much active exercise if he were to be helpless i could feel that i might be of some use at least of more use he knows his friends some of them have been here to see him and he talks quite rationally with them with ralph with me only once in a while he says something silly it seems odd to write that he is not responsible since he never has beenhis condition is so queer that i am at a loss to describe it the other morning before i arrived from the hotel and when the nurse was downstairs he left the hospital and we found him several blocks along commonwealth avenue seated on a bench without a hathe was annoyed that he had forgotten it and quite sensible otherwise we began by taking him out every morning in an automobile today he had a walk with ralph and insisted on going into a club here to which they both belong two or three men were there whom they knew and he talked to them about his fall from the pony and told them just how it happened  at such times only a close observer can tell from his manner that everything is not right  ralph who always could manage him prevented his taking anything to drink he depends upon ralph and it will be harder for me when he is not with us his attitude towards me is just about what it has always been i try to amuse him by reading the newspapers and with games we have a chessboard at times he seems grateful and then he will suddenly grow tired and hard to control once or twice i have had to call in dr magruder who owns the hospital  it has been terribly hard for me to write all this but i had to do it in order that you might understand the situation completely hugh dear i simply cant leave him this has been becoming clearer and clearer to me all these weeks but it breaks my heart to have to write it i have struggled against it i have lain awake nights trying to find justification for going to you but it is stronger than i i am afraid of iti suppose thats the truth even in those unforgettable days at the farm i was afraid of it although i did not know what it was to be call it what you like say that i am weak i am willing to acknowledge that it is weakness i wish no credit for it it gives me no glow the thought of it makes my heart sick im not big enough i suppose thats the real truth i once might have been but im not nowthe years of the life i chose have made a coward of me its not a question of morals or duty its simply that i cant take the thing for which my soul craves its too late if i believed in prayer id pray that you might pity and forgive me i really cant expect you to understand what i cant myself explain oh i need pityand i pity you my dear i can only hope that you will not suffer as i shall that you will find relief away to work out your life but i will not change my decision i cannot change it dont come on dont attempt to see me now i cant stand any more than i am standing i should lose my mind  here the letter was blotted and some words scratched out i was unable to reconstruct them  ralph and i she proceeded irrelevantly have got ham to agree to go to buzzards bay and we have taken a house near wareham write and tell me that you forgive and pity me i love you even more if such a thing is possible than i have ever loved you this is my only comfort and compensation that i have had and have been able to feel such a love and i know i shall always feel itnancy the first effect of this letter was a paralyzing one i was unable to realize or believe the thing that had happened to me and i sat stupidly holding the sheet in my hand until i heard voices along the path and then i fled instinctively like an animal to hide my injury from any persons i might meet i wandered down the shore of the lake striking at length into the woods seeking some inviolable shelter nor was i conscious of physical effort until i found myself panting near the crest of the ridge where there was a pasture which some ancient glacier had strewn with great boulders beside one of these i sank heralded by the deep tones of bells two steers appeared above the shoulder of a hill and stood staring at me with bovine curiosity and fell to grazing again a fleet of white clouds like ships pressed with sail hurried across the sky as though racing for some determined port and the shadows they cast along the hillsides accentuated the high brightness of the day emphasized the vivid and hateful beauty of the landscape my numbness began to be penetrated by shooting pains and i grasped little by little the fulness of my calamity until i was in the state of wild rebellion of one whom life for the first time has foiled in a supreme desire there was no fate about this thing it was just an absurd accident the operation of the laws of nature had sent a man to the ground another combination of circumstances would have killed him still another and he would have arisen unhurt but because of this particular combination my happiness was ruined and nancys she had not expected me to understand well i didnt understand i had no pity in that hour i felt a resentment almost amounting to hate i could see only unreasoning superstition in the woman i wanted above everything in the world women of other days had indeed renounced great loves the thing was not unheard of but that this should happen in these timesand to me it was unthinkable that nancy of all women shouldnt be emancipated from the thralls of religious inhibition and if it wasnt conscience what was it  was it as she said weakness lack of courage to take life when it was offered her i was suddenly filled with the fever of composing arguments to change a decision that appeared to me to be the result of a monstrous caprice and delusion writing them out as they occurred to me in snatches on the backs of envelopesher envelopes then i proceeded to make the draft of a letter the effort required for composition easing me until the draft was finished when i started for the hotel climbing fences leaping streams making my way across rock faces and through woods halting now and then as some reenforcing argument occurred to me to write it into my draft at the proper place until the sheets were interlined and blurred and almost illegible it was already three oclock when i reached my room and the mail left at four i began to copy and revise my scrawl glancing from time to time at my watch which i had laid on the table hurriedly washing my face and brushing my hair i arrived downstairs just as the stage was leaving  after the letter had gone still other arguments i might have added began to occur to me and i regretted that i had not softened some of the things i wrote and made others more emphatic in places argument had degenerated into abject entreaty never had my desire been so importunate as now when i was in continual terror of losing her nor could i see how i was to live without her life lacking a motive being incomprehensible yet the fire of optimism in me though died down to ashes would not be extinguished at moments it flared up into what almost amounted to a conviction that she could not resist my appeal i had threatened to go to her and more than once i started packing  three days later i received a brief note in which she managed to convey to me though tenderly and compassionately that her decision was unalterable if i came on she would refuse to see me i took the afternoon stage and went back to the city to plunge into affairs again but for weeks my torture was so acute that it gives me pain to recall it to dwell upon it today and yet amazing as it may seem there came a time when hope began to dawn again out of my despair perhaps my life had not been utterly shattered after all perhaps ham durrett would get well such things happened and nancy would no longer have an excuse for continuing to refuse me little by little my anger at what i had now become convinced was her weakness cooled andthough paradoxically i had continued to love her in spite of the torture for which she was responsible in spite of the resentment i felt i melted toward her true to my habit of reliance on miracles i tried to reconcile myself to a period of waiting  nevertheless i was faintly awareconsequent upon if not as a result of this tremendous experienceof some change within me it was not only that i felt at times a novel sense of uneasiness at being a prey to accidents subject to ravages of feeling the unity of mind that had hitherto enabled me to press forward continuously toward a concrete goal showed signs of breaking upthe goal had lost its desirability i seemed oddly to be relapsing into the states of questioning that had characterized my earlier years perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that i actually began to speculate on the possible existence of a realm where the soul might find a refuge from the buffetings of life from which the philosophy of prosperity was powerless to save it     xxiv  it was impossible of course that my friends should have failed to perceive the state of disorganization i was in and some of them at least must have guessed its cause dickinson on his return from maine at once begged me to go away i rather congratulated myself that tom had chosen these months for a longdelayed vacation in canada his passion for fishing still persisted  in spite of the fact i have noted that i had lost a certain zest for results to keep busy seemed to be the only way to relieve my mind of an otherwise intolerable pressure and i worked sometimes far into the evening in the background of my thoughts lay the necessity of coming to a decision on the question of the senatorship several times dickinson and gorse had spoken of it and i was beginning to get letters from influential men in other parts of the state they seemed to take it for granted that there was no question of my refusing the time came when i had grown able to consider the matter with a degree of calmness what struck me first when i began to debate upon it was that the senatorship offered a new and possibly higher field for my energies while at the same time the office would be a logical continuation of a signal legal career i was now unable to deny that i no longer felt any exhilaration at the prospect of future legal conquests similar to those of the past but once in the senate i might regain something of that intense conviction of fighting for a just and sound cause with which theodore wading had once animated me fighting there in the capitol at washington would be different no stigma of personal gain attached to it it offered a nearer approach to the ideal i had once more begun to seek held out hopes of a renewal of my unity of mind mr watling had declared that there was something to fight for i had even glimpsed that something but i had to confess that for some years i had not been consciously fighting for it i needed something to fight for  there was the necessity however of renewing my calculations if hambleton durrett should recover even during the ensuing year and if nancy relented it would not be possible for us to be divorced and married for some time i still clung tenaciously to the belief that there were no relationships wholly unaffected by worldly triumphs and as senator i should have strengthened my position it did not strike meeven after all my experiencethat such a course as i now contemplated had a parallel in the one that i had pursued in regard to her when i was young  it seemed fitting that theodore watling should be the first to know of my decision i went to washington to meet him it pained me to see him looking more worn but he was still as cheerful as mentally vigorous as ever and i perceived that he did not wish to dwell upon his illness i did venture to expostulate with him on the risk he must be running in serving out his term we were sitting in the dining room of his house  weve only one life to live hugh he answered smiling at me and we might as well get all out of it we can a few years more or less doesnt make much differenceand i ought to be satisfied id resign now to please my wife to please my friends but we cant trust this governor to appoint a safe man how little we suspected when we elected him that hed become infected you never can tell in these days can you  it was the note of devotion to his cause that i had come to hear i felt it renewing me as i had hoped the threat of disease the louder clamourings of the leaders of the mob had not sufficed to dismay himthough he admitted more concern over these my sympathy and affection were mingled with the admiration he never failed to inspire  but you hugh he said concernedly youre not looking very well my son you must manage to take a good rest before coming herebefore the campaign youll have to go through we cant afford to have anything happen to youyoure too young  i wondered whether he had heard anything he spoke to me again about the work to be done the work he looked to me to carry on  well have to watch for our opportunity he said and when it comes we can handle this new movement not by crushing it but by guiding it ive come to the conclusion that there is a true instinct in it that there are certain things we have done which have been mistakes and which we cant do any more but as for this theory that all wisdom resides in the people its buncombe what we have to do is to work out a practical programme  his confidence in me had not diminished it helped to restore confidence in myself  the weather was cool and bracing for september and as we drove in a motor through the beautiful avenues of the city he pointed out a house for me on one of the circles one of those distinguished residences instances of a nascent good taste that are helping to redeem the polyglot aspect of our national capital mr watling spokerather tactfully i thoughtof maude and the children and ventured the surmise that they would be returning in a few months i interpreted this indeed as in rather the nature of a kindly hint that such a procedure would be wise in view of the larger life now dawning for me but i made no comment he even sympathized with nancy durrett  she did the right thing hugh he said with the admirable casual manner he possessed of treating subjects which he knew to be delicate nancys a fine woman poor devil this in reference to ham  mr watling reassured me on the subject of his own trouble maintaining that he had many years left if he took care he drove me to the station i travelled homeward somewhat lifted out of myself by this visit to him with some feeling of spaciousness derived from washington itself with its dignified presidential mansion among the trees its granite shaft drawing the eye upward with its winged capitol serene upon the hill should we deliver these heirlooms to the mob surely democracy meant more than that  all this time i had been receiving at intervals letters from maude and the children maudes were the letters of a friend and i found it easy to convince myself that their tone was genuine that the separation had brought contentment to her and those independent and selfsufficient elements in her character i admired now rather than deplored at etretat which she found much to her taste she was living quietly but making friends with some american and english and one french family of the same name buffon as the great naturalist the father was a retired silk manufacturer they now resided in paris and had been very kind in helping her to get an apartment in that city for the winter she had chosen one on the avenue kleber not far from the arc it is interesting after her arraignment of me that she should have taken such pains to record their daily life for my benefit in her clear conscientious handwriting i beheld biddy her dresses tucked above slim little knees playing in the sand on the beach her hair flying in the wind and lighted by the sun which gave sparkle to the sea i saw maude herself in her beach chair a book lying in her lap its pages whipped by the breeze and there was moreton who must be proving something of a handful since he had fought with the french boys on the beach and thrown a rock through the windows of the buffon family i remember one of his lettersmade perfect after much correcting and scratchingin which he denounced both france and the french and appealed to me to come over at once to take him home maude had enclosed it without comment this letter had not been written under duress as most of his were  matthews lettershe wrote faithfully once a weeki kept in a little pile by themselves and sometimes reread them i wondered whether it were because of the fact that i was his fatherthough a most inadequate onethat i thought them somewhat unusual he had learned frenchmaude wrotewith remarkable ease i was particularly struck in these letters with the boys power of observation with his facile use of language with the vivid simplicity of his descriptions of the life around him of his experiences at school the letters were thoughtfulnot dashed off in a hurry they gave evidence in every line of the delicacy of feeling that was i think his most appealing quality and i put them down with the impression strong on me that he too longed to return home but would not say so there was a certain pathos in this youthful restraint that never failed to touch me even in those times when i had been most obsessed with love and passion the curious effect of these letters was that of knowing more than they expressed he missed me he wished to know when i was coming over and i was sometimes at a loss whether to be grateful to maude or troubled because she had as yet given him no hint of our separation what effect would it have on him when it should be revealed to him it was through matthew i began to apprehend certain elements in maude i had both failed to note and appreciate her little mannerisms that jarred her habits of thought that exasperated were forgotten and i was forced to confess that there was something fine in the achievement of this attitude of hers that was without ill will or resentment that tacitly acknowledged my continued rights and interest in the children it puzzled and troubled me  the citizens union began its campaign early that autumn long before the hons jonathan parks and timothy macguirerepublican and democratic candidates for mayorthought of going on the stump for several weeks the meetings were held in the small halls and club rooms of various societies and orders in obscure portions of the city  the forces of privilege and corruption were not much alarmed perry blackwood accused the newspapers of having agreed to a conspiracy of silence but as judah b tallant remarked it was the business of the press to give the public what it wanted and the public as yet hadnt shown much interest in the struggle being waged in its behalf when the meetings began to fill up it would be time to report them in the columns of the era meanwhile however the city had been quietly visited by an enterprising representative of a new york periodical of the new type that developed with the opening years of the centuryone making a specialty of passionate muckraking and since the people of america love nothing better than being startled yardleys weekly had acquired a circulation truly fabulous the emissary of the paper had attended several of the citizens meetings interviewed it seemed many persons the result was a revelation to make the blood of politicians capitalists and corporation lawyers run cold i remember very well the day it appeared on our news stands and the heated denunciations it evoked at the boyne club ralph hambleton was the only one who took it calmly who seemed to derive a certain enjoyment from the affair had he been a less privileged person they would have put him in chancery leonard dickinson asserted that yardleys should be sued for libel  theres just one objection to that said ralph  what asked the banker  it isnt libel  i defy them to prove it dickinson snapped its a dd outrage there isnt a city or village in the country that hasnt exactly the same conditions there isnt any other way to run a city  thats what mr krebs says ralph replied that the people ought to put judd jason officially in charge he tells em that jason is probably a more efficient man than democracy will be able to evolve in a coons age that we ought to take him over instead of letting the capitalists have him  did krebs say that dickinson demanded  you cant have read the article very thoroughly leonard ralph commented im afraid you only picked out the part of it that compliments you this fellow seems to have been struck by krebs says hes a coming man that hes making original contributions to the peoples cause quite a tribute you ought to read it  dickinson who had finished his lunch got up and left the table after lighting his cigar ralphs look followed him amusedly  im afraid its time to cash in and be good he observed  well get that fellow krebs yet said grierson wrathfully miller gorse alone made no remarks but in spite of his silence he emanated an animosity against reform and reformers that seemed to charge the very atmosphere and would have repressed any man but ralph  i sat in my room at the club that night and reread the article and if its author could have looked into my soul and observed the emotions he had set up he would no doubt have experienced a grim satisfaction for i too had come in for a share of the comment portions of the matter referring to me stuck in my brain like tar such as the reference to my father to the honoured traditions of the parets and the brecks which i had deliberately repudiated i had less excuse than many others the part i had played in various reprehensible transactions such as the riverside franchise and the dummy telephone company affair was dwelt upon and i was dismissed with the laconic comment that i was a graduate of harvard  my associates and myself were referred to collectively as a gang with the name of our city prefixed we were linked up with and compared to the gangs of other citiesthe terminology used to describe us being that of the police reporter we operated like burglars we looted only it was intimated in one place secondstory men were angels compared to us who had never seen the inside of a penitentiary here we were all arraigned before the bar of public opinion the relentless dickinson the surfeited scherer the rapacious grierson the salacious tallant i have forgotten what miller gorse was called nothing so classic as a minotaur judd jason was a hairy spider who spread his net and lurked in darkness for his victims every adjective was called upon to do its duty even theodore watling did not escape but it was intimated that he would be dealt with in another connection in a future number  the article had a crude and terrifying power and the pain it aroused following almost immediately upon the suffering caused by my separation from nancy was cumulative in character and effect seeming actively to reenforce the unwelcome conviction i had been striving to suppress that the world which had long seemed so acquiescent in conforming itself to my desires was turning against me  though my hunger for nancy was still gnawing i had begun to fear that i should never get her now and the fact that she would not even write to me seemed to confirm this  then there was matthewi could not bear to think that he would ever read that article  in vain i tried that night to belittle to myself its contentions and probable results to summon up the heart to fight in vain i sought to reconstruct the point of view to gain something of that renewed hope and power of devotion to a cause i had carried away from washington after my talk with theodore watling he though stricken had not wavered in his faith why should i  whether or not as the result of the article in yardleys which had been read more or less widely in the city the campaign of the citizens union gained ground and people began to fill the little halls to hear krebs who was a candidate for district attorney evidently he was entertaining and rousing them for his reputation spread and some of the larger halls were hired dickinson and gorse became alarmed and one morning the banker turned up at the club while i was eating my breakfast  look here hugh he said we may as well face the fact that weve got a fight ahead of uswell have to start some sort of a backfire right away  you think greenhalge has a chance of being elected i asked  im not afraid of greenhalge but of this fellow krebs we cant afford to have him district attorney to let a demagogue like him get a start the men the republicans and democrats have nominated are worse than useless parks is no good and neither is macguire if only we could have foreseen this thing we might have had better candidates put upbut theres no use crying over spilt milk youll have to go on the stump hughthats all there is to it you can answer him and the newspapers will print your speeches in full besides it will help you when it comes to the senatorship  the mood of extreme dejection that had followed the appearance of the article in yardleys did not last i had acquired aggressiveness an aggressiveness however differing in quality from the feeling i once would have hadfor this arose from resentment not from belief it was impossible to live in the atmosphere created by the men with whom i associatedespecially at such a timewithout imbibing something of the emotions animating themeven though i had been free from these emotions myself i too had begun to be filled with a desire for revenge and when this desire was upon me i did not have in my mind a pack of reformers or even the writer of the article in yardleys i thought of hermann krebs he was my persecutor it seemed to me that he always had been  well ill make speeches if you like i said to dickinson  im glad he replied were all agreed gorse and the rest of us that you ought to weve got to get some ginger into this fight and a good deal more money im afraid jason sends word well need more by the way hugh i wish youd drop around and talk to jason and get his idea of how the land lies  i went this time in the company of judah b tallant naturally we didnt expect to see mr jason perturbed nor was he he seemed to be in an odd rather exultant moodif he can be imagined as exultant we were not long in finding out what pleased himnothing less than the fact that mr krebs had proposed him for mayor  dd if i wouldnt make a good one too he said dd if i wouldnt show em what a real mayor is  i guess theres no danger of your ever being mayor judd tallant observed with a somewhat uneasy jocularity  i guess there isnt judah replied the boss quickly but with a peculiar violet flash in his eyes they wont ever make you mayor either if i can help it and ive a notion i can id rather see krebs mayor  you dont think he meant to propose you seriously tallant exclaimed  im not a dd fool said the boss but ill say this that he half meant it krebs has a headpiece on him and i tell you if any of this reform dope is worth anything his is theres some sense in what hes talking and if all the voters was like him you might get a man like me for mayor but theyre not and i guess they never will be  sure said mr jason the people are dottythere aint one in ten thousand understands what hes driving at when he gets off things like that they take it on the level  tallant reflected  by gum i believe youre right he said you think they will blow up he added  krebs is the whole show i tell you they wouldnt be anywhere without him the yaps that listen to him dont understand him but somehow he gets under their skins have you seen him lately  never saw him replied tallant  well if you had youd know he was a sick man  sick i exclaimed how do you know  its my business to know things said judd jason and added to tallant that your reporters dont find out  whats the matter with him tallant demanded a slight exultation in his tone did not escape me  youve got me there said jason but i have it pretty straight any one of your reporters will tell you that he looks sick  the era took mr jasons advice and began to publish those portions of krebss speeches that were seemingly detrimental to his own cause other conservative newspapers followed suit  both tallant and i were surprised to hear these sentiments out of the mouth of mr jason  you dont think that crowds going to win do you asked the owner of the era a trifle uneasily  win exclaimed the boss contemptuously theyll blow up and youll never hear of em im not saying we wont need a littlepowder he addedwhich was one of the matters we had come to talk about he gave us likewise a very accurate idea of the state of the campaign mentioning certain things that ought to be done you ought to print some of krebss speeches judah like what he said about me theyre talking it all around that youre afraid to  print things like his proposal to make you mayor  the information that i was to enter the lists against krebs was received with satisfaction and approval by those of our friends who were called in to assist at a council of war in the directors room of the corn national bank i was flattered by the confidence these men seemed to have in my ability all were in a state of anger against the reformers none of them seriously alarmed as to the actual outcome of the campaignespecially when i had given them the opinion of mr jason what disturbed them was the possible effect upon the future of the spread of heretical socialistic doctrines and it was decided to organize a publicity bureau independently of the two dominant political parties to be in charge of a certain new york journalist who made a business of such affairs who was to be paid a sum commensurate with the emergency he was to have carte blanche even in the editorial columns of our newspapers he was also to flood the city with literature we had fought many wars before this and we planned our campaign precisely as though we were dealing with one of those rebellions in the realm of finance of which i have given an instance but now the war chest of our opponents was negligible and we were comforted by the thought that however disagreeable the affair might be while it lasted in the long run capital was invincible  before setting to work to prepare my speeches it was necessary to make an attempt to familiarize myself with the seemingly unprecedented line of argument krebs had evolvedapparently as disconcerting to his friends as to his opponents it occurred to me since i did not care to attend krebss meetings to ask my confidential stenographer miss mccoy to go to turners hall and take down one of his speeches verbatim miss mccoy had never intruded on me her own views and i took for granted that they coincided with my own  id like to get an accurate record of what he is saying i told her do you mind going  no ill be glad to go mr paret she said quietly  hes doing more harm than we thought i remarked after a moment ive known him for a good many years hes clever hes sowing seeds of discontent starting trouble that will be very serious unless it is headed off  miss mccoy made no comment  before noon the next day she brought in the speech neatly typewritten and laid it on my desk looking up and catching her eye just as she was about to withdraw i was suddenly impelled to askwell what did you think of it  she actually flushed for the first time in my dealings with her betraying a feeling which i am sure she deemed most unprofessional  i liked it mr paret she replied simply and i knew that she had understated it was quite apparent that krebs had captivated her i tried not to betray my annoyance  was there a good audience i asked  yes she said  how many do you think  she hesitated  it isnt a very large hall you know i should say it would hold about eight hundred people  andit was fulli persisted  oh yes there were numbers of people standing  i thought i detected in her tonealthough it was not apologetica desire to spare my feelings she hesitated a moment more and then left the room closing the door softly behind her  presently i took up the pages and began to read the language was simple and direct an appeal to common sense yet the words strangely seemed charged with an emotional power that i found myself resisting when at length i laid down the sheets i wondered whether it were imagination or the uncomfortable result of memories of conversations i had had with him  i was however confronted with the task of refuting his arguments but with exasperating ingenuity he seemed to have taken the wind out of our sails it is difficult to answer a man who denies the cardinal principle of american democracythat a good mayor or a governor may be made out of a dogcatcher he called this the cincinnatus theory that any american because he was an american was fit for any job in the gift of state or city or government from sheriff to ambassador to great britain krebs substituted for this fallacy what may be called the doctrine of potentiality if we inaugurated and developed a system of democratic education based on scientific principles and caught the dogcatcher young enough he might become a statesman or thinker or scientist and make his contribution to the welfare and progress of the nation again he might not but he would have had his chance he would not be in a position to complain  here was a doctrine i immediately perceived which it would be suicidal to attempt to refute it ought indeed to have been my line with a growing distaste i began to realize that all there was left for me was to flatter a populace that krebs paradoxically belaboured never in the history of american uplift had an electorate been in this manner wooed upbraided for expediency a proneness to demand immediate results an unwillingness to think yes and an inability to think straight such an electorate deserved to be led around by the nose by the jasons and dickinsons the gorses and the griersons and the parets  yes he had mentioned me that gave me a queer sensation how is one to handle an opponent who praises one with a delightful irony we the dickinsons griersons parets jasons etc had this virtue at least and it was by no means the least of the virtuesthat we did think we had a plan a theory of government and we carried it out he was inclined to believe that morality consisted largely if not wholly in clear thinking and not in the precepts of the sundayschool that was the trouble with the socalled reform campaigns they were conducted on lines of sundayschool morality the people worked themselves up into a sort of revivalist frenzy an emotional state which if the truth were told was thoroughly immoral unreasonable and hypocritical like all frenzies as a matter of course it died down after the campaign was over moreover the american people had shown that they were unwilling to make any sacrifices for the permanent betterment of conditions and as soon as their incomes began to fall off they turned again to the bosses and capitalists like an abject flock of sheep  he went on to explain that he wasnt referring now to that part of the electorate known as the labour element the men who worked with their hands in mills factories etc they had their faults yet they possessed at least the virtue of solidarity a willingness to undergo sacrifices in order to advance the standard of conditions they too had a tenacity of purpose and a plan such as it was which the small business men the clerks lacked  we must wake up to the fact that we shouldnt get utopia by turning out mr jason and the highly efficient gentlemen who hired and financed him it wasnt so simple as that utopia was not an achievement after all but an undertaking a state of mind the continued overcoming of resistance by a progressive education and effort and all this talk of political and financial wickedness was rubbish the wickedness they complained of did not reside merely in individuals it was a social disorder or rather an order that no longer suited social conditions if the socalled good citizens would take the trouble to educate themselves to think instead of allowing their thinking to be done for them they would see that the evils which had been published broadcast were merely the symptoms of that disease which had come upon the social body through their collective neglect and indifference they held up their hands in horror at the spectacle of a commercial licensed prostitution they shunned the prostitute and the criminal but there was none of us if honest who would not exclaim when he saw them there but for the grace of god go i what we still called sin was largely the result of lack of opportunity and the active principle of society as at present organized tended more and more to restrict opportunity lack of opportunity lack of proper nutritionthese made sinners by the wholesale made too ninetenths of the inefficient of whom we selfrighteously complained we had a national philosophy that measured prosperity in dollars and cents included in this measurement the profits of liquor dealers who were responsible for most of our idiots so long as we set our hearts on that kind of prosperity so long as we failed to grasp the simple and practical fact that the greatest assets of a nation are healthy and sane and educated clearthinking human beings just so long was prostitution logical riverside franchises traction deals judd jasons and the respectable gentlemen who continued to fill their coffers out of the public purse inevitable  the speaker turned his attention to the respectable gentlemen with the full coffers amongst whom i was by implication included we had simply succeeded under the rules to which society tacitly agreed that was our sin he ventured to say that there were few men in the hall who at the bottom of their hearts did not envy and even honour our success he for one did not deem these respectable gentlemen utterly reprehensible he was sufficiently emancipated to be sorry for us he suspected that we were not wholly happy in being winners in such a gamehe even believed that we could wish as much as any others to change the game and the prizes what we represented was valuable energy misdirected and misplaced and in a reorganized community he would not abolish us but transform us transform at least the individuals of our type who were the builders gone wrong under the influence of an outworn philosophy we might be made to serve the city and the state with the same effectiveness that we had served ourselves  if the best among the scientists among the university professors and physicians were willing to labourand they werefor the advancement of humanity for the very love of the work and service without disproportionate emoluments without the accumulation of a wealth difficult to spend why surely these big business men had been moulded in infancy from no different clay all were americans instance after instance might be cited of business men and lawyers of ability making sacrifices giving up their personal affairs in order to take places of honour in the government in which the salary was comparatively small proving that even these were open to inducements other than merely mercenary ones  it was unfortunate he went on but true that the vast majority of people of voting age in the united states today who thought they had been educated were under the obligation to reeducate themselves he suggested whimsically a vacation school for congress and all legislative bodies as a starter until the fact of the utter inadequacy of the old education were faced there was little or no hope of solving the problems that harassed us one thing was certainthat they couldnt be solved by a ruleofthumb morality coincident with the appearance of these new and mighty problems perhaps in response to them a new and saner view of life itself was being developed by the worlds thinkers new sciences were being evolved correlated sciences a psychology making a truer analysis of human motives impulses of human possibilities an economics and a theory of government that took account of this psychology and of the vast changes applied science had made in production and distribution we lived in a new world which we sought to ignore and the new education the new viewpoint was in truth nothing but religion made practical it had never been thought practical before the motive that compelled men to work for humanity in science in medicine in artyes and in business if we took the right view of it was the religious motive the application of religion was today extending from the individual to society no religion that did not fill the needs of both was a true religion  this meant the development of a new culture one to be founded on the american tradition of equality of opportunity but culture was not a weed that grew overnight it was a leaven that spread slowly and painfully first inoculating a few who suffered and often died for it that it might gradually affect the many the spread of culture implied the recognition of leadership democratic leadership but still leadership leadership and the wisdom it implied did not reside in the people but in the leaders who sprang from the people and interpreted their needs and longings he went on to discuss a part of the programme of the citizens union  what struck me as i laid down the typewritten sheets was the extraordinary resemblance between the philosophies of hermann krebs and theodore watling onlykrebss philosophy was the bigger held the greater vision of the two i had reluctantly and rather bitterly to admit it the appeal of it had even reached and stirred me whose task was to refute it here indeed was something to fight forperhaps to die for as he had said and as i sat there in my office gazing out of the window i found myself repeating certain phrases he had usedthe phrase about leadership for instance it was a tremendous conception of democracy that of acquiescence to developed leadership made responsible a conception i was compelled to confess transcended mr watlings loyal as i was to him i began to reflect how novel all this was in a political speechalthough what i have quoted was in the nature of a preamble it was a sermon an educational sermon well that is what sermons always had beenand even now pretended to beeducational and stirring appealing to the emotions through the intellect it didnt read like the socialism he used to preach it had the ring of religion he had called it religion  with an effort of the will i turned from this ironical and dangerous vision of a hugh paret who might have been enlisted in an inspiring struggle of a modern yet unregenerate saul kicking against the pricks condemned to go forth breathing fire against a doctrine that made a true appeal against the man i believed i hated just because he had made this appeal in the act of summoning my counterarguments i was interrupted by the entrance of grierson he was calling on a matter of business but began to talk about the extracts from krebss speech he had read in the mail and state  what in hell is this fellow driving at paret he demanded it sounds to me like the ranting of a lunatic dervish if he thinks so much of us and the way we run the town whats he squawking about  i looked at grierson and conceived an intense aversion for him i wondered how i had ever been able to stand him to work with him i saw him in a sudden flash as a cunning cruel bird of prey a gorged drab vulture with beady eyes a resemblance so extraordinary that i wondered i had never remarked it before for he had the hooked vulture nose while the pink baldness of his head was relieved by a few scanty tufts of hair  the people seem to like what hes got to say i observed  it beats me said grierson they dont understand a quarter of itive been talking to some of em its their dd curiosity i guess you know how theyll stand for hours around a street fakir  its more than that i retorted  grierson regarded me piercingly  well well put a crimp in him all right he said with a laugh  i was in an unenviable state of mind when he left me i had an impulse to send for miss mccoy and ask her if she had understood what krebs was driving at but for reasons that must be fairly obvious i refrained i read over again that part of krebss speech which dealt with the immediate programme of the citizens union after paying a tribute to greenhalge as a man of common sense and dependability who would make a good mayor he went on to explain the principle of the new charter they hoped ultimately to get which should put the management of the city in the hands of one man an expert employed by a commission an expert whose duty it would be to conduct the affairs of the city on a business basis precisely as those of any efficient corporation were conducted this plan had already been adopted with encouraging results in several smaller cities of the country he explained in some detail with statistics the waste and inefficiency and dishonesty in various departments under the present system dwelling particularly upon the deplorable state of affairs in the city hospital  i need not dwell upon this portion of his remarks since then textbooks and serious periodicals have dealt with these matters thoroughly they are now familiar to all thinking americans     xxv  my entrance into the campaign was accompanied by a blare of publicity and during that fortnight i never picked up a morning or evening newspaper without reading on the first page some such headline as crowds flock to hear paret as a matter of fact the crowds did flock but i never quite knew as i looked down from platforms on seas of faces how much of the flocking was spontaneous much of it was so since the struggle had then become sufficiently dramatic to appeal to the larger public imagination that is but occasionally waked on the other hand the magic of advertising cannot be underestimated nor must the existence be ignored of an organized corps of shepherds under the vigilant direction of mr judd jason whose duty it was to see that none of our meetings was lacking in numbers and enthusiasm there was always a demonstrative gathering overflowing the sidewalk in front of the entrance swaying and cheering in the light of the street lamps and on the floor within an ample scattering of suspiciously blearyeyed voters to start the stamping and applauding in spite of these known facts the impression of popularity of repudiation of reform by a large majority of levelheaded inhabitants had reassuring and reenforcing effects  astute citizens spectators of the frayif indeed there were anymight have remarked an unique and significant feature of that campaign that the usual recriminations between the two great parties were lacking mr parks the republican candidate did not denounce mr macguire the democratic candidate republican and democratic speakers alike expended their breath in lashing mr krebs and the citizens union  it is difficult to record the fluctuations of my spirit when i was in the halls speaking or waiting to speak i reacted to that phenomenon known as mob psychology i became selfconfident even exhilarated and in those earlier speeches i managed i think to strike the note for which i strovethe judicial note suitable to a lawyer of weight and prominence of deprecation rather than denunciation i sought to embody and voice a fine and calm sanity at a time when everyone else seemed in danger of losing their heads and to a large extent achieved it i had known mr krebs for more than twenty years and while i did not care to criticise a fellowmember of the bar i would go so far as to say that he was visionary that the changes he proposed in government would if adopted have grave and farreaching results we could not for instance support in idleness those who refused to do their share of the work of the world mr krebs was wellmeaning i refrained from dwelling too long upon him passing to mr greenhalge also wellmeaning but a man of mediocre ability who would make a mess of the government of a city which would one day rival new york and chicago loud cheers and i pointed out that mr perry blackwood had been unable to manage the affairs of the boyne street road such men wellintentioned though they might be were hindrances to progress this led me naturally to a discussion of the riverside franchise and the traction consolidation i was one of those whose honesty and good faith had been arraigned but i would not stoop to refute the accusations i dwelt upon the benefits to the city uniform service electricity and large comfortable cars instead of rattletrap conveyances and the development of a large and growing population in the riverside neighbourhood the continual extension of lines to suburban districts that enabled hardworked men to live out of the smoke i called attention to the system of transfers the distance a passenger might be conveyed and conveyed quickly for the sum of five cents i spoke of our capitalists as men more sinned against than sinning their money was always at the service of enterprises tending to the development of our metropolis  when i was not in the meetings however and especially when in my room at night i was continually trying to fight off a sense of loneliness that seemed to threaten to overwhelm me i wanted to be alone and yet i feared to be i was aware in spite of their congratulations on my efforts of a growing dislike for my associates and in the appalling emptiness of the moments when my depression was greatest i was forced to the realization that i had no disinterested friendnot onein whom i could confide nancy had failed me i had scarcely seen tom peters that winter and it was out of the question to go to him for the third time in my life and in the greatest crisis of all i was feeling the need of something of some sustaining and impelling power that must be presented humanly possessing sympathy and understanding and love i think i had a glimpse just a pathetic glimpseof what the church might be of human solidarity comfort and support of human tolerance if stripped of the superstition of an ancient science my tortures werent of the flesh but of the mind my mind was the sheep which had gone astray was there no such thing could there be no such thing as a human association that might at the same time be a divine organism a fold and a refuge for the lost and divided minds the source of all this trouble was social  then toward the end of that last campaign week madness suddenly came upon me i know now how near the breaking point i was but the immediate cause of my flying to piecesto use a vivid expressionwas a speech made by guptill one of the citizens union candidates for alderman a young man of a radical type not uncommon in these days though new to my experience an educated man in the ultraradical sense yet lacking poise and perspective with a certain brilliance and assurance he was a journalist a correspondent of some eastern newspapers and periodicals in this speech which was reported to mefor it did not get into the newspapersi was the particular object of his attack men of my kind and not the judd jasons for whom there was some excuse were the least dispensable tools of the capitalists the greatest menace to civilization we were absolutely lacking in principle we were ready at any time to besmirch our profession by legalizing steals we fouled our nests with dirty fees not all that he said was vituperation for he knew something of the modern theory of the law that legal radicals had begun to proclaim and even to teach in some tolerant universities  the next night in the middle of a prepared speech i was delivering to a large crowd in kingdom hall there had been jeers from a group in a corner at some assertion i made guptills accusations had been festering in my mind the faces of the people grew blurred as i felt anger boiling rising within me suddenly my control gave way and i launched forth into a denunciation of greenhalge krebs guptill and even of perry blackwood that must have been without license or bounds i can recall only fragments of my remarks greenhalge wanted to be mayor and was willing to put the stigma of slander on his native city in order to gain his ambition krebs had made a failure of his profession of everything save in bringing shame on the place of his adoption and on the single occasion heretofore when he had been before the public in the school board fiasco the officials indicted on his supposed evidence had triumphantly been vindicated guptill was gaining money and notoriety out of his spleen perry blackwood was acting out of spite i returned to krebs declaring that he would be the boss of the city if that ticket were elected demanding whether they wished for a boss an agitator itching for power and recognition  i was conscious at the moment only of a wild relief and joy in letting myself go feelings heightened by the clapping and cheers with which my characterizations were received the fact that the cheers were mingled with hisses merely served to drive me on at length when i had returned to krebs the hisses were redoubled angering me the more because of the evidence they gave of friends of his in my audiences perhaps i had made some of these friends for him a voice shouted out above the uproari know about krebs hes a dd sight better man than you and this started a struggle in a corner of the hall i managed somehow when the commotion had subsided to regain my poise and ended by uttering the conviction that the common sense of the community would repudiate the citizens union and all it stood for  but that night as i lay awake listening to the street noises and staring at the glint from a street lamp on the brass knob of my bedstead i knew that i had failed i had committed the supreme violation of the self that leads inevitably to its final dissolution even the exuberant headlines of the newspapers handed me by the club servant in the morning brought but little relief  on the saturday morning before the tuesday of election there was a conference in the directors room of the corn national the city reeked with smoke and acrid stale gas the electric lights were turned on to dispel the november gloom it was not a cheerful conference nor a confident one for the first time in a collective experience the men gathered there were confronted with a situation which they doubted their ability to control a situation for which there was no precedent they had to reckon with a new and unsolvable equation in politics and financethe independent voter there was an element of desperation in the discussion recriminations passed dickinson implied that gorse with all his knowledge of political affairs ought to have foreseen that something like this was sure to happen should have managed better the conventions of both great parties the railroad counsel retorted that it had been as much dickinsons fault as his grierson expressed a regret that i had broken out against the reformers it had reacted he saidand this was just enough to sting me to retaliate that things had been done in the campaign chiefly through his initiative that were not only unwise but might land some of us in the penitentiary if krebs were elected  well grierson exclaimed whether hes elected or not i wouldnt give much now for your chances of getting to the senate we cant afford to fly in the face of the dear public  a tense silence followed this remark in the street below the rumble of the traffic came to us muffled by the heavy plateglass windows i saw tallant glance at gorse and dickinson and i knew the matter had been decided between themselves that they had been merely withholding it from me until after election i was besmirched for the present at least  i think you will do me the justice gentlemen i remember saying slowly with the excessive and rather ridiculous formality of a man who is near the end of his tether that the idea of representing you in the senate was yours not mine you begged me to take the appointment against my wishes and my judgment i had no desire to go to washington then i have less today i have come to the conclusion that my usefulness to you is at an end  i got to my feet i beheld miller gorse sitting impassive with his encompassing stare the strongest man of them all a change of firmaments would not move him but dickinson had risen and put his hand on my shoulder it was the first time i had ever seen him white  hold on hugh he exclaimed i guess were all a little cantankerous today this confounded campaign has got on our nerves and we say things we dont mean you mustnt think were not grateful for the services youve rendered us were all in the same boat and there isnt a man whos been on our side of this fight who could take a political office at this time weve got to face that fact and i know you have the sense to see it too i for one wont be satisfied until i see you in the senate its where you belong and you deserve to be there you understand what the public is how it blows hot and cold and in a few years theyll be howling to get us back if these demagogues win  sure chimed in grierson who was frightened thats right hugh i didnt mean anything nobody appreciates you more than i do old man  tallant too added something and berringerive forgotten what i was tired too tired to meet their advances halfway i said that i had a speech to get ready for that night and other affairs to attend to and left them grouped together like crestfallen conspiratorsall save miller gorse whose pervasive gaze seemed to follow me after i had closed the door  an elevator took me down to the lobby of the corn bank building i paused for a moment aimlessly regarding the streams of humanity hurrying in and out streaking the white marble floor with the wet filth of the streets someone spoke my name it was bitter judd jasons legal tool and i permitted myself to be dragged out of the eddies into a quiet corner by the cigar stand  say i guess weve got krebss goat all right this time he told me confidentially in a voice a little above a whisper he was busy with the shirtwaist girls last year you remember when they were striking well one of em one of the strike leaders has taken to easy street shes agreed to send him a letter tonight to come round to her room after his meeting to say that shes sick and wants to see him hell go all right well have some fun well be ready for him do you get me so long the old mans waiting for me  it may seem odd that this piece of information did not produce an immediately revolting effect i knew that similar practices had been tried on krebs but this was the first time i had heard of a definite plan and from a man like bitter as i made my way out of the building i had indeed a nauseated feeling jasons lawyer was a dirty little man smelling of stale cigars with a blueblack unshaven face in spite of the shocking nature of his confidence he had actually not succeeded in deflecting the current of my thoughts these were still running over the scene in the directors room i had listened to him passively while he had held my buttonhole and he had detained me but an instant  when i reached the street i was wondering whether gorse and dickinson and the others grierson especially could possibly have entertained the belief that i would turn traitor i told myself that i had no intention of this how could i turn traitor and what would be the object revenge the nauseated feeling grew more acute reaching my office i shut the door sat down at my desk summoned my will and began to jot down random notes for the part of my speech i was to give the newspapers notes that were mere silly fragments of arguments i had once thought effective i could no more concentrate on them than i could have written a poem gradually like the smoke that settled down on our city until we lived in darkness at midday the horror of what bitter had told me began to pervade my mind until i was in a state of terror  had i hugh paret fallen to this that i could stand by consenting to an act which was worse than assassination was any cause worth it could any cause survive it but my attempts at reasoning might be likened to the strainings of a wayfarer lost on a mountain side to pick his way in the gathering dusk i had just that desperate feeling of being lost and with it went an acute sense of an imminent danger the ground no longer firm under my feet had become a sliding shale sloping toward an unseen precipice perhaps like the wayfarer my fears were the sharper for the memory of the beauty of the morning on that same mountain when filled with vigour i had gazed on it from the plain below and beheld the sun breaking through the mists  the necessity of taking some action to avert what i now realized as an infamy pressed upon me yet in conflict with the pressure of this necessity there persisted that old rebellion that bitterness which had been growing all these years against the man who above all others seemed to me to represent the forces setting at nought my achievements bringing me to this pass  i thought of appealing to leonard dickinson who surely if he knew of it would not permit this thing to be done and he was the only man with the possible exception of miller gorse who might be able to restrain judd jason but i delayed until after the luncheon hour when i called up the bank on the telephone to discover that it was closed i had forgotten that the day was saturday i was prepared to say that i would withdraw from the campaign warn krebs myself if this kind of tactics were not suppressed but i could not get the banker then i began to have doubts of dickinsons power in the matter judd jason had never been tractable by any means he had always maintained a considerable independence of the financial powers and today not only financial control but the dominance of jason himself was at stake he would fight for it to the last ditch and make use of any means no it was of no use to appeal to him what then well there was a reaction or an attempt at one krebs had not been born yesterday he had avoided the wiles of the politicians heretofore he wouldnt be fool enough to be taken in now i told myself that if i were not in a state bordering on a nervous breakdown i should laugh at such morbid fears i steadied myself sufficiently to dictate the extract from my speech that was to be published i was to make addresses at two halls alternating with parks the mayoralty candidate at four oclock i went back to my room in the club to try to get some rest  seddons hall the place of my first meeting was jammed that saturday night i went through my speech automatically as in a dream the habit of long years asserting itself and yetso i was told afterwardsmy delivery was not mechanical and i actually achieved more emphasis gave a greater impression of conviction than at any time since the night i had lost my control and violently denounced the reformers by some astonishing subconscious process i had regained my manner but the applause came to me as from a distance not only was my mind not there it did not seem to be anywhere i was dazed nor did i feelsave oncea fleeting surge of contempt for the mob below me with their silly faces upturned to mine there may have been intelligent expressions among them but they failed to catch my eye  i remember being stopped by grierson as i was going out of the side entrance he took my hand and squeezed it and there was on his face an odd surprised look  that was the best yet hugh he said  i went on past him looking back on that evening now it would almost seem as though the volition of another possessed me not my own seemingly i had every intention of going on to the national theatre in which parks had just spoken and as i descended the narrow stairway and emerged on the side street i caught sight of my chauffeur awaiting me by the curb  im not going to that other meeting i found myself saying im pretty tired  shall i drive you back to the club sir he inquired  noill walk back wait a moment i entered the ear turned on the light and scribbled a hasty note to andrews the chairman of the meeting at the national telling him that i was too tired to speak again that night and to ask one of the younger men there to take my place then i got out of the car and gave the note to the chauffeur  youre all right sir he asked with a note of anxiety in his voice he had been with me a long time  i reassured him he started the car and i watched it absently as it gathered speed and turned the corner i began to walk slowly at first then more and more rapidly until i had gained a breathless pace in ten minutes i was in west street standing in front of the templars hall where the meeting of the citizens union west in progress now that i had arrived there doubt and uncertainty assailed me i had come as it were in spite of myself thrust onward by an impulse i did not understand which did not seem to be mine what was i going to do the proceeding suddenly appeared to me as ridiculous tinged with the weirdness of somnambulism i revolted walked away got as far as the corner and stood beside a lamp post pretending to be waiting for a car the street lights were reflected in perpendicular wavyyellow ribbons on the wet asphalt and i stood staring with foolish intentness at this phenomenon wondering how a painter would get the effect in oils again i was walking back towards the hall combating the acknowledgment to myself that i had a plan a plan that i did not for a moment believe i would carry out i was shivering  i climbed the steps the wide vestibule was empty except for two men who stopped a lowtoned conversation to look at me i wondered whether they recognized me that i might be recognized was an alarming possibility which had not occurred to me  who is speaking i asked  mr krebs answered the taller man of the two  the hum of applause came from behind the swinging doors i pushed them open cautiously passing suddenly out of the cold into the reeking heated atmosphere of a building packed with human beings the space behind the rear seats was filled with men standing and those nearest glanced around with annoyance at the interruption of my entrance i made my way along the wall finally reaching a side aisle whence i could get sight of the platform and the speaker  i heard his words distinctly but at first lacked the faculty of stringing them together or rather of extracting their collective sense the phrases indeed were set ringing through my mind i found myself repeating them without any reference to their meaning i had reached the peculiar pitch of excitement that counterfeits abnormal calm and all sense of strangeness at being there in that meeting had passed away i began to wonder how i might warn krebs and presently decided to send him a note when he should have finished speakingbut i couldnt make up my mind whether to put my name to the note or not of course i neednt have entered the hall at all i might have sent in my note at the side door  i must have wished to see krebs to hear him speak to observe perhaps the effect on the audience in spite of my inability to take in what he was saying i was able to regard him objectivelyobjectively in a restricted sense i noticed that he had grown even thinner the flesh had fallen away from under his cheekbones and there were sharp deep almost perpendicular lines on either side of his mouth he was emaciated that was the word once in a while he thrust his hand through his dry ashy hair which was of a tone with the paleness of his face such was his only gesture  he spoke quietly leaning with one elbow against the side of his reading stand the occasional pulsations of applause were almost immediately hushed as though the people feared to lose even a word that should fall from his dry lips what was it he was talking about i tried to concentrate my attention with only partial success he was explaining the new theory of city government that did not attempt to evade but dealt frankly with the human needs of today and sought to meet those needs in a positive way what had happened to me though i did not realize it was that i had gradually come under the influence of a tragic spell not attributable to the words i heard existing independently of them pervading the spacious hall weaving into unity dissentient minds and then with what seemed a retarded rather than sudden awareness i knew that he had stopped speaking once more he ran his hand through his hair he was seemingly groping for words that would not come i was pierced by a strange agonythe amazing source of which seemed to be a smile on the face of hermann krebs an ineffable smile illuminating the place like a flash of light in which suffering and tragedy comradeship and loving kindnessall were mingled he stood for a moment with that smile on his faceswayed and would have fallen had it not been for the quickness of a man on the platform behind him and into whose arms he sank  in an instant people had risen in their seats men were hurrying down the aisles while a peculiar human murmur or wail persisted like an undertone beneath the confusion of noises striking the very note of my own feelings above the heads of those about me i saw krebs being carried off the platform the chairman motioned for silence and inquired if there were a physician in the audience and then all began to talk at once the man who stood beside me clutched my arm  i hope he isnt dead say did you see that smile my god ill never forget it  the exclamation poignantly voiced the esteem in which krebs was held as i was thrust along out of the hall by the ebb of the crowd still other expressions of this esteem came to me in fragments expressions of sorrow and dismay of a loyalty i had not imagined mingled with these were occasional remarks of skeptics shaken in human fashion by the suggestion of the inevitable end that never fails to sober and terrify humanity  i guess he was a bigger man than we thought there was a lot of sense in what he had to say  there sure was the companion of this speaker answered  they spoke of him in the past tense i was seized and obsessed by the fear that i should never see him again and at the same moment i realized sharply that this was the one thing i wantedto see him i pushed through the people gained the street and fairly ran down the alley that led to the side entrance of the hall where a small group was gathered under the light that hung above the doorway there stood on the step a little above the others a young man in a grey flannel shirt evidently a mechanic i addressed him  what does the doctor say  before replying he surveyed me with surprise and i think with instinctive suspicion of my clothes and bearing  what can he say he retorted  you mean i began  i mean mr krebs oughtnt never to have gone into this campaign he answered relenting a trifle perhaps at the tone of my voice he knew it too and some of us fellows tried to stop him but we couldnt do nothing with him he added dejectedly  what isthe trouble i asked  they tell me its his heart he wouldnt talk about it  when i think of what he done for our union exclaimed a thickset man plainly a steel worker hes just wore himself out fighting that crooked gang he stared with sudden aggressiveness at me havent i seen you somewheres he demanded  a denial was on my lips when the sharp sinister strokes of a bell were heard coming nearer  its the ambulance said the man on the step  glancing up the alley beyond the figures of two policemen who had arrived and were holding the people back i saw the hood of the conveyance as it came to a halt and immediately a hospital doctor and two assistants carrying a stretcher hurried towards us and we made way for them to enter after a brief interval they were heard coming slowly down the steps inside by the white cruel light of the arc i saw krebs lying motionless i laid hold of one of the men who had been on the platform he did not resent the act he seemed to anticipate my question  hes conscious the doctors expect him to rally when he gets to the hospital  i walked back to the club to discover that several inquiries had been made about me reporters had been there republican headquarters had telephoned to know if i were ill leaving word that i was not to be disturbed under any circumstances i went to my room and spent most of the night in distracted thought when at last morning came i breakfasted early searching the newspapers for accounts of the occurrence at templars hall and the fact that these were neither conspicuous nor circumstantial was in the nature of a triumph of selfcontrol on the part of editors and reporters news however sensational had severely to be condensed in the interest of a cause and at this critical stage of the campaign to make a tragic hero of hermann krebs would have been the height of folly there were a couple of paragraphs giving the gist of his speech and a statement at the end that he had been taken ill and conveyed to the presbyterian hospital  the hospital itself loomed up before me that sunday morning as i approached it along ballantyne street a diluted sunshine washing the extended businesslike facade of grimy yellow brick we were proud of that hospital in the city and many of our foremost citizens had contributed large sums of money to the building scarcely ten years old it had been one of maudes interests i was ushered into the reception room where presently came the physician in charge a dr castle one of those quietmannered modern young medical men who bear on their persons the very stamp of efficiency of the dignity of a scientific profession his greeting implied that he knew all about me his presence seemed to increase the agitation i tried not to betray and must have betrayed  can i do anything for you mr paret he asked  i have come to inquire about mr krebs who was brought here last night i believe  i was aware for an instant of his penetrating professional glance the only indication of the surprise he must have felt that hermann krebs of all men should be the object of my solicitude  why we sent him home this morning nineteen twenty six fowler street he wanted to go and there was no use in his staying  he will recover i asked  the physician shook his head gazing at me through his glasses  he may live a month mr paret he may die tomorrow he ought never to have gone into this campaign he knew he had this trouble hepburn warned him three months ago and theres no man who knows more about the heart than hepburn  then theres no hope i asked  absolutely none its a great pity he added after a moment mr krebs was a remarkable man  nineteen twentysix fowler street i repeated  yes  i held out my hand mechanically and he pressed it and went with me to the door  nineteen twentysix fowler street he repeated  the mean and sordid aspect of fowler street emphasized and seemed to typify my despair the pungent coal smoke stifled my lungs even as it stifled my spirit ugly factories which were little more than sweatshops wore an empty menacing sunday look and the faint november sunlight glistened on dirty pavements where children were making a semblance of play monotonous rows of red houses succeeded one another some pushed forward others thrust back behind little plots of stamped earth into one of these i turned it seemed a little cleaner better kept less sordid than the others i pulled the bell and presently the door was opened by a woman whose arms were bare to the elbow she wore a bluechecked calico apron that came to her throat but the apron was clean and her firm though furrowed face gave evidences of recent housewifely exertions her eyes had the strange look of the cheerfulness that is intimately acquainted with sorrow she did not seem surprised at seeing me  i have come to ask about mr krebs i told her  oh yes she said theres been so many here this morning already its wonderful how people love him all kinds of people no sir he dont seem to be in any pain two gentlemen are up there now in his room i mean  she wiped her arms which still bore traces of soapsuds and then with a gesture natural and unashamed lifted the corner of her apron to her eyes  do you think i could see himfor a moment i asked ive known him for a long time  why i dont know she said i guess so the doctor said he could see some and he wants to see his friends thats not strangehe always did ill ask will you tell me your name  i took out a card she held it without glancing at it and invited me in  i waited unnerved and feverish pulsing in the dark and narrow hall beside the flimsy rack where several coats and hats were hung once before i had visited krebs in that lodginghouse in cambridge long ago with something of the same feelings but now they were greatly intensified now he was dying  the woman was descending  he says he wants to see you sir she said rather breathlessly and i followed her in the semidarkness of the stairs i passed the three men who had been with krebs and when i reached the open door of his room he was alone i hesitated just a second swept by the heat wave that follows sudden shyness embarrassment a sense of folly it is too late to avert  krebs was propped up with pillows  well this is good of you he said and reached out his hand across the spread i took it and sat down beside the shiny oak bedstead in a chair covered with tobaccocolored plush  you feel better i asked  oh i feel all right he answered with a smile its queer but i do  my eye fell upon the long line of sectional bookcases that lined one side of the room why youve got quite a library here i observed  yes ive managed to get together some good books but there is so much to read nowadays so much that is really good and new a man has the hopeless feeling he can never catch up with it all a thousand writers and students are making contributions today where fifty years ago there was one  ive been following your speeches after a fashioni wish i might have been able to read more of them your argument interested me its new unlike the ordinary propaganda of  of agitators he supplied with a smile  of agitators i agreed and tried to return his smile an agitator who appears to suggest the foundations of a constructive programme and who isnt afraid to criticise the man with a vote as well as the capitalist is an unusual phenomenon  oh when we realize that weve only got a little time left in which to tell what we think to be the truth it doesnt require a great deal of courage paret i didnt begin to see this thing until a little while ago i was only a crude hotheaded revolutionist god knows im crude enough still but i began to have a glimmering of what all these new fellows in the universities are driving at he waved his hand towards the bookcases driving at collectively i mean and there are attempts worthy attempts to coordinate and synthesize the sciences what i have been saying is not strictly original i took it on the stump thats all i didnt expect it to have much effect in this campaign but it was an opportunity to sow a few seeds to start a sense of personal dissatisfaction in the minds of a few voters what is it browning says its in bishop blougram i believe when the fight begins within himself a mans worth something its an intellectual fight of course  his words were spoken quietly but i realized suddenly that the mysterious force which had drawn me to him now against my will was an intellectual rather than apparently sentimental one an intellectual force seeming to comprise within it all other human attractions and yet i felt a sudden contrition  see here krebs i said i didnt come here to bother you about these matters to tire you i mustnt stay ill call in again to see how you arefrom time to time  but youre not tiring me he protested stretching forth a thin detaining hand i dont want to rot i want to live and think as long as i can to tell you the truth paret ive been wishing to talk to youim glad you came in  youve been wishing to talk to me i said  yes but i didnt expect youd come in i hope you wont mind my saying so under the circumstances but ive always rather liked you admired you even back in the cambridge days after that i used to blame you for going out and taking what you wanted and i had to live a good many years before i began to see that its better for a man to take what he wants than to take nothing at all i took what i wanted every man worth his salt does theres your great banker friend in new york whom i used to think was the archfiend he took what he wanted and he took a good deal but it happened to be good for him and by piling up his corporations ossa on pelion he is paving the way for a logical economic evolution how can a man in our time find out what he does want unless he takes something and gives it a trial  until he begins to feel that it disagrees with him i said but then i added involuntarily then it may be too late to try something else and he may not know what to try this remark of mine might have surprised me had it not been for the feelingnow grown definitethat krebs had something to give me something to pass on to me of all men indeed he had hinted as much when he acknowledged a wish to talk to me what seems so strange i said as i looked at him lying back on his pillows is your faith that we shall be able to bring order out of all this chaosyour belief in democracy  democracys an adventure he replied the great adventure of mankind i think the trouble in many minds lies in the fact that they persist in regarding it as something to be made safe all that can be done is to try to make it as safe as possible but no adventure is safelife itself is an adventure and neither is that safe its a hazard as you and i have found out the moment we try to make life safe we lose all there is in it worth while  i thought a moment  yes thats so i agreed on the table beside the bed in company with two or three other volumes lay a bible he seemed to notice that my eye fell upon it  do you remember the story of the prodigal son he asked well thats the parable of democracy of selfgovernment in the individual and in society in order to arrive at salvation paret most of us have to take our journey into a far country  a far country i exclaimed the words struck a reminiscent chord  we have to leave what seem the safe things we have to wander and suffer in order to realize that the only true safety lies in development we have first to cast off the leading strings of authority its a delusion that we can insure ourselves by remaining within its wallswe have to risk our lives and our souls it is discouraging when we look around us today and in a way the pessimists are right when they say we dont see democracy we see only what may be called the first stage of it for democracy is still in a far country eating the husks of individualism materialism what we see is not true freedom but freedom run to riot men struggling for themselves spending on themselves the fruits of their inheritance we see a government intent on one object aloneexploitation of this inheritance in order to achieve what it calls prosperity and god is far away  andwe shall turn i asked  we shall turn or perish i believe that we shall turn he fixed his eyes on my face what is it he asked that brought you here to me today  i was silent  the motive paretthe motive that sends us all wandering into is divine is inherited from god himself and the same motive after our eyes shall have been opened after we shall have seen and known the tragedy and misery of life after we shall have made the mistakes and committed the sins and experienced the emptinessthe same motive will lead us back again that too is an adventure the greatest adventure of all because when we go back we shall not find the same godor rather we shall recognize him in ourselves autonomy is godliness knowledge is godliness we went away cringing superstitious we saw everywhere omens and evidences of his wrath in the earth and sea and sky we burned candles and sacrificed animals in the vain hope of averting scourges and other calamities but when we come back it will be with a knowledge of his ways gained at a pricethe price he too must have paidand we shall be able to stand up and look him in the face and all our childish superstitions and optimisms shall have been burned away  some faith indeed had given him strength to renounce those things in life i had held dear driven him on to fight until his exhausted body failed him and even now that he was physically helpless sustained him i did not ask myself then the nature of this faith in its presence it could no more be questioned than the light it was light i felt bathed in it now it was soft suffused but i remembered how the night before in the hall just before he had fallen it had flashed forth in a smile and illumined my soul with an ecstasy that yet was anguish  we shall get back i said at length my remark was not a questionit had escaped from me almost unawares  the joy is in the journey he answered the secret is in the search  but for me i exclaimed  weve all been lost paret it would seem as though we have to be  and yet you aresaved i said hesitating over the word  it is true that i am content even happy he asserted in spite of my wish to live if there is any secret it lies i think in the struggle for an open mind in the keeping alive of a desire to know more and more that desire strangely enough hasnt lost its strength we dont know whether there is a future life but if there is i think it must be a continuation of this he paused i told you i was glad you came inive been thinking of you and i saw you in the hall last night you ask what there is for youill tell youthe new generation  the new generation  thats the task of every man and woman who wakes up ive come to see how little can be done for the great majority of those who have reached our age its hardbut its true superstition sentiment the habit of wrong thinking or of not thinking at all have struck in too deep the habit of unreasoning acceptance of authority is too paralyzing some may be stung back into life spurred on to find out what the world really is but not many the hope lies in those who are coming after uswe must do for them what wasnt done for us we really didnt have much of a chance paret what did our instructors at harvard know about the age that was dawning what did anybody know you can educate yourselfor rather reeducate yourself all thisand he waved his hand towards his bookshelvesall this has sprung up since you and i were at cambridge if we dont try to become familiar with it if we fail to grasp the point of view from which its written theres little hope for us go away from all this and get straightened out make yourself acquainted with the modern trend in literature and criticism with modern history find out whats being done in the field of education read the modern sciences especially biology and psychology and sociology and try to get a glimpse of the fundamental human needs underlying such phenomena as the labour and womans movements god knows ive just begun to get my glimpse and ive floundered around ever since i left college i dont mean to say we can ever see the whole but we can get a clew an idea and pass it on to our children you have children havent you  yes i said  he said nothinghe seemed to be looking out of the window  then the scientific point of view in your opinion hasnt done away with religion i asked presently  the scientific point of view is the religious point of view he said earnestly because its the only selfrespecting point of view i cant believe that god intended to make a creature who would not ultimately weigh his beliefs with his reason instead of accepting them blindly thats immoral if you likeespecially in these days  and are there then no overbeliefs i said remembering the expression in something i had read  that seems to me a relic of the method of ancient science which was upside downa mere confusion with faith faith and belief are two different things faith is the emotion the steam if you like that drives us on in our search for truth theories at a stretch might be identified with overbeliefs but when it comes to confusing our theories with facts instead of recognizing them as theories when it comes to living by overbeliefs that have no basis in reason and observed factsthat is fatal its just the trouble with so much of our electorate todayunreasoning acceptance without thought  then i said you admit of no other faculty than reason  i confess that i dont a great many insights that we seem to get from what we call intuition i think are due to the reason which is unconsciously at work if there were another faculty that equalled or transcended reason it seems to me it would be a very dangerous thing for the worlds progress wed come to rely on it rather than on ourselves the trouble with the world is that it has been relying on it reason is the mindit leaps to the stars without realizing always how it gets there it is through reason we get the selfreliance that redeems us  but you i exclaimed you rely on something else besides reason  yes it is true he explained gently but that thing otherthanourselves we feel stirring in us is power and that power or the source of it seems to have given us our reason for guidanceif it were not so we shouldnt have a semblance of freedom for there is neither virtue nor development in finding the path if we are guided we do rely on that power for movementand in the moments when it is withdrawn we are helpless both the power and the reason are gods  but the church i was moved by some untraced thought to ask you believe there is a future for the church  a church of all those who disseminate truth foster openmindedness serve humanity and radiate faith he repliedbut as though he were speaking to himself not to me  a few moments later there was a knock at the door and the woman of the house entered to say that dr hepburn had arrived i rose and shook krebss hand sheer inability to express my emotion drove me to commonplaces  ill come in soon again if i may i told him  do paret he said its done me good to talk to youmore good than you imagine  i was unable to answer him but i glanced back from the doorway to see him smiling after me on my way down the stairs i bumped into the doctor as he ascended the dingy brown parlour was filled with men standing in groups and talking in subdued voices i hurried into the street and on the sidewalk stopped face to face with perry blackwood  hugh he exclaimed what are you doing here  i came to inquire for krebs i answered ive seen him  youyouve been talking to him perry demanded  i nodded he stared at me for a moment with an astonishment to which i was wholly indifferent he did not seem to know just how to act  well it was decent of you hugh i must say how does he seem  not at all likelike what youd expect in his manner  no agreed perry agitatedly no he wouldnt my god weve lost a big man in him  i think we have i said  he stared at me again gave me his hand awkwardly and went into the house it was not until i had walked the length of the block that i began to realize what a shock my presence there must have been to him with his head full of the contrast between this visit and my former attitude could it be that it was only the night before i had made a speech against him and his associates it is interesting that my mind rejected all sense of anomaly and inconsistency krebs possessed me i must have been in reality extremely agitated but this sense of being possessed seemed a quiet one an amazing thing had happenedand yet i was not amazed the krebs i had seen was the man i had known for many years the man i had ridiculed despised and oppressed but it seemed to me then that he had been my friend and intimate all my life more than that i had an odd feeling he had always been a part of me and that now had begun to take place a merging of personality nor could i feel that he was a dying man he would live on  i could not as yet sort and appraise reduce to order the possessions he had wished to turn over to me  it was noon and people were walking past me in the watery diluted sunlight men in black coats and top hats and women in bizarre complicated costumes bright with colour i had reached the more respectable portion of the city where the churches were emptying these very people whom not long ago i would have acknowledged as my own kind now seemed mildly animated automatons wax figures the day was like hundreds of sundays i had known the city familiar yet passing strange i walked like a ghost through it     xxvi  accompanied by young dr strafford i went to california my physical illness had been brief dr brooke had taken matters in his own hands and ordered an absolute rest after dwelling at some length on the vicious pace set by modern business and the lack of consideration and knowledge shown by men of affairs for their bodies there was a limit to the wrack and strain which the human organism could stand he must of course have suspected the presence of disturbing and disintegrating factors but he confined himself to telling me that only an exceptional constitution had saved me from a serious illness he must in a way have comprehended why i did not wish to go abroad and have my family join me on the riviera as tom peters proposed california had been my choice and dr brooke recommended the climate of santa barbara  high up on the montecito hills i found a villa beside the gateway of one of the deep canons that furrow the mountain side and day after day i lay in a chair on the sunny terrace with a continually recurring amazement at the brilliancy of my surroundings in the early morning i looked down on a feathery mist hiding the world a mist presently to be shot with silver and sapphireblue dissolved by slow enchantment until there lay revealed the plain and the shimmering ocean with its distant islands trembling in the haze at sunset my eyes sought the mountains mountains unreal like glorified scenery of grand opera with violet shadows in the wooded canon clefts and crags of pink tourmaline and ruby against the skies all day long in the tempered heat flowers blazed around me insects hummed lizards darted in and out of the terrace wall birds flashed among the checkered shadows of the live oaks that grove of gnarled oaks summoned up before me visions of some classic villa poised above grecian seas shining amidst dark foliage the refuge of forgotten kings below me on the slope the spaced orange trees were heavy with golden fruit  after a while as i grew stronger i was driven down and allowed to walk on the wide beach that stretched in front of the gay houses facing the sea cormorants dived under the long rollers that came crashing in from the pacific gulls wheeled and screamed in the soft wind alert little birds darted here and there with incredible swiftness leaving tiny footprints across the ribs and furrows of the wet sand far to the southward a dark barrier of mountains rose out of the sea sometimes i sat with my back against the dunes watching the drag of the outgoing water rolling the pebbles after it making a gleaming floor for the light to dance  at first i could not bear to recall the events that had preceded and followed my visit to krebs that sunday morning my illness had begun that night on the monday tom peters had come to the club and insisted upon my being taken to his house when i had recovered sufficiently there had been rather a pathetic renewal of our friendship perry came to see me their attitude was one of apprehension not unmixed with wonder and though they knew of the existence of a mental crisis suspected in all probability some of the causes of it they refrained carefully from all comments contenting themselves with telling me when i was well enough that krebs had died quite suddenly that sunday afternoon that his deathoccurring at such a crucial momenthad been sufficient to turn the tide of the election and make edgar greenhalge mayor thousands who had failed to understand hermann krebs but whom he had nevertheless stirred and troubled suddenly awoke to the fact that he had had elements of greatness  my feelings in those first days at santa barbara may be likened indeed to those of a man who has passed through a terrible accident that has deprived him of sight or hearing and which he wishes to forget what i was most conscious of then was an aching sense of lossan ache that by degrees became a throbbing pain as life flowed back into me reinflaming once more my being with protest and passion arousing me to revolt against the fate that had overtaken me i even began at moments to feel a fierce desire to go back and take up again the fight from which i had been so strangely removedremoved by the agency of things still obscure i might get nancy yet beat down her resistance overcome her if only i could be near her and see her but even in the midst of these surges of passion i was conscious of the birth of a new force i did not understand and which i resented that had arisen to give battle to my passions and desires this struggle was not mentally reflected as a debate between right and wrong as to whether i should or should not be justified in taking nancy if i could get her it seemed as though some new and small yet dogged intruder had forced an entrance into me an insignificant pigmy who did not hesitate to bar the pathway of the reviving giant of my desires these contests sapped my strength it seemed as though in my isolation i loved nancy i missed her more than ever and the flavour she gave to life  then hermann krebs began to press himself on me i use the word as expressive of those early resentful feelingsi rather pictured him then as the personification of an hostile element in the universe that had brought about my miseries and accomplished my downfall i attributed the disagreeable thwarting of my impulses to his agency i did not wish to think of him for he stood somehow for a vague future i feared to contemplate yet the illusion of his presence once begun continued to grow upon me and i find myself utterly unable to describe that struggle in which he seemed to be fighting as against myself for my confidence that process whereby he gradually grew as real to me as though he still liveduntil i could almost hear his voice and see his smile at moments i resisted wildly as though my survival depended on it at other moments he seemed to bring me peace one day i recalled as vividly as though it were taking place again that last time i had been with him i seemed once more to be listening to the calm yet earnest talk ranging over so many topics politics and government economics and science and religion i did not yet grasp the synthesis he had made of them all but i saw them now all focussed in him elements he had drawn from human lives and human experiences i think it was then i first felt the quickenings of a new life to be born in travail and pain wearied yet exalted i sank down on a stone bench and gazed out at the little island of santa cruz afloat on the shimmering sea  i have mentioned my inability to depict the terrible struggle that went on in my soul it seems strange that nietzschethat most ruthless of philosophers to the romantic mindshould express it for me the genius of the heart from contact with which every man goes away richer not blessed and overcome but richer himself fresher to himself than before opened up breathed upon and sounded by a thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more bruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new will and striving full of a new unwillingness and counterstriving  such was my experience with hermann krebs how keenly i remember that new unwillingness and counterstriving in spite of the years it has not wholly died down even today  almost coincident with these quickenings of which i have spoken was the consciousness of a hunger stronger than the craving for bread and meat and i began to meditate on my ignorance on the utter inadequacy and insufficiency of my early education on my neglect of the new learning during the years that had passed since i left harvard and i remembered krebss wordsthat we must reeducate ourselves what did i know a system of law inherited from another social order that was utterly unable to cope with the complexities and miseries and injustices of a modern industrial world i had spent my days in mastering an inadequate and archaic codewhy in order that i might learn how to evade it this in itself condemned it what did i know of life of the shining universe that surrounded me what did i know of the insect and the flower of the laws that moved the planets and made incandescent the suns of the human body of the human soul and its instincts was this knowledge acquired at such cost of labour and life and love by my fellowmen of so little worth to me that i could ignore it declare that it had no significance for me no bearing on my life and conduct if i were to rise and go forwardand i now felt something like a continued impulse in spite of relaxations and revoltsi must master this knowledge it must be my guide form the basis of my creed iwho never had had a creed never felt the need of one for lack of one i had been rudely jolted out of the frail shell i had thought so secure and stood as it were naked and shivering to the storms staring at a world that was no function of me after all my problem indeed was how to become a function of it  i resolved upon a course of reading but it was a question what books to get krebs could have told me if he had lived i even thought once of writing perry blackwood to ask him to make a list of the volumes in krebss little library but i was ashamed to do this  dr strafford still remained with me not many years out of the medical school he had inspired me with a liking for him and a respect for his profession and when he informed me one day that he could no longer conscientiously accept the sum i was paying him i begged him to stay on he was a big and wholesome young man companionable yet quiet and unobtrusive watchful without appearing to be so with the innate as well as the cultivated knowledge of psychology characteristic of the best modern physicians when i grew better i came to feel that he had given his whole mind to the study of my case though he never betrayed it in his conversation  strafford i said to him one morning with such an air of unconcern as i could muster ive an idea id like to read a little science could you recommend a work on biology  i chose biology because i thought he would know something about it  popular biology mr paret  well not too popular i smiled i think it would do me good to use my mind to chew on something besides you can help me over the tough places  he returned that afternoon with two books  ive been rather fortunate in getting these he said one is fairly elementary they had it at the library and the other he paused delicately i didnt know whether you might be interested in the latest speculations on the subject  speculations i repeated  well the philosophy of it he almost achieved a blush under his tan he held out the second book on the philosophy of the organism its the work of a german scientist who stands rather high i read it last winter and it interested me i got it from a clergyman i know who is spending the winter in santa barbara  a clergyman  strafford laughed an advanced clergyman he explained oh a lot of them are reading science now i think its pretty decent of them  i looked at strafford who towered six feet three and it suddenly struck me that he might be one of the forerunners of a type our universities were about to turn out i wondered what he believed of one thing i was sure that he was not in the medical profession to make money that was a faith in itself  i began with the elementary work  youd better borrow a century dictionary i said  thats easy he said and actually achieved it with the clergymans aid  the absorption in which i fought my way through those books may prove interesting to future generations who at sundayschool age when the fable of adam and eve was painfully being drummed into me without any mention of its application will be learning to think straight acquiring easily in early youth what i failed to learn until after forty and think of all the trouble and tragedy that will have been averted it is true that i had read some biology at cambridge which i had promptly forgotten it had not been especially emphasized by my instructors as related to lifecertainly not as related to religion such incidents as that of adam and eve occupied the religious field exclusively i had been compelled to commit to memory temporarily the matter in those books but what i now began to perceive was that the matter was secondary compared to the view point of scienceand this had been utterly neglected as i read i experienced all the excitement of an oldfashioned romance but of a romance of such significance as to touch the very springs of existence and above all i was impressed with the integrity of the scientific methodan integrity commensurate with the dignity of manthat scorned to quibble to make out a case to affirm something that could not be proved  little by little i became familiar with the principles of embryonic evolution ontogeny and of biological evolution phylogeny realized for the first time my own history and that of the ancestors from whom i had developed and descended i this marvellously complicated being torn by desires and despairs was the result of the union of two microscopic cells all living things come from the egg such had been harveys dictum the result was like the tonic of a cold douche i began to feel cleansed and purified as though something stickysweet which all my life had clung to me had been washed away yet a question arose an insistent question that forever presses itself on the mind of man how could these apparently chemical and mechanical processes which the author of the book contented himself with recording account for me the spermia darts for the egg and pierces it personal history begins but what mysterious shaping force is it that repeats in the individual the history of the race supervises the orderly division of the cells by degrees directs the symmetry sets aside the skeleton and digestive tract and supervises the structure  i took up the second book that on the philosophy of the organism to read in its preface that a muchtobehonoured british nobleman had established a foundation of lectures in a scotch university for forwarding the study of a natural theology the term possessed me unlike the old theology woven of myths and a fanciful philosophy of the decadent period of greece natural theology was founded on science itself and scientists were among those who sought to develop it here was a synthesis that made a powerful appeal one of the many signs and portents of a new era of which i was dimly becoming cognizant and now that i looked for signs i found them everywhere in my young doctor in krebs in references in the texts indications of a new order beginning to make itself felt in a muddled chaotic human world which mightwhich must have a parallel with the order that revealed itself in the egg might not both physical and social be due to the influence of the same invisible experimenting creating hand  my thoughts lingered lovingly on this theology so well named natural on its conscientiousness its refusal to affirm what it did not prove on its lack of dogmatic dictums and infallible revelations yet it gave me the vision of a new sanction whereby man might order his life a sanction from which was eliminated fear and superstition and romantic hope a sanction whose doctrinesunlike those of the sentimental theologydid not fly in the face of human instincts and needs nor was it a theology devoid of inspiration and poetry though poetry might be called its complement with all that was beautiful and true in the myths dear to mankind it did not conflict annulling only the vicious dogmatism of literal interpretation in this connection i remembered something that krebs had saidin our talk about poetry and artthat these were emotion religion expressed by the tools reason had evolved music he had declared came nearest to the cry of the human soul  that theology cleared for faith an open road made of faith a reasonable thing yet did not rob it of a sense of high adventure cleansed it of the taints of thrift and selfish concern in this reaffirmation of vitalism there might be a future yes an individual future yet it was far from the smug conception of salvation here was a faith conferred by the freedom of truth a faith that lost and regained itself in life it was dynamic in its operation for as lessing said the searching after truth and not its possession gives happiness to man in the words of an american scientist taken from his book on heredity the evolutionary idea has forced man to consider the probable future of his own race on earth and to take measures to control that future a matter he had previously left largely to fate  here indeed was another sign of the times to find in a strictly scientific work a sentence truly religious as i continued to read these works i found them suffused with religion religion of a kind and quality i had not imagined the birthright of the spirit of man was freedom freedom to experiment to determine to createto create himself to create society in the image of god spiritual creation the function of cooperative man through the coming ages the task that was to make him divine here indeed was the germ of a new sanction of a new motive of a new religion that strangely harmonized with the concepts of the oldonce the dynamic power of these was revealed  i had been thinking of my familyof my family in terms of matthewand yet with a growing yearning that embraced them all i had not informed maude of my illness and i had managed to warn tom peters not to do so i had simply written her that after the campaign i had gone for a rest to california yet in her letters to me after this information had reached her i detected a restrained anxiety and affection that troubled me sequences of words curiously convey meanings and implications that transcend their literal sense true thoughts and feelings are difficult to disguise even in written speech could it be possible after all that had happened that maude still loved me i continually put the thought away from me but continually it returned to haunt me suppose maude could not help loving me in spite of my weaknesses and faults even as i loved nancy in spite of hers love is no logical thing  it was matthew i wanted matthew of whom i thought and trivial longforgotten incidents of the past kept recurring to me constantly i still received his weekly letters but he did not ask why since i had taken a vacation i had not come over to them he represented the medium the link between maude and me that no estrangement no separation could break  all this new vision of mine was for him for the coming generation the soil in which it must be sown the americans of the future and who so well as matthew sensitive yet brave would respond to it i wished not only to give him what i had begun to grasp to study with him to be his companion and friend but to spare him if possible some of my own mistakes and sufferings and punishments but could i go back happy coincidences of desires and convictions had been so characteristic of that other self i had been struggling to cast off i had so easily been persuaded when i had had a chance of getting nancy that it was the right thing to do and now in my loneliness was i not growing just as eager to be convinced that it was my duty to go back to the family which in the hour of selfsufficiency i had cast off i had believed in divorce thenwhy not now well i still believed in it i had thought of a union with nancy as something that would bring about the selfrealization that springs from the gratification of a great passionan appealing phrase i had read somewhere but it was at least a favourable symptom that i was willing now to confess that the selfrealization had been a secondary and sentimental consideration a rosy selfcreated halo to give a moral and religious sanction to my desire was i not trying to do that very thing now it tortured me to think so i strove to achieve a detached consideration of the problemto arrive at length at a thought that seemed illuminating that the it wrongness or rightness utility and happiness of all such unions depend upon whether or not they become a part of the woof and warp of the social fabric in other words whether the gratification of any particular love by divorce and remarriage does or does not tend to destroy a portion of that fabric nancy certainly would have been justified in divorce it did not seem in the retrospect that i would have been surely not if after i had married nancy i had developed this view of life that seemed to me to be the true view i should have been powerless to act upon it but the chances were i should not have developed it since it would seem that any salvation for me at least must come precisely through suffering through not getting what i wanted was this equivocating  my mistake had been in marrying maude instead of nancya mistake largely due to my saturation with a false idea of life would not the attempt to cut loose from the consequences of that mistake in my individual case have been futile but there was a remedy for itthe remedy krebs had suggested i might still prevent my children from making such a mistake i might help to create in them what i might have been and thus find a solution for myself my errors would then assume a value  but the question tortured me would maude wish it would it be fair to her if she did not by my long neglect i had forfeited the right to go and would she agree with my point of view if she did permit me to stay i had less concern on this score a feeling that that development of hers which once had irritated me was in the same direction as my own  i have still strangely to record moments when in spite of the aspirations i had achieved of the redeeming vision i had gained at the thought of returning to her i revolted at such times recollections came into my mind of those characteristics in her that had seemed most responsible for my alienation that demon i had fed so mightily still lived by what righthe seemed to askhad i nourished him all these years if now i meant to starve him thus sometimes he defied me took on protean guises blustered insinuated cajoled managed to make me believe that to starve him would be to starve myself to sap all there was of power in me let me try and see if i could do it again he whispered to what purpose had i gained my liberty if now i renounced it i could not live in fetters even though the fetters should be selfimposed i was lonely now but i would get over that and life lay before me still  fierce and tenacious steel in the cruelty of his desires fearful in the havoc he had wrought could he be subdued foiled he tore and rent me  one morning i rode up through the shady canon fragrant with bay to the open slopes stained smokyblue by the wild lilac where the twisted madrona grows as i sat gazing down on tiny headlands jutting out into a vast ocean my paralyzing indecision came to an end i turned my horse down the trail again i had seen at last that life was bigger than i bigger than maude bigger than our individual wishes and desires i felt as though heavy shackles had been struck from me as i neared the house i spied my young doctor in the garden path his hands in his pockets watching a hummingbird poised over the poppies he greeted me with a look that was not wholly surprise at my early return that seemed to have in it something of gladness  strafford i said ive made up my mind to go to europe  i have been thinking for some time mr paret he replied that a seavoyage is just what you need to set you on your feet  i started eastward the next morning arriving in new york in time to catch one of the big liners sailing for havre on my way across the continent i decided to send a cable to maude at paris since it were only fair to give her an opportunity to reflect upon the manner in which she would meet the situation save for an impatience which at moments i restrained with difficulty the moods that succeeded one another as i journeyed did not differ greatly from those i had experienced in the past month i was alternately exalted and depressed i hoped and doubted and feared my courage my confidence rose and fell and yet i was aware of the nascence within me of an element that gave me a stability i had hitherto lacked i had made my decision and i felt the stronger for it  it was early in march the annual rush of my countrymen and women for foreign shores had not as yet begun the huge steamer was far from crowded the faint throbbing of her engines as she glided out on the north river tide found its echo within me as i leaned on the heavy rail and watched the towers of the city receding in the mist they became blurred and ghostlike fantastic in the grey distance sad appealing with a strange beauty and power once the sight of them sunlit standing forth sharply against the high blue of american skies had stirred in me that passion for wealth and power of which they were so marvellously and uniquely the embodiment i recalled the bright day of my homecoming with maude when she too had felt that passion drawing me away from her after the briefest of possessions well i had had it the power i had stormed and gained entrance to the citadel itself i might have lived here in new york secure defiant of a veering public opinion that envied while it strove to sting why was i flinging it all away was this a sudden resolution of mine forced by events precipitated by a failure to achieve what of all things on earth i had most desired or was it the inevitable result of the development of the hugh paret of earlier days who was not meant for that kind of power  the vibration of the monster ship increased to a strong electric pulsation the water hummed along her sides she felt the swell of the open sea a fine rain began to fall that hid the landyes and the life i was leaving i made my way across the glistening deck to the saloon where my newspapers and periodicals neglected i sat all the morning beside a window gazing out at the limited vignetted zone of waters around the ship we were headed for the old world the wind rose the rain became pelting mingling with the spume of the whitecaps racing madly past within were warmth and luxury electric lights open fires easy chairs and men and women reading conversing as unconcernedly as though the perils of the deep had ceased to be in all this i found an impelling interest the naive capacity in me for wonder so long dormant had been marvellously opened up once more i no longer thought of myself as the important man of affairs and when in the progress of the voyage i was accosted by two or three men i had met and by others who had heard of me it was only to feel amazement at the remoteness i now felt from a world whose realities were stocks and bonds railroads and corporations and the detested new politics so inimical to the smooth conduct of business  it all sounded like a language i had forgotten  it was not until near the end of the passage that we ran out of the storm a morning came when i went on deck to survey spaces of a blue and white sea swept by the white march sunlight to discern at length against the horizon toward which we sped a cloud of the filmiest and most delicate texture and design suddenly i divined that the cloud was france little by little as i watched it took on substance i made out headlands and cliffs and then we were coasting beside them that night i should be in paris with maude my bag was packed my steamer trunk closed i strayed about the decks in and out of the saloons wondering at the indifference of other passengers who sat reading in steamerchairs or wrote last letters to be posted at havre i was filled with impatience anticipation yes with anxiety concerning the adventure that was now so imminent with wavering doubts had i done the wisest thing after all i had the familiar experience that often comes just before reunion after absence of recalling intimate and forgotten impressions of those whom i was about to see again the tones of their voices little gestures  how would they receive me  the great ship had slowed down and was entering the harbour carefully threading her way amongst smaller craft the passengers lining the rails and gazing at the animated scene at the quaint and cheerful french city bathed in sunlight i had reached the dock and was making my way through the hurrying and shifting groups toward the steamer train when i saw maude she was standing a little aside scanning the faces that passed her  i remember how she looked at me expectantly yet timidly almost fearfully i kissed her  youve come to meet me i exclaimed stupidly how are the children  theyre very well hugh they wanted to come too but i thought it better not  her restraint struck me as extraordinary and while i was thankful for the relief it brought to a situation which might have been awkward i was conscious of resenting it a little i was impressed and puzzled as i walked along the platform beside her she seemed almost a stranger i had difficulty in realizing that she was my wife the mother of my children her eyes were clear more serious than i recalled them and her physical as well as her moral tone seemed to have improved her cheeks glowed with health and she wore a becoming suit of dark blue  did you have a good trip hugh she asked  splendid i said forgetting the storm we took our seats in an empty compartment was she glad to see me she had come all the way from paris to meet me all the embarrassment seemed to be on my side was this composure a controlled one or had she indeed attained to the selfsufficiency her manner and presence implied such were the questions running through my head  youve really liked paris i asked  yes hugh and its been very good for us all of course the boys like america better but theyve learned many things they wouldnt have learned at home they both speak french and biddy too even i have improved  im sure of it i said  she flushed  and what else have you been doing  oh going to galleries matthew often goes with me i think he quite appreciates the pictures sometimes i take him to the theatre too the francais both boys ride in the bois with a riding master its been rather a restricted life for them but it wont have hurt them its good discipline we have little excursions in an automobile on fine days to versailles and other places of interest around paris and matthew and i have learned a lot of history i have a professor of literature from the sorbonne come in three times a week to give me lessons  i didnt know you cared for literature  i didnt know it either she smiled matthew loves it monsieur despard declares he has quite a gift for language  maude had already begun matthews education  you see a few people i inquired  a few and they have been very kind to us the buffons whom i met at etretat and some of their friends mostly educated french people  the little railway carriage in which we sat rocked with speed as we flew through the french landscape i caught glimpses of solid norman farm buildings of towers and keeps and delicate steeples and quaint towns of bare poplars swaying before the march gusts of green fields ablaze in the afternoon sun i took it all in distractedly here was maude beside me but a maude i had difficulty in recognizing whom i did not understand who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to satisfy her one with which i had nothing to do i could not tell how she regarded my reintrusion as she continued to talk a feeling that was almost desperation grew upon me i had things to say to her things that every moment of this sort of intercourse was making more difficult and i felt if i did not say them now that perhaps i never should that now or never was the appropriate time and to delay would be to drift into an impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be remote  there was a pause how little i had anticipated the courage it would take to do this thing my blood was hammering  maude i said abruptly i suppose youre wondering why i came over here  she sat gazing at me very still but there came into her eyes a frightened look that almost unnerved me she seemed to wish to speak to be unable to passively she let my hand rest on hers  ive been thinking a great deal during the last few months i went on unsteadily and ive changed a good many of my ideasthat is ive got new ones about things i never thought of before i want to say first that i do not put forth any claim to come back into your life i know i have forfeited any claim ive neglected you and ive neglected the children our marriage has been on a false basis from the start and ive been to blame for it there is more to be said about the chances for a successful marriage in these days but im not going to dwell on that now or attempt to shoulder off my shortcomings on my bringing up on the civilization in which we have lived youve tried to do your share and the failure hasnt been your fault i want to tell you first of all that i recognize your right to live your life from now on independently of me if you so desire you ought to have the children i hesitated a moment it was the hardest thing i had to say ive never troubled myself about them ive never taken on any responsibility in regard to their bringing up  hugh she cried  waitive got more to tell you that you ought to know i shouldnt be here today if nancy durrett had consented toto get a divorce and marry me we had agreed to that when this accident happened to ham and she went back to him i have to tell you that i still love heri cant say how much or define my feelings toward her now ive given up all idea of her i dont think id marry her now even if i had the chance and you should decide to live away from me i dont know im not so sure of myself as i once was the fact is maude circumstances have been too much for me ive been beaten and im not at all certain that it wasnt a cowardly thing for me to come back to you at all  i felt her hand trembling under mine but i had not the courage to look at her i heard her call my name again a little cry the very poignancy of pity and distress it almost unnerved me  i knew that you loved her hugh she said it was onlyonly a little while after you married me that i found it out i guessed itwomen do guess such thingslong before you realized it yourself you ought to have married her instead of me you would have been happier with her  i did not answer  i too have thought a great deal she went on after a moment i began earlier than you i had to i looked up suddenly and saw her smiling at me faintly through her tears but ive been thinking more and learning more since ive been over here ive come to see that that our failure hasnt been as much your fault as i once thought as much as you yourself declare you have done me a wrong and youve done the children a wrong oh it is frightful to think how little i knew when i married you but even then i felt instinctively that you didnt love me as i deserved to be loved and when we came back from europe i knew that i couldnt satisfy you i couldnt look upon life as you saw it no matter how hard i tried i did try but it wasnt any use youll never know how much ive suffered all these years  i have been happier here away from you with the children ive had a chance to be myself it isnt that immuch it isnt that i dont need guidance and counsel andsympathy ive missed those but youve never given them to me and ive been learning more and more to do without them i dont know why marriage should suddenly have become such a mockery and failure in our time but i know that it is that ours hasnt been such an exception as i once thought ive come to believe that divorce is often justified  it is justified so far as you are concerned maude i replied it is not justified for me i have forfeited as i say any rights over you i have been the aggressor and transgressor from the start you have been a good wife and a good mother you have been faithful i have had absolutely nothing to complain of  sometimes i think i might have tried harder she said at least i might have understood better i was stupid but everything went wrong and i saw you growing away from me all the time hugh growing away from the friends who were fond of you as though you were fading in the distance it wasnt wholly becausebecause of nancy that i left you that gave me an excusean excuse for myself long before that i realized my helplessness i knew that whatever i might have done was past doing  yes i know i assented  we sat in silence for a while the train was skirting an ancient town set on a hill crowned with a castle and a gothic church whose windows were afire in the setting sun  maude i said i have not come to plead to appeal to your pity as against your judgment and reason i can say this much that if i do not love you as the word is generally understood i have a new respect for you and a new affection and i think that these will grow i have no doubt that there are some fortunate people who achieve the kind of mutual love for which it is human to yearn whose passion is naturally transmuted into a feeling that may be even finer but i am inclined to think even in such a case that some effort and unselfishness are necessary at any rate that has been denied to us and we can never know it from our own experience we can only hope that there is such a thingyes and believe in it and work for it  work for it hugh she repeated  for othersfor our children i have been thinking about the children a great deal in the last few months especially about matthew  you always loved him best she said  yes i admitted i dont know why it should be so and in spite of it i have neglected him neglected them failed to appreciate them all i did not deserve them i have reproached myself i have suffered for it not as much as i deserved i came to realize that the children were a bond between us that their existence meant something greater than either of us but at the same time i recognized that i had lost my right over them that it was you who had proved yourself worthy it was through the children that i came to think differently to feel differently toward you i have come to you to ask your forgiveness  oh hugh she cried  wait i said i have come to you through them i want to say again that i should not be here if i had obtained my desires yet there is more to it than that i think i have reached a stage where i am able to say that i am glad i didnt obtain them i see now that this coming to you was something i have wanted to do all along but it was the cowardly thing to do after i had failed for it was not as though i had conquered the desires the desires conquered me at any rate i couldnt come to you to encumber you to be a drag upon you i felt that i must have something to offer you ive got a plan maude for my life for our lives i dont know whether i can make a success of it and you are entitled to decline to take the risk i dont fool myself that it will be all plain sailing that there wont be difficulties and discouragements but ill promise to try  what is it she asked in a low voice ii think i know  perhaps you have guessed it i am willing to try to devote what is left of my life to you and to them and i need your help i acknowledge it let us try to make more possible for them the life we have missed  the life we have missed she said  yes my mistakes my failures have brought us to the edge of a precipice we must prevent if we can those mistakes and failures for them the remedy for unhappy marriages for all mistaken selfish and artificial relationships in life is a preventive one my plan is that we try to educate ourselves together take advantage of the accruing knowledge that is helping men and women to cope with the problems to think straight we can then teach our children to think straight to avoid the pitfalls into which we have fallen  i paused maude did not reply her face was turned away from me towards the red glow of the setting sun above the hills  you have been doing this all along you have had the vision the true vision while i lacked it maude i offer to help you but if you think it is impossible for us to live together if you believe my feeling toward you is not enough if you dont think i can do what i propose or if you have ceased to care for me  she turned to me with a swift movement her eyes filled with tears  oh hugh dont say any more i cant stand it how little you know for all your thinking i love you i always have loved you i grew to be ashamed of it but im not any longer i havent any pride any more and i never want to have it again  youre willing to take me as i amto try i said  yes she answered im willing to try she smiled at me and i have more faith than you hugh i think well succeed  at nine oclock that night when we came out through the gates of the big noisy station the children were awaiting us they had changed they had grown biddy kissed me shyly and stood staring up at me  well take you out tomorrow and show you how we can ride said moreton  matthew smiled he stood very close to me with his hand through my arm  youre going to stay father he asked  im going to stay matthew i answered until we all go back to america          pg editors bookmarks        barriers were mere relics of the superstition of the past       benumbing and

conviction that government should remain modestly in the background       everybody should have been satisfied but everybody was not       i hated to lie to heryet i did so       im incapable of
