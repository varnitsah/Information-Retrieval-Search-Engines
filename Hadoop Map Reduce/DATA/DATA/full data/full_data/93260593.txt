of a young english governess that i would write some pieces of history which her pupils could gather some good out ofthe fruit of historical documents placed by modern educational systems at her disposal being to them labour only and sorrow  what else may be said for the book if it ever become one it must say for itself preface more than this i do not care to write and the less because some passages of british history at this hour under record call for instant though brief comment  i am told that the queens guards have gone to ireland playing god save the queen and being as i have declared myself in the course of some letters to which public attention has been lately more than enough directed to the best of my knowledge the staunchest conservative in england i am disposed gravely to question the propriety of the mission of the queens guards on the employment commanded them my own conservative notion of the function of the guards is that they should guard the queens throne and life when threatened either by domestic or foreign enemy but not that they should become a substitute for her inefficient police force in the execution of her domiciliary laws  and still less so if the domiciliary laws which they are sent to execute playing god save the queen be perchance precisely contrary to that god the saviours law and therefore such as in the long run no quantity either of queens or queens men could execute which is a question i have for these ten years been endeavouring to get the british public to considervainly enough hitherto and will not at present add to my own many words on the matter but a book has just been published by a british officer who if he had not been otherwise and more actively employed could not only have written all my books about landscape and picture but is very singularly also of one mind with me god knows of how few englishmen i can now say so on matters regarding the queens safety and the nations honour of whose book far out rovings retold since various passages will be given in my subsequent terminal notes i will content myself with quoting for the end of my preface the memorable words which colonel butler himself quotes as spoken to the british parliament by its last conservative leader a british officer who had also served with honour and success  the duke of wellington said it is already well known to your lordships that of the troops which our gracious sovereign did me the honour to entrust to my command at various periods during the wara war undertaken for the express purpose of securing the happy institutions and independence of the countryat least one half were roman catholics my lords when i call your recollection to this fact i am sure all further eulogy is unnecessary your lordships are well aware for what length of period and under what difficult circumstances they maintained the empire buoyant upon the flood which overwhelmed the thrones and wrecked the institutions of every other peoplehow they kept alive the only spark of freedom which was left unextinguished in europe my lords it is mainly to the irish catholics that we all owe our proud predominance in our military career and that i personally am indebted for the laurels with which you have been pleased to decorate my brow we must confess my lords that without catholic blood and catholic valour no victory could ever have been obtained and the first military talents might have been exerted in vain  let these noble words of tender justice be the first example to my young readers of what all history ought to be it has been told them in the laws of fésole that all great art is praise so is all faithful history and all high philosophy for these three art history and philosophy are each but one part of the heavenly wisdom which sees not as man seeth but with eternal charity and because she rejoices not in iniquity therefore rejoices in the truth  for true knowledge is of virtues only of poisons and vices it is hecate who teaches not athena and of all wisdom chiefly the politicians must consist in this divine prudence it is not indeed always necessary for men to know the virtues of their friends or their masters since the friend will still manifest and the master use but woe to the nation which is too cruel to cherish the virtue of its subjects and too cowardly to recognize that of its enemies     the bible of amiens  chapter i  by the rivers of waters   the intelligent english traveller in this fortunate age for him is aware that halfway between boulogne and paris there is a complex railwaystation into which his train in its relaxing speed rolls him with many more than the average number of bangs and bumps prepared in the access of every important french gare to startle the drowsy or distrait passenger into a sense of his situation  he probably also remembers that at this haltingplace in midjourney there is a wellserved buffet at which he has the privilege of dix minutes darrêt  he is not however always so distinctly conscious that these ten minutes of arrest are granted to him within not so many minutes walk of the central square of a city which was once the venice of france  putting the lagoon islands out of question the french riverqueen was nearly as large in compass as venice herself and divided not by slow currents of ebbing and returning tide but by eleven beautiful trout streams of which some four or five are as large each separately as our surrey wandle or as isaac waltons dove and which branching out of one strong current above the city and uniting again after they have eddied through its streets are bordered as they flow down fordless except where the two edwards rode them the day before crecy to the sands of st valery by groves of aspen and glades of poplar whose grace and gladness seem to spring in every stately avenue instinct with the image of the just mans lifeerit tanquam lignum quod plantatum est secus decursus aquarum  but the venice of picardy owed her name not to the beauty of her streams merely but to their burden she was a worker like the adriatic princes in gold and glass in stone wood and ivory she was skilled like an egyptian in the weaving of fine linen dainty as the maids of judah in divers colours of needlework and of these the fruits of her hands praising her in her own gates she sent also portions to stranger nations and her fame went out into all lands  un règlement de léchevinage du 12me avril 1566 fait voir quon fabriquait à cette epoque des velours de toutes couleurs pour meubles des

be and sent to vie with the variegated carpet of the turk and glow upon the arabesque towers of barbary2 was not this a phase of provincial picard life which an intelligent english traveller might do well to inquire into why should this fountain of rainbows leap up suddenly here by somme and a little frankish maid write herself the sister of venice and the servant of carthage and of tyre  footnote

windows  and if she why not others also of our northern villages has the intelligent traveller discerned anything in the country or in its shores on his way from the gate of calais to the gare of amiens of special advantage for artistic design or for commercial enterprise he has seen league after league of sandy dunes we also we have our sands by severn by lune by solway he has seen extensive plains of useful and not unfragrant peatan article sufficiently accessible also to our scotch and irish industries he has seen many a broad down and jutting cliff of purest chalk but opposite the perfide albion gleams no whit less blanche beyond the blue pure waters he has seen issuing out of the snowy rock but are ours less bright at croydon at guildford or at winchester and yet one never heard of treasures sent from solway sands to african nor that the builders at romsey could give lessons in colour to the builders at granada what can it be in the air or the earthin her stars or in her sunlightthat fires the heart and quickens the eyes of the little whitecapped amienoise soubrette till she can match herself against penelope  the intelligent english traveller has of course no time to waste on any of these questions but if he has bought his hamsandwich and is ready for the en voiture messieurs he may perhaps condescend for an instant to hear what a lounger about the place neither wasteful of his time nor sparing of it can suggest as worth looking at when his train glides out of the station  he will see first and doubtless with the respectful admiration which an englishman is bound to bestow upon such objects the coalsheds and carriagesheds of the station itself extending in their ashy and oily splendours for about a quarter of a mile out of the town and then just as the train gets into speed under a large chimney tower which he cannot see to nearly the top of but will feel overcast by the shadow of its smoke he may see if he will trust his intelligent head out of the window and look back fifty or fiftyone i am not sure of my count to a unit similar chimneys all similarly smoking all with similar works attached oblongs of brown brick wall with portholes numberless of black square window but in the midst of these fifty tall things that smoke he will see one a little taller than any and more delicate that does not smoke and in the midst of these fifty masses of blank wall enclosing worksand doubtless producing works profitable and honourable to france and the worldhe will see one mass of wallnot blank but strangely wrought by the hands of foolish men of long ago for the purpose of enclosing or producing no manner of profitable work whatsoever but one  this is the work of god that ye should believe on him whom he hath sent  leaving

for the people that live round them and never look up as they pass by  suppose we set ourselves first to learn how they came there  at the birth of christ all this hillside and the brightlywatered plain below with the cornyellow champaign above were inhabited by a druidtaught race wild enough in thoughts and ways but under roman government and gradually becoming accustomed to hear the names and partly to confess the power of roman gods for three hundred years after the birth of christ they heard the name of no other god  three hundred years and neither apostles nor inheritors of apostleship had yet gone into all the world and preached the gospel to every creature here on their peaty ground the wild people still trusting in pomona for apples in silvanus for acorns in ceres for bread and in proserpina for rest hoped but the seasons blessing from the gods of harvest and feared no eternal anger from the queen of death  but at last three hundred years being past and gone in the year of christ 301 there came to this hillside of amiens on the sixth day of the ides of october the messenger of a new life  his name firminius i suppose in latin firmin in frenchso to be remembered here in picardy firmin not firminius as denis not dionysius coming out of spaceno one tells what part of space but received by the pagan amienois with surprised welcome and seen of themforty daysmany days we may readpreaching acceptably and binding with baptismal vows even persons in good society and that in such numbers that at last he is accused to the roman governor by the priests of jupiter and mercury as one turning the world upsidedown and in the last day of the fortyor of the indefinite many meant by fortyhe is beheaded as martyrs ought to be and his ministrations in a mortal body ended  the old old story you say be it so you will the more easily remember it the amienois remembered it so carefully that twelve hundred years afterwards in the sixteenth century they thought good to carve and paint the four stone pictures nos 1 2 3 and 4 of our first choice photographs n bthis series is not yet arranged but is distinct from that referred to in chapter iv see appendix ii scene 1st st firmin arriving scene 2nd st firmin preaching scene 3rd st firmin baptizing and scene 4th st firmin beheaded by an executioner with very red legs and an attendant dog of the character of the dog in faust of whom we may have more to say presently  following in the meantime the tale of st firmin as of old time known his body was received and buried by a roman senator his disciple a kind of joseph of arimathea to st firmin in the roman senators own garden who also built a little oratory over his grave the roman senators son built a church to replace the oratory dedicated it to our lady of martyrs and established it as an episcopal seatthe first of the french nations a very notable spot for the french nation surely one deserving perhaps some little memory or monumentcross tablet or the like where therefore do you suppose this first cathedral of french christianity stood and with what monument has it been honoured  it stood where we now stand companion mine whoever you may be and the monument wherewith it has been honoured is thischimney whose gonfalon of smoke overshadows usthe latest effort of modern art in amiens the chimney of st acheul  the first cathedral you observe of the french nation more accurately the first germ of cathedral for the french nationwho are not yet here only this grave of a martyr is here and this church of our lady of martyrs abiding on the hillside till the roman power pass away  falling together with it and trampled down by savage tribes alike the city and the shrine the grave forgottenwhen at last the franks themselves pour from the north and the utmost wave of them lapping along these downs of somme is here stayed and the frankish standard planted and the french kingdom throned  here their first capital here the first footsteps3 of the frank in his france think of it all over the south are gauls burgundians bretons heavierhearted nations of sullen mind at their outmost brim and border here at last are the franks the source of all franchise for this our europe you have heard the word in england before now but english word for it is none honesty we have of our own but frankness we must learn of these nay all the western nations of us are in a few centuries more to be known by this name of frank franks of paris that is to be in time to come but french of paris is in year of grace 500 an unknown tongue in paris as much as in stratfordattyebowe french of amiens is the kingly and courtly form of christian speech paris lying yet in lutetian clay to develope into tilefield perhaps in due time here by softglittering somme reign clovis and his clotilde  footnote 3 the first fixed and setdown footsteps wandering tribes called franks had overswept the country and recoiled again and again but this invasion of the socalled salian franks never retreats again  and by st firmins grave speaks now another gentle evangelist and the first frank kings prayer to the king of kings is made to him known only as the god of clotilde  i must ask the readers patience now with a date or two and stern factstwothreeor more  clodion the leader of the first franks who reach irrevocably beyond the rhine fights his way through desultory roman cohorts as far as amiens and takes it in 4454  footnote 4 see note at end of chapter as also for the allusions in p 8 to the battle of soissons  two years afterwards at his death the scarcely asserted throne is seizedperhaps inevitablyby the tutor of his children merovée whose dynasty is founded on the defeat of attila at chalons  he died in 457 his son childeric giving himself up to the love of women and scorned by the frank soldiery is driven into exile the franks choosing rather to live under the law of rome than under a base chief of their own he receives asylum at the court of the king of thuringia and abides there his chief officer in amiens at his departure breaks a ring in two and giving him the half of it tells him when the other half is sent to return  and after many days the half of the broken ring is sent and he returns and is accepted king by his franks  the thuringian queen follows him i cannot find if her husband is first deadstill less if dead how dying and offers herself to him for his wife  i have known thy usefulness and that thou art very strong and i have come to live with thee had i known in parts beyond sea any one more useful than thou i should have sought to live with him  he took her for his wife and their son is clovis  a wonderful story how far in literalness true is of no manner of moment to us the myth and power of it do manifest the nature of the french kingdom and prophesy its future destiny personal valour personal beauty loyalty to kings love of women disdain of unloving marriage note all these things for true and that in the corruption of these will be the last death of the frank as in their force was his first glory  personal valour worth utilitas the keystone of all birth nothing except as gifting with valourlaw of primogeniture unknownpropriety of conduct it appears for the present also nowhere but we are all pagans yet remember  let us get our dates and our geography at any rate gathered out of the great nowhere of confused memory and set well together thus far  457 merovée dies the useful childeric counting his exile and reign in amiens together is king altogether twentyfour years 457 to 481 and during his reign odoacer ends the roman empire in italy 476  481 clovis is only fifteen when he succeeds his father as king of the franks in amiens at this time a fragment of roman power remains isolated in central france while four strong and partly savage nations form a cross round this dying centre the frank on the north the breton on the west the burgundian on the east the visigoth strongest of all and gentlest in the south from loire to the sea  sketch for yourself first a map of france as large as you like as in plate i fig 1 marking only the courses of the five rivers somme seine loire saone rhone then rudely you find it was divided at the time thus fig 2 fleurdelysée part frank \\\ breton  burgundian  visigoth i am not sure how far these last reached across rhone into provence but i think best to indicate provence as semée with roses  now under clovis the franks fight three great battles the first with the romans near soissons which they win and become masters of france as far as the loire copy the rough map fig 2 and put the fleurdelys all over the middle of it extinguishing the romans fig 3 this battle was won by clovis i believe before he married clotilde he wins his princess by it cannot get his pretty vase however to present to her keep that story well in your mind and the battle of soissons as winning midfrance for the french and ending the romans there for ever secondly after he marries clotilde the wild germans attack him from the north and he has to fight for life and throne at tolbiac this is the battle in which he prays to the god of clotilde and quits himself of the germans by his help whereupon he is crowned in rheims by st remy  illustration plate i the dynasties of france  and now in the new strength of his christianity and his twin victory over rome and germany and his love for his queen and his ambition for his people he looks south on that vast visigothic power between loire and the snowy mountains shall christ and the franks not be stronger than villainous visigoths who are arians also all his franks are with him in that opinion so he marches against the visigoths meets them and their alaric at poitiers ends their alaric and their arianism and carries his faithful franks to the pic du midi  and so now you must draw the map of france once more and put the fleurdelys all over its central mass from calais to the pyrenees only brittany still on the west burgundy in the east and the white provence rose beyond rhone and now poor little amiens has become a mere border town like our durham and somme a border streamlet like our tyne loire and seine have become the great french rivers and men will be minded to build cities by these where the wellwatered plains not of peat but richest pasture may repose under the guard of saucy castles on the crags and moated towers on the islands but now let us think a little more closely what our changed symbols in the map may meanfive fleurdelys for level bar  they dont mean certainly that all the goths are gone and nobody but franks in france the franks have not massacred visigothic man woman and child from loire to garonne nay where their own throne is still set by the somme the peatbred people whom they found there live there still though subdued frank or goth or roman may fluctuate hither and thither in chasing or flying troops but unchanged through all the gusts of war the rural people whose huts they pillage whose farms they ravage and over whose arts they reign must still be diligently silently and with no time for lamentation ploughing sowing cattlebreeding  else how could frank or hun visigoth or roman live for a month or fight for a day  whatever the name or the manners of their masters the ground delvers must be the same and the goatherd of the pyrenees and the vinedresser of garonne and the milkmaid of picardy give them what lords you may abide in their land always blossoming as the trees of the field and enduring as the crags of the desert and these the warp and first substance of the nation are divided not by dynasties but by climates and are strong here and helpless there by privileges which no invading tyrants can abolish and through faults which no preaching hermit can repress now therefore please let us leave our history a minute or two and read the lessons of constant earth and sky  in old times when one posted from calais to paris there was about half an hours trot on the level from the gate of calais to the long chalk hill which had to be climbed before arriving at the first posthouse in the village of marquise  that chalk rise virtually is the front of france that last bit of level north of it virtually the last of flanders south of it stretches now a district of chalk and fine building limestoneif you keep your eyes open you may see a great quarry of it on the west of the railway halfway between calais and boulogne where once was a blessed little craggy dingle opening into velvet lawnsthis high but never mountainous calcareous tract sweeping round the chalk basin of paris away to caen on one side and nancy on the other and south as far as bourges and the limousin this limestone tract with its keen fresh air everywhere arable surface and quarriable banks above wellwatered meadow is the real country of the french here only are their arts clearly developed farther south they are gascons or limousins or auvergnats or the like westward grimgranitic bretons eastward alpinebearish burgundians here only on the chalk and finelyknit marble between say amiens and chartres one way and between caen and rheims on the other have you real france  of which before we carry on the farther vital history i must ask the reader to consider with me a little how history so called has been for the most part written and of what particulars it usually consists  suppose that the tale of king lear were a true one and that a modern historian were giving the abstract of it in a school manual purporting to contain all essential facts in british history valuable to british youth in competitive examination the story would be related somewhat after this manner  the reign of the last king of the seventyninth dynasty closed in a series of events with the record of which it is painful to pollute the pages of history the weak old man wished to divide his kingdom into dowries for his three daughters but on proposing this arrangement to them finding it received by the youngest with coldness and reserve he drove her from his court and divided the kingdom between his two elder children  the youngest found refuge at the court of france where ultimately the prince royal married her but the two elder daughters having obtained absolute power treated their father at first with disrespect and soon with contumely refused at last even the comforts necessary to his declining years the old king in a transport of rage left the palace with it is said only the court fool for an attendant and wandered frantic and half naked during the storms of winter in the woods of britain  hearing of these events his youngest daughter hastily collected an army and invaded the territory of her ungrateful sisters with the object of restoring her father to his throne but being met by a well disciplined force under the command of her eldest sisters paramour edmund bastard son of the earl of gloucester was herself defeated thrown into prison and soon afterwards strangled by the adulterers order the old king expired on receiving the news of her death and the participators in these crimes soon after received their reward for the two wicked queens being rivals for the affections of the bastard the one of them who was regarded by him with less favour poisoned the other and afterwards killed herself edmund afterwards met his death at the hand of his brother the legitimate son of gloucester under whose rule with that of the earl of kent the kingdom remained for several succeeding years  imagine this succinctly graceful recital of what the historian conceived to be the facts adorned with violently black and white woodcuts representing the blinding of gloucester the phrenzy of lear the strangling of cordelia and the suicide of goneril and you have a type of popular history in the nineteenth century which is you may perceive after a little reflection about as profitable reading for young persons so far as regards the general colour and purity of their thoughts as the newgate calendar would be with this farther condition of incalculably greater evil that while the calendar of prisoncrime would teach a thoughtful youth the dangers of low life and evil company the calendar of kingly crime overthrows his respect for any manner of government and his faith in the ordinances of providence itself  books of loftier pretence written by bankers members of parliament or orthodox clergymen are of course not wanting and show that the progress of civilization consists in the victory of usury over ecclesiastical prejudice or in the establishment of the parliamentary privileges of the borough of puddlecombe or in the extinction of the benighted superstitions of the papacy by the glorious light of reformation finally you have the broadly philosophical history which proves to you that there is no evidence whatever of any overruling providence in human affairs that all virtuous actions have selfish motives and that a scientific selfishness with proper telegraphic communications and perfect knowledge of all the species of bacteria will entirely secure the future wellbeing of the upper classes of society and the dutiful resignation of those beneath them  meantime the two ignored powersthe providence of heaven and the virtue of menhave ruled and rule the world not invisibly and they are the only powers of which history has ever to tell any profitable truth under all sorrow there is the force of virtue over all ruin the restoring charity of god to these alone we have to look in these alone we may understand the past and predict the future destiny of the ages  i return to the story of clovis king now of all central france fix the year 500 in your minds as the approximate date of his baptism at rheims and of st remys sermon to him telling him of the sufferings and passion of christ till clovis sprang from his throne grasping his spear and crying had i been there with my brave franks i would have avenged his wrongs  there is little doubt proceeds the cockney historian that the conversion of clovis was as much a matter of policy as of faith but the cockney historian had better limit his remarks on the characters and faiths of men to those of the curates who have recently taken orders in his fashionable neighbourhood or the bishops who have lately preached to the population of its manufacturing suburbs frankish kings were made of other clay  the christianity of clovis does not indeed produce any fruits of the kind usually looked for in a modern convert we do not hear of his repenting ever so little of any of his sins nor resolving to lead a new life in any the smallest particular he had not been impressed with convictions of sin at the battle of tolbiac nor in asking for the help of the god of clotilde had he felt or professed the remotest intention of changing his character or abandoning his projects what he was before he believed in his queens god he only more intensely afterwards became in the confidence of that before unknown gods supernatural help his natural gratitude to the delivering power and pride in its protection added only fierceness to his soldiership and deepened his political enmities with the rancour of religions indignation no more dangerous snare is set by the fiends for human frailty than the belief that our own enemies are also the enemies of god and it is perfectly conceivable to me that the conduct of clovis might have been the more unscrupulous precisely in the measure that his faith was more sincere  had either clovis or clotilde fully understood the precepts of their master the following history of france and of europe would have been other than it is what they could understand or in any wise were taught you will find that they obeyed and were blessed in obeying but their history is complicated with that of several other persons respecting whom we must note now a few too much forgotten particulars  if from beneath the apse of amiens cathedral we take the street leading due south leaving the railroad station on the left it brings us to the foot of a gradually ascending hill some half a mile longa pleasant and quiet walk enough terminating on the level of the highest land near amiens whence looking back the cathedral is seen beneath us all but the flêche our gained hilltop being on a level with its roofridge and to the south the plain of france  somewhere about this spot or in the line between it and st acheul stood the ancient roman gate of the twins whereon were carved romulus and remus being suckled by the wolf and out of which one bitter winters day a hundred and seventy years ago when clovis was baptizedhad ridden a roman soldier wrapped in his horsemans cloak5 on the causeway which was part of the great roman road from lyons to boulogne  footnote 5 more properly his knights cloak in all likelihood the trabea with purple and white stripes dedicate to the kings of rome and chiefly to romulus  and it is well worth your while also some frosty autumn or winter day when the east wind is high to feel the sweep of it at this spot remembering what chanced here memorable to all men and serviceable in that winter of the year 332 when men were dying for cold in amiens streetsnamely that the roman horseman scarce gone out of the city gate was met by a naked beggar shivering with cold and that seeing no other way of shelter for him he drew his sword divided his own cloak in two and gave him half of it  no ruinous gift nor even enthusiastically generous sydneys cup of cold water needed more selfdenial and i am well assured that many a christian child of our day himself well warmed and clad meeting one naked and cold would be ready enough to give the whole cloak off his own shoulders to the necessitous one if his betteradvised nurse or mamma would let him but this roman soldier was no christian and did his serene charity in simplicity yet with prudence  nevertheless that same night he beheld in a dream the lord jesus who stood before him in the midst of angels having on his shoulders the half of the cloak he had bestowed on the beggar  and jesus said to the angels that were around him know ye who hath thus arrayed me my servant martin though yet unbaptized has done this and martin after this vision hastened to receive baptism being then in his twentythird year6  footnote 6 mrs jameson legendary art vol ii p 721  whether these things ever were so or how far so credulous or incredulous reader is no business whatever of yours or mine what is and shall be everlastingly sonamely the infallible truth of the lesson herein taught and the actual effect of the life of st martin on the mind of christendomis very absolutely the business of every rational being in any christian realm  you are to understand then first of all that the especial character of st martin is a serene and meek charity to all creatures he is not a preaching saintstill less a persecuting one not even an anxious one of his prayers we hear littleof his wishes nothing what he does always is merely the right thing at the right momentrightness and kindness being in his mind one an extremely exemplary saint to my notion  converted and baptizedand conscious of having seen christhe nevertheless gives his officers no trouble whateverdoes not try to make proselytes in his cohort it is christs business surelyif he wants them he may appear to them as he has to me seems the feeling of his first baptized days he remains seventeen years in the army on those tranquil terms  at the end of that time thinking it might be well to take other service he asks for his dismissal from the emperor julianon whose accusation of faintheartedness martin offers unarmed to lead his cohort into battle bearing only the sign of the cross julian takes him at his wordkeeps him in ward till time of battle comes but the day before he counts on putting him to that war ordeal the barbarian enemy sends embassy with irrefusable offers of submission and peace  the story is not often dwelt upon how far literally true again observe does not in the least matterhere is the lesson for ever given of the way in which a christian soldier should meet his enemies which had john bunyans mr greatheart understood the celestial gates had opened by this time to many a pilgrim who has failed to hew his path up to them with the sword of sharpness  but true in some practical and effectual way the story is for after a while without any oratorizing anathematizing or any manner of disturbance we find the roman knight made bishop of tours and becoming an influence of unmixed good to all mankind then and afterwards and virtually the same story is repeated of his bishops robe as of his knights cloaknot to be rejected because so probable an invention for it is just as probable an act  going in his full robes to say prayers in church with one of his deacons he came across some unhappily robeless person by the wayside for whom he forthwith orders his deacon to provide some manner of coat or gown  the deacon objecting that no apparel of that profane nature is under his hand st martin with his customary serenity takes off his own episcopal stole or whatsoever flowing stateliness it might be throws it on the destitute shoulders and passes on to perform indecorous public service in his waistcoat or such mediæval nether attire as remained to him  but as he stood at the altar a globe of light appeared above his head and when he raised his bare arms with the hostthe angels were seen round him hanging golden chains upon them and jewels not of the earth  incredible to you in the nature of things wise reader and too palpably a gloss of monkish folly on the older story  be it so yet in this fable of monkish folly understood with the heart would have been the chastisement and check of every form of the churchs pride and sensuality which in our day have literally sunk the service of god and his poor into the service of the clergyman and his rich and changed what was once the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness into the spangling of pantaloons in an ecclesiastical masquerade  but one more legendand we have enough to show us the roots of this saints strange and universal power over christendom  what peculiarly distinguished st martin was his sweet serious unfailing serenity no one had ever seen him angry or sad or gay there was nothing in his heart but piety to god and pity for men the devil who was particularly envious of his virtues detested above all his exceeding charity because it was the most inimical to his own power and one day reproached him mockingly that he so soon received into favour the fallen and the repentant but st martin answered him sorrowfully saying oh most miserable that thou art if thou also couldst cease to persecute and seduce wretched men if thou also couldst repent thou also shouldst find mercy and forgiveness through jesus christ7  footnote 7 mrs jameson vol ii p 722  in this gentleness was his strength and the issue of it is best to be estimated by comparing its scope with that of the work of st firmin the impatient missionary riots and rants about amiens streetsinsults exhorts persuades baptizesturns everything as aforesaid upside down for forty days then gets his head cut off and is never more named out of amiens st martin teazes nobody spends not a breath in unpleasant exhortation understands by christs first lesson to himself that undipped people may be as good as dipped if their hearts are clean helps forgives and cheers companionable even to the lovingcup as readily the clown as the king he is the patron of honest drinking the stuffing of your martinmas goose is fragrant in his nostrils and sacred to him the last kindly rays of departing summer and somehowthe idols totter before him far and nearthe pagan gods fade his christ becomes all mens christhis name is named over new shrines innumerable in all lands high on the roman hills lowly in english fieldsst augustine baptized his first english converts in st martins church at canterbury and the charing cross station itself has not yet effaced wholly from london minds his memory or his name  that story of the episcopal robe is the last of st martin respecting which i venture to tell you that it is wiser to suppose it literally true than a mere myth myth however of the deepest value and beauty it remains assuredly and this really last story i have to tell which i admit you will be wiser in thinking a fable than exactly true nevertheless had assuredly at its root some grain of fact sprouting a hundredfold cast on good ground by a visible and unforgettable piece of st martins actual behaviour in high company while as a myth it is every whit and for ever valuable and comprehensive  st martin then as the tale will have it was dining one day at the highest of tables in the terrestrial globenamely with the emperor and empress of germany you need not inquire what emperor or which of the emperors wives the emperor of germany is in all early myths the expression for the highest sacred power of the state as the pope is the highest sacred power of the church st martin was dining then as aforesaid with the emperor of course sitting next him on his leftempress opposite on his right everything orthodox st martin much enjoying his dinner and making himself generally agreeable to the company not in the least a john baptist sort of a saint you are aware also that in royal feasts in those days persons of much inferior rank in society were allowed in the hall got behind peoples chairs and saw and heard what was going on while they unobtrusively picked up crumbs and licked trenchers  when the dinner was a little forward and time for wine came the emperor fills his own cupfills the empresssfills st martinsaffectionately hobnobs with st martin the equally loving and yet more truly believing empress looks across the table humbly but also royally expecting st martin of course next to hobnob with her st martin looks round first deliberately becomes aware of a tatterdemalion and thirstylooking soul of a beggar at his chair side who has managed to get his cup filled somehow alsoby a charitable lacquey  st martin turns his back on the empress and hobnobs with him  for which charitymythic if you like but evermore exemplaryhe remains as aforesaid the patron of goodchristian topers to this hour  as gathering years told upon him he seems to have felt that he had carried weight of crozier long enoughthat busy tours must now find a busier bishopthat for himself he might innocently henceforward take his pleasure and his rest where the vine grew and the lark sang for his episcopal palace he takes a little cave in the chalk cliffs of the upcountry river arranges all matters therein for bed and board at small cost night by night the stream murmurs to him day by day the vineleaves give their shade and daily by the horizons breadth so much nearer heaven the forerunning sun goes down for him beyond the glowing waterthere where now the peasant woman trots homewards between her panniers and the saw rests in the halfcleft wood and the village spire rises grey against the farthest light in turners loireside8  footnote 8 modern painters plate 73  all which things though not themselves without profit my special reason for telling you now has been that you might understand the significance of what chanced first on clovis march south against the visigoths  having passed the loire at tours he traversed the lands of the abbey of st martin which he declared inviolate and refused permission to his soldiers to touch anything save water and grass for their horses so rigid were his orders and the obedience he exacted in this respect that a frankish soldier having taken without the consent of the owner some hay which belonged to a poor man saying in raillery that it was but grass he caused the aggressor to be put to death exclaiming that victory could not be expected if st martin should be offended  now mark you well this passage of the loire at tours is virtually the fulfilment of the proper bounds of the french kingdom and the sign of its approved and securely set power is honour to the poor even a little grass is not to be stolen from a poor man on pain of death so wills the christian knight of roman armies throned now high with god so wills the first christian king of far victorious frankshere baptized to god in jordan of his goodly land as he goes over to possess it  how long  until that same sign should be read backwards from a degenerate throneuntil message being brought that the poor of the french people had no bread to eat answer should be returned to them they may eat grass whereuponby st martins faubourg and st martins gatethere go forth commands from the poor mans knight against the kingwhich end his feasting  and be this much remembered by you of the power over french souls past and to come of st martin of tours   notes to chapter i   the reader will please observe that notes immediately necessary to the understanding of the text will be given with numbered references under the text itself while questions of disputing authorities or quotations of supporting documents will have lettered references and be thrown together at the end of each chapter9 one good of this method will be that after the numbered notes are all right if i see need of farther explanation as i revise the press i can insert a letter referring to a final note without confusion of the standing types there will be some use also in the final notes in summing the chapters or saying what is to be more carefully remembered of them thus just now it is of no consequence to remember that the first taking of amiens was in 445 because that is not the founding of the merovingian dynasty neither that merovæus seized the throne in 447 and died ten years later the real date to be remembered is 481 when clovis himself comes to the throne a boy of fifteen and the three battles of clovis reign to be remembered are soissons tolbiac and poitiersremembering also that this was the first of the three great battles of poitiershow the poitiers district came to have such importance as a battleposition we must afterwards discover if we can of queen clotilde and her flight from burgundy to her frank lover we must hear more in next chapterthe story of the vase at soissons is given in the pictorial history of france but must be deferred also with such comment as it needs to next chapter for i wish the readers mind in the close of this first number to be left fixed on two descriptions of the modern frank taking that word in its saracen sense as distinguished from the modern saracen the first description is by colonel butler entirely true and admirable except in the implied extension of the contrast to olden time for the saxon soul under alfred the teutonic under charlemagne and the frank under st louis were quite as religious as any asiatics though more practical it is only the modern mob of kingless miscreants in the west who have sunk themselves by gambling swindling machinemaking and gluttony into the scurviest louts that have ever fouled the earth with the carcases she lent them  footnote 9 the plan for numbered and lettered references is not followed after the first chapter                                       of the features of english character brought to light by the spread of british dominion in asia there is nothing more observable than the contrast between the religious bias of eastern thought and the innate absence of religion in the anglosaxon mind turk and greek buddhist and armenian copt and parsee all manifest in a hundred ways of daily life the great fact of their belief in a god in their vices as well as in their virtues the recognition of deity is dominant  with the western on the contrary the outward form of practising belief in a god is a thing to be halfashamed ofsomething to hide a procession of priests in the strada reale would probably cause an average briton to regard it with less tolerant eye than he would cast upon a juggernaut festival in orissa but to each alike would he display the same iconoclasm of creed the same idea not the less fixed because it is seldom expressed in words you pray therefore i do not think much of you but there is a deeper difference between east and west lying beneath this incompatibility of temper on the part of modern englishmen to accept the religious habit of thought in the east all eastern peoples possess this habit of thought it is the one tie which links together their widely differing races let us give an illustration of our meaning on an austrian lloyds steamboat in the levant a traveller from beyrout will frequently see strange groups of men crowded together on the quarterdeck in the morning the missal books of the greek church will be laid along the bulwarks of the ship and a couple of russian priests coming from jerusalem will be busy muttering mass a yard to right or left a turkish pilgrim returning from mecca sits a respectful observer of the scene it is prayer and therefore it is holy in his sight so too when the evening hour has come and the turk spreads out his bit of carpet for the sunset prayers and obeisance towards mecca the greek looks on in silence without trace of scorn in his face for it is again the worship of the creator by the created they are both fulfilling the first law of the eastprayer to god and whether the shrine be jerusalem mecca or lhassa the sanctity of worship surrounds the votary and protects the pilgrim  into this life comes the englishman frequently destitute of one touch of sympathy with the prayers of any people or the faith of any creed hence our rule in the east has ever rested and will ever rest upon the bayonet we have never yet got beyond the stage of conquest never assimilated a people to our ways never even civilized a single tribe around the wide dominion of our empire it is curious how frequently a wellmeaning briton will speak of a foreign church or temple as though it had presented itself to his mind in the same light in which the city of london appeared to blucheras something to loot the other idea that a priest was a person to hang is one which is also often observable in the british brain on one occasion when we were endeavouring to enlighten our minds on the greek question as it had presented itself to a naval officer whose vessel had been stationed in greek and adriatic waters during our occupation of corfu and the other ionian isles we could only elicit from our informant the fact that one morning before breakfast he had hanged seventeen priests  the second passage which i store in these notes for future use is the supremely magnificent one out of a book full of magnificenceif truth be counted as having in it the strength of deed alphonse karrs grains de bon sens i cannot praise either this or his more recent bourdonnements to my own hearts content simply because they are by a man utterly after my own heart who has been saying in france this many a year what i also this many a year have been saying in england neither of us knowing of the other and both of us vainly see pages 11 and 12 of bourdonnements the passage here given is the sixtythird clause in grains de bon sens  et tout cela monsieur

of artificial memoryfar less slighting the pleasure and power of resolute and thoughtful memorymy younger readers will find it extremely useful to note any coincidences or links of number which may serve to secure in their minds what may be called dates of anchorage round which others less important may swing at various cables lengths  thus it will be found primarily a most simple and convenient arrangement of the years since the birth of christ to divide them by fives of centuriesthat is to say by the marked periods of the fifth tenth fifteenth and now fast nearing us twentieth centuries  and thisat first seemingly formal and arithmeticaldivision will be found as we use it very singularly emphasized by signs of most notable change in the knowledge disciplines and morals of the human race  2 all dates it must farther be remembered falling within the fifth century begin with the number 4 401 402 etc and all dates in the tenth century with the number 9 901 902 etc and all dates in the fifteenth century with the number 14 1401 1402 etc  in our immediate subject of study we are concerned with the first of these marked centuriesthe fifthof which i will therefore ask you to observe two very interesting divisions  all dates of years in that century we said must begin with the number 4  if you halve it for the second figure you get 42  and if you double it for the second figure you get 48  illustration plate iithe bible of amiens northern porch before restoration  add 1 for the third figure to each of these numbers and you get 421 and 481 which two dates you will please fasten well down and let there be no drifting about of them in your heads  for the first is the date of the birth of venice herself and her dukedom see st marks rest part i p 30 and the second is the date of birth of the french venice and her kingdom clovis being in that year crowned in amiens  3 these are the great birthdaysbirthdatesin the fifth century of nations its deathdays we will count at another time  since not for dark rialtos dukedom nor for fair frances kingdom only are these two years to be remembered above all others in the wild fifth century but because they are also the birthyears of a great lady and greater lord of all future christendomst genevieve and st benedict  genevieve the white wave laughing waterthe purest of all the maids that have been named from the seafoam or the rivulets ripple unsulliednot the troubled and troubling aphrodite but the leucothea of ulysses the guiding wave of deliverance  white wave on the bluewhether of pure lake or sunny seathenceforth the colours of france blue field with white lilies she is always the type of purity in active brightness of the entire soul and lifeso distinguished from the quieter and restricted innocence of st agnesand all the traditions of sorrow in the trial or failure of noble womanhood are connected with her name ginevra in italian passing into shakespeares imogen and guinevere the torrent wave of the british mountain streams of whose pollution your modern sentimental minstrels chant and moan to you lugubriously uselessbut none tell you that i hear of the victory and might of this white wave of france  4 a shepherd maid she wasa tiny thing barefooted bareheadedsuch as you may see running wild and innocent less cared for now than their sheep over many a hillside of france and italy tiny enoughseven years old all told when first one hears of her seven times one are seven i am old you may trust me linnet linnet10 and all around herfierce as the furies and wild as the winds of heaventhe thunder of the gothic armies reverberate over the ruins of the world  5 two leagues from paris roman paris soon to pass away with rome herself the little thing keeps her flock not even her own nor her fathers flock like david she is the hired servant of a richer farmer of nanterre who can tell me anything about nanterrewhich of our pilgrims of this omnispeculant omninescient age has thought of visiting what shrine may be there i dont know even on what side of paris it lies11 nor under which heap of railway cinders and iron one is to conceive the sheepwalks and blossomed fields of fairy st phyllis there were such left even in my time between paris and st denis see the prettiest chapter in all the mysteries of paris where fleur de marie runs wild in them for the first time but now i suppose st phylliss native earth is all thrown up into bastion and glacis profitable and blessed of all saints and her as these have since proved themselves or else are covered with manufactories and cabarets seven years old she was then when on his way to england from auxerre st germain passed a night in her village and among the children who brought him on his way in the morning in more kindly manner than elishas convoy noticed this onewidereyed in reverence than the rest drew her to him questioned her and was sweetly answered that she would fain be christs handmaid and he hung round her neck a small copper coin marked with the cross thencefoward genevieve held herself as separated from the world  footnote 10 miss ingelow  footnote 11 on inquiry i find in the flat between paris and sèvres  6 it did not turn out so however far the contrary you must think of her instead as the first of parisiennes queen of vanity fair that was to be sedately poor st phyllis with her coppercrossed farthing about her neck more than nitocris was to egypt more than semiramis to nineveh more than zenobia to the city of palm treesthis sevenyearsold shepherd maiden became to paris and her france you have not heard of her in that kindno how should youfor she did not lead armies but stayed them and all her power was in peace  7 there are however some seven or eight and twenty lives of her i believe into the literature of which i cannot enter nor need all having been ineffective in producing any clear picture of her to the modern french or english mind and leaving ones own poor sagacities and fancy to gather and shape the sanctity of her into an intelligible i do not say a credible form for there is no question here about beliefthe creature is as real as joan of arc and far more powerfulshe is separated just as st martin is by his patience from too provocative prelatesby her quietness of force from the pitiable crowd of feminine martyr saints  there are thousands of religious girls who have never got themselves into any calendars but have wasted and wearied away their livesheaven knows why for we cannot but here is one at any rate who neither scolds herself to martyrdom nor frets herself into consumption but becomes a tower of the flock and builder of folds for them all her days  8 the first thing then you have to note of her is that she is a pure native gaul she does not come as a missionary out of hungary or illyria or egypt or ineffable space but grows at nanterre like a marguerite in the dew the first reine blanche of gaul  i have not used this ugly word gaul before and we must be quite sure what it means at once though it will cost us a long parenthesis  9 during all the years of the rising power of rome her people called everybody a gaul who lived north of the sources of tiber if you are not content with that general statement you may read the article gallia in smiths dictionary which consists of seventyone columns of close print containing each as much as three of my pages and tells you at the end of it that though long it is not complete you may however gather from it after an attentive perusal as much as i have above told you  but as early as the second century after christ and much more distinctly in the time with which we are ourselves concernedthe fifththe wild nations opposed to rome and partially subdued or held at bay by her had resolved themselves into two distinct masses belonging to two distinct latitudes one fixed in habitation of the pleasant temperate zone of europeengland with her western mountains the healthy limestone plateaux and granite mounts of france the german labyrinths of woody hill and winding thal from the tyrol to the hartz and all the vast enclosed basin and branching valleys of the carpathians think of these four districts briefly and clearly as britain gaul germany and dacia  10 north of these rudely but patiently resident races possessing fields and orchards quiet herds homes of a sort moralities and memories not ignoble dwelt or rather drifted and shook a shattered chain of gloomier tribes piratical mainly and predatory nomad essentially homeless of necessity finding no stay nor comfort in earth or bitter sky desperately wandering along the waste sands and drenched morasses of the flat country stretching from the mouths of the rhine

i can give you no picture of it bring to your ears no murmur of it nor cry i can only show you the absolute must have been of its unrewarded past and the way in which all we have thought of or been told is founded on the deeper facts in its history unthought of and untold  15 the main mass of this innocent and invincible peasant life is as i have above told you grouped in the fruitful and

that the french were more polite than true they will find if they examine into the matter that only truth can be polished and that all we recognize of beautiful subtle or constructive in the manners the language or the architecture of the french comes of a pure veracity in their nature which you will soon feel in the living creatures themselves if you love them if you understand even their worst rightly their very revolution was a revolt against lies and against the betrayal of love no people had ever been so loyal in vain  17 that they were originally germans they themselves i suppose would now gladly forget but how they shook the dust of germany off their feetand gave themselves a new nameis the first of the phenomena which we have now attentively to observe respecting them  the most rational critics says mr gibbon in his tenth chapter suppose that about the year 240 suppose then we for our greater comfort say about the year 250 halfway to end of fifth century where we areten years less or more in cases of supposing about do not much matter but some floating buoy of a date will be handy here  about ad 250 then a new confederacy was formed under the name of franks by the old inhabitants of the lower rhine and the weser  18 my own impression concerning the old inhabitants of the lower rhine and the weser would have been that they consisted mostly of fish with superficial frogs and ducks but mr gibbons note on the passage informs us that the new confederation composed itself of human creatures in these items following  1 the chauci who lived we are not told where  2 the sicambri         in the principality of waldeck  3 the attuarii         in the duchy of berg  4 the bructeri         on the banks of the lippe  5 the chamavii         in the country of the bructeri  6 the catti            in hessia  all this i believe you will be rather easier in your minds if you forget than if you remember but if it please you to read or reread or best of all get read to you by some real miss isabella wardour the story of martin waldeck in the antiquary you will gain from it a sufficient notion of the central character of the principality of waldeck connected securely with that important german word woodyor woodish i supposedescriptive of rock and halfgrown forest together with some wholesome reverence for scotts instinctively deep foundations of nomenclature  19 but for our present purpose we must also take seriously to our maps again and get things within linear limits of space  all the maps of germany which i have myself the privilege of possessing diffuse themselves just north of frankfort into the likeness of a painted window broken small by puritan malice and put together again by ingenious churchwardens with every bit of it wrong side upwardsthis curious vitrerie purporting to represent the sixty seventy eighty or ninety dukedoms marquisates counties baronies electorates and the like into which hereditary alemannia cracked itself in that latitude but under the mottling colours and through the jotted and jumbled alphabets of distracted dignitiesbesides a chainmail of black railroads over all the chains of it not in links but bristling with legs like centipedesa hard forenoons work with good magnifyingglass enables one approximately to make out the course of the weser and the names of certain towns near its sources deservedly memorable  20 in case you have not a forenoon to spare nor eyesight to waste this much of merely necessary abstract must serve youthat from the drachenfels and its six brother felsen eastward trending to the north there runs and spreads a straggling company of gnarled and mysterious craglets jutting and scowling above glens fringed by coppice and fretful or musical with stream the crags in pious ages mostly castled for distantly or fancifully christian purposesthe glens resonant of woodmen or burrowed at the sides by miners and invisibly tenanted farther underground by gnomes and above by forest and other demons the entire district clasping crag to crag and guiding dell to dell some hundred and fifty miles with intervals between the dragon mountain above rhine and the rosin mountain hartz shadowy still to the south of the riding grounds of black brunswickers of indisputable bodily presenceshadowy anciently with hercynian hedge or fence forest corrupted or coinciding into hartz or rosin forest haunted by obscurely apparent foresters of at least resinous not to say sulphurous extraction  21 a hundred and fifty miles east to west say half as much north to southabout a thousand square miles in wholeof metalliferous coniferous and ghostiferous mountain fluent and diffluent for us both in mediæval and recent times with the most essential oil of turpentine and myrrh or frankincense of temper and imagination which may be typified by it producible in germany especially if we think how the more delicate uses of rosin as indispensable to the fiddlebow have developed themselves from the days of st elizabeth of marburg to those of st mephistopheles of weimar  22 as far as i know this cluster of wayward cliff and dingle has no common name as a group of hills and it is quite impossible to make out the diverse branching of it in any maps i can lay hand on but we may remember easily and usefully that it is all north of the mainethat it rests on the drachenfels at one end and tosses itself away to the morning light with a concave swoop up to the hartz brocken summit 3700 feet above sea nothing higher with one notable interval for weser stream of which presently  23 we will call this in future the chain or company of the enchanted mountains and then we shall all the more easily join on the giant mountains riesengebirge when we want them but these are altogether higher sterner and not yet to be invaded the nearer ones through which our road lies we might perhaps more aptly call the goblin mountains but that would be scarcely reverent to st elizabeth nor to the numberless pretty chatelaines of towers and princesses of park and glen who have made german domestic manners sweet and exemplary and have led their lightly rippling and translucent lives down the glens of ages until enchantment becomes perhaps too canonical in the almanach de gotha  we will call them therefore the enchanted mountains not the goblin perceiving gratefully also that the rock spirits of them have really much more of the temper of fairy physicians than of gnomes eachas it were with sensitive hazel wand instead of smiting rodbeckoning out of sparry caves effervescent brunnen beneficently salt and warm  24 at the very heart of this enchanted chain thenand the beneficentest if one use it and guide it rightly of all the brunnen there sprang the fountain of the earliest frank race in the principality of waldeckyou can trace their current to no farther source there it rises out of the earth  frankenberg burg on right bank of the eder nineteen miles north of marburg you may find marked clearly in the map no 18 of blacks general atlas wherein the cluster of surrounding bewitched mountains and the valley of ederstream otherwise as the village higher up the dell still calls itself engelbach angel brook joining that of the fulda just above cassel are also delineated in a way intelligible to attentive mortal eyes i should be plagued with the names in trying a woodcut but a few careful penstrokes or wriggles of your own offhand touching would give you the concurrence of the actual sources of weser in a comfortably extricated form with the memorable towns on them or just south of them on the other slope of the watershed towards maine frankenberg and waldeck on eder fulda and cassel on fulda eisenach on werra who

i find marked by a cross as built by some pious walter knight of meiningen on the boden wasser bottom water as of water having found its way well down at last so bodensee of rhine well got down out of via mala  26 and thus having got your springs of weser clear from the rock and as it were gathered up the reins of your river you can draw for yourself easily enough the course of its farther stream flowing virtually straight north to the north sea and mark it strongly on your sketched map of europe next to the border vistula leaving out elbe yet for a time for now you may take the whole space between weser and vistula north of the mountains as wild barbarian saxon or goth but piercing the source of the franks at waldeck you will find them gradually but swiftly filling all the space between weser and the mouths of rhine passing from mountain foam into calmer diffusion over the netherland where their straying forest and pastoral life has at last to embank itself into muddy agriculture and in bleakflying sea mist forget the sunshine on its basalt crags  27 whereupon we must also pause to embank ourselves somewhat and before other things try what we can understand in this name of frank concerning which gibbon tells us in his sweetest tones of satisfied moral serenitythe love of liberty was the ruling passion of these germans they deserved they assumed they maintained the honourable epithet of franks or freemen he does not however tell us in what language of the timechaucian sicambrian chamavian or cattianfrank ever meant free nor can i find out myself what tongue of any time it first belongs to but i doubt not that miss yonge history of christian names articles on frey and frank gives the true root in what she calls the high german frang free lord not by any means a free commoner or anything of the sort but a person whose nature and name implied the existence around him and beneath of a considerable number of other persons who were by no means frang nor frangs his title is one of the proudest then maintainableratified at last by the dignity of age added to that of valour into the seigneur or monseigneur not even yet in the last cockney form of it mossoo wholly understood as a republican term  28 so that accurately thought of the quality of frankness glances only with the flat side of it into any meaning of libre but with all its cutting edge determinedly and to all time it signifies brave strong and honest above other men15 the old woodland race were never in any wolfish sense free but in a most human sense frank outspoken meaning what they had said and standing to it when they had got it out quick and clear in word and act fearless utterly and restless alwaysbut idly lawless or weakly lavish neither in deed nor word their frankness if you read it as a scholar and a christian and not like a modern halfbred halfbrained infidel knowing no tongue of all the world but in the slang of it is really opposed not to servitudebut to shyness16 it is to this day the note of the sweetest and frenchiest of french character that it makes simply perfect servants unwearied in protective friendship in meekly dextrous omnificence in latent tutorship the lovingly availablest of valetsthe mentally and personally bonniest of bonnes but in no capacity shy of you though you be the duke or duchess of montaltissimo you will not find them abashed at your altitude they will speak up to you when they have a mind  footnote 15 gibbon touches the facts more closely in a sentence of his 22nd chapter the independent warriors of germany who considered truth as the noblest of their virtues and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions he is speaking especially of the frankish tribe of the attuarii against whom the emperor julian had to refortify the rhine from cleves to basle but the first letters of the emperor jovian after julians death delegated the military command of gaul and illyrium what a vast one it was we shall see hereafter to malarich a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the franks and they remain the loyal allies of rome in her last struggle with alaric apparently for the sake only of an interesting variety of languageand at all events without intimation of any causes of so great a change in the national characterwe find mr gibbon in his next volume suddenly adopting the abusive epithets of procopius and calling the franks a light and perfidious nation vii 251 the only traceable grounds for this unexpected description of them are that they refuse to be bribed either into friendship or activity by rome or ravenna and that in his invasion of italy the grandson of clovis did not previously send exact warning of his proposed route nor even entirely signify his intentions till he had secured the bridge of the po at pavia afterwards declaring his mind with sufficient distinctness by assaulting almost at the same instant the hostile camps of the goths and romans who instead of uniting their arms fled with equal precipitation  footnote 16 for detailed illustration of the word see val darno lecture viii fors clavigera letters xlvi 231 lxxvii 137 and chaucer romaunt of rose 1212next him the knight

them of which we shall see proof enough in due timebut instantly note this farther that whatever sidegleam of the thing they afterwards called liberty may be meant by the frank name you must at once now and always in future guard yourself from confusing their liberties with their activities what the temper of the army may be towards its chief is one questionwhether either chief or army can be kept six months quietanother and a totally different one that they must either be fighting somebody or going somewhere else their life isnt worth living to them the activity and mercurial flashing and flickering hither and thither which in the soul of it is set neither on war nor rapine but only on change of place moodtense and tensionwhich never needs to see its spurs in the dish but has them always bright and on and would ever choose rather to ride fasting than sit feastingthis childlike dread of being put in a corner and continual want of something to do is to be watched by us with wondering sympathy in all its sometimes splendid but too often unlucky or disastrous consequences to the nation itself as well as to its neighbours  30 and this activity which we stolid beefeaters before we had been taught by modern science that we were no better than baboons ourselves were wont discourteously to liken to that of the livelier tribes of monkey did in fact so much impress the hollanders when first the irriguous franks gave motion and current to their marshes that the earliest heraldry in which we find the frank power blazoned seems to be founded on a dutch endeavour to give some distantly satirical presentment of it for says a most ingenious historian mons andré favineparisian and advocate in the high court of the french parliament in the year 1620those people who bordered on the river sala called salts by the allemaignes were on their descent into dutch lands called by the romans franci salici whence salique law to come you observe and by abridgment salii as if of the verb salire that is to say saulter to leapand in future thereforeduly also to dancein an incomparable manner to be quicke and nimble of foot to leap and mount well a quality most notably requisite for such as dwell in watrie and marshy places so that while such of the french as dwelt on the great course of the river rhine were called nageurs swimmers they of the marshes were called saulteurs leapers so that it was a nickname given to the french in regard both of their natural disposition and of their dwelling as yet to this day their enemies call them french toades or frogs more properly from whence grew the fable that their ancient kings carried such creatures in their armes  31 without entering at present into debate whether fable or not you will easily remember the epithet salian of these fosseleaping and riverswimming folk so that as aforesaid all the length of rhine must be refortified against themepithet however it appears in its origin delicately saline so that we may with good discretion as we call our seasoned mariners old salts think of these more brightly sparkling franks as young saltsbut this equivocated presently by the romans with natural respect to their martial fire and elan into saliiexsultantes17such as their own armed priests of war and by us now with some little farther but slight equivocation into useful meaning to be thought of as here first salient as a beaked promontory towards the france we know of and evermore in brilliant elasticities of temper a salient or outsallying nation lending to us english presentlyfor this much of heraldry we may at once glance on totheir leopard not as a spotted or blotted creature but as an inevitably springing and pouncing one for our own kingly and princely shields  footnote 17 their first mischievous exsultation into alsace being invited by the romans themselves or at least by constantius in his jealousy of julianwith presents and promisesthe hopes of spoil and a perpetual grant of all the territories they were able to subdue gibbon chap xix 3 208 by any other historian than gibbon who has really no fixed opinion on any character or question but safe in the general truism that the worst men sometimes do right and the best often do wrong praises when he wants to round a sentence and blames when he cannot otherwise edge oneit might have startled us to be here told of the nation which deserved assumed and maintained the honourable name of freemen that these undisciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the subjects of the empire who possessed any property which they were desirous of acquiring the first campaign of julian which throws both franks and alemanni back across the rhine but grants the salian franks under solemn oath their established territory in the netherlands must be traced at another time  thus much of their salian epithet may be enough but from the interpretation of the frankish one we are still as far as ever and must be content in the meantime to stay so noting however two ideas afterwards entangled with the name which are of much descriptive importance to us  32 the french poet in the first book of his franciades says mons favine but what poet i know not nor can enquire encounters in the sense of enquarters or depicts as a herald certain fables on the name of the french by the adoption and composure of two gaulish words joyned together phereencos which signifieth bearelaunce shakelance we might perhaps venture to translate a lighter weapon than the spear beginning here to quiver in the hand of its chivalryand fereencos then passing swiftly on the tongue into francosa derivation not to be adopted but the idea of the weapon most carefullytogether with this followingthat among the arms of the ancient french over and beside the launce was the battaileaxe which they called anchon and moreover yet to this day in many provinces of france it is termed an achon wherewith they served themselves in warre by throwing it a farre off at joyning with the enemy onely to discover the man and to cleave his shield because this achon was darted with such violence as it would cleave the shield and compell the maister thereof to hold down his arm and being so discovered as naked or unarmed it made way for the sooner surprizing of him it seemeth that this weapon was proper and particuler to the french souldior as well him on foote as on horsebacke for this cause they called it franciscus francisca securis oblonga quam franci librabant in hostes for the horseman beside his shield and francisca armes common as wee have said to the footman had also the lance which being broken and serving to no further effect he laid hand on his francisca as we learn the use of that weapon in the archbishop of tours his second book and twentyseventh chapter  33 it is satisfactory to find how respectfully these lessons of the archbishop of tours were received by the french knights and curious to see the preferred use of the francisca by all the best of themdown not only to coeur de lions time but even to the day of poitiers in the last wrestle of the battle at poitiers gate là fit le roy jehan de sa main merveilles darmes et tenoit une hache de guerre dont bien se deffendoit et combattoitsi la quartre partie de ses gens luy eussent ressemblé la journée eust été pour eux still more notably in the episode of fight which froissart stops to tell just before between the sire de verclef on severn and the picard squire jean de helennes the englishman losing his sword dismounts to recover it on which helennes casts his own at him with such aim and force quil acconsuit langlois es cuisses tellement que lespée entra dedans et le cousit tout parmi jusquau hans  on this the knight rendering himself the squire binds his wound and nurses him staying fifteen days pour lamour de lui at chasteleraut while his life was in danger and afterwards carrying him in a litter all the way to his own chastel in picardy his ransom however is 6000 noblesi suppose about 25000 pounds of our present estimate and you may set down for one of the fatallest signs that the days of chivalry are near their darkening how devint celuy escuyer chevalier pour le grand profit quil eut du seigneur de verclef  i return gladly to the dawn of chivalry when every hour and year men were becoming more gentle and more wise while even through their worst cruelty and error native qualities of noblest cast may be seen asserting themselves for primal motive and submitting themselves for future training  34 we have hitherto got no farther in our notion of a salian frank than a glimpse of his two principal weaponsthe shadow of him however begins to shape itself to us on the mist of the brocken bearing the lance light passing into the javelinbut the axe his woodmans weapon heavyfor economical reasons in scarcity of iron preferablest of all weapons giving the fullest swing and weight of blow with least quantity of actual metal and roughest forging gibbon gives them also a weighty sword suspended from a broad belt but gibbons epithets are always gratis and the belted sword whatever its measure was probably for the leaders only the belt itself of gold the distinction of the roman counts and doubtless adopted from them by the allied frank leaders afterwards taking the pauline mythic meaning of the girdle of truthand so finally the chief mark of belted knighthood  35 the shield for all was round wielded like a highlanders targetarmour presumably nothing but hardtanned leather or patiently close knitted hemp their close apparel says mr gibbon accurately expressed the figure of their limbs but apparel is only miltonicgibbonian for nobody knows what he is more intelligible of their persons the lofty stature of the franks and their blue eyes denoted a germanic origin the warlike barbarians were trained from their earliest youth to run to leap to swim to dart the javelin and battleaxe with unerring aim to advance without hesitation against a superior enemy and to maintain either in life or death the invincible reputation of their ancestors vi 95 for the first time in 358 appalled by the emperor julians victory at strasburg and besieged by him upon the meuse a body of six hundred franks dispensed with the ancient law which commanded them to conquer or die although they were strongly actuated by the allurements of rapine they professed a disinterested love of war which they considered as the supreme honour and felicity of human nature and their minds and bodies were so hardened by perpetual action that according to the lively expression of an orator the snows of winter were as pleasant to them as the flowers of spring iii 220  36 these mental and bodily virtues or indurations were probably universal in the military rank of the nation but we learn presently with surprise of so remarkably free a people that nobody but the king and royal family might wear their hair to their own liking the kings wore theirs in flowing ringlets on the back and shouldersthe queens in tresses rippling to their feetbut all the rest of the nation were obliged either by law or custom to shave the hinder part of their head to comb their short hair over their forehead and to content themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers  37 moustachesmr gibbon means i imagine and i take leave also to suppose that the nobles and noble ladies might wear such tress and ringlet as became them but again we receive unexpectedly embarrassing light on the democratic institutions of the franks in being told that the various trades the labours of agriculture and the arts of hunting and fishing were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign  servile and emolument however though at first they sound very dreadful and very wrong are only miltonicgibbonian expressions of the general fact that the frankish kings had ploughmen in their fields employed weavers and smiths to make their robes and swords hunted with huntsmen hawked with falconers and were in other respects tyrannical to the ordinary extent that an english master of hounds may be the mansion of the longhaired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables for poultry and cattle the garden was planted with useful vegetables the magazines filled with corn and wine either for sale or consumption and the whole administration conducted by the strictest rules of private economy  38 i have collected these imperfect and not always extremely consistent notices of the aspect and temper of the franks out of mr gibbons casual references to them during a period of more than two centuriesand the last passage quoted which he accompanies with the statement that one hundred and sixty of these rural palaces were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom without telling us what kingdom or at what period must i think be held descriptive of the general manner and system of their monarchy after the victories of clovis but from the first hour you hear of him the frank closely considered is always an extremely ingenious well meaning and industrious personageif eagerly acquisitive also intelligently conservative and constructive an element of order and crystalline edification which is to consummate itself one day in the aisles of amiens and things generally insuperable and impregnable if the inhabitants of them had been as soundhearted as their builders for many a day beyond  39 but for the present we must retrace our ground a little for indeed i have lately observed with compunction in rereading some of my books for revised issue that if ever i promise in one number or chapter careful consideration of any particular point in the next the next never does touch upon the promised point at all but is sure to fix itself passionately on some antithetic antipathic or antipodic point in the opposite hemisphere this manner of conducting a treatise i find indeed extremely conducive to impartiality and largeness of view but can conceive it to beto the general readernot only disappointing if indeed i may flatter myself that i ever interest enough to disappoint but even liable to confirm in his mind some of the fallacious and extremely absurd insinuations of adverse critics respecting my inconsistency vacillation and liability to be affected by changes of the weather in my principles or opinions i purpose therefore in these historical sketches at least to watch and i hope partly to correct myself in this fault of promise breaking and at whatever sacrifice of my variously fluent or refluent humour to tell in each successive chapter in some measure what the reader justifiably expects to be told  40 i left merely glanced at in my opening chapter the story of the vase of soissons it may be found and it is very nearly the only thing that is to be found respecting the personal life or character of the first louis in every cheap popular history of france with cheap popular moralities engrafted thereon had i time to trace it to its first sources perhaps it might take another aspect but i give it as you may anywhere find itasking you only to consider whether even as so readit may not properly bear a somewhat different moral  41 the story is then that after the battle of soissons in the division of roman or gallic spoil the king wished to have a beautifully wrought silver vase forhimself i was going to writeand in my last chapter did mistakenly infer that he wanted it for his better selfhis queen but he wanted it for neitherit was to restore to st remy that it might remain among the consecrated treasures of rheims that is the first point on which the popular histories do not insist and which one of his warriors claiming equal division of treasure chose also to ignore the vase was asked by the king in addition to his own portion and the frank knights while they rendered true obedience to their king as a leader had not the smallest notion of allowing him what more recent kings call royaltiestaxes on everything they touch and one of these frank knights or countsa little franker than the restand as incredulous of st remys saintship as a protestant bishop or positivist philosophertook upon him to dispute the kings and the churchs claim in the manner suppose of a liberal opposition in the house of commons and disputed it with such security of support by the public opinion of the fifth century thatthe king persisting in his requestthe fearless soldier dashed the vase to pieces with his waraxe exclaiming thou shalt have no more than thy portion by lot  42 it is the first clear assertion of french liberté fraternité and egalité supported then as now by the destruction which is the only possible active operation of free personages on the art they cannot produce  the king did not continue the quarrel cowards will think that he paused in cowardice and malicious persons that he paused in malignity he did pause in anger assuredly but biding its time which the anger of a strong man always can and burn hotter for the waiting which is one of the chief reasons for christians being told not to let the sun go down upon it precept which christians nowadays are perfectly ready to obey if it is somebody else who has been injured and indeed the difficulty in such cases is usually to get them to think of the injury even while the sun rises on their wrath18  footnote 18 read mr plimsolls article on coal mines for instance  43 the sequel is very shocking indeedto modern sensibility i give it in the if not polished at least delicately varnished language of the pictorial history  about a year afterwards on reviewing his troops he went to the man who had struck the vase and examining his arms complained that they were in bad condition italics mine and threw them what shield and sword on the ground the soldier stooped to recover them and at that moment the king struck him on the head with his battleaxe crying thus didst thou to the vase at soissons the moral modern historian proceeds to reflect that thisas an evidence of the condition of the franks and of the ties by which they were united gives but the idea of a band of robbers and their chief which is indeed so far as i can myself look into and decipher the nature of things the primary idea to be entertained respecting most of the kingly and military organizations in this world down to our own day and unless perchance it be the afghans and zulus who are stealing our lands in englandinstead of we theirs in their several countries but concerning the manner of this piece of military execution i must for the present leave the reader to consider with himself whether indeed it be less kingly or more savage to strike an uncivil soldier on the head with ones own battleaxe than for instance to strike a person like sir thomas more on the neck with an executionersusing for the mechanism and as it were guillotine bar and rope to the blowthe manageable forms of national law and the gracefully twined intervention of a polite group of noblemen and bishops  44 far darker things have to be told of him than this as his proud life draws towards the closethings which if any of us could see clear through darkness you should be told in all the truth of them but we never can know the truth of sin for its nature is to deceive alike on the one side the sinner on the other the judge diabolicbetraying whether we yield to it or condemn here is gibbons sneerif you care for it but i gather first from the confused paragraphs which conduct to it the sentences of praise less niggard than the sage of lausanne usually grants to any hero who has confessed the influence of christianity  45 clovis when he was no more than fifteen years of age succeeded by his fathers death to the command of the salian tribe the narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the island of the batavians with the ancient dioceses of tournay and arras and at the baptism of clovis the number of his warriors could not exceed five thousand the kindred tribes of the franks who had seated themselves along the scheldt the meuse the moselle and the rhine were governed by their independent kings of the merovingian race the equals the allies and sometimes the enemies of the salic prince when he first took the field he had neither gold nor silver in his coffers nor wine and corn in his magazines but he imitated the example of cæsar who in the same country had acquired wealth by the sword and purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest the untamed spirit of the barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline at the annual review of the month of march their arms were diligently inspected and when they traversed a peaceful territory they were prohibited from touching a blade of grass the justice of clovis was inexorable and his careless or disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death it would be superfluous to praise the valour of a frank but the valour of clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence in all his transactions with mankind he calculated the weight of interest of passion and of opinion and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the germans and sometimes moderated by the milder genius of rome and christianity  46 but the savage conqueror of gaul was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion which depends on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative theology he was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of the gospel which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert his ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and christian duties his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war and as soon as clovis had dismissed a synod of the gallican church he calmly assassinated all the princes of the merovingian race  47 it is too true but rhetorically put in the first placefor we ought to be told how many all the princes werein the second place we must note that supposing clovis had in any degree searched the scriptures as presented to the western world by st jerome he was likely as a soldierking to have thought more of the mission of joshua19 and jehu than of the patience of christ whose sufferings he thought rather of avenging than imitating and the question whether the other kings of the franks should either succeed him or in envy of his enlarged kingdom attack and dethrone was easily in his mind convertible from a personal danger into the chance of the return of the whole nation to idolatry and in the last place his faith in the divine protection of his cause had been shaken by his defeat before aries by the ostrogoths and the frank leopard had not so wholly changed his spots as to surrender to an enemy the opportunity of a first spring  footnote 19 the likeness was afterwards taken up by legend and the walls of angoulême after the battle of poitiers are said to have fallen at the sound of the trumpets of clovis a miracle says gibbon which may be reduced to the supposition that some clerical engineer had secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart i cannot too often warn my honest readers against the modern habit of reducing all history whatever to the supposition that  etc etc the legend is of course the natural and easy expression of a metaphor  48 finally and beyond all these personal questions the forms of cruelty and subtletythe former observe arising much out of a scorn of pain which was a condition of honour in their women as well as men are in these savage races all founded on their love of glory in war which can only be understood by comparing what remains of the same temper in the higher castes of the north american indians and before tracing in final clearness the actual events of the reign of clovis to their end the reader will do well to learn this list of the personages of the great drama taking to heart the meaning of the name of each both in its probable effect on the mind of its bearer and in its fateful expression of the course of their acts and the consequences of it to future generations  1 clovis frank form hluodoveh glorious holiness or       consecration latin chlodovisus when baptized by st       remy softening afterwards through the centuries into

crowned when he was only fifteen five years afterwards he challenges in the spirit and almost in the language of chivalry the roman governor syagrius holding the district of rheims and soissons campum sibi præparari jussithe commanded his antagonist to prepare him a battlefieldsee gibbons note and reference chap xxxviii 6 297 the benedictine abbey of nogent was afterwards built on the field marked by a circle of pagan sepulchres clovis bestowed the adjacent lands of leuilly and coucy on the church of rheims20  footnote 20 whenfor this tradition as well as that of the vase points to a friendship between clovis and st remy and a singular respect on the kings side for the christians of gaul though he was not yet himself converted  ad 485 the battle of soissons not dated by gibbon the subsequent death of syagrius at the court of the younger alaric was in 486take 485 for the battle  50 ad 493 i cannot find any account of the relations between clovis and the king of burgundy the uncle of clotilde which preceded his betrothal to the orphan princess her uncle according to the common history had killed both her father and mother and compelled her sister to take the veilmotives none assigned nor authorities clotilde herself was pursued on her way to france21 and the litter in which she travelled captured with part of her marriage portion but the princess herself mounted on horseback and rode with part of her escort forward into france ordering her attendants to set fire to everything that pertained to her uncle and his subjects which they might meet with on the way  footnote 21 it is a curious proof of the want in vulgar historians of the slightest sense of the vital interest of anything they tell that neither in gibbon nor in messrs bussey and gaspey nor in the elaborate histoire des villes de france can i find with the best research my winters morning allows what city was at this time the capital of burgundy or at least in which of its four nominal capitalsdijon besancon geneva and vienneclotilde was brought up the evidence seems to me in favour of viennecalled always by messrs b and g vienna with what effect on the minds of their dimly geographical readers i cannot saythe rather that clotildes mother is said to have been thrown into the rhone with a stone round her neck the author of the introduction to bourgogne in the histoire des villes is so eager to get his little spiteful snarl at anything like religion anywhere that he entirely forgets the existence of the first queen of francenever names her nor as such the place of her birthbut contributes only to the knowledge of the young student this beneficial quota that gondeband plus politique que guerrier trouva au milieu de ses controverses théologiques avec avitus évêque de vienne le temps de faire mourir ses trois frères et de recueillir leur heritage  the one broad fact which my own readers will find it well to remember is that burgundy at this time by whatever king or victor tribe its inhabitants may be subdued does practically include the whole of french switzerland and even of the german as far east as vindonissathe reuss from vindonissa through lucerne to the st gothard being its effective eastern boundary that westwardit meant all jura and the plains of the saone and southward included all savoy and dauphiné according to the author of la suisse historique clotilde was first addressed by cloviss herald disguised as a beggar while she distributed alms at the gate of st pierre at geneva and her departure and pursued flight into france were from dijon  51 the fact is not chronicled usually among the sayings or doings of the saints but the punishment of kings by destroying the property of their subjects is too well recognized a method of modern christian warfare to allow our indignation to burn hot against clotilde driven as she was hard by grief and wrath the years of her youth are not counted to us clovis was already twentyseven and for three years maintained the faith of his ancestral religion against all the influence of his queen  52 ad 496 i did not in the opening chapter attach nearly enough importance to the battle of tolbiac thinking of it as merely compelling the alemanni to recross the rhine and establishing the frank power on its western bank but infinitely wider results are indicated in the short sentence with which gibbon closes his account of the battle after the conquest of the western provinces the franks alone retained their ancient possessions beyond the rhine they gradually subdued and civilized the exhausted countries as far as the elbe and the mountains of bohemia and the peace of europe was secured by the obedience of germany  53 for in the south theodoric had already sheathed the sword in the pride of victory and the vigour of his ageand his farther reign of three and thirty years was consecrated to the duties of civil government even when his soninlaw alaric fell by clovis hand in the battle of poitiers theodoric was content to check the frank power at arles without pursuing his success and to protect his infant grandchild correcting at the same time some abuses in the civil government of spain so that the healing sovereignty of the great goth was established from sicily to the danubeand from sirmium to the atlantic ocean  54 thus then at the close of the fifth century you have europe divided simply by her watershed and two christian kings reigning with entirely beneficent and healthy powerone in the northone in the souththe mightiest and worthiest of them married to the others youngest sister a saint queen in the northand a devoted and earnest catholic woman queen mother in the south it is a conjunction of things memorable enough in the earths historymuch to be thought of o fast whirling reader if ever out of the crowd of pent up cattle driven across rhine or adige you can extricate yourself for an hour to walk peacefully out of the south gate of cologne or across fra giocondos bridge at veronaand so pausing look through the clear air across the battlefield of tolbiac to the blue drachenfels or across the plain of st ambrogio to the mountains of garda for there were foughtif you will think closelythe two victorbattles of the christian world constantines only gave changed form and dying colour to the falling walls of rome but the frank and gothic races thus conquering and thus ruled founded the arts and established the laws which gave to all future europe her joy and her virtue and it is lovely to see how even thus early the feudal chivalry depended for its life on the nobleness of its womanhood there was no vision seen or alleged at tolbiac the king prayed simply to the god of clotilde on the morning of the battle of verona theodoric visited the tent of his mother and his sister and requested that on the most illustrious festival of his life they would adorn him with the rich garments which they had worked with their own hands  55 but over clovis there was extended yet another influencegreater than his queens when his kingdom was first extended to the loire the shepherdess of nanterre was already agedno torchbearing maid of battle like clotilde no knightly leader of deliverance like jeanne but grey in meekness of wisdom and now filling more and more with crystal light cloviss father had known her he himself made her his friend and when he left paris on the campaign of poitiers vowed that if victorious he would build a christian church on the hills of seine he returned in victory and with st genevieve at his side stood on the site of the ruined roman thermæ just above the isle of paris to fulfil his vow and to design the limits of the foundations of the first metropolitan church of frankish christendom  the king gave his battleaxe the swing and tossed it with his full force  measuring with its flight also the place of his own grave and of clotildes and st genevieves  there they rested and restin soultogether la colline tout entière porte encore le nom de la patronne de paris une petite rue obscure a gardé celui du roi conquerant     our fathers have told us  advice   the three chapters22 of our fathers have told us now submitted to the public are enough to show the proposed character and tendencies of the work to which contrary to my usual custom i now invite subscription because the degree in which i can increase its usefulness by engraved illustration must greatly depend on the known number of its supporters  footnote 22 viz chapters i and ii and the separate travellers edition of chapter iv  i do not recognize in the present state of my health any reason to fear more loss of general power whether in conception or industry than is the proper and appointed check of an old mans enthusiasm of which however enough remains in me to warrant my readers against the abandonment of a purpose entertained already for twenty years  the work if i live to complete it will consist of ten parts each taking up some local division of christian history and gathering towards their close into united illustration of the power of the church in the thirteenth century  the next chapter which i hope to issue soon after christmas completes the first part descriptive of the early frank power and of its final skill in the cathedral of amiens  the second part ponte della pietra will i hope do more for theodoric and verona than i have been able to do for clovis and the first capital of france  the third ara celi will trace the foundations of the papal power  the fourth ponteamare and fifth ponte vecchio will only with much difficulty gather into brief form what i have by me of scattered materials respecting pisa and florence  the sixth valle crucis will be occupied with the monastic architecture of england and wales  the seventh the springs of eure will be wholly given to the cathedral of chartres  the eighth domrémy to that of rouen and the schools of architecture which it represents  the ninth the bay of uri to the pastoral forms of catholicism reaching to our own times  and the tenth the bells of cluse to the pastoral protestantism of savoy geneva and the scottish border  each part will consist of four sections only and one of them the fourth will usually be descriptive of some monumental city or cathedral the resultant and remnant of the religious power examined in the preparatory chapters  one illustration at least will be given with each chapter23 and drawings made for others which will be placed at once in the sheffield museum for public reference and engraved as i find support or opportunity for binding with the completed work  footnote 23 the first plate for the bible of amiens curiously enough failed in the engraving and i shall probably have to etch it myself it will be issued with the fourth in the fullsize edition of the fourth chapter  as in the instance of chapter iv of this first part a smaller edition of the descriptive chapters will commonly be printed in reduced form for travellers and nonsubscribers but otherwise i intend this work to be furnished to subscribers only     chapter iii  the lion tamer   1 it has been often of late announced as a new discovery that man is a creature of circumstances and the fact has been pressed upon our notice in the hope which appears to some people so pleasing of being able at last to resolve into a succession of splashes in mud or whirlwinds in air the circumstances answerable for his creation but the more important fact that his nature is not levelled like a mosquitos to the mists of a marsh nor reduced like a moles beneath the crumblings of a burrow but has been endowed with sense to discern and instinct to adopt the conditions which will make of it the best that can be is very necessarily ignored by philosophers who propose as a beautiful fulfilment of human destinies a life entertained by scientific gossip in a cellar lighted by electric sparks warmed by tubular inflation drained by buried rivers and fed by the ministry of less learned and better provisioned races with extract of beef and potted crocodile  2 from these chemically analytic conceptions of a paradise in catacombs undisturbed in its alkaline or acid virtues by the dread of deity or hope of futurity i know not how far the modern reader may willingly withdraw himself for a little time to hear of men who in their darkest and most foolish day sought by their labour to make the desert as the garden of the lord and by their love to become worthy of permission to live with him for ever it has nevertheless been only by such toil and in such hope that hitherto the happiness skill or virtue of man have been possible and even on the verge of the new dispensation and promised canaan rich in beatitudes of iron steam and fire there are some of us here and there who may pause in filial piety to look back towards that wilderness of sinai in which their fathers worshipped and died  illustration plate iiiamiens jour des trÉpassÉs 1880  3 admitting then for the moment that the main streets of manchester the district immediately surrounding the bank in london and the bourse and boulevards of paris are already part of the future kingdom of heaven when earth shall be all bourse and boulevardthe world of which our fathers tell us was divided to them as you already know partly by climates partly by races partly by times and the circumstances under which a mans soul was given to him had to be considered under these three headsin what climate is he of what race at what time  he can only be what these conditions permit with appeal to these he is to be heardunderstood if it may bejudged by our love firstby our pity if he need itby our humility finally and always  4 to this end it is needful evidently that we should have truthful maps of the world to begin with and truthful maps of our own hearts to end with neither of these maps being easily drawn at any time and perhaps least of all nowwhen the use of a map is chiefly to exhibit hotels and railroads and humility is held the disagreeablest and meanest of the seven mortal sins  5 thus in the beginning of sir edward creasys history of england you find a map purporting to exhibit the possessions of the british nationillustrating the extremely wise and courteous behaviour of mr fox to a frenchman of napoleons suite in advancing to a terrestrial globe of unusual magnitude and distinctness spreading his arms round it over both the oceans and both the indies and observing in this impressive attitude that while englishmen live they overspread the whole world and clasp it in the circle of their power  6 fired by mr foxs enthusiasmthe otherwise seldom fierysir edward proceeds to tell us that our island home is the favourite domicile of freedom empire and glory without troubling himself or his readers to consider how long the nations over whom our freedom is imperious and in whose shame is our glory may be satisfied in that arrangement of the globe and its affairs or may be even at present convinced of their degraded position in it by his method of its delineation  for the map being drawn on mercators projection represents therefore the british dominions in north america as twice the size of the states and considerably larger than all south america put together while the brilliant crimson with which all our landed property is coloured cannot but impress the innocent reader with the idea of a universal flush of freedom and glory throughout all those acres and latitudes so that he is scarcely likely to cavil at results so marvellous by inquiring into the nature and completeness of our government at any particular placefor instance in ireland in the hebrides or at the cape  7 in the closing chapter of the first volume of the laws of fésole i have laid down the mathematical principles of rightly drawing mapsprinciples which for many reasons it is well that my young readers should learn the fundamental one being that you cannot flatten the skin of an orange without splitting it and must not if you draw countries on the unsplit skin stretch them afterwards to fill the gaps  the british pride of wealth which does not deny itself the magnificent convenience of penny walter scotts and penny shakespeares may assuredly in its future greatness possess itself also of penny universes conveniently spinnable on their axes i shall therefore assume that my readers can look at a round globe while i am talking of the world and at a properly reduced drawing of its surfaces when i am talking of a country  8 which if my reader can at present door at least refer to a fairly drawn doublecircle map of the globe with converging meridiansi will pray him next to observe that although the old division of the world into four quarters is now nearly effaced by emigration and atlantic cable yet the great historic question about the globe is not how it is divided here and there by ins and outs of land or sea but how it is divided into zones all round by irresistible laws of light and air it is often a matter of very minor interest to know whether a man is an american or african a european or an asiatic but it is a matter of extreme and final interest to know if he be a brazilian or a patagonian a japanese or a samoyede  9 in the course of the last chapter i asked the reader to hold firmly the conception of the great division of climate which separated the wandering races of norway and siberia from the calmly resident nations of britain gaul germany and dacia  fasten now that division well home in your mind by drawing however rudely the course of the two rivers little thought of by common geographers but of quite unspeakable importance in human history the vistula and the dniester  10 they rise within thirty miles of each other24 and each runs not counting ins and outs its clear three hundred milesthe vistula to the northeast the dniester to the southwest the two of them together cut europe straight across at the broad neck of itand more deeply looking at the thing they divide europe properly so calledeuropas own and jovesthe small educationable civilizable and more or less mentally rational fragment of the globe from the great siberian wilderness cisural and transural the inconceivable chaotic space occupied datelessly by scythians tartars huns cossacks bears ermines and mammoths in various thickness of hide frost of brain and woe of abodeor of unabiding nobodys history worth making out has anything to do with them for the force of scandinavia never came round by finland at all but always sailed or paddled itself across the baltic or down the rocky west coast and the siberian and russian icepressure merely drives the really memorable races into greater concentration and kneads them up in fiercer and more necessitous exploring masses but by those exploring masses of true european birth our own history was fashioned for ever and therefore these two truncating and guarding rivers are to be marked on your map of europe with supreme clearness the vistula with warsaw astride of it half way down and embouchure in balticthe dniester in euxine flowing each of them measured arrowstraight as far as from edinburgh to london with windings25 the vistula six hundred miles and the dniester fivecount them together for a thousand miles of moat between europe and the desert reaching from dantzic to odessa  footnote 24 taking the san branch of upper vistula  footnote 25 note however generally that the strength of a river cæteris paribus is to be estimated by its straight course windings being almost always caused by flats in which it can receive no tributaries  11 having got your europe moated off into this manageable and comprehensible space you are next to fix the limits which divide the four gothic countries britain gaul germany and dacia from the four classic countries spain italy greece and lydia  there is no other generally opponent term to gothic but classic and i am content to use it for the sake of practical breadth and clearness though its precise meaning for a little while remains unascertained only get the geography well into your mind and the nomenclature will settle itself at its leisure  12 broadly then you have sea between britain and spainpyrenees between gaul and spainalps between germany and italydanube between dacia and greece you must consider everything south of the danube as greek variously influenced from athens on one side byzantium on the other then across the Ægean you have the great country absurdly called asia minor for we might just as well call greece europe minor or cornwall england minor but which is properly to be remembered as lydia the country which infects with passion and tempts with wealth which taught the lydian measure in music and softened the greek language on its border into ionic which gave to ancient history the tale of troy and to christian history the glow and the decline of the seven churches  13 opposite to these four countries in the south but separated from them either by sea or desert are another four as easily rememberedmorocco libya egypt and arabia  morocco virtually consisting of the chain of atlas and the coasts depending on it may be most conveniently thought of as including the modern morocco and algeria with the canaries as a dependent group of islands  libya in like manner will include the modern tunis and tripoli it will begin on the west with st augustines town of hippo and its coast is colonized from tyre and greece dividing it into the two districts of carthage and cyrene egypt the country of the river and arabia the country of no river are to be thought of as the two great southern powers of separate religion  14 you have thus easily and clearly memorable twelve countries distinct evermore by natural laws and forming three zones from north to south all healthily habitablebut the races of the northernmost disciplined in endurance of cold those of the central zone perfected by the enjoyable suns alike of summer and winter those of the southern zone trained to endurance of heat writing them now in tabular view       britain       gaul       germany       dacia      spain         italy      greece        lydia      morocco       libya      egypt         arabia  you have the ground of all useful profane history mapped out in the simplest terms and then as the fount of inspiration for all these countries with the strength which every soul that has possessed has held sacred and supernatural you have last to conceive perfectly the small hill district of the holy land with philistia and syria on its flanks both of them chastising forces but syria in the beginning herself the origin of the chosen racea syrian ready to perish was my fatherand the syrian rachel being thought of always as the true mother of israel  15 and remember in all future study of the relations of these countries you must never allow your mind to be disturbed by the accidental changes of political limit no matter who rules a country no matter what it is officially called or how it is formally divided eternal bars and doors are set to it by the mountains and seas eternal laws enforced over it by the clouds and stars the people that are born on it are its people be they a thousand times again and again conquered exiled or captive the stranger cannot be its king the invader cannot be its possessor and although just laws maintained whether by the people or their conquerors have always the appointed good and strength of justice nothing is permanently helpful to any race or condition of men but the spirit that is in their own hearts kindled by the love of their native land  16 of course in saying that the invader cannot be the possessor of any country i speak only of invasion such as that by the vandals of libya or by ourselves of india where the conquering race does not become permanently inhabitant you are not to call libya vandalia nor india england because these countries are temporarily under the rule of vandals and english neither italy gothland under ostrogoths nor england denmark under canute national character varies as it fades under invasion or in corruption but if ever it glows again into a new life that life must be tempered by the earth and sky of the country itself of the twelve names of countries now given in their order only one will be changed as we advance in our historygaul will properly become france when the franks become her abiding inhabitants the other eleven primary names will serve us to the end  17 with a moments more patience therefore glancing to the far east we shall have laid the foundations of all our own needful geography as the northern kingdoms are moated from the scythian desert by the vistula so the southern are moated from the dynasties properly called oriental by the euphrates which partly sunk beneath the persian gulf reaches from the shores of beloochistan and oman to the mountains of armenia and forms a huge hotair funnel the base or mouth of which is on the tropics while its extremity reaches thirtyseven degrees of northern latitude hence it comes that the semoom itself the specific and gaseous semoom pays occasional visits to mosoul and djezeerat omer while the thermometer at bagdad attains in summer an elevation capable of staggering the belief of even an old indian26  footnote 26 sir f palgrave arabia vol ii p 155 i gratefully adopt in the next paragraph his division of asiatic nations p 160  18 this valley in ancient days formed the kingdom of assyria as the valley of the nile formed that of egypt in the work now before us we have nothing to do with its people who were to the jews merely a hostile power of captivity inexorable as the clay of their walls or the stones of their statues and after the birth of christ the marshy valley is no more than a field of battle between west and east beyond the great riverpersia india and china form the southern oriens persia is properly to be conceived as reaching from the persian gulf to the mountain chains which flank and feed the indus and is the true vital power of the east in the days of marathon but it has no influence on christian history except through arabia while of the northern asiatic tribes mede bactrian parthian and scythian changing into turk and tartar we need take no heed until they invade us in our own historic territory  19 using therefore the terms gothic and classic for broad distinction of the northern and central zones of this our own territory we may conveniently also use the word arab27 for the whole southern zone the influence of egypt vanishes soon after the fourth century while that of arabia powerful from the beginning rises in the sixth into an empire whose end we have not seen and you may most rightly conceive the religious principle which is the base of that empire by remembering that while the jews forfeited their prophetic power by taking up the profession of usury over the whole earth the arabs returned to the simplicity of prophecy in its beginning by the well of hagar and are not opponents to christianity but only to the faults or follies of christians they keep still their faith in the one god who spoke to abraham their father and are his children in that simplicity far more truly than the nominal christians who lived and live only to dispute in vociferous council or in frantic schism the relations of the father the son and the holy ghost  footnote 27 gibbons fiftysixth chapter begins with a sentence which may be taken as the epitome of the entire history we have to investigate the three great nations of the world the greeks the saracens and the franks encountered each other on the theatre of italy i use the more general word goths instead of franks and the more accurate word arab for saracen but otherwise the reader will observe that the division is the same as mine gibbon does not recognize the roman people as a nationbut only the roman power as an empire  20 trusting my reader then in future to retain in his mind without confusion the idea of the three zones gothic classic and arab each divided into four countries clearly recognizable through all ages of remote or recent historyi must farther at once simplify for him the idea of the roman empire see note to last paragraph in the manner of its affecting them its nominal extent temporary conquests civil dissensions or internal vices are scarcely of any historical moment at all the real empire is effectual only as an exponent of just law military order and mechanical art to untrained races and as a translation of greek thought into less diffused and more tenable scheme for them the classic zone from the beginning to the end of its visible authority is composed of these two elementsgreek imagination with roman order and the divisions or dislocations of the third and fourth century are merely the natural apparitions of their differences when the political system which concealed them was tested by christianity it seems almost wholly lost sight of by ordinary historians that in the wars of the last romans with the goths the great gothic captains were all christians and that the vigorous and naïve form which the dawning faith took in their minds is a more important subject of investigation by far than the inevitable wars which followed the retirement of diocletian or the confused schisms and crimes of the lascivious court of constantine i am compelled however to notice the terms in which the last arbitrary dissolutions of the empire took place that they may illustrate instead of confusing the arrangement of the nations which i would fasten in your memory  21 in the middle of the fourth century you have politically what gibbon calls the final division of the eastern and western empires this really means only that the emperor valentinian yielding though not without hesitation to the feeling now confirmed in the legions that the empire was too vast to be held by a single person takes his brother for his colleague and divides not truly speaking their authority but their attention between the east and the west to his brother valens he assigns the extremely vague præfecture of the east from the lower danube to the confines of persia while for his own immediate government he reserves the warlike præfectures of illyricum italy and gaul from the extremity of greece to the caledonian rampart and from the rampart of caledonia to the foot of mount atlas that is to say in less poetical cadence gibbon had better have put his history into hexameters at once valentinian kept under his own watch the whole of roman europe and africa and left lydia and caucasus to his brother lydia and caucasus never did and never could form an eastern empirethey were merely outside dependencies useful for taxation in peace dangerous by their multitudes in war there never was from the seventh century before christ to the seventh after christ but one roman empire which meant the power over humanity of such men as cincinnatus and agricola it expires as the race and temper of these expire the nominal extent of it or brilliancy at any moment is no more than the reflection farther or nearer upon the clouds of the flames of an altar whose fuel was of noble souls there is no true date for its division there is none for its destruction whether dacian probus or noric odoacer be on the throne of it the force of its living principle alone is to be watchedremaining in arts in laws and in habits of thought dominant still in europe down to the twelfth centuryin language and example dominant over all educated men to this hour  22 but in the nominal division of it by valentinian let us note gibbons definition i assume it to be his not the emperors of european roman empire into illyricum italy and gaul i have already said you must hold everything south of the danube for greek the two chief districts immediately south of the stream are upper and lower moesia consisting of the slope of the thracian mountains northward to the river with the plains between it and them this district you must notice for its importance in forming the moesogothic alphabet in which the greek is by far the principal element28 giving sixteen letters out of the twentyfour the gothic invasion under the reign of valens is the first that establishes a teutonic nation within the frontier of the empire but they only thereby bring themselves more directly under its spiritual power their bishop ulphilas adopts this moesian alphabet twothirds greek for his translation of the bible and it is universally disseminated and perpetuated by that translation until the extinction or absorption of the gothic race  footnote 28 milman hist of christianity vol iii p 36  23 south of the thracian mountains you have thrace herself and the countries confusedly called dalmatia and illyria forming the coast of the adriatic and reaching inwards and eastwards to the mountain watershed i have never been able to form a clear notion myself of the real character of the people of these districts in any given period but they are all to be massed together as northern greek having more or less of greek blood and dialect according to their nearness to greece proper though neither sharing in her philosophy nor submitting to her discipline but it is of course far more accurate in broad terms to speak of these illyrian moesian and macedonian districts as all greek than with gibbon or valentinian to speak of greece and macedonia as all illyrian29  footnote 29 i find the same generalization expressed to the modern student under the term balkan peninsula extinguishing every ray and trace of past history at once  24 in the same imperial or poetical generalization we find england massed with france under the term gaul and bounded by the caledonian rampart whereas in our own division caledonia hibernia and wales are from the first considered as essential parts of britain30 and the link with the continent is to be conceived as formed by the settlement of britons in brittany and not at all by roman authority beyond the humber  footnote 30 gibbons more deliberate statement its clear enough from the coast or the extremity of caithness and ulster the memory of celtic origin was distinctly preserved in the perpetual resemblance of languages religion and manners and the peculiar character of the british tribes might be naturally ascribed to the influence of accidental and local circumstances the lowland scots wheat eaters or wanderers and the irish are very positively identified by gibbon at the time our own history begins it is certain italics his not mine that in the declining age of the roman empire caledonia ireland and the isle of man were inhabited by the scotschap 25 vol iv p 279  the higher civilization and feebler courage of the lowland english rendered them either the victims of scotland or the grateful subjects of rome the mountaineers pict among the grampians or of their own colour in cornwall and wales have never been either instructed or subdued and remain to this day the artless and fearless strength of the british race  25 thus then once more reviewing our order of countries and noting only that the british islands though for the most part thrown by measured degree much north of the rest of the north zone are brought by the influence of the gulf stream into the same climateyou have at the time when our history of christianity begins the gothic zone yet unconverted and having not yet even heard of the new faith you have the classic zone variously and increasingly conscious of it disputing with it striving to extinguish itand your arab zone the ground and sustenance of it encompassing the holy land with the warmth of its own wings and cherishing thereembers of phoenix fire over all the earththe hope of resurrection  26 what would have been the course or issue of christianity had it been orally preached only and unsupported by its poetical literature might be the subject of deeply instructive speculationif a historians duty were to reflect instead of record the power of the christian faith was however in the fact of it always founded on the written prophecies and histories of the bible and on the interpretations of their meaning given by the example far more than by the precept of the great monastic orders the poetry and history of the syrian testaments were put within their reach by st jerome while the virtue and efficiency of monastic life are all expressed and for the most part summed in the rule of st benedict to understand the relation of the work of these two men to the general order of the church is quite the first requirement for its farther intelligible history  gibbons thirtyseventh chapter professes to give an account of the institution of the monastic life in the third century but the monastic life had been instituted somewhat earlier and by many prophets and kings by jacob when he laid the stone for his pillow by moses when he drew aside to see the burning bush by david before he had left those few sheep in the wilderness and by the prophet who was in the deserts till the time of his showing unto israel its primary institution for europe was numas in that of the vestal virgins and college of augurs founded on the originally etrurian and derived roman conception of pure life dedicate to the service of god and practical wisdom dependent on his guidance31  footnote 31 i should myself mark as the fatallest instant in the decline of the roman empire julians rejection of the counsel of the augurs for the last time the etruscan haruspices accompanied a roman emperor but by a singular fatality their adverse interpretation by the signs of heaven was disdained and julian followed the advice of the philosophers who coloured their predictions with the bright hues of the emperors ambition milman hist of christianity chap vi  the form which the monastic spirit took in later times depended far more on the corruption of the common world from which it was forced to recoil either in indignation or terror than on any change brought about by christianity in the ideal of human virtue and happiness  27 egypt mr gibbon thus begins to account for the new institution the fruitful parent of superstition afforded the first example of monastic life egypt had her superstitions like other countries but was so little the parent of superstition that perhaps no faith among the imaginative races of the world has been so feebly missionary as hers she never prevailed on even the nearest of her neighbours to worship cats or cobras with her and i am alone to my belief among recent scholars in maintaining herodotus statement of her influence on the archaic theology of greece but that influence if any was formative and delineative not ritual so that in no case and in no country was egypt the parent of superstition while she was beyond all dispute for all people and to all time the parent of geometry astronomy architecture and chivalry she was in its material and technic elements the mistress of literature showing authors who before could only scratch on wax and wood how to weave paper and engrave porphyry she was the first exponent of the law of judgment after death for sin she was the tutress of moses and the hostess of christ  28 it is both probable and natural that in such a country the disciples of any new spiritual doctrine should bring it to closer trial than was possible among the illiterate warriors or in the stormvexed solitudes of the north yet it is a thoughtless error to deduce the subsequent power of cloistered fraternity from the lonely passions of egyptian monachism the anchorites of the first three centuries vanish like feverish spectres when the rational merciful and laborious laws of christian societies are established and the clearly recognizable rewards of heavenly solitude are granted to those only who seek the desert for its redemption  29 the clearly recognizable rewards i repeat and with cautious emphasis no man has any data for estimating far less right of judging the results of a life of resolute selfdenial until he has had the courage to try it himself at least for a time but i believe no reasonable person will wish and no honest person dare to deny the benefits he has occasionally felt both in mind and body during periods of accidental privation from luxury or exposure to danger the extreme vanity of the modern englishman in making a momentary stylites of himself on the top of a horn or an aiguille and his occasional confession of a charm in the solitude of the rocks of which he modifies nevertheless the poignancy with his pocket newspaper and from the prolongation of which he thankfully escapes to the nearest tabledhôte ought to make us less scornful of the pride and more intelligent of the passion in which the mountain anchorites of arabia and palestine condemned themselves to lives of seclusion and suffering which were comforted only by supernatural vision or celestial hope that phases of mental disease are the necessary consequence of exaggerated and independent emotion of any kind must of course be remembered in reading the legends of the wilderness but neither physicians nor moralists have yet attempted to distinguish the morbid states of intellect32 which are extremities of noble passion from those which are the punishments of ambition avarice or lasciviousness  footnote 32 gibbons hypothetical conclusion respecting the effects of selfmortification and his following historical statement must be noted as in themselves containing the entire views of the modern philosophies and policies which have since changed the monasteries of italy into barracks and the churches of france into magazines this voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of mind and body nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are capable of any lively affection for the rest of mankind a cruel unfeeling temper has characterized the monks of every age and country  how much of penetration or judgment this sentence exhibits i hope will become manifest to the reader as i unfold before him the actual history of his faith but being i suppose myself one of the last surviving witnesses of the character of recluse life as it still existed in the beginning of this century i can point to the portraiture of it given by scott in the introduction to the monastery as one perfect and trustworthy to the letter and to the spirit and for myself can say that the most gentle refined and in the deepest sense amiable phases of character i have ever known have been either those of monks or of servants trained in the catholic faith  30 setting all questions of this nature aside for the moment my younger readers need only hold the broad fact that during the whole of the fourth century multitudes of selfdevoted men led lives of extreme misery and poverty in the effort to obtain some closer knowledge of the being and will of god we know in any available clearness neither what they suffered nor what they learned we cannot estimate the solemnizing or reproving power of their examples on the less zealous christian world and only god knows how far their prayers for it were heard or their persons accepted this only we may observe with reverence that among all their numbers none seemed to have repented their chosen manner of existence none perish by melancholy or suicide their selfadjudged sufferings are never inflicted in the hope of shortening the lives they embitter or purify and the hours of dream or meditation on mountain or in cave appear seldom to have dragged so heavily as those which without either vision or reflection we pass ourselves on the embankment and in the tunnel  31 but whatever may be alleged after ultimate and honest scrutiny of the follies or virtues of anchorite life we are unjust to jerome if we think of him as its introducer into the west of europe he passed through it himself as a phase of spiritual discipline but he represents in his total nature and final work not the vexed inactivity of the eremite but the eager industry of a benevolent tutor and pastor his heart is in continual fervour of admiration or of hoperemaining to the last as impetuous as a childs but as affectionate and the discrepancies of protestant objection by which his character has been confused or concealed may be gathered into some dim picture of his real self when once we comprehend the simplicity of his faith and sympathise a little with the eager charity which can so easily be wounded into indignation and is never repressed by policy  32 the slight trust which can be placed in modern readings of him as they now stand may be at once proved by comparing the two passages in which milman has variously guessed at the leading principles of his political conduct jerome began  and ended his career as a monk of palestine he attained he aspired to no dignity in the church though ordained a presbyter against his will he escaped the episcopal dignity which was forced upon his distinguished contemporaries history of christianity book iii  jerome cherished the secret hope if it was not the avowed object of his ambition to succeed damasus as bishop of rome is the rejection of an aspirant so singularly unfit for the station from his violent passions his insolent treatment of his adversaries his utter want of selfcommand his almost unrivalled faculty of awakening hatred to be attributed to the sagacious and intuitive wisdom of rome history of latin christianity book i chap ii  33 you may observe as an almost unexceptional character in the sagacious wisdom of the protestant clerical mind that it instinctively assumes the desire of power and place not only to be universal in priesthood but to be always purely selfish in the ground of it the idea that power might possibly be desired for the sake of its benevolent use so far as i remember does not once occur in the pages of any ecclesiastical historian of recent date in our own reading of past ages we will with the readers permission very calmly put out of court all accounts of hopes cherished in secret and pay very small attention to the reasons for mediæval conduct which appear logical to the rationalist and probable to the politician33 we concern ourselves only with what these singular and fantastic christians of the past really said and assuredly did  footnote 33 the habit of assuming for the conduct of men of sense and feeling motives intelligible to the foolish and probable to the base gains upon every vulgar historian partly in the ease of it partly in the pride and it is horrible to contemplate the quantity of false witness against their neighbours which commonplace writers commit in the mere rounding and enforcing of their shallow sentences jerome admits indeed with specious but doubtful humility the inferiority of the unordained monk to the ordained priest says dean milman in his eleventh chapter following up his gratuitous doubt of jeromes humility with no less gratuitous asseveration of the ambition of his opponents the clergy no doubt had the sagacity to foresee the dangerous rival as to influence and authority which was rising up in christian society  34 jeromes life by no means began as a monk of palestine dean milman has not explained to us how any mans could but jeromes childhood at any rate was extremely other than recluse or precociously religious he was born of rich parents living on their own estate the name of his native town in north illyria stridon perhaps now softened into strigi near aquileia in venetian climate at all events and in sight of alps and sea he had a brother and sister a kind grandfather and a disagreeable private tutor and was a youth still studying grammar at julians death in 363  35 a youth of eighteen and well begun in all institutes of the classic schools but so far from being a monk not yet a christiannor at all disposed towards the severer offices even of roman life or contemplating with aversion the splendours either worldly or sacred which shone on him in the college days spent in its capital city  for the power and majesty of paganism were still concentrated at rome the deities of the ancient faith found their last refuge in the capital of the empire to the stranger rome still offered the appearance of a pagan city it contained one hundred and fiftytwo temples and one hundred and eighty smaller chapels or shrines still sacred to their tutelary god and used for public worship christianity had neither ventured to usurp those few buildings which might be converted to her use still less had she the power to destroy them the religious edifices were under the protection of the præfect of the city and the præfect was usually a pagan at all events he would not permit any breach of the public peace or violation of public property above all still towered the capitol in its unassailed and awful majesty with its fifty temples or shrines bearing the most sacred names in the religious and civil annals of rome those of jove of mars of janus of romulus of cæsar of victory some years after the accession of theodosius to the eastern empire the sacrifices were still performed as national rites at the public costthe pontiffs made their offerings in the name of the whole human race the pagan orator ventures to assert that the emperor dared not to endanger the safety of the empire by their abolition the emperor still bore the title and insignia of the supreme pontiff the consuls before they entered upon their functions ascended the capitol the religious processions passed along the crowded streets and the people thronged to the festivals and theatres which still formed part of the pagan worship34  footnote 34 milman history of christianity vol iii p 162 note the sentence in italics for it relates the true origin of the papacy  36 here jerome must have heard of what by all the christian sects was held the judgment of god between them and their chief enemythe death of the emperor julian but i have no means of tracing and will not conjecture the course of his own thoughts until the tenor of all his life was changed at his baptism the candour which lies at the basis of his character has given us one sentence of his own respecting that change which is worth some volumes of ordinary confessions i left not only parents and kindred but the accustomed luxuries of delicate life the words throw full light on what to our less courageous temper seems the exaggerated reading by the early converts of christs words to themhe that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me we are content to leave for much lower interests either father or mother and do not see the necessity of any farther sacrifice we should know more of ourselves and of christianity if we oftener sustained what st jerome found the more searching trial i find scattered indications of contempt among his biographers because he could not resign one indulgencethat of scholarship and the usual sneers at monkish ignorance and indolence are in his case transferred to the weakness of a pilgrim who carried his library in his wallet it is a singular question putting as it is the modern fashion to do the idea of providence wholly aside whether but for the literary enthusiasm which was partly a weakness of this old mans character the bible would ever have become the library of europe  37 for that observe is the real meaning in its first power of the word bible not book merely but bibliotheca treasury of books and it is i repeat a singular question how far if jerome at the very moment when rome his tutress ceased from her material power had not made her language the oracle of hebrew prophecy a literature of their own and a religion unshadowed by the terrors of the mosaic law might have developed itself in the hearts of the goth the frank and the saxon under theodoric clovis and alfred  38 fate had otherwise determined and jerome was so passive an instrument in her hands that he began the study of hebrew as a discipline only and without any conception of the task he was to fulfil still less of the scope of its fulfilment i could joyfully believe that the words of christ if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead had haunted the spirit of the recluse until he resolved that the voices of immortal appeal should be made audible to the churches of all the earth but so far as we have evidence there was no such will or hope to exalt the quiet instincts of his natural industry and partly as a scholars exercise partly as an old mans recreation the severity of the latin language was softened like venetian crystal by the variable fire of hebrew thought and the book of books took the abiding form of which all the future art of the western nations was to be an hourly expanding interpretation  39 and in this matter you have to note that the gist of it lies not in the translation of the hebrew and greek scriptures into an easier and a common language but in their presentation to the church as of common authority the earlier gentile christians had naturally a tendency to carry out in various oral exaggeration or corruption the teaching of the apostle of the gentiles until their freedom from the bondage of the jewish law passed into doubt of its inspiration and after the fall of jerusalem even into horrorstricken interdiction of its observance so that only a few years after the remnant of exiled jews in pella had elected the gentile marcus for their bishop and obtained leave to return to the Ælia capitolina built by hadrian on mount zion it became a matter of doubt and controversy whether a man who sincerely acknowledged jesus as the messiah but who still continued to observe the law of moses could possibly hope for salvation35 while on the other hand the most learned and the most wealthy of the christian name under the generally recognised title of knowing gnostic had more insidiously effaced the authority of the evangelists by dividing themselves during the course of the third century into more than fifty numerably distinct sects and producing a multitude of histories in which the actions and discourses of christ and his apostles were adapted to their several tenets36  footnote 35 gibbon chap xv ii 277  footnote 36 ibid ii 283 his expression the most learned and most wealthy should be remembered in confirmation of the evermore recurring fact of christianity that minds modest in attainment and lives careless of gain are fittest for the reception of every constantie not local or accidentalchristian principle  40 it would be a task of great and in nowise profitable difficulty to determine in what measure the consent of the general church and in what measure the act and authority of jerome contributed to fix in their ever since undisturbed harmony and majesty the canons of mosaic and apostolic scripture all that the young reader need know is that when jerome died at bethlehem this great deed was virtually accomplished and the series of historic and didactic books which form our present bible including the apocrypha were established in and above the nascent thought of the noblest races of men living on the terrestrial globe as a direct message to them from its maker containing whatever it was necessary for them to learn of his purposes towards them and commanding or advising with divine authority and infallible wisdom all that was best for them to do and happiest to desire  41 and it is only for those who have obeyed the law sincerely to say how far the hope held out to them by the lawgiver has been fulfilled the worst children of disobedience are those who accept of the word what they like and refuse what they hate nor is this perversity in them always conscious for the greater part of the sins of the church have been brought on it by enthusiasm which in passionate contemplation and advocacy of parts of the scripture easily grasped neglected the study and at last betrayed the balance of the rest what forms and methods of selfwill are concerned in the wresting of the scriptures to a mans destruction is for the keepers of consciences to examine not for us the history we have to learn must be wholly cleared of such debate and the influence of the bible watched exclusively on the persons who receive the word with joy and obey it in truth  42 there has however been always a farther difficulty in examining the power of the bible than that of distinguishing honest from dishonest readers the hold of christianity on the souls of men must be examined when we come to close dealing with it under these three several heads there is first the power of the cross itself and of the theory of salvation upon the heartthen the operation of the jewish and greek scriptures on the intellectthen the influence on morals of the teaching and example of the living hierarchy and in the comparison of men as they are and as they might have been there are these three questions to be separately kept in mindfirst what would have been the temper of europe without the charity and labour meant by bearing the cross then secondly what would the intellect of europe have become without biblical literature and lastly what would the social order of europe have become without its hierarchy  43 you see i have connected the words charity and labour under the general term of bearing the cross if any man will come after me let him deny himself for charity and take up his cross of pain and follow me  the idea has been exactly reversed by modern protestantism which sees in the cross not a furca to which it is to be nailed but a raft on which it and all its valuable properties37 are to be floated into paradise  footnote 37 quite one of the most curious colours of modern evangelical thought is its pleasing connection of gospel truth with the extension of lucrative commerce see farther the note at p 83  44 only therefore in days when the cross was received with courage the scripture searched with honesty and the pastor heard in faith can the pure word of god and the bright sword of the spirit be recognised in the heart and hand of christianity the effect of biblical poetry and legend on its intellect must be traced farther through decadent ages and in unfenced fieldsproducing paradise lost for us no less than the divina commediagoethes faust and byrons cain no less than the imitatio christi  45 much more must the scholar who would comprehend in any degree approaching to completeness the influence of the bible on mankind be able to read the interpretations of it which rose into the great arts of europe at their culmination in every province of christendom according to the degree of artpower it possessed a series of illustrations of the bible were produced as time went on beginning with vignetted illustrations of manuscript advancing into lifesize sculpture and concluding in perfect power of realistic painting these teachings and preachings of the church by means of art are not only a most important part of the general apostolic acts of christianity but their study is a necessary part of biblical scholarship so that no man can in any large sense understand the bible itself until he has learned also to read these national commentaries upon it and been made aware of their collective weight the protestant reader who most imagines himself independent in his thought and private in his study of scripture is nevertheless usually at the mercy of the nearest preacher who has a pleasant voice and ingenious fancy receiving from him thankfully and often reverently whatever interpretation of texts the agreeable voice or ready wit may recommend while in the meantime he remains entirely ignorant of and if left to his own will invariably destroys as injurious the deeply meditated interpretations of scripture which in their matter have been sanctioned by the consent of all the christian church for a thousand years and in their treatment have been exalted by the trained skill and inspired imagination of the noblest souls ever enclosed in mortal clay  46 there are few of the fathers of the christian church whose commentaries on the bible or personal theories of its gospel have not been to the constant exultation of the enemies of the church fretted and disgraced by angers of controversy or weakened and distracted by irreconcilable heresy on the contrary the scriptural teaching through their art of such men as orcagna giotto angelico luca della robbia and luini is literally free from all earthly taint of momentary passion its patience meekness and quietness are incapable of error through either fear or anger they are able without offence to say all that they wish they are bound by tradition into a brotherhood which represents unperverted doctrines by unchanging scenes and they are compelled by the nature of their work to a deliberation and order of method which result in the purest state and frankest use of all intellectual power  47 i may at once and without need of returning to this question illustrate the difference in dignity and safety between the mental actions of literature and art by referring to a passage otherwise beautifully illustrative of st jeromes sweetness and simplicity of character though quoted in the place where we find it with no such favouring intentionnamely in the pretty letter of queen sophie charlotte fathers mother of frederick the great to the jesuit vota given in part by carlyle in his first volume ch iv  how can st jerome for example be a key to scripture she insinuates citing from jerome this remarkable avowal of his method of composing booksespecially of his method in that book commentary on the galatians where he accuses both peter and paul of simulation and even of hypocrisy the great st augustine has been charging him with this sad fact says her majesty who gives chapter and verse and jerome answers i followed the commentaries of origen offive or six different persons who turned out mostly to be heretics before jerome had quite done with them in coming years and to confess the honest truth to you continues jerome i read all that and after having crammed my head with a great many things i sent for my amanuensis and dictated to him now my own thoughts now those of others without much recollecting the order nor sometimes the words nor even the sense in another place in the book itself further on38 he says i do not myself write i have an amanuensis and i dictate to him what comes into my mouth if i wish to reflect a little or to say the thing better or a better thing he knits his brows and the whole look of him tells me sufficiently that he cannot endure to wait here is a sacred old gentleman whom it is not safe to depend upon for interpreting the scripturesthinks her majesty but does not say soleaving father vota to his reflections alas no queen sophie neither old st jeromes nor any other human lips nor mind may be depended upon in that function but only the eternal sophia the power of god and the wisdom of god yet this you may see of your old interpreter that he is wholly open innocent and true and that through such a person whether forgetful of his author or hurried by his scribe it is more than probable you may hear what heaven knows to be best for you and extremely improbable you should take the least harmwhile by a careful and cunning master in the literary art reticent of his doubts and dexterous in his sayings any number of prejudices or errors might be proposed to you acceptably or even fastened in you fatally though all the while you were not the least required to confide in his inspiration  footnote 38 commentary on the galatians chap iii  48 for indeed the only confidence and the only safety which in such matters we can either hold or hope are in our own desire to be rightly guided and willingness to follow in simplicity the guidance granted but all our conceptions and reasonings on the subject of inspiration have been disordered by our habit first of distinguishing falselyor at least needlesslybetween inspiration of words and of acts and secondly by our attribution of inspired strength or wisdom to some persons or some writers only instead of to the whole body of believers in so far as they are partakers of the grace of christ the love of god and the fellowship of the holy ghost in the degree in which every christian receives or refuses the several gifts expressed by that general benediction he enters or is cast out from the inheritance of the saintsin the exact degree in which he denies the christ angers the father and grieves the holy spirit he becomes uninspired or unholyand in the measure in which he trusts christ obeys the father and consents with the spirit he becomes inspired in feeling act word and reception of word according to the capacities of his nature he is not gifted with higher ability nor called into new offices but enabled to use his granted natural powers in their appointed place to the best purpose a child is inspired as a child and a maiden as a maiden the weak even in their weakness and the wise only in their hour  that is the simply determinable theory of the inspiration of all true members of the church its truth can only be known by proving it in trial but i believe there is no record of any mans having tried and declared it vain39  footnote 39 compare the closing paragraph in p 45 of the shrine of the slaves strangely as i revise this page for press a slip is sent me from the christian newspaper in which the comment of the orthodox evangelical editor may be hereafter representative to us of the heresy of his sect in its last audacity actually opposing the power of the spirit to the work of christ i only wish i had been at matlock and heard the kind physicians sermon  an interesting and somewhat unusual sight was seen in derbyshire on saturday lasttwo old fashioned friends dressed in the original garb of the quakers preaching on the roadside to a large and attentive audience in matlock one of them who is a doctor in good practice in the county by name dr charles a fox made a powerful and effective appeal to his audience to see to it that each one was living in obedience to the light of the holy spirit within christ within was the hope of glory and it was as he was followed in the ministry of the spirit that we were saved by him who became thus to each the author and finisher of faith he cautioned his hearers against building their house on the sand by believing in the free and easy gospel so commonly preached to the wayside hearers as if we were saved by believing this or that nothing short of the work of the holy ghost in the soul of each one could save us and to preach anything short of this was simply to delude the simple and unwary in the most terrible form  it would be unfair to criticise an address from so brief an abstract but we must express our conviction that the obedience of christ unto death the death of the cross rather than the work of the spirit in us is the good tidings for sinful mened  in juxtaposition with this editorial piece of modern british press theology i will simply place the 4th 6th and 13th verses of romans viii italicising the expressions which are of deepest import and always neglected that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live  it would be well for christendom if the baptismal service explained what it professes to abjure  49 beyond this theory of general inspiration there is that of special call and command with actual dictation of the deeds to be done or words to be said i will enter at present into no examination of the evidences of such separating influence it is not claimed by the fathers of the church either for themselves or even for the entire body of the sacred writers but only ascribed to certain passages dictated at certain times for special needs and there is no possibility of attaching the idea of infallible truth to any form of human language in which even these exceptional passages have been delivered to us but this is demonstrably true of the entire volume of them as we have it and readeach of us as it may be rendered in his native tongue that however mingled with mystery which we are not required to unravel or difficulties which we should be insolent in desiring to solve it contains plain teaching for men of every rank of soul and state of life which so far as they honestly and implicitly obey they will be happy and innocent to the utmost powers of their nature and capable of victory over all adversities whether of temptation or pain  50 indeed the psalter alone which practically was the service book of the church for many ages contains merely in the first half of it the sum of personal and social wisdom the 1st 8th 12th 14th 15th 19th 23rd and 24th psalms well learned and believed are enough for all personal guidance the 48th 72nd and 75th have in them the law and the prophecy of all righteous government and every real triumph of natural science is anticipated in the 104th  51 for the contents of the entire volume consider what other group of historic and didactic literature has a range comparable with it there are  i the stories of the fall and of the flood the grandest human traditions founded on a true horror of sin  ii the story of the patriarchs of which the effective truth is visible to this day in the polity of the jewish and arab races  iii the story of moses with the results of that tradition in the moral law of all the civilized world  iv the story of the kingsvirtually that of all kinghood in david and of all philosophy in solomon culminating in the psalms and proverbs with the still more close and practical wisdom of ecclesiasticus and the son of sirach  v the story of the prophetsvirtually that of the deepest mystery tragedy and permanent fate of national existence  vi the story of christ  vii the moral law of st john and his closing apocalypse of its fulfilment  think if you can match that table of contents in any otheri do not say book but literature think so far as it is possible for any of useither adversary or defender of the faithto extricate his intelligence from the habit and the association of moral sentiment based upon the bible what literature could have taken its place or fulfilled its function though every library in the world had remained unravaged and every teachers truest words had been written down  52 i am no despiser of profane literature so far from it that i believe no interpretations of greek religion have ever been so affectionate none of roman religion so reverent as those which will be found at the base of my art teaching and current through the entire body of my works but it was from the bible that i learned the symbols of homer and the faith of horace the duty enforced upon me in early youth of reading every word of the gospels and prophecies as if written by the hand of god gave me the habit of awed attention which afterwards made many passages of the profane writers frivolous to an irreligious reader deeply grave to me how far my mind has been paralysed by the faults and sorrow of lifehow far short its knowledge may be of what i might have known had i more faithfully walked in the light i had is beyond my conjecture or confession but as i never wrote for my own pleasure or selfproclaiming i have been guarded as men who so write always will be from errors dangerous to others and the fragmentary expressions of feeling or statements of doctrine which from time to time i have been able to give will be found now by an attentive reader to bind themselves together into a general system of interpretation of sacred literatureboth classic and christian which will enable him without injustice to sympathize in the faiths of candid and generous souls of every age and every clime  53 that there is a sacred classic literature running parallel with that of the hebrews and coalescing in the symbolic legends of mediæval christendom is shown in the most tender and impressive way by the independent yet similar influence of virgil upon dante and upon bishop gawaine douglas at earlier dates the teaching of every master trained in the eastern schools was necessarily grafted on the wisdom of the greek mythology and thus the story of the nemean lion with the aid of athena in its conquest is the real rootstock of the legend of st jeromes companion conquered by the healing gentleness of the spirit of life  54 i call it a legend only whether heracles ever slew or st jerome ever cherished the wild or wounded creature is of no moment to us in learning what the greeks meant by their vaseoutlines of the great contest or the christian painters by their fond insistence on the constancy of the lionfriend former tradition in the story of samsonof the disobedient prophetof davids first inspired victory and finally of the miracle wrought in the defence of the most favoured and most faithful of the greater prophets runs always parallel in symbolism with the dorian fable but the legend of st jerome takes up the prophecy of the millennium and foretells with the cumæan sibyl and with isaiah a day when the fear of man shall be laid in benediction not enmity on inferior beingswhen they shall not hurt nor destroy in all the holy mountain and the peace of the earth shall be as far removed from its present sorrow as the present gloriously animate universe from the nascent desert whose deeps were the place of dragons and its mountains domes of fire  of that day knoweth no man but the kingdom of god is already come to those who have tamed in their own hearts what was rampant of the lower nature and have learned to cherish what is lovely and human in the wandering children of the clouds and fields  avallon 28th august

the edifices on the globe that differ from it but i love too many cathedralsthough i have never had the happiness of becoming the custode of even oneto permit myself the easy and faithful exercise of the privilege in question and i must vindicate my candour and my judgment in the outset by confessing that the cathedral of amiens has nothing to boast of in the way of towersthat its central flèche

of his time in the north was to admit as much light into the building as was consistent with the comfort of it to make its structure intelligibly admirable but not curious or confusing and to enrich and enforce the understood structure with ornament sufficient for its beauty yet yielding to no wanton enthusiasm in expenditure nor insolent in giddy or selfish ostentation of skill and finally to make the external sculpture of its walls and gates at once an alphabet and epitome of the religion by the knowledge and inspiration of which an acceptable worship might be rendered within those gates to the lord whose fear was in his holy temple and whose seat was in heaven  footnote 41 it was a universal principle with the french builders of the great ages to use the stones of their quarries as they lay in the bed if the beds were thick the stones were used of their full thicknessif thin of their necessary thinness adjusting them with beautiful care to directions of thrust and weight the natural blocks were never sawn only squared into fitting the whole native strength and crystallization of the stone being thus kept unflawedne dédoublant jamais une pierre cette méthode est excellente

seventy departments of france the use of the stonesaw is unknown  3 it is not easy for the citizen of the modern aggregate of bad building and illliving held in check by constables which we call a townof which the widest streets are devoted by consent to the encouragement of vice and the narrow ones to the concealment of miserynot easy i say for the citizen of any such mean city to understand the feeling of a burgher of the christian ages to his cathedral for him the quite simply and franklybelieved text where two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst of them was expanded into the wider promise to many honest and industrious persons gathered in his namethey shall be my people and i will be their goddeepened in his reading of it by some lovely local and simply affectionate faith that christ as he was a jew among jews and a galilean among galileans was also in his nearness to anyeven the poorestgroup of disciples as one of their nation and that their own beau christ damiens was as true a compatriot to them as if he had been born of a picard maiden  4 it is to be remembered howeverand this is a theological point on which depended much of the structural development of the northern basilicasthat the part of the building in which the divine presence was believed to be constant as in the jewish holy of holies was only the enclosed choir in front of which the aisles and transepts might become the kings hall of justice as in the presencechamber of christ and whose high altar was guarded always from the surrounding eastern aisles by a screen of the most finished workmanship while from those surrounding aisles branched off a series of radiating chapels or cells each dedicated to some separate saint this conception of the company of christ with his saints the eastern chapel of all being the virgins was at the root of the entire disposition of the apse with its supporting and dividing buttresses and piers and the architectural form can never be well delighted in unless in some sympathy with the spiritual imagination out of which it rose we talk foolishly and feebly of symbols and types in old christian architecture every part is literal the cathedral is for its builders the house of godit is surrounded like an earthly kings with minor lodgings for the servants and the glorious carvings of the exterior walls and interior wood of the choir which an english rector would almost instinctively think of as done for the glorification of the canons was indeed the amienois carpenters way of making his mastercarpenter comfortable42nor less of showing his own native and insuperable virtue of carpenter before god and man  footnote 42 the philosophic reader is quite welcome to detect and expose as many carnal motives as he pleases besides the good onescompetition with neighbour beauvaiscomfort to sleepy headssolace to fat sides and the like he will find at last that no quantity of competition or comfortseeking will do anything the like of this carving nowstill less his own philosophy whatever its species and that it was indeed the little mustard seed of faith in the heart with a very notable quantity of honesty besides in the habit and disposition that made all the rest grow together for good  5 whatever you wish to see or are forced to leave unseen at amiens if the overwhelming responsibilities of your existence and the inevitable necessities of precipitate locomotion in their fulfilment have left you so much as one quarter of an hour not out of breathfor the contemplation of the capital of picardy give it wholly to the cathedral choir aisles and porches lancet windows and roses you can see elsewhere as well as herebut such carpenters work you cannot it is latefully developed flamboyant just past the fifteenth centuryand has some flemish stolidity mixed with the playing french fire of it but woodcarving was the picards joy from his youth up and so far as i know there is nothing else so beautiful cut out of the goodly trees of the world  sweet and younggrained wood it is oak trained and chosen for such work sound now as four hundred years since under the carvers hand it seems to cut like clay to fold like silk to grow like living branches to leap like living flame canopy crowning canopy pinnacle piercing pinnacleit shoots and wreathes itself into an enchanted glade inextricable imperishable fuller of leafage than any forest and fuller of story than any book43  footnote 43 arnold boulin masterjoiner menuisier at amiens solicited the enterprise and obtained it in the first months of the year 1508 a contract was drawn and an agreement made with him for the construction of one hundred and twenty stalls with historical subjects high backings crownings and pyramidal canopies it was agreed that the principal executor should have seven sous of tournay a little less than the sou of france a day for himself and his apprentice threepence a day the twosay a shilling a week the master and sixpence a week the man and for the superintendence of the whole work twelve crowns a year at the rate of twentyfour sous the crown ie twelve shillings a year the salary of the simple workman was only to be three sous a day for the sculptures and histories of the seats the bargain was made separately with antoine avernier imagecutter residing at amiens at the rate of thirtytwo sous sixteen pence the piece most of the wood came from clermont en beauvoisis near amiens the finest for the basreliefs from holland by st valery and abbeville the chapter appointed four of its own members to superintend the work jean dumas jean fabres pierre vuaille and jean lenglaché to whom my authors canons both attribute the choice of subjects the placing of them and the initiation of the workmen au sens véritable et plus élevé de la bible ou des legendes et portant quelque fois le simple savoirfaire de louvrier jusquà la hauteur du génie du théologien  without pretending to apportion the credit of savoirfaire and theology in the business we have only to observe that the whole company master apprentices workmen imagecutter and four canons got well into traces and set to work on the 3rd of july 1508 in the great hall of the évêché which was to be the workshop and studio during the whole time of the business in the following year another menuisier alexander huet was associated with the body to carry on the stalls on the right hand of the choir while arnold boulin went on with those on the left arnold leaving his new associate in command for a time went to beauvais and st riquier to see the woodwork there and in july of 1511 both the masters went to rouen together pour étudier les chaires de la cathédrale the year before also two franciscans monks of abbeville expert and renowned in working in wood had been called by the amiens chapter to give their opinion on things in progress and had each twenty sous for his opinion and travelling expenses  in 1516 another and an important name appears on the accountsthat of jean trupin a simple workman at the wages of three sous a day but doubtless a good and spirited carver whose true portrait it is without doubt and by his own hand that forms the elbowrest of the 85th stall right hand nearest apse beneath which is cut his name jhan trupin and again under the 92nd stall with the added wish jan trupin god take care of thee dieu te pourvoie  the entire work was ended on st johns day 1522 without so far as we hear any manner of interruption by dissension death dishonesty or incapacity among its fellowworkmen master or servant and the accounts being audited by four members of the chapter it was found that the total expense was 9488 livres 11 sous and 3 obols décimes or 474 napoleons 11 sous 3 décimes of modern french money or roughly four hundred sterling english pounds  for which sum you perceive a company of probably six or eight good workmen old and young had been kept merry and busy for fourteen years and this that you seeleft for substantial result and gift to you  i have not examined the carvings so as to assign with any decision the several masters work but in general the flower and leaf design in the traceries will be by the two head menuisiers and their apprentices the elaborate scripture histories by avernier with variously completing incidental grotesque by trupin and the joining and fitting by the common workmen no nails are usedall is morticed and so beautifully that the joints have not moved to this day and are still almost imperceptible the four terminal pyramids you might take for giant pines forgotten for six centuries on the soil where the church was built they might be looked on at first as a wild luxury of sculpture and hollow traceriesbut examined in analysis they are marvels of order and system in construction uniting all the lightness strength and grace of the most renowned spires in the last epoch of the middle ages  the above particulars are all extractedor simply translated out of the excellent description of the stalles et les clôtures du choeur of the cathedral of amiens by mm les chanoines jourdain et duval amiens vv alfred caron 1867 the accompanying lithographic outlines are exceedingly good and the reader will find the entire series of subjects indicated with precision and brevity both for the woodwork and the external veil of the choir of which i have no room to speak in this travellers summary  6 i have never been able to make up my mind which was really the best way of approaching the cathedral for the first time if you have plenty of leisure and the day is fine and you are not afraid of an hours walk the really right thing to do is to walk down the main street of the old town and across the river and quite out to the chalk hill44 out of which the citadel is half quarriedhalf walledand walk to the top of that and look down into the citadels dry ditchor more truly dry valley of death which is about as deep as a glen in derbyshire or more precisely the upper part of the happy valley at oxford above lower hincksey and thence across to the cathedral and ascending slopes of the city so you will understand the real height and relation of tower and townthen returning find your way to the mount zion of it by any narrow cross streets and chance bridges you canthe more winding and dirty the streets the better and whether you come first on west front or apse you will think them worth all the trouble you have had to reach them  footnote 44 the strongest and finally to be defended part of the earliest city was on this height  7 but if the day be dismal as it may sometimes be even in france of late yearsor if you cannot or will not walk which may also chance for all our athletics and lawntennisor if you must really go to paris this afternoon and only mean to see all you can in an hour or twothen supposing that notwithstanding these weaknesses you are still a nice sort of person for whom it is of some consequence which way you come at a pretty thing or begin to look at iti think the best way is to walk from the hotel de france or the place de perigord up the street of three pebbles towards the railway stationstopping a little as you go so as to get into a cheerful temper and buying some bonbons or tarts for the children in one of the charming patissiers shops on the left just past them ask for the theatre and just past that you will find also on the left three open arches through which you can turn passing the palais de justice and go straight up to the south transept which has really something about it to please everybody it is simple and severe at the bottom and daintily traceried and pinnacled at the top and yet seems all of a piecethough it isntand everybody must like the taper and transparent fretwork of the flèche above which seems to bend to the west windthough it doesntat least the bending is a long habit gradually yielded into with gaining grace and submissiveness during the last three hundred years and coming quite up to the porch everybody must like the pretty french madonna in the middle of it with her head a little aside and her nimbus switched a little aside too like a becoming bonnet a madonna in decadence she is though for all or rather by reason of all her prettiness and her gay soubrettes smile and she has no business there neither for this is st honorés porch not hers and grim and grey st honoré used to stand there to receive youhe is banished now to the north porch where nobody ever goes in this was done long ago in the fourteenthcentury days when the people first began to find christianity too serious and devised a merrier faith for france and would have brightglancing soubrette madonnas everywhereletting their own darkeyed joan of arc be burned for a witch and thenceforward things went their merry way straight on ça allait ça ira to the merriest days of the guillotine  but they could still carve in the fourteenth century and the madonna and her hawthornblossom lintel are worth your looking atmuch more the field above of sculpture as delicate and more calm which tells st honorés own story little talked of now in his parisian faubourg  8 i will not keep you just now to tell st honorés storyonly too glad to leave you a little curious about it if it were possible45for certainly you will be impatient to go into the church and cannot enter it to better advantage than by this door for all cathedrals of any mark have nearly the same effect when you enter at the west door but i know no other which shows so much of its nobleness from the south interior transept the opposite rose being of exquisite fineness in tracery and lovely in lustre and the shafts of the transept aisles forming wonderful groups with those of the choir and nave also the apse shows its height better as it opens to you when you advance from the transept into the midnave than when it is seen at once from the west end of the nave where it is just possible for an irreverent person rather to think the nave narrow than the apse high therefore if you let me guide you go in at this south transept door and put a sou into every beggars box who asks it thereit is none of your business whether they should be there or not nor whether they deserve to have the soube sure only that you yourself deserve to have it to give and give it prettily and not as if it burnt your fingers then being once inside take what first sensation and general glimpse of it pleases youpromising the custode to come back to see it properly only then mind you keep the promise and in this first quarter of an hour seeing only what fancy bid youbut at least as i said the apse from midnave and all the traverses of the building from its centre then you will know when you go outside again what the architect was working for and what his buttresses and traceries mean for the outside of a french cathedral except for its sculpture is always to be thought of as the wrong side of the stuff in which you find how the threads go that produce the inside or rightside pattern and if you have no wonder in you for that choir and its encompassing circlet of light when you look up into it from the crosscentre you need not travel farther in search of cathedrals for the waitingroom of any station is a better place for youbut if it amaze you and delight you at first then the more you know of it the more it will amaze for it is not possible for imagination and mathematics together to do anything nobler or stronger than that procession of window with material of glass and stonenor anything which shall look loftier with so temperate and prudent measure of actual loftiness  footnote 45 see however pages 32 and 130 §§ 36 112114 of the octavo edition of the two paths  9 from the pavement to the keystone of its vault is but 132 french feetabout 150 english think onlyyou who have been in switzerlandthe staubbach falls nine hundred nay dover cliff under the castle just at the end of the marine parade is twice as high and the little cockneys parading to military polka on the asphalt below think themselves about as tall as it i supposenay what with their little lodgings and stodgings and podgings about it they have managed to make it look no bigger than a moderatesized limekiln yet it is twice the height of amiens apseand it takes good building with only such bits of chalk as one can quarry beside somme to make your work stand half that height for six hundred years  10 it takes good building i say and you may even aver the bestthat ever was or is again likely for many a day to be on the unquaking and fruitful earth where one could calculate on a pillars standing fast once well set up and where aisles of aspen and orchards of apple and clusters of vine gave type of what might be most beautifully made sacred in the constancy of sculptured stone from the unhewn block set on end in the druids bethel to this lords house and bluevitrailed gate of heaven you have the entire course and consummation of the northern religious builders passion and art  11 but note furtherand earnestlythis apse of amiens is not only the best but the very first thing done perfectly in its manner by northern christendom in pages 323 and 327 of the sixth volume of m viollet le duc you will find the exact history of the development of these traceries through which the eastern light shines on you as you stand from the less perfect and tentative forms of rheims and so momentary was the culmination of the exact rightness that here from nave to transeptbuilt only ten years laterthere is a little change not towards decline but to a not quite necessary precision where decline begins one cannot among the lovely fantasies that succeeded exactly saybut exactly and indisputably we know that this apse of amiens is the first virgin perfect workparthenon also in that senseof gothic architecture  12 who built it shall we ask god and manis the first and most true answer the stars in their courses built it and the nations greek athena labours hereand roman father jove and guardian mars the gaul labours here and the frank knightly normanmighty ostrogothand wasted anchorite of idumea  the actual man who built it scarcely cared to tell you he did so nor do the historians brag of him any quantity of heraldries of knaves and fainéants you may find in what they call their history but this is probably the first time you ever read the name of robert of luzarches i say he scarcely caredwe are not sure that he cared at all he signed his name nowhere that i can hear of you may perhaps find some recent initials cut by english remarkable visitors desirous of immortality here and there about the edifice but robert the builderor at least the master of building cut his on no stone of it only when after his death the headstone had been brought forth with shouting grace unto it this following legend was written recording all who had part or lot in the labour within the middle of the labyrinth then inlaid in the pavement of the nave you must read it trippingly on the tongue it was rhymed gaily for you by pure french gaiety not the least like that of

too for there are one or two points both of idea and chronology in it that i should have liked the abbés opinion of  the main purport of the rhyme however we perceive to be line for line as follows       in the year of grace twelve hundred      and twenty the work then falling to ruin      was first begun again      then was of this bishopric      everard the blessed bishop      and king of france

attention to ecclesiastical architecture these points are noticeableif you have still a little patience  14 the workie the work of amiens in especial her cathedral was déchéant falling to ruin for thei cannot at once sayfourth fifth or what timein the year 1220 for it was a wonderfully difficult matter for little amiens to get this piece of business fairly done so hard did the devil pull against her she built her first bishops church scarcely more than st firmins tombchapel about the year 350 just outside the railway station on the road to paris46 then after being nearly herself destroyed chapel and all by the frank invasion having recovered and converted her franks she built another and a properly called cathedral where this one stands now under bishop st save st sauve or salve but even this proper cathedral was only of wood and the normans burnt it in 881 rebuilt it stood for 200 years but was in great part destroyed by lightning in 1019 rebuilt again it and the town were more or less burnt together by lightning in 1107my authority says calmly un incendie provoqué par la même cause détruisit la ville et une partie de la cathédrale the partie being rebuilt once more the whole was again reduced to ashes réduite en cendre par le feu de ciel en 1218 ainsi que tous les titres les martyrologies les calendriers et les archives de levêché et du chapitre  footnote 46 at st acheul see the first chapter of this book and the description historique de la cathédrale damiens by a p m gilbert 8vo amiens 1833 pp 57  15 it was the fifth cathedral i count then that lay in ashes according to mons gilbertin ruin certainlydéchéantand ruin of a very discouraging completeness it would have been to less lively townspeoplein 1218 but it was rather of a stimulating completeness to bishop everard and his peoplethe ground well cleared for them as it were and lightning feu de lenfer not du ciel recognized for a diabolic plague as in egypt was to be defied to the pit they only took two years you see to pull themselves together and to work they went in 1220 they and their bishop and their king and their robert of luzarches and this that roofs you was what their hands found to do with their might  16 their king was àdonc at that time louis viii who is especially further called the son of philip of august or philip the wise because his father was not dead in 1220 but must have resigned the practical kingdom to his son as his own father had done to him the old and wise king retiring to his chamber and thence silently guiding his sons hands very gloriously yet for three years  but fartherand this is the point on which chiefly i would have desired the abbés judgmentlouis viii died of fever at montpensier in 1226 and the entire conduct of the main labour of the cathedral and the chief glory of its service as we shall hear presently was saint louiss for a time of fortyfour years and the inscription was put à ce point ci by the last architect six years after st louiss death how is it that the great and holy king is not named  17 i must not in this travellers brief lose time in conjectural answers to the questions which every step here will raise from the ravaged shrine but this is a very solemn one and must be kept in our hearts till we may perhaps get clue to it one thing only we are sure ofthat at least the due honouralike by the sons of kings and sons of craftsmenis given always to their fathers and that apparently the chief honour of all is given here to philip the wise from whose house not of parliament but of peace came in the years when this temple was first in building an edict indeed of peacemaking that it should be criminal for any man to take vengeance for an insult or injury till forty days after the commission of the offenceand then only with the approbation of the bishop of the diocese which was perhaps a wiser effort to end the feudal system in its saxon sense47 than any of our recent projects for ending it in the norman one  footnote 47 feud saxon faedh low latin faida scottish fae english foe derivative johnson remember also that the root of feud in its norman sense of landallotment is foi not fee which johnson old tory as he was did not observeneither in general does the modern antifeudalist  18 a ce point ci the point namely of the labyrinth inlaid in the cathedral floor a recognized emblem of many things to the people who knew that the ground they stood on was holy as the roof over their head chiefly to them it was an emblem of noble human lifestraitgated narrowwalled with infinite darknesses and the inextricabilis error on either handand in the depth of it the brutal nature to be conquered  19 this meaning from the proudest heroic and purest legislative days of greece the symbol had borne for all men skilled in her traditions to the schools of craftsmen the sign meant further their crafts noblesse and pure descent from the divinelyterrestrial skill of dædalus the labyrinthbuilder and the first sculptor of imagery pathetic48 with human life and death  footnote 48                        tu quoque magnam      partem opere in tanto sineret dolor icare haberes      bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro      bis patriæ cecidere manus  there is advisedly no pathos allowed in primary sculpture its heroes conquer without exultation and die without sorrow  20 quite the most beautiful sign of the power of true christiancatholic faith is this continual acknowledgment by it of the brotherhoodnay more the fatherhood of the elder nations who had not seen christ but had been filled with the spirit of god and obeyed according to their knowledge his unwritten law the pure charity and humility of this temper are seen in all christian art according to its strength and purity of race but best to the full seen and interpreted by the three great christianheathen poets dante douglas of dunkeld49 and george chapman the prayer with which the last ends his lifes work is so far as i know the perfectest and deepest expression of natural religion given us in literature and if you can pray it herestanding on the spot where the builder once wrote the history of the parthenon of christianity  footnote 49 see fors clavigera letter lxi p 22  21 i pray thee lord the father and the guide of our reason that we may remember the nobleness with which thou hast adorned us and that thou wouldst be always on our right hand and on our left50 in the motion of our own wills that so we may be purged from the contagion of the body and the affections of the brute and overcome them and rule and use as it becomes men to use them for instruments and then that thou wouldst be in fellowship with us for the careful correction of our reason and for its conjunction by the light of truth with the things that truly are  footnote 50 thus the command to the children of israel that they go forward is to their own wills they obeying the sea retreats but not before they dare to advance into

our souls that we may know well who is to be held for god and who for mortal amen51  footnote 51 the original is written in latin only supplico tibi domine pater et dux rationis nostræ ut nostræ

cannot there is no hope of your at present taking pleasure in any human work of large faculty whether poetry painting or sculpture we may walk a little farther westwards down the nave where in the middle of it but only a few yards from its end two flat stones the custode will show you them one a little farther back than the other are laid over the graves of the two great bishops all whose strength of life was given with the builders to raise this temple their actual graves have not been disturbed but the tombs raised over them once and again removed are now set on your right and left

nobler language than ever latin was but its virtue is in colour and tone not in what may be called metallic or crystalline condensation and it is impossible to translate the last line of this inscription in as few english words note in it first that the bishops friends and enemies are spoken of as in word not act because the swelling or mocking or flattering words of men are indeed what the meek of the earth must know how to bear and to welcometheir deeds it is for kings and knights to deal with not but that the bishops often took deeds in hand also and in actual battle they were permitted to strike with the mace but not with sword or lanceie not to shed blood for it was supposed that a man might always recover from a maceblow which however would much depend on the bishops mind who gave it the battle of bouvines quite one of the most important in mediæval history was won against the english and against odds besides of germans under their emperor otho by two french bishops senlis and bayeuxwho both generalled the french kings line and led its charges our earl of salisbury surrendered to the bishop of bayeux in person  25 note farther that quite one of the deadliest and most diabolic powers of evil words or rightly so called blasphemy has been developed in modern days in the effect of sometimes quite innocently meant and enjoyed slang there are two kinds of slang in the essence of it one thieves latinthe special language of rascals used for concealment the other one might perhaps best call louts latinthe lowering or insulting words invented by vile persons to bring good things in their own estimates to their own level or beneath it the really worst power of this kind of blasphemy is in its often making it impossible to use plain words without a degrading or ludicrous attached sensethus i could not end my translation of this epitaph as the old latinist could with the exactly accurate image to the proud a filebecause of the abuse of the word in lower english retaining however quite shrewdly the thirteenthcentury idea but the exact force of the symbol here is in its allusion to jewellers work filing down facets a proud man is often also a precious one and may be made brighter in surface and the purity of his inner self shown by good filing  26 take it all in all the perfect duty of a bishop is expressed in these six latin linesau mieux mieuxbeginning with his pastoral officefeed my sheepqui pavit populum and be assured good reader these ages never could have told you what a bishops or any other mans duty was unless they had each man in his place both done it welland seen it well done the bishop geoffroys tomb is on your left and its inscription is       behold the limbs of godfrey press their lowly bed       whether he is preparing for us all one less than or like it       whom the twin laurels adorned in medicine       and in divine law the dual crests became him       brightshining man of eu by whom the throne of amiens       rose into immensity be thou increased in heaven                                                       amen  and now at lastthis reverence done and thanks paidwe will turn from these tombs and go out at one of the western doorsand so see gradually rising above us the immensity of the three porches and of the thoughts engraved in them  27 what disgrace or change has come upon them i will not tell you todayexcept only the immeasurable loss of the great old foundationsteps open sweeping broad from side to side for all who came unwalled undivided sunned all along by the westering day lighted only by the moon and the stars at night falling steep and many down the hillsideceasing one by one at last wide and few towards the leveland worn by pilgrim feet for six hundred years so i once saw them and twicesuch things can now be never seen more  nor even of the west front itself above is much of the old masonry left but in the porches nearly allexcept the actual outside facing with its rose moulding of which only a few flowers have been spared here and there54 but the sculpture has been carefully and honourably kept and restored to its placepedestals or niches restored here and there with clay or some which you see white and crude recarved entirely nevertheless the impression you may receive from the whole is still what the builder meant and i will tell you the order of its theology without further notices of its decay  footnote 54 the horizontal lowest part of the moulding between the northern and central porch is old compare its roses with the new ones running round the arches aboveand you will know what restoration means  28 you will find it always well in looking at any cathedral to make your quarters of the compass sure in the beginning and to remember that as you enter it you are looking and advancing eastward and that if it has three entrance porches that on your left in entering is the northern that on your right the southern i shall endeavour in all my future writing of architecture to observe the simple law of always calling the door of the north transept the north door and that on the same side of the west front the northern door and so of their opposites this will save in the end much printing and much confusion for a gothic cathedral has almost always these five great entrances which may be easily if at first attentively recognized under the titles of the central door or porch the northern door the southern door the north door and the south door  but when we use the terms right and left we ought always to use them as in going out of the cathedral or walking down the navethe entire north side and aisles of the building being its right side and the south its leftthese terms being only used well and authoritatively when they have reference either to the image of christ in the apse or on the rood or else to the central statue whether of christ the virgin or a saint in the west front at amiens this central statue on the trumeau or supporting and dividing pillar of the central porch is of christ immanuelgod with us on his right hand and his left occupying the entire walls of the central porch are the apostles and the four greater prophets the twelve minor prophets stand side by side on the front three on each of its great piers55  footnote 55 see now the plan at the end of this chapter  the northern porch is dedicated to st firmin the first christian missionary to amiens  the southern porch to the virgin  but these are both treated as withdrawn behind the great foundation of christ and the prophets and their narrow recesses partly conceal their sculpture until you enter them what you have first to think of and read is the scripture of the great central porch and the façade itself  29 you have then in the centre of the front the image of christ himself receiving you i am the way the truth and the life and the order of the attendant powers may be best understood by thinking of them as placed on christs right and left hand this being also the order which the builder adopts in his scripture history on the façadeso that it is to be read from left to rightie from christs left to christs right as he sees it thus therefore following the order of the great statues first in the central porch there are six apostles on christs right hand and six on his left on his left hand next to him peter then in receding order andrew james john matthew simon on his right hand next him paul and in receding order james the bishop philip bartholomew thomas and jude these opposite ranks of the apostles occupy what may be called the apse or curved bay of the porch and form a nearly semicircular group clearly visible as we approach but on the sides of the porch outside the lines of apostles and not seen clearly till we enter the porch are the four greater prophets on christs left isaiah and jeremiah on his right ezekiel and daniel  30 then in front along the whole façaderead in order from christs left to his rightcome the series of the twelve minor prophets three to each of the four piers of the temple beginning at the south angle with hosea and ending with malachi  as you look full at the façade in front the statues which fill the minor porches are either obscured in their narrower recesses or withdrawn behind each other so as to be unseen and the entire mass of the front is seen literally as built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone literally that for the receding porch is a deep angulus and its midpillar is the head of the corner  built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets that is to say of the prophets who foretold christ and the apostles who declared him though moses was an apostle of god he is not herethough elijah was a prophet of god he is not here the voice of the entire building is that of the heaven at the transfiguration this is my beloved son hear ye him  31 there is yet another and a greater prophet still who as it seems at first is not here shall the people enter the gates of the temple singing hosanna to the son of david and see no image of his father thenchrist himself declare i am the root and the offspring of david and yet the root have no sign near it of its earth  not so david and his son are together david is the pedestal of the christ  32 we will begin our examination of the temple front therefore with this its goodly pedestal stone the statue of david is only twothirds lifesize occupying the niche in front of the pedestal he holds his sceptre in his right hand the scroll in his left king and prophet type of all divinely right doing and right claiming and right proclaiming kinghood for ever  the pedestal of which this statue forms the fronting or western sculpture is square and on the two sides of it are two flowers in vases on its north side the lily and on its south the rose and the entire monolith is one of the noblest pieces of christian sculpture in the world  above this pedestal comes a minor one bearing in front of it a tendril of vine which completes the floral symbolism of the whole the plant which i have called a lily is not the fleur de lys nor the madonnas but an ideal one with bells like the crown imperial shakespeares type of lilies of all kinds representing the mode of growth of the lily of the valley which could not be sculptured so large in its literal form without appearing monstrous and is exactly expressed in this tabletas it fulfils together with the rose and vine its companions the triple saying of christ i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valley i am the true vine                                       33 on the side of the upper stone are supporters of a different character supportersnot captives nor victims the cockatrice and adder representing the most active evil principles of the earth as in their utmost malignity still pedestals of christ and even in their deadly life accomplishing his final will  both creatures are represented accurately in the mediæval traditional form the cockatrice half dragon half cock the deaf adder laying one ear against the ground and stopping the other with her tail  the first represents the infidelity of pride the cockatriceking serpent or highest serpentsaying that he is god and will be god  the second the infidelity of death the adder nieder or nether snake saying that he is mud and will be mud  34 lastly and above all set under the feet of the statue of christ himself are the lion and dragon the images of carnal sin or human sin as distinguished from the spiritual and intellectual sin of pride by which the angels also fell  to desire kingship rather than servantshipthe cockatrices sin or deaf death rather than hearkening lifethe adders sinthese are both possible to all the intelligences of the universe but the distinctively human sins anger and lust seeds in our race of their perpetual sorrowchrist in his own humanity conquered and conquers in his disciples therefore his foot is on the heads of these and the prophecy inculcabis super leonem et aspidem is recognized always as fulfilled in him and in all his true servants according to the height of their authority and the truth of their power  35 in this mystic sense alexander iii used the words in restoring peace to italy and giving forgiveness to her deadliest enemy under the porch of st marks56 but the meaning of every act as of every art of the christian ages lost now for three hundred years cannot but be in our own times read reversed if at all through the counterspirit which we now have reached glorifying pride and avarice as the virtues by which all things move and have their beingwalking after our own lusts as our sole guides to salvation and foaming out our own shame for the sole earthly product of our hands and lips  footnote 56 see my abstract of the history of barbarossa and alexander in fiction fair and foul nineteenth century november 1880 pp 752 seq  36 of the statue of christ itself i will not speak here at any length as no sculpture would satisfy or ought to satisfy the hope of any loving soul that has learned to trust in him but at the time it was beyond what till then had been reached in sculptured tenderness and was known far and near as the beau dieu damiens57 yet understood observe just as clearly to be no more than a symbol of the heavenly presence as the poor coiling worms below were no more than symbols of the demoniac ones no idol in our sense of the wordonly a letter or sign of the living spiritwhich however was indeed conceived by every worshipper as here meeting him at the temple gate the word of life the king of glory and the lord of hosts  footnote 57 see account and careful drawing of it in viollet le ducarticle christ dict of architecture iii 245  dominus virtutum lord of virtues58 is the best single rendering of the idea conveyed to a welltaught disciple in the thirteenth century by the words of the twentyfourth psalm  footnote 58 see the circle of the powers of the heavens in the byzantine rendering i wisdom ii thrones iii dominations iv angels v archangels vi virtues vii potentates viii princes ix seraphim in the gregorian order dante par xxviii carys note the angels and archangels are separated giving altogether nine orders but not ranks note that in the byzantine circle the cherubim are first and that it is the strength of the virtues which calls on the dead to rise st marks rest p 97 and pp 158159  37 under the feet of his apostles therefore in the quatrefoil medallions of the foundation are represented the virtues which each apostle taught or in his life manifestedit may have been sore tried and failing in the very strength of the character which he afterwards perfected thus st peter denying in fear is afterwards the apostle of courage and st john who with his brother would have burnt the inhospitable village is afterwards the apostle of love understanding this you see that in the sides of the porch the apostles with their special virtues stand thus in opposite ranks  now you see how these virtues answer to each other in their opposite ranks remember the lefthand side is always the first and see how the lefthand virtues lead to the right hand                     courage        to faith                    patience       to

railway time presses it may be a kindness to him to note that if he walks from the east end of the cathedral down the street to the south rue st denis it takes him by the shortest line to the stationi will begin again with st peter and interpret the sculptures in the quatrefoils a little more fully keeping the fixed numerals for indication of the statues st peters quatrefoils will be 1 a and 1 b and malachis 28 a and 28 b  1 a courage with a leopard on his shield the french and        english agreeing in the reading of that symbol down        to the time of the black princes leopard coinage in        aquitaine61  footnote 61 for a list of the photographs of the quatrefoils described in this chapter see the appendices at the end of this volume  2 b cowardice a man frightened at an animal darting out        of a thicket while a bird sings on the coward has        not the heart of a thrush  2 a patience holding a shield with a bull on it never giving        back62  footnote 62 in the cathedral of laon there is a pretty compliment paid to the oxen who carried the stones of its tower to the hilltop it stands on the tradition is that they harnessed themselvesbut tradition does not say how an ox can harness himself even if he had a mind probably the first form of the story was only that they went joyfully lowing as they went but at all events their statues are carved on the height of the tower eight colossal looking from its galleries across the plains of france see drawing in viollet le duc under article clocher  2 b anger a woman stabbing a man with a sword anger        is essentially a feminine vicea man worth calling so        may be driven to fury or insanity by indignation        compare the black prince at limoges but not by        anger fiendish enough often soincensed with        indignation satan stood unterrified but in that last        word is the difference there is as much fear in anger        as there is in hatred  3 a gentillesse bearing shield with a lamb  3 b churlishness again a woman kicking over her cupbearer        the final forms of ultimate french churlishness        being in the feminine gestures of the cancan        see the favourite prints in shops of paris  4 a love the divine not human love i in them and        thou in me her shield bears a tree with many        branches grafted into its cutoff stem in those days        shall messiah be cut off but not for himself  4 b discord a wife and husband quarrelling she has        dropped her distaff amiens wool manufacture see farther        on9 a  5 a obedience bears shield with camel actually the most        disobedient and illtempered of all serviceable beastsyet        passing his life in the most painful service i do        not know how far his character was understood by the        northern sculptor but i believe he is taken as a type        of burdenbearing without joy or sympathy such as        the horse has and without power of offence such as the        ox has his bite is bad enough see mr palgraves        account of him but presumably little known of at        amiens even by crusaders who would always ride        their own warhorses or nothing  5 b rebellion a man snapping his fingers at his bishop        as henry the eighth at the popeand the modern        french and english cockney at all priests whatever  6 a perseverence the grandest spiritual form of the virtue        commonly called fortitude usually overcoming        or tearing a lion here caressing one and holding her        crown hold fast that which thou hast that no man        take thy crown  6 b atheism leaving his shoes at the church door the infidel        fool is always represented in twelfth and thirteenth        century ms as barefootthe christian having his        feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace        compare how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o        princes daughter  7 a faith holding cup with cross above it her accepted        symbol throughout ancient europe it is also an enduring        one for all differences of church put aside the        words except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and        drink his blood ye have no life in you remain in        their mystery to be understood only by those who have        learned the sacredness of food in all times and places        and the laws of life and spirit dependent on its acceptance        refusal and distribution  7 b idolatry kneeling to a monster the contrary of        faithnot want of faith idolatry is faith in the        wrong thing and quite distinct from faith in no thing        6 b the dixit insipiens very wise men may be        idolaters but they cannot be atheists  8 a hope with gonfalon standard and distant crown as        opposed to the constant

the bible of amiens but the two lateral porches contain supplementary subjects necessary for completion of the pastoral and traditional teaching addressed to her people in that day  the northern porch

already spoken67 st geoffroy is more real for us than the rest he was born in the year of the battle of hastings at molincourt in the soissonais and was bishop of amiens from 1104 to 1150 a man of entirely simple pure and right life one of the severest of ascetics but without gloomalways gentle and merciful many miracles are recorded of him but all indicating a tenour of life which was chiefly miraculous by its justice and peace consecrated at rheims and attended by a train of other bishops and nobles to his diocese he dismounts from his horse at st acheul the place of st firmins first tomb and walks barefoot to his cathedral along the causeway now so defaced at another time he walks barefoot from amiens to picquigny to ask from the vidame of amiens the freedom of the chatelain adam he maintained the privileges of the citizens with the help of louis le gros against the count of amiens defeated him and razed his castle nevertheless the people not enough obeying him in the order of their life he blames his own weakness rather than theirs and retires to the grande chartreuse holding himself unfit to be their bishop the carthusian superior questioning him on his reasons for retirement and asking if he had ever sold the offices of the church the bishop answered my father my hands are pure of simony but i have a thousand times allowed myself to be seduced by praise

who received st firmin himself he preserved the tomb of the martyr in his fathers garden and at last built a church over it dedicated to our lady of martyrs which was the first episcopal seat of amiens at st acheul spoken of above st ulpha was an amienoise girl who lived in a chalk cave above the marshes of the sommeif ever mr murray provides you with a comic guide to amiens no doubt the enlightened composer of it will count much on your enjoyment of the story of her being greatly disturbed at her devotions by the frogs and praying them silent you are now of course wholly superior to such follies and are sure that god cannot or will not so much as shut a frogs mouth for you remember therefore that as he also now leaves open the mouth of the liar blasphemer and betrayer you must

it we will go into the madonnas porchonly if you come at all good protestant feminine readercome civilly and be pleased to recollect if you have in known history material for recollection this or if you cannot recollectbe you very solemnly assured of this that neither madonnaworship nor ladyworship of any sort whether of dead ladies or living ones ever did any human creature any harmbut that money worship wig worship cockedhatandfeather worship plate worship pot worship and pipe worship have done and are doing a great dealand that any of these and all are quite millionfold more offensive to the god of heaven and earth and the stars than all the absurdest and lovingest mistakes made by any generations of his simple children about what the virginmother could or would or might do or feel for them  49 and next please observe this broad historical fact about the three sorts of madonnas  there is first the madonna dolorosa the byzantine type and cimabues it is the noblest of all and the earliest in distinct popular influence68  footnote 68 see the description of the madonna of murano in second volume of stones of venice  secondly the madone reine who is essentially the frank and norman one crowned calm and full of power and gentleness she is the one represented in this porch  thirdly the madone nourrice who is the raphaelesque and generally late and decadence one she is seen here in a good french type in the south transept porch as before noticed  an admirable comparison will be found instituted by m viollet le duc the article vierge in his dictionary is altogether deserving of the most attentive study between this statue of the queenmadonna of the southern porch and the nursemadonna of the transept i may perhaps be able to get a photograph made of his two drawings side by side but if i can the reader will please observe that he has a little flattered the queen and a little vulgarized the nurse which is not fair the statue in this porch is in thirteenthcentury style extremely good but there is no reason for making any fuss about itthe earlier byzantine types being far grander  50 the madonnas story in its main incidents is told in the series of statues round the porch and in the quatrefoils belowseveral of which refer however to a legend about the magi to which i have not had access and i am not sure of their interpretation  the large statues are on the left hand reading outwards as usual            29 the angel gabriel           30 virgin annunciate           31 virgin visitant           32 st elizabeth           33 virgin in presentation           34 st simeon  on the right hand reading outward            35 36 37 the three kings           38 herod           39 solomon           40 the queen of sheba  51 i am not sure of rightly interpreting the introduction of these two last statues but i believe the idea of the designer was that virtually the queen mary visited herod when she sent or had sent for her the magi to tell him of her presence at bethlehem and the contrast between solomons reception of the queen of sheba and herods driving out the madonna into egypt is dwelt on throughout this side of the porch with their several consequences to the two kings and to the world  the quatrefoils underneath the great statues run as follows  29 under gabriel       a daniel seeing the stone cut out without hands       b moses and the burning bush  30 under virgin annunciate       a gideon and the dew on the fleece       b moses with written law retiring aaron dominant points to          his budding rod  31 under virgin visitant       a the message to zacharias fear not for thy prayer is heard       b the dream of joseph fear not to take unto thee mary thy          wife   32 under st elizabeth       a the silence of zacharias they perceived that he had seen a          vision in the temple       b there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name          he wrote saying his name is john  33 under virgin in presentation       a flight into egypt       b christ with the doctors  34 under st simeon       a fall of the idols in egypt       b the return to nazareth    these two last quatrefoils join the beautiful c and d of amos  then on the opposite side under the queen of sheba and joining the a and b of obadiah  40   a solomon entertains the queen of sheba the grace cup       b solomon teaches the queen of sheba god is above  39 under solomon       a solomon on his throne of judgment       b solomon praying before his templegate  38 under herod       a massacre of innocents       b herod orders the ship of the kings to be burned  37 under the third king       a herod inquires of the kings       b burning of the ship  36 under the second king       a adoration in bethlehemnot certain       b the voyage of the kings  35 under the first king       a the star in the east       b being warned in a dream that they should not return to herod  i have no doubt of finding out in time the real sequence of these subjects but it is of little importthis group of quatrefoils being of less interest than the rest and that of the massacre of the innocents curiously illustrative of the incapability of the sculptor to give strong action or passion  but into questions respecting the art of these basreliefs i do not here attempt to enter they were never intended to serve as more than signs or guides to thought and if the reader follows this guidance quietly he may create for himself better pictures in his heart and at all events may recognize these following general truths as their united message  52 first that throughout the sermon on this amiens mount christ never appears or is for a moment thought of as the crucified nor as the dead but as the incarnate wordas the present friendas the prince of peace on earthand as the everlasting king in heaven what his life is what his commands are and what his judgment will be are the things here taught not what he once did nor what he once suffered but what he is now doingand what he requires us to do that is the pure joyful beautiful lesson of christianity and the fall from that faith and all the corruptions of its abortive practice may be summed briefly as the habitual contemplation of christs death instead of his life and the substitution of his past suffering for our present duty  53 then secondly though christ bears not his cross the mourning prophetsthe persecuted apostlesand the martyred disciples do bear theirs for just as it is well for you to remember what your undying creator is doing for youit is well for you to remember what your dying fellowcreatures have done the creator you may at your pleasure deny or defythe martyr you can only forget deny you cannot every stone of this building is cemented with his blood and there is no furrow of its pillars that was not ploughed by his pain  54 keeping then these things in your heart look back now to the central statue of christ and hear his message with understanding he holds the book of the eternal law in his left hand with his right he blessesbut blesses on condition this do and thou shalt live nay in stricter and more piercing sense this be and thou shalt live to show mercy is nothingthy soul must be full of mercy to be pure in act is nothingthou shalt be pure in heart also  and with this further word of the unabolished lawthis if thou do not this if thou art not thou shalt die  55 die whatever death meanstotally and irrevocably there is no word in thirteenthcentury theology of the pardon in our modern sense of sins and there is none of the purgatory of them above that image of christ with us our friend is set the image of christ over us our judge for this present lifehere is his helpful presence after this lifethere is his coming to take account of our deeds and of our desires in them and the parting asunder of the obedient from the disobedient of the loving from the unkind with no hope given to the last of recall or reconciliation i do not know what commenting or softening doctrines were written in frightened minuscule by the fathers or hinted in hesitating whispers by the prelates of the early church but i know that the language of every graven stone and every glowing windowof things daily seen and universally understood by the people was absolutely and alone this teaching of moses from sinai in the beginning and of st john from patmos in the end of the revelation of god to israel  this it was simplysternlyand continually for the great three hundred years of christianity in her strength eleventh twelfth and thirteenth centuries and over the whole breadth and depth of her dominion from iona to cyreneand from calpe to jerusalem at what time the doctrine of purgatory was openly accepted by catholic doctors i neither know nor care to know it was first formalized by dante but never accepted for an instant by the sacred artist teachers of his timeor by those of any great school or time whatsoever69  footnote 69 the most authentic foundations of the purgatorial scheme in artteaching are in the renderings subsequent to the thirteenth century of the verse by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison forming gradually into the idea of the deliverance of the waiting saints from the power of the grave  in literature and tradition the idea is originally i believe platonic certainly not homeric egyptian possiblybut i have read nothing yet of the recent discoveries in egypt not however quite liking to leave the matter in the complete emptiness of my own resources i have appealed to my general investigator mr anderson james r who writes as follows  there is no possible question about the doctrine and universal inculcation of it ages before dante curiously enough though the statement of it in the summa theologiæ as we have it is a later insertion but i find by references that st thomas teaches it elsewhere albertus magnus developes it at length if you refer to the golden legend under all souls day you will see how the idea is assumed as a commonplace in a work meant for popular use in the thirteenth century st gregory the pope argues for it dial iv 38 on two scriptural quotations 1 the sin that is forgiven neither in hôc sæculo nor in that which is to come and 2 the fire which shall try every mans work i think platonic philosophy and the greek mysteries must have had a good deal to do with introducing the idea originally but with themas to virgilit was part of the eastern vision of a circling stream of life from which only a few drops were at intervals tossed to a definitely permanent elysium or a definitely permanent hell it suits that scheme better than it does the christian one which attaches ultimately in all cases infinite importance to the results of life in hôc sæculo  do you know any representation of heaven or hell unconnected with the last judgment i dont remember any and as purgatory is by that time past this would account for the absence of pictures of it  besides purgatory precedes the resurrectionthere is continual question among divines what manner of purgatorial fire it may be that affects spirits separate from the bodyperhaps heaven and hell as opposed to purgatory were felt to be picturable because not only spirits but the risen bodies too are conceived in them  bedes account of the ayrshire seers vision gives purgatory in words very like dantes description of the second stormy circle in hell and the angel which ultimately saves the scotchman from the fiends comes through hell quasi fulgor stellæ micantis inter tenebrasqual sul presso del mattino per gli grossi vapor marte rosseggia bedes name was great in the middle ages dante meets him in heaven and i like to hope may have been helped by the vision of my fellowcountryman more than six hundred years before  56 neither do i know nor care to knowat what time the notion of justification by faith in the modern sense first got itself distinctively fixed in the minds of the heretical sects and schools of the north practically its strength was founded by its first authors on an asceticism which differed from monastic rule in being only able to destroy never to build and in endeavouring to force what severity it thought proper for itself on everybody else also and so striving to make one artless letterless and merciless monastery of all the world its virulent effort broke down amidst furies of reactionary dissoluteness and disbelief and remains now the basest of popular solders and plasters for every condition of broken law and bruised conscience which interest can provoke or hypocrisy disguise  57 with the subsequent quarrels between the two great sects of the corrupted church about prayers for the dead indulgences to the living papal supremacies or popular liberties no man woman or child need trouble themselves in studying the history of christianity they are nothing but the squabbles of men and laughter of fiends among its ruins the life and gospel and power of it are all written in the mighty works of its true believers in normandy and sicily on river islets of france and in the river glens of england on the rocks of orvieto and by the sands of arno but of all the simplest completest and most authoritative in its lessons to the active mind of north europe is this on the foundation stones of amiens  58 believe it or not reader as you will understand only how thoroughly it was once believed and that all beautiful things were made and all brave deeds done in the strength of ituntil what we may call this present time in which it is gravely asked whether religion has any effect on morals by persons who have essentially no idea whatever of the meaning of either religion or morality  concerning which dispute this much perhaps you may have the patience finally to read as the flèche of amiens fades in the distance and your carriage rushes towards the isle of france which now exhibits the most admired patterns of european art intelligence and behaviour  59 all human creatures in all ages and places of the world who have had warm affections common sense and selfcommand have been and are naturally moral human nature in its fulness is necessarily moralwithout love it is inhuman without sense70 inhumanwithout discipline inhuman  footnote 70 i dont mean

the knowledge and enforcement of them have nothing to do with religion a good and wise man differs from a bad and idiotic one simply as a good dog from a cur and as any manner of dog from a wolf or a

creatures that are like yourself you feel that you would love still more dearly creatures better than yourselfwere they revealed to youif striving with all your might to mend what is evil near you and around you would fain look for a day when some judge of all the earth shall wholly do right and the little hills rejoice on every side if parting with the companions that have given you all the best

loneliness seeing no more beauty and feeling no more gladnessyou would care for the promise to you of a time when you should see gods light again and know the things you have longed to know and walk

6 passage du commerce who had photographed them for m viollet le duc to obtain negatives of the entire series with the central pedestal of the christ  the proofs are entirely satisfactory to me and extremely honourable to m kaltenbachers skill and it is impossible to obtain any more instructive and interesting in exposition of the manner of central thirteenthcentury sculpture  i directed their setting so that the entire succession of the quatrefoils might be included in eighteen plates the front and two sides of the pedestal raise their number to twentyone the whole unmounted sold by my agent mr ward the negatives being my own property for four guineas or separately each five shillings  besides these of my own i have chosen four general views of the cathedral from m kaltenbachers formerlytaken negatives which together with the firstnamed series twentyfive altogether will form a complete body of illustrations for the fourth chapter of the bible of amiens costing in all five

                  appendix iii  general plan of our fathers have told us71   footnote 71 reprinted from the advice issued with chap iii march 1882  the first part of our fathers have told us now submitted to the public is enough to show the proposed character and tendencies of the work to which contrary to my usual custom i now invite subscription because the degree in which i can increase its usefulness by engraved illustration must greatly depend on the known number of its supporters  i do not recognize in the present state of my health any reason to fear more loss of general power whether in conception or industry than is the proper and appointed check of an old mans enthusiasm of which however enough remains in me to warrant my readers against the abandonment of a purpose entertained already for twenty years  the work if i live to complete it will consist of ten parts each taking up some local division of christian history and gathering towards their close into united illustration of the power of the church in the thirteenth century  the present volume completes the first part descriptive of the early frank power and of its final skill in the cathedral of amiens  the second part ponte della pietra will i hope do more for theodoric and verona than i have been able to do for clovis and the first capital of france  the third ara celi will trace the foundations of the papal power  the fourth ponteamare and fifth ponte vecchio will only with much difficulty gather into brief form what i have by me of scattered materials respecting pisa and florence  the sixth valle crucis will be occupied with the monastic architecture of england and wales  the seventh the springs of eure will be wholly given to the cathedral of chartres  the eighth domrémy to that of rouen and the schools of architecture which it represents  the ninth the bay of uri to the pastoral forms of catholicism reaching to our own times  and the tenth the bells of cluse to the pastoral protestantism of savoy geneva and the scottish border  each part will consist of four sections only and one of them the fourth will usually be descriptive of some monumental city or cathedral the resultant and remnant of the religious power examined in the preparatory chapters  one illustration at least will be given with each chapter and drawings made for others which will be placed at once in the sheffield museum for public reference and engraved as i find support or opportunity for binding with the completed work  as in the instance of chapter iv of this first part a smaller edition of the descriptive chapters will commonly be printed in reduced form for travellers and nonsubscribers but otherwise i intend this work to be furnished to subscribers only     index  except in the case
