geoffrey thurston was following in his grandfathers footsteps the sturdy dalefolk said and several of them shook their heads solemnly as they repeated the observation when one morning the young man came striding down the steep street of a village in the north country  the cluster of gray stone houses nestled beneath the scarred face of a crag and because mining operations had lately been suspended and work was scarce just then palefaced men in moleskin lounged about the slateslab doorsteps  above the village and beyond the summit of the crag the mouth of a tunnel formed a black blot on the sunlit slopes of sheepcropped grass stretching up to the heather which gave place in turn to rock outcrop on the shoulders of the fell the loungers glanced at the tunnel regretfully for that mine had furnished most of them with their daily bread  its in t blood said one nodding toward the young man  ay headstrong follys bred in t bone of them an its safer to counter an angry bull than a thurston of crosbie ghyll  its like his grandfatherroughed out of the old hard whinstane he is  a murmur of approval followed for the listeners knew there was a measure of truth in this but it ceased when the pedestrian passed close to them with long vigorous strides  though several raised their hands halfway to their caps in grudging salute geoffrey thurston who appeared preoccupied looked at none of them  notwithstanding his youth there were lines on his forehead and his brows were wrinkled over his eyes while his carriage suggested strength of limb and energy  tall in stature his frame looked wiry rather than heavily built  his face was resolute for both square jaw and steady brown eyes suggested tenacity of purpose  the hands that swung at his sides had been roughened by labor with pick and drill  yet in spite of the old claystained shooting suit and shapeless slouch hat with the grease on the front of it where a candle had been set there was a stamp of command and even refinement about him  he was a thurston of crosbie one of a family the members of which had long worked their own diminishing lands among the rugged fells that stretch between the west riding and the solway  the thurstons had been a reckless hardliving race with a stubborn combative disposition  most of them had found scope for their energies in wresting a few more barren acres from the grasp of moss and moor but several times an eccentric genius had scattered to the winds what the rest had won and geoffrey seemed bent on playing the traditional rôle of spendthrift  there were however excuses for him  he was an ambitious man and had studied mechanical science under a famous engineer  perhaps because the surface of the earth yielded a sustenance so grudgingly a love of burrowing was born in the family copper was dear and the speculative public well disposed towards british mines  when current prices permitted it a little copper had been worked from time immemorial in the depths of crosbie fell so geoffrey continuing where his grandfather had ceased drove the ancient adit deeper into the hill mortgaging field by field to pay for tools and men until when the little property had wellnigh gone he came upon a fault or break in the strata which made further progress almost impossible  when thurston reached the mouth of the adit he turned and looked down upon the poor climbing meadows under the great shoulder of the fell beyond these a few weatherbeaten buildings forming a rude quadrangle pierced by one tall archway stood beside a tarn that winked like polished steel  he sighed as his glance rested upon them  for many generations they had sheltered the thurstons of crosbie but unless he could stoop to soil his hands in a fashion revolting to his pride a strange master would own them before many months had gone  an angry glitter came into his eyes and his face grew set as placing a lighted candle in his hat he moved forward into the black adit  twenty minutes had passed when thurston stood on the brink of a chasm where some movement of the earths crust had rent the rocks asunder beside him was a mining engineer whose fame for skill was greater than his reputation for integrity  both men had donned coarse overalls and melhuish the mining expert held his candle so that its light fell upon his companion as well as upon the dripping surface of the rock moisture fell from the wet stone into the gloomy rift and a faint monotonous splashing rose up from far below  melhuish however was watching thurston too intently to notice anything else  he was a middleaged man with a pale puffy face and avaricious eyes  he was wellknown to speculative financiers who made much more than the shareholders of certain new mining companies  its interesting geologicallywholly abnormal considering the stratification though very unfortunate for you said melhuish  i give you my word of honor that when i advised you to push on the heading i never expected this  however there it is and unless youre willing to consider certain suggestions already made i cant see much use in wasting any more money  as i said my friends would under the circumstances treat you fairly  thurstons face was impassive and melhuish who thought that his companion bore himself with a curious equanimity for a ruined man did not see that thurstons hard fingers were clenched savagely on the handle of a pick  i fancied you understood my opinions and i havent changed them said geoffrey  i asked you to meet me here today to consider whether the ore already in sight would be worth reduction and you say no you can advise your friends when you see them that im not inclined to assist them in a deliberate fraud upon the public  melhuish laughed  you are exaggerating and people seem perfectly willing to pay for their experience whether they acquire it over copper lead or tin  besides theres an average commercial probability that somebody will find good ore after going down far enough and your part would be easy  you take a moderate price as vendor we advancing enough to settle the mortgage  sign the papers my friends will send you and keep your mouth shut  and their expert wouldnt see that fault asked geoffrey  melhuish smiled pityingly before he answered  the gentlemen i speak of keep an expert who certainly wouldnt see any more than was necessary  the indications that deceived me are good enough for anybody  human judgment is always liable to error and there are ways of framing a report without committing the person who makes it  may i repeat that its a fair business risk and whoever takes this mine should strike the lead if sufficient capital is poured in  it would be desirable for you to act judiciously  my financial friends i understand have been in communication with the people who hold your mortgages  geoffrey thurstons temper always fiery had been sorely tried dropping his pick he gripped the tempter by the shoulder with fingers that held him like a vice  he pressed melhuish backward until they stood within a foot of the verge of the black rift  melhuishs face was gray in the candlelight as he heard the dislodged pebbles splash sullenly into the water fathoms beneath  he had heard stories of the vagaries of the thurstons of crosbie and it was most unpleasant to stand on the brink of eternity in the grasp of one of them  suddenly geoffrey dropped his hands  you need better nerves in your business melhuish he said quietly  one would hardly have fancied you would be so startled at a harmless joke intended to test them for you  there have been several spendthrifts and highly successful drunkards in my family but with the exception of my namesake who was hanged like a jacobite gentleman for taking sword in hand their despatches from two of cumberlands dragoons we have hitherto drawn the line at stealing  im not interested in genealogy and i dont appreciate jests of the sort you have just tried melhuish answered somewhat shakily  ill take your word that you meant no harm and i request further and careful consideration before you return a definite answer to my friends suggestions  you shall have it in a few days geoffrey promised and melhuish who determined to receive the answer under the open sunlight and if possible with assistance near at hand turned toward the mouth of the adit  because he thought it wiser he walked behind geoffrey  the afternoon was not yet past when thurston stood leaning on the back of a stone seat outside a quaint old hall which had once been a feudal fortalice and was now attached to an unprofitable farm  because the impoverished gentleman who held a long lease on the ancient building had let one wing to certain sportsmen several of geoffreys neighbors had gathered on the indifferentlykept lawn to enjoy a tennis match miss millicent austin sat in an angle of the stone seat  her little feet encased in white shoes reposed upon a cushion that one of the sportsmen had insisted on bringing to her  her hands lay idly folded in her lap  the delicate hands were characteristic for millicent austin was slight and dainty  with pale gold hair and pink and white complexion she was a perfect type of saxon beauty though some of her rivals said the color of her eyes was too light a blue  they also added that the blue eyes were very quick to notice where their owners interests lay  an indefinite engagement had long existed between the girl and the man beside her and at one time they had cherished a degree of affection for each other but when the merry highspirited girl returned from london changed into a calculating woman geoffrey was bound up mind and body in his mine and millicent began to wonder whether with her advantages she might not do better than to marry a dalesman burdened by heavy debts  they formed a curious contrast the man brownhaired browneyed hardhanded rugged of feature and sometimes rugged of speech and the dainty woman who appeared born for a life of ease and luxury  beauty and the beast said one young woman to her companion as she laid by her racquet  i suppose he has the money  unless his mine proves successful i dont think either will have much but if miss austin is a beauty in a mild way hes a noble beast one very likely to turn the tables upon a rash hunter was the answer and yet hes stalking blindly into the snare  alas poor lion  you seem interested in him  im not partial to wild beasts myself remarked her companion and the other smiled as she answered  hardly that but i know the family history and they are a curious race with great capabilities for good or evil  it all depends upon how they are led because nobody could drive a thurston  it is rather i must confess an instinctive prejudice against the woman beside him  i do not like and would not trust miss austin though of course except to you my dear i would not say so  the young speaker glanced a moment towards the pair and then passed on with a slight frown upon her honest face for thurston bent over his companion with something that suggested deadly earnestness in his attitude and the spectator assumed that millicent austins head was turned away from him because she possessed a fine profile and not because of excessive diffidence  nor was the observer wrong for millicent did little without a purpose and was just then thinking keenly as she said  i am very sorry to hear about your misfortune geoffrey but there is a way of escape from most disasters if one will look for it you know and if you came to terms with them i understand those london people would at least recoup you for your expenditure  you have heard of that exclaimed geoffrey sharply displeased that his fiancée who had been away should betray so accurate a knowledge of all that concerned his business affairs  of course i did  i made tom tell me  you will agree with them will you not the girl replied  so said geoffrey with a slight huskiness  i wish i could but it is impossible and i am not pleased that tom should tell you what i was waiting to confide to you myself  let that pass for i want you to listen to me  the old holding will have to go and there is little room for a poor man in this overcrowded country  as you know certain property will revert to me eventually but remembering what is in our blood i dare not trust myself to drag out a life of idleness or monotonous drudgery waiting for the future here  the curse is a very real thingand it would not be fair to you  now i can save enough from the wreck to start us without positive hardship over seas and george has written offering me a small share in his australian cattlerun  you shall want for nothing millicent that toil can win you and i know that with you to help me i shall achieve at least a competence  millicent who glanced up at him as if she were carefully studying him could see that the man spoke with conviction  she knew that his power of effort and dogged obstinacy would carry him far toward obtaining whatever his heart desired  she dropped her long lashes as he continued  hitherto i have overcome the taint i spoke ofyou knew what it was when you gave me your promiseand working hard with you to cheer me in a new land under the open sun i shall crush it utterly semipoverty with an illpaid task that demanded but half my energies would try you millicent and be dangerous to me  what i say sounds very selfish doesnt itbut you will come  there was an appeal in his voice which touched the listener  it was seldom a thurston of crosbie asked help from anyone but she had no wish to encourage geoffrey in what she considered his folly and shook her head with a pretty assumption of petulance  dont be sensational she said with a wave of her hand  you are prone to exaggeration and of course i will not go with you  how could i help you to chase wild cattle  now try to be sensible  come to terms with these company people and then you need not go  would you have me a thief asked geoffrey gazing down upon her with a fierce resentment in his look of reproach and the girl shrank from him a little  no but so far as i understand it this is an ordinary business transaction and if these people are willing to buy the mine why should you refuse she returned in a temporizing tone  if thurston was less in love with millicent austin than he had been he hardly realized it then  he was disappointed and his forehead contracted as he struggled with as heavy a temptation as could have assailed the honor of any man  millicent was very fair to look upon as she turned to him with entreaty and anxiety in her face  nevertheless he answered wearily it is not an ordinary business transaction  these people would pay me with the general publics money and when the mine proves profitless as it certainly will they would turn the deluded shareholders loose on me  there are always risks in mining millicent observed significantly the investing public understands that doesnt it  of course i would not have you dishonest but geoffrey  thurston was patient in action but seldom in speech and he broke out hotly  many a woman has sent a man to his damnation for a little luxury but i expected help from you  millicent if i assist those swindlers and stay here dragging out the life of a gentleman pauper on a dole of stolen money i shall go down and down dragging you with me  if you will come out to a new country with me i know you will never regret it  whatever is best worth winning over there i will win for you cant you see that we stand at the crossroads and whichever way we choose there can be no turning back  think and for gods sake think well  the decision means everything to you and me  again millicent was aware of an unwilling admiration for the speaker even though she had little for his sentiments  he stood erect with a grim look on his face his nostrils quivering and his lips firmly setstubborn vindictive powerful  though his strength was untrained she knew that he was a man to trustgreat in his very failings with no meanness in his composition and clearly born for risky enterprise and hazardous toil  she was a little afraid of him a fact which was not in itself unpleasant but she dreaded poverty and hardship  with a shrug of the shoulder upon which he had laid his hand she said  i think you are absurd today you are hurting me  this melodramatic pose approaches the ludicrous and i have really no patience with your folly  a little period of calm reflection may prove beneficial and i will leave you to it  clara is beckoning me  she turned away and thurston after vainly looking around for clara stalked sullenly into the hall where he flung himself down in a chair beside an open window  it did not please him to see millicent take her place before the net in the tennis court and to hear her laugh ring lightly across the lawn  a certain sportsman named leslie who had devoted himself to miss austins service watched him narrowly from a corner of the big hall  you look badly hipped over something thurston commented the sportsman presently  i suppose its the mine and would like to offer my sympathy  might i recommend a brandyandsoda one of those cubanos and confidence  tom left the bottle handy for you  in spite of the family failing or perhaps because it was the only thing he feared thurston had been an abstemious man  now however he emptied one stiff tumbler at a gulp and the soda frothed in the second when he noticed a curious smile for just a moment in the eyes of his companion  the smile vanished immediately but thurston had seen and remembered  it was characteristic of him that before two more seconds had passed the glass crashed into splinters in the grate  quite right exclaimed leslie nodding  when one feels as you evidently do a little of that sort of consolation is considerably better than too much  you dont however appear to be in a companionable humor and perhaps i had better not intrude on you  during the rest of the afternoon thurston saw little of millicent and leslie was much with her  the weather changed suddenly when at dusk geoffrey rode home  in forecast of winter a bitter breeze sighed across the heather and set the harsh grasses moaning eerily  the sky was somber overhead scarred fell and towering pike had faded to blurs of dingy gray and the ghostly whistling of curlew emphasized the emptiness of the darkening moor  the evenings mood suited geoffreys and he rode slowly with loose bridle  the bouquet of the brandy had awakened within him a longing that he dreaded and though hitherto he had been too intent upon his task to trouble about his character it was borne in upon him that he must stand fast now or never  but it was not the thought of his own future which first appealed to him  those who had gone before him had rarely counted consequences when tempted by either wine or women and he would have risked that freely  geoffrey was however in his own eccentric fashion a just man and he dared not risk bringing disaster upon millicent  so he rode slowly thinking hard until the horse which seemed affected by its masters restlessness plunged as a dark figure rose out of the heather  hallo is it you evans asked the rider with a forced laugh  i thought it was the devil  hes abroad tonight  thourt wrang mr geoffrey answered the gamekeeper  its thursday night he comes  black jim as broke thy head for thee is coming with t quarrymen to poach t covers  got the office from yan with a grudge against t gang an captain franklin whos layin for him sends his compliments thinkin as maybe thee would like t fun  thurston rarely forgot either an injury or a friend and the preceding october when tripping he fell helpless black jim twice with murderous intent had brought a gunbutt down upon his unprotected skull  excitement was at all times as wine to him so promising to be at the rendezvous he rode homeward faster than before with a sense of anticipation which helped to dull the edge of his care     chapter ii  a disillusion  it was a clear cold night when geoffrey thurston met captain franklin who held certain sporting rights in the vicinity at the place agreed upon  the captain had brought with him several amateur assistants and stablehands besides two stalwart keepers  greeting thurston he said  very good of you to help me  our local constable is either afraid or powerless and i must accordingly allow black jims rascals to sweep my covers or take the law into my own hands  it is the pheasants he is after now and hell start early so as to get his plunder off from the junction by the night mail and because the moon rises soon  we had better divide and you might come with evans and me to the beeches while the others search the fir spinney  geoffrey assenting followed the officer across a dewdamped meadow and up a winding lane hung with gossamerdecked briars until the party halted ankledeep among withered leaves in a dry ditch just outside the wood  there were reasons why each detail of all that happened on that eventful night should impress itself upon geoffreys memory and long afterwards when wandering far out in the shadow of limitless forests or the chill of eternal snow he could recall every incident leaves that made crimson glories by day still clung low down about the widegirthed trunks beyond the straggling hedge of ancient thorns but the higher branches rose nakedly against faintly luminous sky  spruce firs formed clumps of solid blackness and here and there a delicate tracery of birch boughs filled gaps against the skyline between  the meadows behind him were silent and empty streaked with belts of spectral mist and because it was not very late he could see a red glimmer of light in the windows of barrow hall  but if the grass told no story it was otherwise with the wood for geoffrey could hear the rabbits thumping in their burrows among the roots of the thorn  twice a cockpheasant uttered a drowsy raucous crow and there was a blundering of unseen feathery bodies among the spruce while when this ceased he heard a waterhen flutter with feet splashing across a hidden pool  then heavy stillness followed intensified by the clamor of a beck which came foaming down the side of a fell until clattering loudly woodpigeons neither asleep nor wholly awake drove out against the sky wheeled and fell clumsily into the wood again  all this was a plain warning and keeper evans nodded agreement when captain franklin said  theres somebody here and in order not to miss him well divide our forces once more  if youll go in by the hall footpath thurston and whistle on sight of anything suspicious id be much obliged to you  a few minutes later thurston halted on the topmost step of the lofty stile by which a footpath from the hall entered the wood  looking back across misty grass land and swelling ridges of heather he could see a faint brightness behind the eastern rim of the moor but when he stepped down it was very dark among the serried treetrunks  the slender birches had faded utterly the stately beeches resembled dim ghosts of trees and only the spruces retained imperfectly their shape and form  thurston was country bred and lifting high his feet to clear bramble trailer and fallen twig he walked by feeling instead of sight  the beck moaned a little more loudly and there was a heavy astringent odor of damp earth and decaying leaves  when beast and bird were still again it seemed as if nature worn out by the productive effort of summer were sinking under solemn silence into her winter sleep  the watcher knew the wood was a large one and unlawful visitants might well be hidden towards its farther end  he stood still at intervals concentrating all his powers to listen but his ears told him nothing until at last there was a rustle somewhere ahead  puzzled by the sound which reminded him of something curiously out of place in the lonely wood he instantly sank down behind an ash tree  the sound certainly was not made by withered bracken or bramble leaves and had nothing to do with the stealthy fall of a poachers heavy boot it came again more clearly and thurston was almost sure that it was the rustle of a woven fabric such as a womans dress  to confirm this opinion a soft laugh followed  he rose deciding it could only be some assignation with a maid from the hall and no business of his  he had turned to retreat when he noticed the eastern side of a silver fir reflect a faint shimmer  glancing along the beam of light that filtered through a fantastic fretwork of delicate birch twigs arching a drive he saw a broad bright disk hanging low above the edge of the moor  it struck him that perhaps the poachers had used the girl to coax information out of a young groom or keeper and that she was now warning them  so he waited debating because he was a rudely chivalrous person how he might secure the girls companion without involving the girls disgrace  again a laugh rose from beyond a thicket  then he heard the voice of a man  geoffrey was puzzled for the laugh was musical unlike a rustic giggle and though the calling of the beck partly drowned it the mans voice did not resemble that of a laborer  thurston moved again wondering whether it was not some affair of leslies from the hall and whether he ought not to slip away after all  the birch boughs sighed a little there was a fluttering down of withered leaves and he remained undecided gripping his stout oak cudgel by the middle  then the hot blood pulsed fiercely through every artery for the voice rose once more harsh and clear this time with almost a threat in the tone and there was no possibility of doubting that the speaker was leslie  this cannot continue millicent the voice said  it has gone on too long and i will not be trifled with  you cannot have both of us and my patience is exhausted  leave the fool to his folly  geoffrey raised the cudgel and dropped it to his side  turning suddenly cold he remained for a second or two almost without power of thought or motion  the disillusion was cruel  the womans light answer filled him with returning fury and he hurled himself at a thicket from which amid a crash of branches he reeled out into the sight of the speakers  the moon was well clear of the moor now and silver light and inky shadow checkered the mosses of the drive  with a little scream of terror millicent sprang apart from her companions side and stood for a space staring at the man who had appeared out of the rentdown undergrowth  the pale light beat upon geoffreys face showing it was white with anger  looking from geoffrey the girl glanced towards leslie who waited in the partial shadow of a hazel bush  even had he desired to escape which was possible the bush would have cut off his retreat  geoffrey turned fiercely from one to the other  the woman who stood with one hand on a birch branch was evidently struggling to regain her courage  her lips were twitching and her pale blue eyes were very wide open  the man was shrinking back as far as possible in a manner which suggested physical fear he had heard the dalesfolk say a savage devil easily aroused lurked in all the thurstons and the one before him looked distinctly dangerous just then  leslie was weak in limb as well as moral fiber and it was geoffrey who broke the painful silence  what are you doing here at such an hour with this man millicent he asked sternly  no answer  it appears that some explanation is certainly due to meand i mean to force it out of one of you  millicent saying nothing gazed at her companion as if conjuring him to speak plainly and to end an intolerable position  geoffrey read her meaning even though leslie who glanced longingly over his shoulder down the drive refused to do so  because there was spirit in her and she had recovered from the first shock of surprise millicent ground one little heel into the mosses with a gesture of disgust and anger when the man made answer  i resent your attitude and question  we came out to see the moon rise on the moor and found the night breeze nipping  geoffrey laughed harshly before he repeated you found the breeze nipping  there is scarcely an air astir  and you understand the relations existing between miss austin and me  i want a better reason millicent you at least are not a cowarddare you give it me  i challenge your right to demand an account of my actions said the girl  with an evident effort to defy thurston she added after a pause but the explanation must have come sooner or later and you shall have it now  i have grownperhaps the brutal truth is besttired of you and your folly  you would sacrifice my future to your fantastic prideand this man would give up everything for me  the first heat of geoffreys passion was past and he was now coldly savage because of the womans treachery  including his conscience and honor but not his personal safety he supplemented contemptuously  millicent one could almost admire you turning to leslie he asked but are you struck dumb that you let the woman speak  this was my promised wife to whom you have been making love though for delicacy would be superfluous it is evident that she has not discouraged you  until three days ago i could have trusted my life to her  now i presume she has pledged herself to you  yes answered leslie recovering his equanimity as his fears grew less oppressive  he began to excuse himself but geoffrey cut him short with a gesture  then even if i desired to make them my protests would be useless said geoffrey  i am at least grateful for your frankness millicent it prevented me from wringing the truth from your somewhat abject lover  had you told me honestly when this man first spoke to you that you had grown tired of me i would have released you and i would have tried to wish you well  now i can only say that at least you know the worst of each otherand there will be less disappointment when stripped of either mutual or self respect you begin life together  but i was forgetting that franklins keepers are searching the wood  some of them might talk  go at once by the hall path as softly as you can  the man and the girl were plainly glad to hurry away and geoffrey waited until the sound of their footsteps became scarcely audible before he heeded a faint rustling which indicated that somebody with a knowledge of woodcraft was forcing a passage through the undergrowth he broke a dry twig at intervals as he walked slowly for a little distance  then he dropped on hands and knees to cross a strip of open sward at an angle to his previous course and lay still in the black shadow of a spruce  it was evident that somebody was following his trail and the pursuer passing his hidingplace followed it straight on  geoffreys was a curious character and the very original cure for a disappointment in love that of baffling a game watcher while his faithless mistress escaped brought him relief it left no time for reflection  presently he dashed across a bare strip of velvet mosses and rabbitcropped turf slipped between the roots of the hedge and running silently beneath it halted several score yards away face to face with the astonished keeper  weel im clanged this clean beats me gasped that worthy  hello behind there  its only mr geoffrey sir  didst see black jim slip out this way or hear a scream a laal while gone by  i saw no one answered geoffrey but i heard the scream  it was not unlike a hare squealing in a snare  you and i must have been stalking each other evans and black jim cant be here  the rest came up as they spoke and captain franklin said you seem badly disappointed at missing your old enemy thurston  i never saw you look so savage  i expect black jim has tricked us after all  ive had several troubles lately and dont find much amusement in hunting poachers who arent there said geoffrey  you will excuse me from going back with you  he departed across the meadows at a swinging pace and the keeper who stared after him commented  something gradely wrang with mr geoffrey tonight  theyre an ill folk to counter yon and its maybe as well for black jim as mr geoffrey didnt get hold on him  geoffrey saw no more of millicent but once he visited her younger sister a gentle invalid who because of the friendship which had long existed between them said you must try to believe i mean it in kindness when i say that i am not wholly sorry geoffrey  you and millicent would never have gotten on well together and while i wish the awakening could have happened in a more creditable way you will realizewhen somebody else makes you happythat all has been for the best  that day will be long in coming declared the man grimly and the sick girl laid a thin white hand on his hard one as she answered him  it is not a flattering speech and you must not lose faith in all of us the invalid went on  lying still here helpless i have often thought about both of you and i feel that you have done well in choosing a new life in a new country  when you go out geoffrey you will take my fervent wishes for your welfare with you  janet austin was frail and worn by pain  her pale face flushed a little as the man suddenly stooped and touched her forehead with his lips  god bless you for your kindly heart he said  a ruined man has very few friends and many acquaintances are waiting to convince him that his downfall is the result of his own folly butand he straightened his wiry frame while his eyes glintedthey have not seen the end and even if beaten there is satisfaction in a stubborn singlehanded struggle  janet austin perhaps thinking of her own helplessness sighed as she answered  i do not think you will be beaten geoffrey but if you will take advice from me remember that overconfidence in your powers and the pride that goes with it may cost you many a minor victory  goodby and good luck geoffrey  you will remember me  that afternoon while thurston was in the midst of preparations to leave his native land the mining engineer called upon him with a provincial newspaper in his hand  i suppose this is your answer he remarked laying his finger on a paragraph   mr g thurston who has in the face of many difficulties attempted to exploit the copper vein in crosbie fell has been compelled to close the mine the printed lines ran  we understand he came upon an unexpected break in the strata coupled with a subsidence which practically precludes the possibility of following the lost lead with any hope of commercial success  he has therefore placed his affairs in the hands of messrs lonsdale  routh solicitors and we understand intends emigrating  his many friends and former employees wish him success   yes geoffrey answered dryly i sent them the information also a copy to london financial papers  considering the interest displayed just now in british mines they should insert a paragraph  ive staked down your backers game in return for your threats and you may be thankful you have come off so easily  your check is ready  it is the last you will ever get from me  the expert smiled almost goodnaturedly  you neednt have taken so much trouble thurston he said  the exploitation of your rabbit burrow would only have been another drop in the bucket to my correspondents and its almost a pity we cant be friends for with some training your sledgehammer style would make its mark in the ring  thanks replied geoffrey  im not fishing for compliments and its probably no use explaining my motivesyou wouldnt understand them still in future dont set down every man commonly honest as an uncommon fool  if i ever had much money which is hardly likely i should fight extremely shy of any investments recommended by your friends     chapter iii  geoffreys first contract  it was springtime among the mountains which glistening coldly white with mantles of eternal snow towered above the deepsunk valley when one morning geoffrey thurston limped painfully out of a redwood forest of british columbia  the boom of a hidden river set the pine sprays quivering  a blue grouse was drumming deliriously on the top of a stately fir and the morning sun drew clean healing odors from balsam and cedar  the scene was characteristic of what is now the grandest and wildest as it will some day be the richest province of the canadian dominion the serene majesty of snowclad heights and the grandeur of vast shadowy aisles with groined roofs of red branches and mighty colonnades of living trunks were partly lost upon the traveler who most of the preceding night had trudged wearily over rough railroad ballast  he had acquired colonial experience of the hardest kind by working through the winter in an ontario logging camp which is a rough school  an hour earlier the man to visit whom thurston had undertaken an eightleague journey had laughed in his face when he offered to drain a lake which flooded his ranch  saying nothing but looking grimmer than ever geoffrey had continued his weary journey in search of sustenance  he frowned as he flung himself down beneath a fir for shimmering like polished steel between the giant trees the glint of water caught his eye and the blue wood smoke curling over the house on a distant slope suggested the usual plentiful colonial breakfast  although geoffreys male forbears had been reckless men his mother had transmitted him a strain of northcountry canniness  the remnant of his poor possessions converted into currency lay in a canadian bank to provide working capital and finding no scope for his mental abilities he had wandered here and there endeavoring to sell the strength of his body for daily bread  sometimes he had been successful more often he had failed but always when he would accept it the kindly bush settlers gave him freely of their best  as he basked in the warmth and brightness he took from his pocket a few cents worth of crackers  when he had eaten his face relaxed for the love of wild nature was born in him and the glorious freshness of the spring was free to the poorest as well as to the richest  he stooped to drink at a glacierfed rill and then producing a corncob pipe sighed on finding that only the tin label remained of his cake of tobacco  through the shadow of the firs two young women watched him with curiosity  the man looked worn and weary his jean jacket was old and torn and an essential portion of one boot was missing  the strangers face had been almost blackened by the snowreflected glare of the clear winter sun and yet both girls decided that he was hardly a representative specimen of the wandering fraternity of tramps  helen savine was slender tall and dark  though arrayed in a plain dress of light fabric she carried herself with a dignity befitting the daughter of the famous engineering contractor julius savine and a descendant through her mother from seigneurs of ancient french descent who had ruled in patriarchal fashion in oldworld quebec  jean graham whose father owned the ranch on the slope behind them was ruddy in face with a solidity of frame that betokened caledonian extraction and true transatlantic directness of speech  he must be hungry whispered jean  quite goodlooking too and its queer he sits there munching those crackers instead of walking straight up and striking us for a meal  i dont like to see a goodlooking man hungry she added reflectively  we will go down and speak to him said helen and the suggestion that she should interview a wandering vagrant did not seem out of place in that country where men from many different walks of life turned their often illfitted hands to the rudest labor that promised them a livelihood  in any case helen possessed a somewhat imperious will which was supplemented by a grace of manner which made whatever she did appear right  geoffrey looking round at the sound of approaching steps stood suddenly upright thrusting the more dilapidated boot behind the other and wondering with what purpose the two girls had sought him  one he recognized as a type common enough throughout the dominionkindly shrewd somewhat hardfeatured and caustic in speech but the other who looked down on him with thinlyveiled pity more resembled the women of birth and education whom he had seen in england  you are a stranger to this district  looking for work perhaps said helen savine  geoffrey lifted his wide and battered felt hat as he answered i am  there is work here announced helen  i can offer you a dollar nowif you would care to earn it  yonder rock which i believe is a loose boulder obstructs our wagon trail  if you are willing to remove it and will follow us to the ranch you will find suitable tools  geoffrey flushed a little under his tan  when seeking work he had grown used to being sworn at by foremen with protectionist tendencies but it galled him to be offered a womans charity and the words if you would care to earn it left a sting  nevertheless he reflected that any superfluous sensitiveness would be distinctly out of place in one of his position and considering the wages paid in that country the man who rolled the boulder clear would well earn his dollar accordingly he answered i should be glad to remove the rock if i can  the two young women turned back towards the ranch and thurston followed respectfully as far as possible in the rear that they might not observe the condition of his attire  this was an entirely superfluous precaution for helens keen eyes had noticed  reaching the ranch geoffrey possessed himself of a grubhoe which is a pick with an adzshaped blade with an ax and shovel also he returned with the girls to the boulder  for an hour or two he toiled hard grubbing out hundredweights of soil and gravel from round about the rock  then cutting a young fir he inserted the butt of it as a lever and spent another thirty minutes focusing his full strength on the opposite end  the rock however refused to move an inch and because a few crackers are not much for a hungry man to work on after an allnight march thurston became conscious that he had a headache and a distressful stitch in his side  still being obstinate and filled with an unreasoning desire to prove his trustworthiness to his fair employer he continued doggedly and after another hours digging found the stone still immovable  then it happened that while with the perspiration dripping from him he tugged at the lever the rancher who had rebuffed him that morning drew rein close beside  hello  what are you after now  youre messing all this trail up if youre doing nothing else he declared in a tone of challenge  if you have come here to amuse yourself at my expense take care  im not in the mood for baiting answered thurston who still smarted under the recollection of the summary manner in which the speaker had rejected his proffered services  there are however folks in this country more willing to give a stranger a chance than you and ive taken a contract to remove that rock for a dollar  now if you are satisfied ride on your way  then youve made a blame bad bargain commented the rancher with unruffled good humor  i was figuring that i might help you  i thought you were a hobo after my chickens or trying to bluff me into a free meal this morning  if youd asked straight for it id have given it you  geoffrey hesitated divided between an inclination to laugh or to assault the rancher who perhaps guessed his thoughts for dismounting he said  if youre so mighty thinskinned what are you doing here  why dont you british dukes stop right back in your own country where folks touch their hats to you  let me on to that lever  for at least twenty minutes the two men tugged and panted  then bransome the rancher said  the blame things either part of the outcrop or wedged fast there forever and ive no more time to spare  say grahams a hard man and has been playing it low on you  whats the matter with turning his contract up and going over to fill oat bags for me  thank but having given my word to move that rock im going to stay here until i do it answered geoffrey and bransome nodding to him rode on towards the ranch  when he reached it bransome said to jean graham in the hearing of miss savine  the old man has taken in yonder guileless stranger who has put two good dollars worth of work into that job already and the rocks rather faster than it was before  did he say mr graham hired him asked helen and she drew her own inference when bransome answered  why no  i put it that way and he didnt contradict me  it was afternoon when thurston realized at last that even considerable faith in ones self is not sufficient unaided to move huge boulders he felt faint and hungry but the pride of the insular briton restrained him from begging for a meal  his own dislike to acknowledge defeat also prompted him to decide that where weary muscles failed mechanical power might succeed and he determined to tramp back a league to the settlement in the hope of perhaps obtaining a drill and some giant powder on credit  he had not studied mining theoretically as well as in a costly practical school for nothing  it was a rough trail to the settlement  the red dust lay thick upon it and the afternoon sun was hot  when at last powdered all over with dust and very weary thurston came in sight of the little wooden store he noticed bransomes horse fastened outside it  he did not see the rancher who sat on an empty box behind a sugar hogshead inside the counter  i want two sticks of giant powder a fathom or two of fuse and several detonators said geoffrey as indifferently as he could  i have only two bits at present to pay for them but if they dont come to more than a dollar you shall have the rest tomorrow  i also want to borrow a drill  the storekeeper was used to giving much longer credit than geoffrey wanted but the glance he cast at the applicant was not reassuring and it is possible he might have refused his request but that unseen by thurston bransome signaled to him from behind the barrel  we dont trade that way with strangers generally the storekeeper answered  still if you want them special and will pay me what theyre worth tomorrow ill oblige you and even lend you a set of drills  but youll come back sure and not lose any of them drills he added dubiously  i havent come here to rob you  its a business deal and not a favor im asking asserted geoffrey grimly and when he withdrew the storekeeper observed  why cant you do your own charity bransome instead of taxing me thats the crank who wanted to run your lake down isnt he  i guess ill never see either him or them drills again  you will the rancher assured him  if that mans alive tomorrow youll get your money ill go bail for him  hes just the man you mention but im considerably less sure about the crankiness than i was this morning  theres a quantity of fine clean sand in him  meanwhile and soon after geoffrey had set out for the store the two girls strolled down the trail to ascertain how he was progressing they looked at each other significantly when they came upon the litter of débris and tools  lit out announced jean graham  the sight of all that work was too much for him  hell be lying on his back now by the river thinking poetry  this countrys just thick with reposeful britishers nobody at home has any use for and their kind friends ship off onto us  in a way im sorry  he lit out hungry and he didnt look like a loafer  im afraid we were a little hard upon him said helen smiling still i am somewhat surprised he did not carry out his bargain  you can never trust those giltedge britishers said jean graham with authority  there was old man peters who took one of them in and hed sit in the store nights making little songs to his banjo and talking just wonderful  said he was a baronet or something if he had his rights and made love to sally  old fool peters believed him and lent him three hundred dollars to start a lawsuit over his english property with  dessay peters thought redhaired sally would look well trailing round as a countess in a goldhemmed dress  the baronet took the money but wanted some more and lit out the same night with lou of the sapin rouge saloon  i should hardly expect all that from our acquaintance of this morning but i am disappointed though im sure i dont know why i should be said helen savine  the sunlight had faded from the valley though the peaks still shimmered orange and red and the broken edge of a glacier flashed like a great rose diamond when the two girls sat on the veranda encircling grahams ranchhouse  the rancher and his stalwart sons were away rounding up his cattle but jean was expecting both them and her mother and the delayed supper was ready  the evening was very still and cool the lifegiving air was heavy with the breath of dewtouched cedars while the hoarse clamor of the river accentuated the hush of the mountain solitude  strange to say both of the girls were thinking about the vagrant and helen savine who considered herself a judge of character had been more impressed by him than she would have cared to admit  there was no doubt she reflected that the man was tolerably goodlooking and had enjoyed some training though perhaps not the best in england  he had also known adversity she deduced from the gauntness of his face and a certain grimness of expression  she had noticed that his chin indicated a masterful expression and she was therefore the more surprised that he had allowed himself to be vanquished by the boulder  suddenly a heavy crash broke through the musical jangle of cow bells that drew nearer up the valley and a cloud of yellow smoke curling above the dark branches spread itself across the fir tops in filmy folds  i guess thats our hobo blowing the rock up cried jean  i wonder where he stole the giant powder from  well daddys found his cattle and the swearing will have made him hungry  ill start kate on to the supper and well bring the man in when he comes round for his dollar  presently thurston knocked at the door and strode in at a summons to enter  slightly abashed he halted inside the threshold  jean looking ruddy and winsome in light print dress with sleeves rolled clear of each plump forearm was spreading great platefuls of hot cakes and desiccated fruits among the more solid viands on the snowy tablecloth  geoffrey found it difficult to refrain from glancing wolfishly at the good things until his eyes rested upon miss savine and then it cost him an effort to turn them away  helen reclined on an oxhide lounge  an early rose rested among the glossy clusters of her thick dark hair  a faint tinge of crimson showed through the pale olive in her cheek and he caught the glimmer of pearly teeth between the ripe red lips  in her presence he grew painfully conscious that he was ragged toilstained and dusty though he had made the best toilet he could beside a stream  i have removed the rock and have brought the tools back he said  how much did the explosives cost you asked helen and geoffrey smiled  if you will excuse me is not that beside the question  i engaged to remove the boulder and i have done it he answered  ever since her mothers death helen savine had ruled her father and most of the men with whom she came in contact  she had come to the ranch with mr savine who was interested in many enterprises in the neighborhood and she was prepared to be interested in whatever occurred  few of her wishes ever had been thwarted so naturally she was conscious of a faint displeasure that a disheveled wanderer should even respectfully slight her question  placing two silver coins on the table the said coldly  then here are your covenanted wages and we are obliged to you  geoffrey handed one of the coins back with a slight inclination of his head  our bargain was one dollar madam and i cannot take more perhaps you have forgotten he replied  helen was distinctly annoyed now  the color grew a little warmer in her cheek and her eyes brighter but she uttered only a thank you and took up the piece of silver  jean graham prompted by the westerners generous hospitality and a feeling that she had been overlooked spoke  you have earned a square meal any way and youre going to get it she declared  sit right down there and well have supper when the boys come in  uneasily conscious that helen was watching him thurston cast a swift hungry glance at the food  then remembering his frayed and tattered garments and the hole in his boot he answered i thank you but as i must be well on my way tomorrow i cannot stay  then youll take these along and eat them when it suits you said the girl deftly thrusting a plateful of hot cakes upon him  divided between gratitude and annoyance geoffrey stood still stupidly holding out the dainties at arms length while flavored syrup dripped from them  it was equally impossible to return them without flagrant discourtesy or to retire with any dignity  finally he moved out backwards still clutching the plate of cakes and when he had disappeared helen laughed softly while jeans merriment rang out in rippling tones  you saved the situation said helen  it was really getting embarrassing and he made me ashamed  i ought to have known better than to play that trick with the dollar but the poor man looked as if he needed it  he is certainly not a hobo and i could wonder who he is but that it does not matter as we shall never see him again  meanwhile geoffrey thurston walked savagely down the trail  he felt greatly tempted to hurl the cakes away but on second thoughts ate them instead  it was a trifling decision but it led to important results as trifles often do because if he had not satisfied his hunger he would have limped back through the settlement towards the railroad and probably never would have reentered the valley  as it was when the edge of his hunger was blunted he felt drowsy and curling himself up among the roots of hemlock sank into slumber under the open sky  early next morning bransome stopped him on the trail  ive been thinking over what you told me about making a rock cutting to run the water clear of my meadows said the rancher and if youre still keen on business im open to talk to you  why didnt you talk yesterday morning inquired thurston and bransome answered frankly well just then i had my doubts about you now i figure that if you say you can do a thing you can  come over to the ranch and if we cant make a deal ill give you a weeks work any way  thanks replied thurston  i should be glad to but i have some business at the settlement first  will you advance me a dollar on account of wages so that i can discharge a debt to the storekeeper  why yes agreed the rancher  but didnt you get a dollar from graham yesterday  do you want two  yes said thurston  i want two and bransome laughed  youre in a greater hurry to pay your debts than other folks from your country ive met over here he observed with a smile  but come on to the ranch and breakfast ill square the storekeeper for you  thurston accepted the chance that offered him a sustaining meal but he did not explain that owing to some faint trace of superstition in his nature he intended to keep helen savines dollar  it was the first coin that he had earned as his own master in the dominion and he felt that the successfullyexecuted contract marked a turning point in his career     chapter iv  geoffrey makes progress  thurston did justice to his breakfast at bransomes ranch and he frankly informed his host that he had found it difficult to exist on two handfuls of crackers and one of hot corn cakes  when the meal was finished and pipes were lighted the two men surveyed each other with mutual interest  they were not unlike in physique for the colonial was as is usual with his kind lean and wiry  his quick restless movements suggested nervous energy but when advisable he could assume the bovine stolidity which though foreign to his real nature the canadian bushman occasionally adopts for diplomatic purposes thurston however still retained certain traits of the insular briton including a curtness of speech and a judicious reserve  that blame lake backs up on my meadows each time the creek rises bransome observed at length  the snow melts fast in haytime and more often than i like a freshet harvests my timothy grass for me now cutting down threehundredfoot redwoods is good as exercise but it gets monotonous and a big strip of natural prairie would be considerably more useful than a beavers swimming bath  you said you could blow a channel through the rocks that hold up the outlet didnt you  i can geoffrey asserted confidently  from some knowledge of mining i am inclined to think that a series of heavy charges fired simultaneously along the natural cleavage would reduce the lakes level at least a fathom  have you got a pencil  here it was that the national idiosyncrasies of the men became apparent for thurston leaning on one elbow made an elaborate sketch and many calculations with bransomes pencil  a hummingbird resplendent in gold and purple blundered in between the roses shrouding the open window and hovered for a moment above him on invisible wings  thurston did not notice the bird but bransome flung a crust at it as he smiled on his companion  well take the figures for granted  life is too short to worry over them the rancher said  lets get down to business  how much are you asking no cure no pay i finding tools and material  i want your bottom price straight away  thurston had never done business in so summary a fashion before but he could adapt himself to circumstances and he mentioned a moderate sum forthwith  cant come downthen its a deal bransome announced contractthis is the pacific slope and weve no time for such foolery  im figuring that i can trust you and my words good enough in this locality  run that pond down a fathom and youll get your money  any particular reason why you shouldnt start in today  dont know of any  then put that pipe in your pocket and well strike out for the store at the settlement now  so it came about that at sunset geoffrey was deposited with several bags of provisions a blanket and a litter of tools outside a ruined shack on the edge of the natural prairie surrounding bransomes lake he had elected to live beside his work  a tall forest of tremendous growth walled the lake and then for a space rotting trees and willow swale showed where the intermittent rise of waters had set a limit to the allencroaching bush  the wail of a loon rang eerily out of the shadow and was answered by the howl of a distant wolf  a thin silver crescent sailed clear of the fretted minarets of towering firs clear cut against a pale pearl of the sky  carltons prairie we call it said bransome leaning against his light wagon which stood near the deserted dwelling  land which isnt all rock or forest is mighty scarce and carlton figured hed done great things when he bought this place  five years he tried to drain it working night and day and pouring good money into it and five times the freshets washed out his crops for him  the creek just laughed at his ditches  then when hed no more money he went out to help tracklaying and a big tree flattened him  the boys said he didnt seem very sorry  this prairie had broken his heart for him and ive heard the siwash say he still comes back and digs at nights when the moon is full  carlton made a mistake said geoffrey who had been examining the surroundings rather than listening to the tale  he began in what looked the easiest and was the hardest way  he should have cut the mother rock instead of trenching the forest  when bransome drove away thurston rolled himself in the thick brown blanket and sank into slumber under the lee of the dead mans dwelling through which a maple tree had grown from the inside wrenching off the shingle roof  an owl that circled about the crumbling house stooped now and then on muffled wing to inspect the sleeper  once a stealthy panther slipping through the willows bared its fangs and passed the other way and the pale green points of luminescence that twinkled in the surrounding bush and were the eyes of timber wolves faded again  neither did the deer that panther and wolves sought come down to feed on the swamp that night for a man holding dominion over the beasts of the forest lay slumbering in the desolate clearing  geoffrey began work early next day and afterwards week by week toiled from dawn until nearly sunset blasting clear minor reefs and ledges until he attacked the mother rock under the lip of a clashing fall the fee promised was by no means large and because current wages prohibited assistance he did all the work himself  so he shoveled débris and drilled holes in the hard blue grit and drilling singlehanded is a difficult operation damaging to the knuckles of the man attempting it  he waded waistdeep in water learned to carry heavy burdens on his shoulder and found his interest in the task growing upon him  he felt that much depended upon the successful completion of his contract  it was not however all monotonous labor and there were compensations for after each days toil was done he lay prone on scented pine twigs and heard the voices of the bush break softly through the solemn hush as through gradations of fading glories along the lofty snows night closed in  he would watch the black bear grubbing hogfashion among the tall wild cabbage while the little butter duck paddling before its brood set divergent lines creeping across the steely lake until the shadows of the whitened driftwood broke and quivered  sometimes he would call the chipmunks which scurried up and down behind him or tap on a rotten log until a crested woodpecker cried in answer and by degrees the spell of the mountains gained upon him until he forgot his troubles and became no more subject to fits of berserk rage  he was growing quiet and more patient learning to wait but his energy and determination still remained  but he was not wholly cut off from human intercourse for at times some of the scattered ranchers would ride over to offer impracticable advice or to predict his failure and geoffrey listened quietly answering that in time it would be proved which was right  sometimes he tramped through scented shadow to grahams homestead and discussed crops and cattle with the rancher  on these occasions he had long conversations with helen savine who finding no person of liberal education thereabouts was pleased to talk to him  there was nothing incongruous in this for petty class distinctions vanish in the bush where when his daily task is done the hired man meets his master on terms of equality  at last the day on which thurstons work was to be practically tested arrived and most of the ranchers drove over to witness what they regarded as a reckless experiment  jean graham and helen savine stood a little apart from the rest on the edge of the forest looking down on the glancing water and talking with the experimenter  the rich wet meadows were heavy with flag and blossom to the edge of the driftwood frieze and the splash of rising trout alone disturbed the reflection of the mighty trunks and branches crowning a promontory on the farther side  it is very beautiful and now you are going to spoil it all mr bransome said helen  the rancher glanced at her with admiration in his eyes  helen was worthy of inspection  her thin summer dress with the cluster of crimson roses tucked into the waist of it brought out her rich beauty which betokened a latin ancestry  yes its mighty pretty a picture worth looking atall of it he said and there was a faint smile on helens lips as she recognized that the general tribute to the picturesque was as far as bransome dared venture in the direction of a compliment  he was not a diffident person but he felt a wholesome respect for helen savine  mighty pretty but whats the good of it and im not farming for my health he continued  its just a beautiful wilderness and what has a man brains given him for unless its to turn the wilderness into cheese and butter  it has broken one mans heart and my thickheaded neighbors said a swamp it would remain forever but a stranger with ideas came along and i told him sail ahead  i did hear you told him not to be aperhaps i had better saya simple fool helen answered mischievously and bransome coughed before he made reply  maybe he acknowledged  i didnt know him then but today im ready to back that man to put through just whatever he sets his mind upon  as bransome spoke the subject of this encomium came up from the little gorge by the lake outlet and it struck helen savine that the rock worker had changed to advantage since she first saw him  his keen eyes which she had noticed were quick to flash with anger had grown more kindly and the bronzed face was more reposeful  the thin jean garments and great knee boots which had no longer any rents in them suited the wellproportioned frame  i was disappointed about the electric firing gear ordered from vancouver but i think the coupled timefuses should serve almost as well said thurston acknowledging helens presence with a bow that was significant  you appear interested miss savine  we are trusting to the shock of a number of charges fired simultaneously and perhaps you had better retire nearer the bush for the blast will be powerful i should like your good wishes since you are in a measure responsible for this venture  you will remember you gave me my first commission  you have them said helen with a frank sincerity for though the man was a mere enterprising laborer she was too proud to assume any air of condescension  she was helen savine and considered that she had no need to maintain her dignity  geoffrey returned a conventional answer and there was a buzz of voices as he and bransome walked back together towards the gorge  the rancher halted discreetly when his companion taking a brand from a fire near it clambered over the boulders  geoffrey disappeared among the rocks and the voices grew louder when he came into view again walking hurriedly  several trails of thin blue vapor began to crawl in and out among the rocks  bransome joined thurston and both men broke into a smart trot they were heading for the bush until geoffrey halting near it ran back at full speed towards the gorge  all who watched him were astonished for they were already bracing themselves to face the heavy shock  hes madstark mad roared graham  come back for your life bransome  its smashed into small pieces both of you will be and the eyes of the spectators grew wide as they watched the two running figures for the rancher also had turned and the lines of vapor were creeping with ominous swiftness across the face of the stone  there was a roar as the behind man clutched at the other missed him and staggered several paces leaving his hat behind him before he took up the chase again  single cries sharper than the rest rose out of the clamor blown to glory both of them  two sticks of giant powder in most of the holes  all thats left of the britisher wont be worth picking up  the two men disappeared among the boulders almost under the white foam of the fall and for a brief space there was heavy silence emphasized by the song of hurrying water and the drumming of a bluegrouse on the summit of a fir  helen savine fancied she could hear the assembly breathing unevenly and felt a pricking among the roots of her hair while she struggled with an impulse which prompted her to cry aloud or in any wild fashion to break the torturing suspense  jean graham whose eyes were wide with apprehension noted that her face was bloodless to the lips  neither had as yet been rudely confronted with tragedy and both felt held fast spellbound without the power to move  the lord have mercy on them said the hoarse voice of a man somewhere behind the girls  once more a murmur swelled into a roar and jean twining her brown fingers together cried there  theyre coming  they may be in time  a figure apparently bransomes leaped down from a boulder close in front of one that climbed over the stone and there followed harsh breathless cries of encouragement as the two headed at mad speed for the sheltering forest the rear runner who came up with hands clenched and long swinging strides gaining steadily on the one before him they were near enough for those who watched to see that the fear of sudden death was stamped upon their perspiring faces  then as they passed a spur of rock outcrop thurston leaped upon the leader hurled him forward so that he lost his balance and the pair went down out of sight among the rocks while a shaft of radiance pale in the sunlight blazed aloft beside the outlet of the lake  thick yellowtinted vapor followed it and hillside and forest rang to the shock of a stunning detonation  the smoke curling in filmy wreaths spread itself across the quaggy meadows while the patter of falling fragments filled the quivering bush and was mingled with a loud splashing or a heavy crash as some piece of greater weight drove hurtling through the trees or plunged into the lake  then for the last time the assembly gave voice raising a tumultuous cheer of relief as the two men came forth uninjured out of the eddying smoke  geoffrey shaking the dust from his garments turned to his companion with a somewhat nervous laugh  we cut it rather fine he said but i felt reasonably sure there would be just sufficient time and it might have spoiled the whole blast if the two bad fuses had failed to fire their shots  of course im grateful for your company but as it was my particular business i dont quite see why you turned back after me  bransome who mopped his forehead stared at the speaker with some wonder and more admiration before he answered  theres a good deal of cast iron about you and i guess id a long way sooner have trusted the rest than have gone back to stir up those two charges  what took mewell i figured you had turned suddenly crazy and i was in a way responsible for you  made the best bargain for your time i could but i didnt buy you up bones and bodysee  i think i do answered geoffrey and that was all but it meant the recognition of a bond between them  bransome as if glad to change the subject asked  say after you had fired the fuse what did you waste precious seconds looking for  if i wasnt too scared to notice anything clearly id swear you found something and picked it up  i did declared geoffrey smiling  it was something i must have dropped before  only a trifle but i would not like to lose it andi had one eye on the fusesthere seemed a second or two to spare however for some reason my throat feels all stuck together  have you any cider in your wagon  halfanhour later when most of the spectators stood watching the released waters thunder down the gorge for the blast had been successful helen savine said  i dont quite understand what happened mr bransome  it was this way answered the rancher glad to profit by any opportunity of interesting the girl  that thurston is a hard tough man  two fuses that were to fire small charges petered out and sooner than risk anything he must light them again  i dont quite understand all the rest of it either for hes not a mean man and why he should stay fooling on top of a powder mine looking for one dollar when ive a hatful to pay him is away beyond me  yet im sure he picked up a piece of silver just before we ran  curious kind of creature isnt he  helen thought the incident distinctly odd  she could not comprehend why a man should risk his life for the sake of a silver coin  she could not find a solution of the mystery until it was explained that evening  geoffrey thurston attired in white shirt black sash and new store clothes had tramped over to grahams ranch and by degrees he and miss savine gravitated away from the others  they were interested in subjects that did not appeal to the rest and though jean smiled mischievously at times this excited no comment  clear moonlight sparkled upon the untrodden snows above them snows that had remained stainless since the giant peaks were framed when the world was young  the pines were black on their lower slopes and white mists filled the valley out of which the song of the river rose in long reverberations  geoffrey and helen leaned on the veranda balustrade both silent for the solemnity of the mountains impressed them and speech seemed superfluous  after a while the girl told geoffrey that he ought to be glad to live after his narrow escape from death  there was really no great risk and if there had been the results would have justified it geoffrey replied  the failure of two charges might have spoiled all my work for me  since i left you the roads and trails surveyor voluntarily offered me a rock work contract he had refused before and i at once accepted it  you have not been used to this laborious life  have you no further ambition and do you like it asked helen flashing a quick glance at him  it is not exactly what i expected but as there appears to be no great demand in this country for mental abilities one is glad to earn a living as one can he said  i am afraid i am a somewhat ambitious person  i consider this only the beginning and miss savine responsible for it  you will remember who it was offered me my first contract  dont commanded helen averting her eyes  that is hardly fair or civil  you really looked soand how was i to know  geoffreys pulse beat faster and the smile faded out of his eyes as he noticed for the moon was high the trace of faintly heightened color in the speakers face  i doubtless looked the hungry wornout tramp i was he interposed gravely  and out of gentle compassion you offered me a dollar well i earned that dollar and i have it still  it has brought me good luck and i will keep it as a talisman  instinctively his fingers slid to one end of a thin gold chain and for a moment a look of consternation came into his face for the links hung loose then as the hard hand dropped to his pocket he looked relieved and helen found it judicious to watch a gray blur of shadow moving across the snow  she had sometimes wondered what he wore at one end of that crosspattern chain for rock cutters do not usually adorn themselves with such trinkets but remembering bransomes comments she now understood what had happened just before the explosion geoffreys quick eyes had noticed something unusual in her air and his old reckless spirit breaking through all restraint prompted him to say  it will i fancy still bring me good fortune  i come of a superstitious race and nothing would tempt me to part with it  this as i said is only the beginning  it appeared impossible to move the boulder from your wagon trail and i did it  the neighbors declared nobody could drain bransomes prairie and a number of goodly acres are drying now while tonight i feel it may be possible to go on and on until  does not that sound somewhat egotistical interposed helen  horribly said thurston with a curious smile  but you see i am trusting in the talisman and some day i may ask you to admit that i have made it good  im not avaricious and desire money only as means to an end  dollars  if all goes well the contract for the wagon road rock work should bring me in a good many of them  you are refreshingly certain averred helen  but will the end or dominant purpose justify all this  thurston answered quietly  i may ask you to judge that also some day  helen was conscious of a chagrin quite unusual to her  hitherto she had experienced little difficulty in making the men she knew regret anything that resembled presumption but with this man it was different  what he meant she would not at the moment ask herself but though she rather admired his quietly confident tone it nettled her and yet without begging an awkward question she could not resent it geoffreys reckless frankness was often more unassailable than wiser mens diplomacyand she was certainly pleased that he had recovered the dollar  the dew is getting heavy and i promised jean some instruction in netting she told him rather unsteadily  she paused a second and with an assumed carelessness added isnt it useless to forecast the future     chapter v  the legends of crosbie ghyll  helen savine had passed two years in england and because her father was a prosperous man who humored her slightest wishes she occasionally returned to take her pleasure in what she called the old country  it is a far cry from the snowy heights of the pacific slope to the pleasant valleys of the north country but in these days of quadrupleexpansion engines distance counts but little when one has sufficient money  the atlantic express had brought helen and her aunt by marriage mrs thomas p savine into montreal whence a fast train had conveyed them to new york in time to catch a big southampton liner but mrs savine was a restless lady and had grown tired of london within six weeks from the day she left vancouver  she was an american and took pains to impress the fact upon anybody who mistook her for a canadian and finding a party of her countrymen and women whom she had hoped to overtake in the metropolis had departed northwards she determined to follow them to the english lakes  its a big hot dusty wilderness tom and weve seen all theyve got to show us here before she said to her longsuffering husband as she stood in the vestibule of a fashionable hotel  say well pull out today and catch the schroeders party meditating around wordsworths tomb  young man will you kindly get us a railroad schedule  the silverbuttoned official who watched the big plateglass door started at a smart rap on his shoulder and blinked at the angular lady in a startling costume and a blue veil  thomas savine interposed meekly  a timetable and thats evidently not the man to ask my dear  then he can tell the right one mrs savine answered airily and presently halted before a row of resplendentlygilded books adorning one portion of the vestibule  she thereupon explained for the benefit of all listeners that it was hard to see the necessity for so many railways in so small a country and finally with a clerks assistance selected a train which would deposit her at oxenholme from which place the official suggested that she might find means of transport into the district in which to the best of his belief coleridge and wordsworth or one of them wrote what mrs savine entitled charming little pieces it proved good counsel and two of the party passed a delightful week at ambleside where their sojourn was marred only by mrs savines laments that potatoes were not served at supper and breakfast  i want some potatoes with my ham she said and when the attendant explained that the vegetables were never eaten in england at that meal she inquired dont you grow potatoes anywhere in this country  the attendant said that very fine ones were produced in the immediate vicinity and mrs savine waved a jeweled hand majestically  then away you go and buy some  ill sit right here until theyre boiled she said  it really isnt the custom and you know you never got them in london and hardly ate them at home said thomas savine but mrs savine remained superior to such reasoning  thats quite outside the question  i want those potatoes and im going to have them she insisted  there was a whispering at the end of the breakfast hall somebody whistled up a tube and the hotel manager appeared to announce with regrets that it was unfortunately impossible in the busy season to upset the culinary arrangements for the benefit of a single guest  then well start again and follow the schroeders trail to that place in cumberland mrs savine decided  tom you go out and buy one of those twenty five cent guidebooks which tell you all about everything hire some ponies and a man and well drive a straight line across the mountains  the manager respectfully suggested it would be better to take the train even though the railway went round because the mountains were lofty and the roads were indifferent in the region traversed  to this the lady answered with some truth that the highest peak in britain was a pigmy to the lowest of the selkirks and that she had spent two summers camping among the fastnesses of the snowclad olympians  your aunt is a smart woman but she cant help upsetting things said thomas savine when his niece went out with him to make arrangements for the trip  helen smiled pleasantly for she knew her aunts good qualities and also she was fond of adventurous wanderings  it was perfect weather and the three tourists enjoyed their journey among the less frequented fells during which they camped so thomas savine termed it each night in some highperched hostelry or troutfishers haunt  helen realized that never before had she fully appreciated the beauty of england  quite apart from its wonders of industrial enterprise tide of worldwide commerce and treasury of literature and art the old country was to be loved for its quiet green restfulness she thought  suddenly there came a change  a southwester drove thick rainclouds scudding across peak and valley and filled the passes with dank white mists from the irish sea and so towards the close of a threatening day mrs savines party came winding down in a hurry from a bare hill shoulder and under the gray crags of crosbie fell  the hollows beneath them were lost in a woolly vapor lowflying scud raked the bare ridges above and even as they passed a black rift in the hillside the first heavy drops of rain fell pattering  helen savine had seen many a mining adit in british columbia and turning to glance at the mouth of the tunnel she read scratched on the rock beside it thurstons folly  that careless glance over her shoulder was to lead to important results  theres wild weather brewing said thomas savine  make those ponies rustle and well get in somewhere before it comes along  when they reached the little windswept village it became evident that no shelter for the night could be found there for it was seldom that even an enterprising pedestrian tourist came down from the high moors behind crosbie fell  still one inhabitant informed their guide in a tongue none of the others could comprehend that if he was in an unusually good humor old musker the keeper might take them in at crosbie ghyll  thus it happened that just as the rain began in earnest such a cavalcade as had probably never before passed its gloomy portals rode up to the gate of the dilapidated edifice  some of the ironbound barriers still lay moldering in the hollow of the arch and helen noticed slits for muskets in the stout walls above for the owners had been a fighting race and several times in bygone centuries the tide of battle had rolled about and then had ebbed away from the stubbornlyheld stronghold  the observer had gathered so much from a paragraph in her guidebook  the romance of english history appealed to helen as it does to the citizens of the wider britain over seas and she turned in her saddle to look about her  framed by the weatherworn archway she could see the black rampart of the fells fading into the rain and the bare sweep of moss and moor which had once stretched unbroken to the feet of the great ranges above the solway shore  inside the quadrangle for the place had during the past century served as farm instead of hall barn cartshed and shippon were ruinous and empty but she could fill the space in fancy with sturdy archer manatarms and corsleted rider for that the present venerable edifice had been built into an older one the stump of a square tower remained to testify  thomas savine pounded on the oaken door at one end of the courtyard until it was opened by a bentshouldered man with frosted hair and wrinkled visage  we are unfortunate strangers with a guide who has lost his way and it would be a favor if you could take us in tonight out of the storm he said  the older man glanced at the party suspiciously  if you ride straight on across the moor youll find a road and a brand new hotel in twelve miles where youll get whatever you have been used to he said  i once took some london folks in and after the thanks they gave me i never will again  were not londoners only forlorn canadians explained thomas savine never mind matilda hell find out that youre an american in due time  we have all learned to rough it in our own country and would trouble you very little  what part of canada asked the forbidding figure in the doorway and when savine answered british columbia called margery  a little weazened woman with cheeks still ruddy from much lashing of the wind appeared in the portal  strangers from british columbia  perhaps they know the master said the man and there was a whispering until the woman vanished saying ill ask miss gracie  she returned promptly and with a reserved courtesy bade the party enter  then she sent her husband and the guide to stable the ponies and fifteen minutes later the travelers reassembled beside the deepseated window of a great stoneflagged room darkly wainscoted which apparently once had been the hall and was now kitchen  there were a spotless cloth and neat cutlery on the table by the window trout and bacon hacked from the sides hanging beneath the smokeblackened beams frizzled upon a peat fire and though she found neither wine nor potatoes mrs savine said that she had not enjoyed such a meal since she left vancouver  we cant give you a sittingroom to yourselves apologized the withered dame as the removed the cloth  what furniture there is above is covered up and it will be ill finding you sleeping quarters even nobody lives here beside ourselves except when mr forsyth comes down for a few weeks shooting  his wife was a thurston and he bought the old place to please her sooner than let it go out of the family  a thurston said helen savine  we saw thurstons folly written beside a mining tunnel on the fell  was that one of the former owners being colonials we are interested in all ancient buildings and their traditions  oh yes broke in mrs savine  we just love to hear about wicked barons and witches and all those quaint folk of the olden time  musker had drawn nearer meanwhile and thomas savine held out the cigar case that lay upon his knee  if we may smoke in the great hearth there just help yourself said he  my wife is fond of antiquities and if you have any to talk of we should be glad of your company  musker glanced keenly at his guests  though having lived elsewhere he spoke easy colloquial english he was a son of the north country dogged and slow intensely selfrespecting and while loyal with feudal fealty to superiors he knew quick to resent a strangers assumption of authority  thomas savine brownfaced vigorous a pleasant colonial gentleman smiled upon him goodnaturedly and musker took a cigar awkwardly  mrs savine surveyed the great bare hall with respectful curiosity and evident interest while helen visibly interested leaned back in her chair  maybe you met the master in british columbia musker hazarded with an eager look in his dim eyes  what is his full name and what is he like asked helen bending forward a little  the old woman reaching over lifted a faded photograph from the window seat  geoffrey thurston she answered  that was him when he was young my husband yonder broke the pony in  helen started as she gazed at the picture of the boy and the pony  the face was like and yet unlike that of the gaunt and hungry man whom she had first seen sitting upon the fallen fir  yes she answered gravely i know him  i met mr thurston in british columbia  we would take it very kindly if you would tell us how and where you found him miss said musker in haste  i found him in a great canadian forest  he was looking very worn and tired helen answered with a trace of color in her face  ii hired him to do some work for me and it was hard workmuch harder than i fanciedbut he did it and as we afterwards discovered spent all i paid him on the powder he found was necessary  ay said the old man  that was mr geoffrey  they were all hard and ill to beat the thurstons of crosbie  and youll kindly tell us miss you saw him again  yes repeated helen i saw him again  by good fortune the work he did for me procured him a contract he carried out daringly and when i last saw him he was no longer hungry or ragged but i fancy on the way to win success as an engineer  musker straightened his bent shoulders and smiled a slow almost reluctant smile of pride while his wifes eyes were grateful as she fixed them on the speaker  ay  what mr geoffrey sets his heart on hell win or ruin himself over  it was the way of all of them and this is gradely news he told her  now said helen nodding towards him graciously we dont wish to be unduly inquisitive butif you may tell uswhy did mr thurston emigrate to canada  musker was evidently tempted to embark upon a favorite topic and his wife went out hurriedly  but he hesitated sitting silent for a minute or two  savine rising under the arch of the great hearth flung his cigar into the fire as a young woman wearing what helen noticed was a decidedly antiquated riding habit came forward out of the shadows  i hope we are not intruding here said the canadian  we were tired out before the rain came down and almost afraid to cross the moor  you are very welcome said the stranger  i am not however mistress only a relative of the old places owner and therefore a kinswoman of geoffrey thurston  i heard that you had shown him a passing kindness and should like to thank you  there was no apparent reason why the two young women should scrutinize each other and yet both did so by the fading daylight and red blaze of the fire  helen saw that the stranger was ruddy and blondefrank by nature and impulsive she imagined  the stranger noted only that the colonial was pale and dark and comely with a slightly imperious presence and a face that it was not easy to read  i am marian thwaite of barrow hall and regret i cannot stay any longer having three miles to ride in the rain she said  still i may return tomorrow before you set out  mrs forsyth will be pleased if she hears you have made these canadian strangers comfortable musker and i think you may tell them why mr geoffrey left england may i ask your names  helen told her and after miss thwaite departed musker began the story of thurstons folly  it had grown quite dark  driving rain lashed the windows  the ancient building was filled with strange rumblings and the wailing of the blast when the old man concluded mr geoffrey was too proud to turn a swindler and that was why he shook off his sweetheart who tried to persuade him though he knew old anthony thurston would have left him his money if they married  some said it was the opposite interposed his wife but musker answered angrily then they didnt tell it right  no woman born could twist geoffrey thurston from his path and when she gave him bad counsel he turned his back on her  a fool these dolts called him  he was a leal hard man and what was a light womans greediness to him  and what became of the lady asked helen with a curious flash in her eyes  she married a london man who came here shooting married him out of spite and has rued it many times if the tales are true  she was down with him fishing looking sour and pale and the hall maids were say  just gossip and lies broke in his spouse and helen who apparently had lapsed into a disdainful indifference asked no further questions mrs savine however made many inquiries and musker who became unusually communicative presently offered to show the strangers what he called the armory  they followed him down a draughty corridor to the blackwainscoted gunroom at the base of the crumbling tower and when he had lighted a lamp its glow revealed a modern collection of costly guns  there were also troutrods hung upon the wall and a few good sporting etchings at all of which musker glanced somewhat contemptuously  these are mr forsyths and i take care of them but he only belongs to the place by purchase and marriage  those belonged to the thurstonsthe old dead thurstonsand they hunted men he said  he ran the lamp up higher by a tarnished brass chain and pointed first to a big moldering bow  a thurston drew that in france long ago and it has splitted many an annandale cattle thief in the solway mosses since  red geoffrey carried this long spear and so the story goes won his wife with it and brought her home on the crupper from beside the nith  she pined away and died just above where we stand now in this very tower  that was another geoffreys sword they hanged him high outside lancaster jail  he was for prince charlie and cut down singlehanded two of king georges dragoons carrying a warrant for a friends arrest when the princes cause was lost  his wife she poisoned herself  those are the spurs mad harry rode hellfire on a wager down crosbie ghyll with and broke his neck doing it besides his young wifes heart  the women who married the thurstons had an ill lot to grapple with  even when they settled down to farming the thurstons were men who would walk unflinchingly into ruin sooner than lose their grip on their purpose and mr geoffrey favors them  they must have been just lovely sighed mrs savine  say ive taken a fancy to some of those old things  that rusty iron lamp cant be much use to anybody but its quaint and id give its weight in dollars for it  cant you tell me where mr forsyth lives  musker stared at her horrified thomas savine laughed and even helen who had appeared unusually thoughtful smiled  musker answered  no money could buy one of them out of the family and if any but a thurston moves that lamp from where it hangs the dead men rise and come for it when midnight strikes  it is falling to pieces but once when they took it to kendal to be mended the smith sent a man back with it on horseback before the day had broken  there was a few moments silence when musker concluded and the ancient weapons glinted strangely as the lamps flame wavered in the chilling draughts  a gale from the irish sea boomed about the crumbling tower and all the lonely mosses seemed to swell it with their moaning  helen shivered as she listened for those clamorous voices of wind and rain carried her back in fancy to the old unhappy days of bloodshed and foray  the associations of the place oppressed her  she had acquired a horror of those grim dead men whose mementos hung above her and whose spirits might well wander on such a night vainly seeking rest even mrs savine became subdued and her husband said  we cant tell tales like these in our country and im thankful we cant  still i daresay it was such men as these who bred in us the grit to chase the whales in the arctic build our railroads through the snowbarred passes and master the primeval forest  now well try to forget them and go back out of this creepy place to the fire again  an hour later mrs musker escorted helen to her quarters  a bright fire glowed in the rusty grate and two candles burned on the dressingtable  its mrs forsyths own room and the best in the house the old caretaker assured the girl  musker has been telling you about the old thurstons  hes main proud of them but you neednt fear themits long since the last one walked  you have a kind heart and nothing evil dare hurt you  see  ive tried to make you comfortable  you were kind to the old places real mastermany a time ive nursed himgod bless you  helen was not in the least afraid of the dead thurstons  she was filled with the commonsense courage which characterizes the inhabitants of her new country but she had been affected by the stories and she sat for a time with her feet on the hearth irons gazing thoughtfully into the blaze  she had met a modern thurston and found the instincts of his forbears strong within him  she considered that strength courage and resolution well became a man but that gentleness and chivalrous respect for women were desirable attributes too  the thurstons however had taken to bloodshed as a pastime and broken most of their wives hearts until it seemed that they had brought a curse upon their race  she suspected there was a measure of their brutality in the one she knew  remembering something geoffrey once had said her face grew flushed and she clenched a little hand with an angry gesture saying no man shall ever make a slave of me and my husband if i have one must be my servant before he is my master  thereupon she dismissed the subject tried to blot the stories from her memory and presently buried her ears in the pillow to shut out the clamor of the storm  after a sound nights slumber and an interview with miss thwaite she resumed her journey next morning  musker stood in the gate to watch the party ride away and glancing at the coins in his hand said to margery i wish theyd come often  main interested in my stories they were all of them and its double what any of the shooting folks ever gave me  this one came from the young lady and theres a way about her that puzzles me after seeing her     chapter vi  millicents reward  the late autumn evening was closing in  millicent leslie stood out on the terrace of the old north country hall where the year before she had first met her husband  a pale moon had climbed above the high black ridge of moor which shut in one end of the valley and the big beech wood that rolled down the lower hillside had faded to a shadowy blur but she could still see the dim white road running straight between the hedgerows and could catch the faint gleam of a winding river  twilight and night were meeting and melting into each other the dew lay heavy upon the last of the dahlias beneath the terrace wall and there was a chill of frost in the air  it was very still though now and then the harsh call of a pheasant came up faintly through the murmur of the river from the depths of the wood  millicent could hear no other sound though she strained her ears to listen and it seemed to her that the rattle of wheels should carry far down the silent valley  she was waiting somewhat anxiously for the return of her husband who had set off that morning with three or four other men to walk certain distant stubble and turnip fields for partridges  they had passed a week at the hall for although millicent would have preferred to avoid that particular place leslie had said he did not know of any other place where one could obtain rough shooting as well as a more or less congenial company in return for what was little more than a firstclass hotel bill  he had also added that he needed a holiday in which millicent had agreed with him  there was no doubt that he had looked jaded and harassed  millicent knew little about her husbands business except that it was connected with stocks and shares and the flotation of companies but she was quite aware that he had met with a serious reverse soon after he married her since it had been necessary for them to give up their town house and install themselves temporarily in a london flat  leslie had informed her that reverses were not uncommon in his profession and he had appeared quite convinced of his ability to recover his losses in a new venture which had something to do with south african gold or diamonds  of late however he had grown dejected and moody  on the previous evening she had seen his face set hard as he read a letter which bore the london postmark  he had not given her any information about the contents of the letter for there had been no great measure of confidence between them but there were one or two telegrams for him among those a groom had brought over from the nearest station during the day and she felt a little uneasy as she thought of them  by and by with a little shiver and a suppressed sigh she glanced up at the highest part of the climbing wood  it was there she had had her last memorable interview with geoffrey almost a year ago  though she had not cared to face the fact she was troubled by a suspicion that she had made an unwise choice then  leslie had changed since their marriage  he was harsh at times and though he had even in their more humble quarters surrounded her with a certain amount of luxury there was a laxity in his manners and conversation that jarred upon her geoffrey she remembered had not been addicted to mincing words but at least he had lived in accordance with a spartan moral code millicent was not a scrupulous woman and her ideas of ethical justice were rudimentary but she possessed in place of a conscience a delicate sense of refinement which her husband frequently offended  feeling chilly at length and seeing no sign of the shooters return millicent went back into the house  she stopped when she reached the square entrance hall which served the purpose of a loungingroom  the hall had been rudely ceiled and paneled at a time when skilled craftsmen were scarce in the north country and in the daylight it was more or less dim and forbidding but with the lamps lighted and a fire blazing in the wide oldfashioned hearth the place looked invitingly comfortable  when she entered millicent was not altogether pleased to see another woman there  marian thwaite whom she knew but had not expected to meet lay in a big chair near the fire  the glow of health which the keen air of the moors had brought there was in her face  she wore heavy boots and severely simple walking attire  her features suggested a decided character and she had unwavering blue eyes  mrs boone wont be down for some minutes and i believe the rest are dressing marian said  i havent seen you since your marriage and to tell the truth youre not looking by any means as fresh as you did before you left us  i suppose its one effect of living in london  she studied millicent with a steady contemplative gaze and there was no doubt that her comment was justified  millicents face was pallid there was a certain weariness in her eyes and on the whole her expression was languidly querulous  i didnt know you were coming tonight said millicent as she sank into a chair  i didnt know it myself marian explained  i was out on the fells and i met boone as i came down this way  he said somebody would drive me home if id stay  you have been here a week havent you  how is it you havent come over to see us yet  as a matter of fact i didnt intend to call and it was rather against my wishes that we came up here said millicent with the candor of an old acquaintance  you were not very cordial when i last saw you and i cant help a feeling that you are all of you prejudiced against me  quite unembarrassed marian looked at her with a reflective air  yes she admitted to some extent thats true  were closely connected with the thurstons and ive no doubt we make rather intolerant partisans  after all its only natural that we sympathize with geoffrey  besidesyou can make what you like of ithe was always a favorite of mine  i suppose you havent heard from him since he went to canada  would you have expected him to write  marian smiled  perhaps it would have been unreasonable but taking it for granted that he hasnt been communicative ive a piece of news for you  some canadian tourists stayed a night at the ghyll two or three months ago and it seems they met him in british columbia  i understand he is by no means prosperous but at least getting a footing in the country and the people apparently have rather a high opinion of him  did i mention that one of the party was a girl  she saw the quickened interest in millicents eyes  with assumed indifference in her voice millicent asked what kind of people were they  the girl was handsomewellfinished too  in fact she struck me as rather an imperious young person of some consequence in the place she came from  she would pass in any circle that you or i are likely to get an entry to  i dont know whether its significant but i understand from margery that she took some interest in muskers stories of the thurstons  there was nothing to show whether millicent was pleased with this or not  she did not speak for a moment or two  did they mention what geoffrey had been doing she inquired presently  chopping down trees for sawmills or something of the kind  the man said geoffrey had evidently been what they call up against it until lately when he seems to have got upon his feet  it will probably convince you that you were perfectly right in not marrying him  this time millicent laughed  it wouldnt have counted for much with you  marian looked at her with unwavering eyes  no she replied if id had any particular tenderness for geoffrey it certainly wouldnt have had the least effect beyond making me more sorry for him but as it happens he never did anything to encourage vain ideas of the kind in me  she changed the subject with the abruptness which usually characterized her  i suppose you havent seen old anthony thurston since you married leslie  he at least is openly bitter against you  i havent  in a way i suppose he is right  of course he would take the stereotyped view that it was all my faultthat is to say that i had discarded geoffrey  i believe he did but it struck me once or twice that geoffrey proclaimed that view a little too loudly  of course with his rather primitive notions of delicacy and what is due to us its very much what one would have anticipated in his case  he naturally wouldnt want to leave room for any suspicion that hewasnt altogether satisfied with you  millicents face clouded  that is a point which concerns nobody except geoffrey and myself she declared  and anthony thurston marian broke in  of course its an open secret that if you had married geoffrey you would both have benefited by his will  as things have turned out my own opinion is that the question whether either of you ever gets a penny of the property depends a great deal on the view he continues to take of the matter any way thats not the least concern of mine except that im sorry for geoffrey  i wonder if im going too far in asking what it was you and he actually split upon  im referring to the immediate cause of the trouble  i can tell you that millicent answered quickly for she was glad to remove the ground for one suspicion which was evidently in marians mind  geoffrey insisted on giving up the mine when he could have sold it and going out to australia or canada  i wouldnt go with him  i think nobody could have reasonably expected me to  marian smiled  well she said i wonder if you know that your husband was one of the men who were willing to take the mine over there are reasons for believing it was what brought him here in the first place  millicents start betrayed the fact that this was news to her but just then there was a rattle of wheels outside and marian rose  a murmur of voices and laughter grew clearer when the outer door was opened and the two could hear the returning shooters talking with their host who had gone out another way to meet them  the birds were scarce and very wild announced one of them  we had only two or three brace all morning though we were a little more fortunate when we got up onto the higher land  its my candid opinion that we should have done better there but leslie had all the luck in the turnips and he made a shocking bad use of it  thats a fact assented leslie with what struck millicent as a rather strained laugh  i was right off the mark  there are some days when you simply cant shoot  several of the women guests now entered the hall but the men did not come in  judging from the sounds outside they seemed to be waiting while coats or cartridge bags were handed down to them from the dogcart and they were evidently bantering one another in the meanwhile  it depends upon how long you sit up in the smokingroom on the previous night said one of them and another observed  if you happen to be in business the state of the markets has its effect  millicent started again at this for she remembered her husbands expression when he had read his letter on the preceding evening  a third speaker took up the conversation  i dont think any variation in the price of colonials or kaffirs or of wheat and cotton for that matter should prevent a man from telling the difference between a hare and a dog  ive a suspicion that if tom cares to look hell find one or two number six pellets in the hindquarters of the setter  its a good thing our friend wasnt quite up to his usual form that time  a burst of laughter followed and leslies voice broke through it rather sharply as he replied he should have kept the brute in hand the difference isnt a big one when you can only see a livercolored patch through a clump of bracken  besides there was a hare  undoubtedly cried somebody  lawson got it  then they came in one after another and while some of them spoke to their hostess and the other women leslie walked up to the little table where several letters were spread out  millicent watched him as he did it and there was no doubt that the very way he moved was suggestive of restrained eagerness  she saw him tear open a telegram and crumple it in his hand after which he seized a second one and ripped it across the fold in his clumsy haste  then as he put the pieces together his face grew suddenly pale and haggard  nobody else however appeared to notice him and he leaned with one hand upon the table for a moment or two with his head turned away from her  she felt her heart beat painfully fast for it was clear that a disaster of some kind had befallen him though a large part of her anxiety sprang from the question how far the fact was likely to affect herself  he moved away from the table and went towards the stairway at the further end of the hall and she followed him a few minutes later  he was sitting by an open window when she reached their room  a candle flickered beside him and a little bundle of papers was clenched in one hand  what is it harry she asked  he looked up at her and his voice sounded hoarse  ill try to tell you later he answered  theres a dinner to be got through and it will be a big enough effort to sit it out  slip away as soon as you can afterward without attracting attention  youll find me on the terrace  he dismissed her with a wave of his hand and she turned towards the little dressingroom  when she came out again he had gone leaving his outdoor clothing scattered on the floor  the dinner that followed was an ordeal to millicent but she took her part in the conversation and glanced towards her husband only now and then  he did not eat a great deal and though he spoke when it seemed necessary she noticed the trace of unsteadiness in his voice  at last however the meal which seemed to drag on interminably was finished and as soon as possible she slipped out upon the terrace where she found leslie leaning against a seat  the moon which had risen higher was brighter now and she could see his face  it showed set and somber in the pale silvery light  well she said impatiently  cant you speak  ill try he answered  winkleheim reef explorations went down to four and six pence today and as theres 5 shillings a share not paid up its very probable that one wouldnt be able to give the stock away before the market closes tomorrow  ah replied millicent sharply didnt you tell me that they were worth sixteen shillings not very long ago  why didnt you sell them then  because as it seems to me now my greediness was greater than my judgment  i wanted twenty shillings and i thought i saw how i could get it  he paused with a little jarring laugh  as a matter of factstrange as it may seemi believed in the thing  that is why i let them send out their independent expert and held on when the stock began to drop  at the worst id good reasons for believing walmer would let me see the cipher report in time to sell  as it happened he and the other traitor sold their own stock instead and that must have started the panic  now theyve got their report  theres no ore that will pay for milling in the reef  it was not all clear to millicent but she understood from his manner that her husband was ruined  then what are we to do she asked  is there nobody who will give you a start again  you must be known in the business  that is the precise trouble  im too well known  so long as a man is a winner at this particular game and can make it worth while for interested folks to applaud him or at least to keep their mouths shut he can find a field for his talents when he wants it but once he makes a false move or comes down with a bang they get their claws in him and keep him from getting up again  nobody has any sympathy with a broken company exploiter especially when he has for once been crazy enough to believe in his own venture  leslie found it a small relief to run on with ironical bitterness but millicent who was severely practical in some respects checked him  you havent answered my other question  then i wont keep you waiting  in a few weeks well go out to the pacific slope of north america  i may save enough from the wreck to start me in the landagency business somewhere in british columbia  millicent turned from him and gazed down the moonlit valley troubled as she was its rugged beauty and its stillness appealed to her and she knew it would be a wrench to leave the land which had hitherto safely sheltered her  she had known only the smoother side of life in it and nobody could appreciate the ease and luxury it could offer some of its inhabitants better than she did  now it seemed she must leave it and go out to struggle for a mere living in some unlovely town in what she supposed must be a wild and semibarbarous country  she felt bitter against the man who as she thought of it had dragged her down but she hid her resentment  but you know nothing about the landagency business she pointed out  leslie laughed ironically  i have a few ideas  milliganwe had him over at dinner oncemade a good deal of money that way and from what he told me it doesnt seem very different from the business i have been engaged in  success evidently depends upon ones ability to sell the confiding investor what he thinks hed like to get  somehow i fancy that with moderately good luck two or three years of it should set us on our feet  but those two or three years  its unthinkable millicent broke out  im afraid you will have to face them said leslie dryly  he turned and looked hard at her  you cant reasonably rue your bargain  you knew when i married you that while i had the command of money my business was a risky one  again millicent stood silent a moment or two  she recognized that it was largely because leslie enjoyed that command of money that she had discarded geoffrey  now his riches had apparently taken wings and vanished but the man was bound to her still  one could fancy that there was something like retribution in the thing  its rather dreadful but i suppose i shall not make it any better by complaining she remarked after a long silence  her husbands manner became embarrassed  i understand that anthony thurston is well off and you were a favorite of his he said  would it be of any use if you explained the trouble to him  no was the answer it would be perfectly useless and for other reasons that course is impossible  he meant me to marry geoffrey and ive mortally offended him  hes a hard determined man  leslie made a sign of assent though there was a suggestion of grim amusement in his manner  i suppose you couldnt very well explain that it was geoffrey who threw you over  that would no doubt be too much to expect of you and after all when you get to the bottom of the matter it wouldnt be true  in reality you finished with geoffrey when he decided to emigrate instead of selling the mine didnt you  millicent flashed a swift glance at him but he met it halfmockingly and she turned her head away  why should you make yourself intolerable she returned  im sorry for youthat is i want to be if you will let me  leslie shrugged his shoulders as he lit a cigar  well he said it cant be helped  we must face the thing  and now i dont want to set the others wondering why we have slipped away we had better go in again  they walked back info the house  leslie with one or two of the other men sat up late in the smokingroom  leslie told a number of stories with force and point and when at length two of his companions went up the stairway together one of them looked at the other with a lifting of the eyebrows  after what leslie has got through tonight ill take the farthest place in the line from him tomorrow he said  if his nerves arent unusually good it seems quite possible that therell be more than a setter peppered     chapter vii  the breaking of the jam  it was late one moonlight night when geoffrey thurston sat inside his doubleskinned tent which was pitched above a river of british columbia  a few good furs checkered the spruce twigs which served as a carpet and the canvas dwelling was both commodious and comfortable  a bright brass lamp hung from the ridge pole a nickeled clock ticked cheerily upon a hanging shelf behind the neat camp cot while the rest of the wellmade furniture betokened a degree of prosperity  one of savines junior assistants sent up there in an emergency to replace an older man sat close by and because he dwelt in a bark shanty envied thurston his tent  geoffrey was studying a bridgework tracing that lay unrolled upon his knees  i can only repeat what i said months ago  the wing slide of the log pass is too short and the angle over sharp he said glancing at the jam  an extra big log will jam there some day and imperil the whole bridge  did you send a man down to keep watch tonight  the slide is in accordance with the roads and trails specification answered the young man airily  there was no reason why we should do more work than they asked for  youre an uneasy man thurston always looking for trouble and ive had enough of late over the rascally hoboes who when they feel inclined condescend to work for me  oh yes  i posted the lookout as soon as i heard davies was running his saw logs down  thurston hitched his chair forward and threw the doorflap back so that he could look out into the night  the tent stood perched on the hillside  long ranks of climbing pines stretched upwards from it to the scarped rocks which held up the snowfields on the shoulders of the mighty peaks above  thin white mist and the roar of water rose up from the shadowy gorge below but in one place where the rock walls which hemmed it in sloped down a gossamerlike structure spanned the chasm this was a wagonroad bridge julius savine the contractor of large interests and wellknown name was building for the provincial authorities and on their surveyors recommendation he had sublet to thurston the construction of a pass through which sawlogs and driftwood might slide without jamming between the piers  savine being pressed for time had brought in a motley collection of workmen picked up haphazard in the seaboard cities  after bargaining to work for certain wages these workmen had demanded twenty per cent more thurston who had picked his own assistants carefully among the sturdy ranchers and had aided savines representative in resisting this demand now surmised that the malcontents were meditating mischief there were some mighty mean rascals among them his foreman said  youre looking worried again observed his companion presently and thurston answered perhaps i am  i wish davies would run his logs down by daylight but presumably the stream is too fast for him when the waters rise  it might give some of your friends yonder an opportunity summers  you dont figure theyre capable of wrecking the bridge replied summers showing sudden uneasiness  one or two among them including the man i had to thrash are capable of anything  perhaps you had better hail your watchman thurston said  summers blew a whistle and an answer came back faintly through the fret of the river plenty saw logs coming down  all of them handy sizes and sliding safely through  thats good enough declared summers  im not made of castiron and need a little sleep at times so goodnight to you  he departed with the cheerful confidence of the salaried man and thurston who fought for his own interests flung himself down on his trestle cot with all his clothes on  neither the timber slide nor the bridge was quite finished but because rivers in that region shrink at night when the frost checks the drainage from the feeding glaciers on the peaks above the sawmiller had insisted on driving down his logs when there was less chance of their stranding on the shoals that cumbered the highwater channel  thurston lay awake for some time listening to the fret of the river which vibrated far across the silence of the hills and to the occasional crash of a mighty log smiting the slide  hardly had his eyelids closed when he was aroused by a sound of hurried footsteps approaching the tent  he stood wide awake in the entrance before the newcomer reached it  theres a mighty big pine caught its butt on one slide and jammed its thin end across the pier said the man  logs piling up behind it already  as he spoke somebody beat upon a suspended iron sheet down in the valley and drowsy voices rose up from among the clustered tents summers went by shouting get a move on before we lose the bridge  five minutes later thurston running across a bending plank halted on the rock which served as foundation for the main bridge pier  beside him summers shouted confused orders to a group of struggling men  the moonlight beat down mistily through the haze that rose from the river and geoffrey could see the long wedgeheaded timber framing that he had built beside the wing on the shoreside so that any trunk floating down would cannon off at an angle and shoot safely between the piers but one huge fir had proved too long for the pass and when its butt canted the other end had driven athwart the point of the wedge after which because the river was black with drifting logs other heavy trunks drove against it and jammed it fast  panting men were hard at work with levers and pikepoles striving to wrench the massive trunk clear and one lighted an airblast flare whose red glare flickered athwart the strip of water foaming between the piers  it showed that some of the logs forced up by the pressure were sliding out above the others while amid a horrible grinding some sank  one side of the river was blocked by a mass of timber that was increasing every moment thurston feared that the unfinished piers could not long withstand the pressure and he remembered that his own work would be paid for only on completion  nevertheless he passed several minutes in a critical survey and then glanced towards certain groups of dark figures watching for the approaching ruin  shell go down inside an hourthat is certain and savine will lose thousands of dollars said summers whose eyes were wide with apprehension  im rattled completely  cant you think of anything that might be done  yes answered thurston coolly  it is however almost too late now  it could have been done readily if the man who should have seen to it had not turned traitor  hello  wheres mattawa tom  a big sinewy axman from the forests of northern ontario sprang up beside him and thurston said  im going to try to chop through the king log thats keying them its rather more than you bargained for but will you stand by me tom  looks mighty like suicide was the dry answer  but if youre ready to chance it im coming right along  the workmen had divided into two hostile camps but there was a growl of admiring wonder from friends and foes alike when two figures balancing bright axes stood high up on the pier slides ready to leap down upon the working logs  then disjointed cries went up too late youll be smashed flatter than a flapjack when the jam breaks up get hold of the fools somebody take their axes away  ill brain the first man who touches mine threatened thurston turning savagely upon those who approached him with remonstrances and there was a simultaneous murmur from all the assembly when the two adventurous men dropped upon the timber  the logs rolled groaned and heaved beneath them and thurston trusting to the creeper spikes upon his heels sprang from one great tree trunk to another behind his companion who had a longer experience of the perilous work of logdriving  here a gap filled with spouting foam opened up before him there a trunk upon which he was about to step rolled over and sank  but he worked his way forward towards the center of the fir which keyed the growing mass  this log was many feet in girth pressed down level with the water it was already bending like a slacklystrung bow  the example proved inspiring  thurstons assistants were sturdy fearless men who often risked their lives in wresting a living from the forest so several among them prepared to follow  two seamen deserters sprang out from the ranks of the mutineers  one stalwart forest rancher however tripped his comrade up and sat upon his prostrate form shouting youll stop just where you are you blame idiot  you couldnt do nothing if you got there  hardly room for them two fellows already where they can get at the log  the remaining volunteers saw the force of this argument and when somebody increased the blast of the lamp so that the roaring column of flame leapt up higher the men stood very still staring at the two who had now gained the center of the partly submerged log  it requires considerable practice to acquire full mastery of the longhafted ax but thurston who was stout of arm and keen of eye had managed to earn his bread with it one winter in an ontario logging camp  when he swung aloft the heavy wedge of steel it reflected the blast lamps radiance making red flashes as it circled round his head it came down hissing close past his knee  mattawa toms blade crossed it when it rose and the first white chip leapt up  more chips followed in quick succession until they whirled in one continuous shower and the razoredged steel losing definite form became a confused circling brightness in the center of which two supple figures swayed and heaved  the red light smiting the faces of the two showed great drops of sweat the swell of toilhardened muscles on the corded arms and the rise of each straining chest  there was not a clash nor a falter but flash after flash the blades came down chunking into the everwidening notch  summers had seen sword play in montreal armories and had heard the ax clang often on the side of western firs butfor thurston was fighting to stave off ruinthis grim struggle in the face of a desperate risk surpassed any remembered exhibition of fencers skill with the steel  the trunk was bending visibly beneath the hewers the river frothed more at their feet and the giant logs were rolling creeping shocking close behind ready to plunge forward when the partly severed trunk should yield  thurston felt as if his lungs were bursting his heart throbbed painfully and something drummed deafeningly inside his head  his vision grew hazy and he could scarcely see the widening gap in the rough bark into which the trenchant steel cut  it was evident that the steadily increasing jam would rub the bridge piers out of existence long before any two men could hew half way through the great trunk but fortunately the log was now bending like a fullydrawn bow and the pressure would burst it asunder when a little more of its circumference had been chopped into  so choking and blinded with perspiration geoffrey smote on mechanically until the man from mattawa said shes about busted  just then there was a clamor from the watchers on the piers  men shouted come back whole jams starting king logs yielding now jump for your lives before the wreckage breaks away with you  mattawa tom leapt shorewards from moving log to log but for a few moments thurston who scarcely noticed his absence chopped on alone filled with the lust of conflict he remembered only that it was necessary to make sure of victory before he relaxed an effort  thrice more in succession he whirled the heavy ax above his head while with a sharp snapping of fibers the fir trunk yielded beneath his feet flinging his ax into the river he stood erect breathless a moment too late  the logs behind the one which perilously supported him were creeping forward ready for the mad rush that must follow a few seconds later  there remained now but one poor chance of escape and he seized it instinctively  springing along the sinking trunk he threw himself clear of it into the river while running men jostled each other as they surged toward the side of the timber when he sank  a wet head broke the surface a swinging left hand followed it  the swimmer clutched the edge of a looselyfitted beam and held it until strong hands reached down to him  some gripped his wet fingers some the back of his coat one even clutched his hair  there was a heave then a scramble and amid hoarse cheers the rescued man fell over backwards among his rescuers  thurston who stood up dripping said somewhat shakily ah you were only just in time  im vastly grateful to you all  the last words were lost in a deafening crash as the jam broke up and the giant logs drove through the opening thrashing the river into foam  the treetrunks ground against one another or smote the slide casing with a thunderous shock but the stonebacked timber stood the strain and when the clamor of the passage of the logs ceased a heavy stillness brooded over the camp as the river grew empty again  thurston sought out the man from mattawa  laying a wet hand upon his shoulder he said thank you tom  i wont forget the assistance you rendered me  thats all right answered the brawny axman awkwardly  i get my wages safe and regular and ive tackled as tough a contract for a worse master before  there was no chance for further speech  davies who owned the sawmill lower down stream reined in a lathered horse close by  where have all my logs gone to he asked  my foreman roused me to say only a few dozen had brought up in the boom and as the boys were running them down by scores i figured theyd piled up against your bridge  i dont see any special chaos about here though you look as if you had been in swimming but what in the name of thunder have you done with the logs  theyre on their way down river thurston replied dryly  we had some trouble with them which necessitated my taking a bath  but see here what made you turn a twohundredfoot red fir loose among them  i didnt answered davies with a puzzled air  the boys saw every log into standard lengths  we have no use for a twohundredfooter and couldnt get her into the mill  are you sure it wasnt a windblown log  i saw the butt had been freshly crosscut declared thurston with an ominous glitter in his eyes  i understand you are pretty slack just now  as a favor would you hire your chopping gang to me for a few days  ill tell you why i want them later  ill decide in a few minutes he added when davies had told him what the cost would be  turning towards summers he said there may be several more big red firs growing handy beside the river and i mean to prevent any more accidents of this kind in future  if your employer will not reimburse me i will bear the cost myself  i would sooner spend my last dollar than allow any of these loafers to coerce me  the workmen stood still all of them curious and a few uneasy raising one hand to demand attention thurston said a red fir was felled by two or three among you today and launched down stream after darkness fell  i want the men who did it to step forward and explain their reasons to me  youre a mighty bold man remarked summerswho knew that although few were actually dangerous the malcontents outnumbered thurstons loyal assistants  among the listeners nobody moved but there was a murmuring and all eyes were fixed upon the speaker who either by design or accident leaned upon the haft of a big ax  i hardly expected an answer he went on  accordingly ill proceed to name the men who i believe must know about this contemptible action and notify them that they will be paid off tomorrow  a tumult of mingled wrath and applause started when thurston coolly called aloud a dozen names  one voice broke through the others were working for julius savine an dont count a bad twobits on you it declared defiantly  well all fling our tools into the river before we let one of them fellows go  in that case the value of the tools will be deducted from the wages due you thurston announced calmly  after this notice julius savines representative wont pay any of the men i mention whether they work or not and nobody who does not earn it will get a single meal out of the cook shanty  ill give you until tomorrow to make up your minds concerning what you will do  aside to davies he said ill take your lumber gang in any case  go back and send them in as soon as you can  the assembly broke up in a divided state of mind  although it was very late little groups lingered outside the tents and at intervals angry voices were heard  summers set out for the railroad to communicate by telegraph with his employer and thurston retired to his tent where he went peacefully to sleep  awakening later than usual he listened with apparent unconcern to mattawa tom who aroused him with the warning  its time you were out  them fellows are coming along for their money  the boys called up a big roll as soon as the lumber gang marched in and though there was considerable wild talking the sensible ones allowed it was no more use kicking  thats all right averred thurston who paid the departing malcontents and was glad to get rid of them knowing that the lumbermen who were mostly poor settlers had small sympathy with the mutineers and that he would have at least a balance of power  he set the men to work immediately lengthening the wing of the log slide and the wedge guards of the piers  he himself toiled as hard as any two among them and to the astonishment of all completed the big task before the week was past  i hardly like to say what it has cost me but no log of any length could jam itself in the new pass he said to summers  youre an enterprising man was the answer  savine is a bit of a rustler too and youll have a chance of explaining things to him tomorrow  i have had word from him that hes coming through     chapter viii  a rest by the way  it was afternoon when julius savine accompanied by summers had entered thurstons tent  on the way from the railroad summers had explained to the contractor all that had happened  geoffrey rose to greet savine glancing at his employer with some curiosity for he had not met him before  savine was a man of quick restless movements and nervous disposition  the gray that tinged his long mustache lightly sprinkled his hair gave evidence of his fifty years of intense living he was known to be not only a daring engineer but a generally successful speculator in mining and industrial enterprises nevertheless geoffrey fancied that something in his face gave a hint of physical weakness  i have heard one or two creditable things about you and thought of asking you to run up to my offices but im glad to meet you now said savine with a smile adding when thurston made a solemn bow there ive been sufficiently civil and i see you would rather i talked business  im considerably indebted to you for the way you tackled the late crisis and approve of the logguards extension  how much did the extra work cost you  here is the wages bill and a list of the iron work charged at cost thurston answered  as i did the work without any orders you would be justified in declining to pay for it and i have included no profit  ah said savine who glanced over the paper and scribbled across it looking up with a twinkle in his eye he asked have you been acquiring riches latterly  my cashier will pay that note whenever you hand it in at vancouver  ill also endorse your contract for payment if you will give it me  further i want to say that ive been to look at your work and it pleases me  there are plenty of men in this province who would have done it as solidly but its the general design and ingenious fixings that take my fancy  may i ask where you got the ideas  in england answered geoffrey  i spent some time in the drawing office of a man of some note  he mentioned a name and savine who looked at him critically nodded as if in recognition  the older man smiled when thurston showed signs of resenting his inspection  in that case i should say you ought to do savine observed cheerfully  i dont understand said thurston and savine answered  no  well if youll wait a few moments ill try to make things plain to you  i want a live man with brains of his own and some knowledge of mechanical science  there is no trouble about getting them by the car load from the east or the old country but the man for me must know how to use his muscles if necessary and handle ax and drill as well in short i want one who has been right through the mill as you seem to have been and so long as he earns it im not going to worry over his salary  im afraid i would not suit you said geoffrey  im rather too fond of my own way to make a good servant and of late i have not done badly fighting for my own hand  therefore while i thank you and should be glad to undertake any minor contracts you can give me i prefer to continue as at present  i should not fancy that you would be particularly easy to get on with savine observed with another shrewd glance but with unabated good humor  still what you suggest might suit me  i have rather more work at present than i can hold on to with both hands and have tolerably good accounts of you  come west with me and spend the week end at my house where we could talk things over quietly  geoffrey was gratifiedfor the speaker was famous in his professionand he showed his feeling as he answered i consider myself fortunate that you should ask me  i figured you were not fond of compliments and im a plain man myself declared savine with the humor apparent in his keen eyes again  i will however give you one piece of advice before i forget it  my sisterinlaw might be there and if she wants to doctor you dont let her  she has a weakness for physicking strangers and the results are occasionally embarrassing  it happened accordingly that thurston who had overhauled his wardrobe in vancouver duly arrived at a pretty wooden villa which looked down upon a deep inlet  he knew the mountain valleys of the cumberland and had wandered sometimes footsore and hungry under the giant ramparts of the selkirks and the rockies but he had never seen a fairer spot than the reft in the hills which sheltered savines villa and was known by its indian name the place of the hundred springs  for a background somber cedars lifted their fretted spires against the skyline on the southern hand  beneath the trees the hillsides closed in and the emerald green of maples and tawny tufts of oak rolled down to a breadth of milkwhite pebbles and a stretch of silver sand past which clear green water shoaling from shade to shade wound inland threads of glancing spray quivered in and out among the foliage and high above beyond a strip of sparkling sea and set apart by filmy cloud from all the earth below stretched the giant sawedge of the coast ranges snow  the whitepainted redroofed dwelling with its greenlatticed shutters tasteful scroll work and ample if indifferently swarded lawns was pleasant to look upon but thurston found more pleasure in the sight of its young mistress who awaited him in a great cool room that was hung with deerhead trophies and floored with parquetry of native timber  helen savine wore a white dress and her favorite crimson roses nestled in the belt  though she greeted geoffrey with indifferent cordiality the girl was surprised when her eyes rested upon him  thurston was not a man of the conventional type one meets and straightway forgets and she had often thought about him but since the night at crosbie ghyll his image had presented itself as she first saw himragged hungry and grim a worthy descendant of the wild thurstons about whom musker had discoursed  now in spite of his weatherbeaten face and hardened hands he appeared what he was a man of education and some refinement and his resolute expression erect carriage and muscular frame rendered lithe and almost statuesque by much swinging of the ax gave him an indefinite air of distinction  again she decided that geoffrey thurston was a wellfavored man but remembering muskers stories she set herself to watch for some trace of inherent barbarity  this was unfortunate for geoffrey because in such cases observers generally discover what they search for  geoffrey was placed beside helen at dinner and having roughed it since he left england and even before that time it seemed strange to him to be deftly waited upon at a table glittering with silver and gay with flowers  mrs thomas savine sat opposite him between her husband and the host and helen found certain suspicions confirmed when savine referred to the crushing of the strike  previously he had given his daughter a brief account of it  it was daringly done said helen but i wonder mr thurston if you and others who hold the power ever consider the opposite side of the question  it may be that those men whose task is evidently highly dangerous have wives and children depending upon them and a few extra dollars earned hardly enough no doubt might mean so much to them  i am afraid i dont always do so answered geoffrey  i have toiled tolerably hard as a workman myself  if any employé should consider that he was underpaid for the risk he ran and should say so civilly i should listen to him  on the other hand if any combination strove by unfair means to coerce me i should spare no effort to crush it  thurston generally was too much in earnest to make a pleasant dinnertable conversationalist  as he spoke he shut one big brown hand  it was a trifling action and he was perhaps unconscious of it but helen who noticed the flicker in his eyes and the vindictive tightening of the hard fingers shrank from him instinctively  is that not a cruel plan of action and is there no room for a gentler policy in your profession  must the weak always be trampled out of existence she replied with a slight trace of indignation  thurston turned towards her with a puzzled expression  julius savine smiled but his sisterinlaw who had remained silent but not unobservant broke in you believe in the hereditary transmission of character mr thurston  i think most people do to some extent answered geoffrey  but why do you ask me  its quite simple said mrs savine smiling  did my husband tell you that when we were in england we were held up by a storm there one night in your ancestral home  there was a man there who ought to belong to the feudal ages  he was called musker and he told us quaint stories about some of you  i fancy geoffrey who robbed the kings dragoons must have looked just like you when you shut your fingers so a few minutes ago  i am a little surprised geoffrey returned with a flush rising in his cheeks  musker used to talk a great deal of romantic nonsense crosbie ghyll is no longer mine  i hope you passed a pleasant night there  mrs savine became eloquent concerning the historic interest of the ancient house and her brotherinlaw who appeared interested observed  so far you have not told me about that particular adventure  again the incident was unfortunate for geoffrey because helen who had no great respect for her aunts perceptions decided that if the similitude had struck even that lady she was right in her own estimation of thurstons character  we heard of several instances of reckless daring and we colonials consider all the historic romance of the land we sprang from belongs to us as well as you mrs savine said  so if it is not an intrusion may i ask if any of those border warriors were remarkable for deeds of selfabnegation or charity  i am afraid not admitted geoffrey rather grimly  neither did any of them ever do much towards the making of history  all of them were generally too busy protecting their property or seizing that of their neighbors  but at least when they fought they seem to have fought for the losing side and according to tradition paid for it dearly however to change the subject is it fair to hold any man responsible for his ancestors shortcomings  they have gone back to the dust long ago and it is the present that concerns us  still can anybody avoid the results of those shortcomings or virtues persisted helen and her father said  i hardly think so  there is an instance beside you mr thurston miss savines grandfather ruled in paternally feudal fashion over a few dozen superstitious habitants way back in oldworld quebec as his folks had done since the first french colonization  that explains my daughters views on social matters and her weakness for playing the somewhat autocratic lady bountiful  the seigneurs were benevolent village despots with very quaint ways  savine spoke lightly and one person only noticed that the face of his daughter was slightly less pale in coloring than before but that one afterwards remembered her fathers words and took them as a clue to the womans character  he discovered also that helen savine was both generous and benevolent but that she loved to rule and to rule somewhat autocratically  the first day at the savine villa passed like a pleasant dream to the man who had toiled for a bare living in the shadowy forests or knelt all day among hot rocks to hold the weary drill with bleeding fingers mr savine grew more and more interested in geoffrey who during the second day made great advances in the estimation of mrs thomas savine  bicycles were not so common a womans possession in canada or elsewhere then  in fact there were few roads in british columbia fit to propel one on  an american friend had sent miss savine a wheel which after a few journeys over a corduroy road groaned most distressfully whenever she mounted it  helen desired to ride in to the railroad but the gaudy machine complained even more than usual and when at last one of its wheels declined to revolve julius savine called geoffreys attention to it  if you are anxious for mild excitement and want to earn my daughters gratitude you might tackle that confounded thing mr thurston he said  the local blacksmith shakes his head over it and sent it back the last time worse than ever with several necessary portions missing after running many kinds of machines in my time im willing to own that this particular specimen defies me  thurston had stripped and fitted various intricate mining appliances but he had never struggled with a bicycle  so when helen accepted his offer of assistance he wheeled the machine out upon the lawn and proceeded lightheartedly to dismantle it while the savine brothers lounged in cane chairs encouraging him over their cigars  the dismantling was comparatively simple but when the time for reassembling came thurston who found that certain cups could not by any legitimate means be induced to screw home into their places was perforce obliged to rest the machine upon two chairs and wriggle underneath it where he reclined upon his back with grimy oil dripping upon his forehead  red in the face he crawled out to breathe at intervals and helen made stern efforts to conceal her mingled alarm and merriment when thomas savine said  will you take long odds thurston that you never make that invention of his satanic majesty run straight again  mrs savine cautioned the operator about sunstroke and apoplexy  when thomas savine caught helens eye both laughed outright and geoffrey mistaking the reason felt hurt he determined to conquer the bicycle or remain beneath it all night  when at last he succeeded in putting the various parts together and straightened his aching back he hoped that he did not look so disgusted grimy and savage as he undoubtedly felt  you must really let it alone said helen  the sun is very hot and perhaps you might be more successful after luncheon  i have noticed that when mending bicycles a rest and refreshment sometimes prove beneficial  thats so agreed thomas savine  young harry was wont to tackle it on just those lines  he used up several of my best cubanos and a bottle of claret each time before he had finished and then i was never convinced that the thing went any better  you must beware of ruining your health interposed mrs savine mending bicycles frequently leads to an accumulation of malevolent humors  did i interrupt you mr thurston  i was only going to say that it is nearly finished and that i should not like to be vanquished by an affair of this kind said geoffrey with emphasis  would it hurt the machine if i stood it upon its head miss savine  oh no and i am so grateful helen answered assuringly noticing guiltily that there were oil and red dust besides many somber smears upon the operators face and jacket while the skin was missing from several of his knuckles  it was done at last and geoffrey sighed while the rest of the party expressed surprise as well as admiration when the wheels revolved freely without click or groan  julius savine nodded with more than casual approval and helen was gracious with her thanks  you look quite faint observed mrs savine  it was the hot sun on your forehead and the mental excitement  such things are often followed by dangerous consequences and you must take a dose of my elixir  helen dear you know where to find the bottle  julius savine was guilty of a slight gesture of impatience  his brother laughed while helen seemed anxious to slip away  geoffrey answered  i hardly think one should get very mentally excited over a bicycle  i feel perfectly well and only somewhat greasy  that is just one of the symptoms  yes you have hit itgreasy feeling broke in the amateur dispenser who rarely relaxed her efforts until she had run down her victim  helen why dont you hunt round for that bottle  i mean greasy externally explained geoffrey in desperation and again thomas savine chuckled while helen who ground one little bootheel into the grasses deliberately turned away  mrs savine however cheerfully departed to find the bottle and soon returned with it and a wine glass  she filled the glass with an inky fluid which smelt unpleasant and said to geoffrey  you will be distinctly better the moment you have taken this  geoffrey took the goblet walked apart a few paces and making a wry face heroically swallowed the bitter draught after which mrs savine who beamed upon him said  you feel quite differently dont you  yes asserted geoffrey truthfully longing to add that he had felt perfectly well before and had now to make violent efforts to overcome his nausea  his heroism had its reward however for when helen returned from her wheel ride she said i was really ashamed when my aunt insisted on doctoring you but you must take it as a compliment because she only prescribes for the people she takes a fancy to  i hope the dose was not particularly nasty  sorry for you thurston from experience cried thomas savine  when i see that bottle i just vacate the locality  the taste isnt the worst of it by a long way  that night julius savine called geoffrey into his study and spreading a roll of plans before him offered terms which were gladly accepted for the construction of portions of several works  savine said i wont worry much about references  your work speaks for itself and the roads and trails surveyor has been talking about you  ill take you as youll have to take me on trust  i keep my eye on rising young men and i have been watching you  besides the man who could master an obstinate bicycle the first time he wrestled with one must have some sense of his own and it isnt everybody who would have swallowed that physic  i could not well avoid doing so said geoffrey with a rueful smile  i feel i owe you an apology but its my sisterinlaws one weakness and you have won her favor for the rest of your natural life savine returned  you have had several distinguished fellowsufferers including provincial representatives and railroad directors for to my horror she physicked a very famous one the last time he came  he did not suffer with your equanimity  in fact he was almost uncivil and said to me if the secretary hadnt sent off your trestle contract i should urge the board to reconsider it  did you ask me here that your relatives might poison me savine  geoffrey laughed and his host added  i want to talk over a good many details with you and dare say you deserve a holidayi know i doso i shall retain you here for a week at least  i take your consent for granted its really necessary     chapter ix  geoffrey stands firm  geoffrey thurston possessed a fine constitution and in spite of mrs savines treatment and her husbands predictions rose refreshed and vigorous on the morning that followed his struggle with the bicycle it was a glorious morning and when breakfast was over he enjoyed the unusual luxury of lounging under the shadow of a cedar on the lawn where he breathed in the cool breeze which rippled the sparkling straits  hitherto he had risen with the sun to begin a day of toil and anxiety and this brief glimpse of a life of ease with the pleasures of congenial companionship was as an oasis in the desert to him  a few days will be as much as is good for me he told himself with a sigh  in the meantime hard work and short commons are considerably more appropriate but i shall win the right to all these things some day if my strength holds out  his forehead wrinkled his eyes contracted and he stared straight before him seeing neither the luminous green of the maples nor the whispering cedars but far off in the misty future a golden possibility which if well worth winning must be painfully earned his reverie was broken suddenly  are your thoughts very serious this morning mr thurston a clear voice inquired and the most alluring of the visions he had conjured up stood before him losing nothing by the translation into material flesh  helen savine had halted under the cedar  in soft clinging draperies of white and cream she was a charming reality  im afraid they were geoffrey answered and helen laughed musically  one would fancy that you took life too much in earnest she said it is fortunately impossible either to work or to pile up money forever and a holiday is good for everybody  i am going down to white rock cove to see if my marine garden is as beautiful as it used to be would you care to inspect it and carry this basket for me  thurston showed his pleasure almost too openly  they chatted lightly on many subjects as they walked together kneedeep at times among scarlet wineberries and the delicate green and ebony of maidenhair fern  the scents and essence of summer hung heavy in the air  shafts of golden sunlight piercing the somber canopy of the forest isles touched and it seemed to geoffrey etherealized his companion  the completeness of his enjoyment troubled the man and presently he lapsed into silence  all this appeared too good too pleasant he feared to last  do you know that you have not answered my last question nor spoken a word for the last ten minutes inquired helen with a smile at length have these woods no charm for you or are you regretting the cigarbox beneath the cedar  geoffrey turned towards her and there was a momentary flash in his eyes as he answered  you must forgive me  keen enjoyment often blunts the edge of speech and i was wishing that this walk through the cool green stillness might last forever  afraid that he might have said too much he ceased speaking abruptly and then after the fashion of one unskilled in tricks of speech proceeded to remedy one blunder by committing another  it reminds me of the evenings at grahams ranch  there can surely be no sunsets in the world to equal those that flame along the snows of british columbia and you will remember how together we watched them burn and fade  it was an unfortunate reference for now and then helen had recalled that period with misgivings  cut off from all association with persons of congenial tastes she had not only found the mans society interesting but she had allowed herself to sink into an indefinite state of companionship with him  in the mountain solitude such camaraderie had seemed perfectly natural but it was impossible under different circumstances  it was only on the last occasion that he had ever hinted at a continuance of this intimacy but she had not forgotten the rash speech  had the recollections been all upon her own side she might have permitted a partial renewal of the companionship but she became forbidding at once when geoffrey ventured to remind her of it  yes she said reflectively  the sunsets were often impressive but we are all of us unstable and what pleases us at one time may well prove tiresome at another  if that experience were repeated i should very possibly grow sadly discontented at grahams ranch  geoffrey was not only shrewd enough to comprehend that if miss savine unbent during a summer holiday in the wilderness it did not follow that she would always do so but he felt that he deserved the rebuke he had however learned patience in canada and was content to bide his time so he answered goodhumoredly that such a result might well be possible  they were silent until they halted where the hillside fell sharply to the verge of a cliff  far down below thurston could see the white pebbles shine through translucent water and with professional instincts aroused he dubiously surveyed the slope to the head of the crag  julius savine or somebody under his orders had constructed a zigzag pathway which wound down between small maples and clusters of wineberries shimmering like blooddrops among their glossy leaves  in places the pathway was underpinned with timber against the side of an almost sheer descent and he noticed that one could have dropped a vertical line from the fishhawk which hung poised a few feet outside one angle into the water  they descended cautiously to the first sharp bend and here geoffrey turned around in advance of his companion  do you mind telling me how long it is since you or anybody else has used this path miss savine he inquired  i came up this way last autumn and think hardly any other person has used it since  but why do you ask was the reply  i fancied so geoffrey lapsed instinctively into his brusque professional style of comment  poor system of underpinning badly fixed yonder  i am afraid you must find some other way down to the beach this morning  it was long since helen had heard anybody apply the word must to herself  as julius savines only daughter most of her wishes had been immediately gratified while the men she met vied with one another in paying her homage  in addition to this her father in whose mechanical abilities she had supreme faith had constructed that pathway especially for her pleasure  so for several reasons her pride took fire and she answered coldly the path is perfectly safe  my father himself watched the greater portion of its building  it was safe once no doubt answered geoffrey slightly puzzled as to how he had offended her but still resolute  the rains of last winter however have washed out much of the surface soil leaving bare parts of the rock beneath and the next angle yonder is positively dangerous  can we not go around  only by the head of the valley two miles away at least helens tone remained the reverse of cordial  i have climbed both in the selkirks and the coast range and to anyone with a clear head even in the most slippery places there cannot be any real danger  i regret that i cannot agree with you  i devoutly wish i could said geoffrey uneasily  no you must please go no further miss savine  the girls eyes glittered resentfully  a flush crept into the center of either cheek as she walked towards him  though he did not intend it there was perhaps too strong a suggestion of command in his attitude and when helen came abreast of him he laid a hand restrainingly upon her arm  she shook it off not with illhumored petulance for helen was never ungraceful nor undignified but with a disdain that hurt the man far more than anger  nevertheless knowing that he was right he was determined that she should run no risk letting his hand swing at his side he walked a few paces before her and then turned in a narrow portion of the path where two people could not pass abreast  please listen to me miss savine he began  i am an engineer and i can see that the bend yonder is dangerous  i cannot therefore consent to allow you to venture upon it  how should i face your father if anything unfortunate happened  my father saw the path built repeated helen  he also is an engineer and is said to be one of the most skillful in the dominion i am not used to being thwarted for inadequate reasons  let me pass  geoffrey stood erect and immovable  i am very sorry miss savine that in this one instance i cannot obey you he said  there was an awkward silence and while they looked at each other helen felt her breath come faster  retreating a few paces she seated herself upon a boulder thus leaving the task of terminating an unpleasant position to geoffrey who was puzzled for a time  finally an inspiration dawned upon thurston who said  perhaps you would feel the disappointment less if i convinced you by ocular demonstration  walking cautiously forward to the dangerous angle he grasped a broken edge of the rock outcrop about which the path twisted and pressed hard with both feet upon the edge of the narrow causeway  it was a hazardous experiment and the result of it startling for there was a crash and a rattle and geoffrey remained clinging to the rock with one foot in a cranny while a mass of earth and timber slid down the steeppitched slope and disappeared over the face of the crag  a hollow splashing rose suggestively from far beneath the rock  helen who had been too angry to notice the consideration for herself implied in the mans last speech turned her eyes upon the ground and did not raise them until after swinging himself carefully onto firmer soil geoffrey approached her  i hope after what you have seen you will forgive me for preventing your descent he said  you used considerable violence and i am still unconvinced helen declared rising as she spoke  in any case you have at least made further progress impossible and we may as well retrace our steps  no i do not wish to hear any more upon the subject  it is really not worth further discussion  they turned back together  when the ascent grew steeper geoffrey held out his hand  instead of accepting the proffered assistance as she had done when they descended helen apparently failed to notice the hand and the homeward journey was not pleasant to either of them  helen did not parade her displeasure but geoffrey was sensible of it and never being a fluent speaker upon casual subjects he was not successful in his conversational efforts  when at last they reached the villa he shook his shoulders disgustedly as he recalled some of his inane remarks  it was hardly a wonder she was silent  heavens what prompted me to drivel in that style he reflected  it was cruelly unfortunate but i could not let her risk her precious safety over that confounded path  at luncheon it happened that mrs savine said i saw you going towards the white rock cove helen  very interesting place isnt it mr thurston  but you brought none of that lovely weed back with you  did you notice how i had the path graded as you went down asked savine and thurston saw that helens eyes were fixed upon him  the expression of the eyes aroused his indignation because the glance was not a challenge but a warning that whatever his answer might be the result would be indifferent to her  he was hurt that she should suppose for a moment that he would profit by this opportunity  we were not able to descend the whole way he replied  last winters rains have loosened the surface soil and one angle of the path slipped bodily away  very fortunately i was some distance in advance of miss savine and there was not the slightest danger  might i suggest socketed timbers  the occurrence reminds me of a curious accident to the railroad track in the rockies  helen did not glance at the speaker again for savine asked no awkward questions  but thurston saw no more of her during the afternoon  that evening he sought savine in his study  you have all been very kind to me he said  in fact so much so that i feel if i stay any longer among you i shall never be content to rough it when i go back to the bush  this is only too pleasant but being a poor man with a living to earn it would be more consistent if i recommenced my work  which of the operations should i undertake first  savine smiled on him whimsically and answered with western directness  i dont know whether the roads surveyor was right or wrong when he said that you were not always overcivil  see here thurston leaving all personal amenities out of the question im inclined to figure that you will be of use to me aid the connection also will help you considerably  my paid representatives are not always so energetic as they might be  so if you are tired of high maples you can start in with the rockcutting on the new wagon road  it is only a detail but i want it finished and as the cars would bring you down in two hours time ill expect you to put in the weekend here talking over more important things with me  thurston left the house next morning  he did not see helen to say goodby to her for she had ridden out into the forest before he departed from high maples  helen admitted to herself that she was interested in thurston the more so because he alone of all the men whom she had met had successfully resisted her will  but she shrank from him and though convinced that his action in preventing her from going down the pathway had been justified she could not quite forgive him     chapter x  savines confidence  despite his employers invitation thurston did not return to high maples at the end of the week  the rockcutting engrossed all his attention and he was conscious that it might be desirable to allow miss savines indignation to cool  he had thought of her often since the day that she gave him the dollar and at first still smarting under the memory of another womans treachery had tried to analyze his feelings regarding her  the result was not very definite though he decided that he had never really loved millicent and was very certain now that she had wasted little affection upon him  one evening at grahams ranch when they had stood silently together under the early stars he had become suddenly conscious of the allimportant fact that his life would be empty without helen savine and that of all the women whom he had met she alone could guide and raise him towards a higher plane  it was characteristic of geoffrey thurston that the determination to win her in spite of every barrier of wealth and rank came with the revelation and that at the same time counting the cost he realized that he must first bid boldly for a name and station and with all patience bide his time  a more coldblooded man might have abandoned the quest as hopeless at the first and one more impulsive might have ruined his chances by rashness but geoffrey united the characteristics of the reckless thurstons with his mothers cool north country canniness  it therefore happened that savine irritated by a journalistic reference to the tardiness of that seasons roadmaking went down to see how the work entrusted to geoffrey was progressing  he was accompanied by his daughter who desired to visit the wife of a prosperous rancher  it was towards noon of a hot day when they alighted from their horses in the mouth of a gorge that wound inland from the margin of a lake  no breath of wind ruffled the steely surface of the lake  white boulder and somber fir branch slept motionless reflected in the crystal depths of the water and lines of great black cedars that kept watch from the ridge above stood mute beneath the sun  as they picked their path carefully through the débris littering an ugly rent in the rock where perspiring men were toiling hard with pick and drill they came upon thurston before he was aware of them geoffrey stood with a heavy hammer in his hand critically surveying a somewhat seedy man who was just then offering his services  savine who had a sense of humor was interested in the scene and said to his daughter thurstons busy  well just wait until hes through with that fellow  geoffrey being ignorant of their presence decided that the applicant who said that he was an englishman and used to estimating quantities would be of little service but he seldom refused to assist a stranger in distress  i do all the draughting and figuring work myself he said  however if you are hard up you can earn two dollars a day wheeling broken rock until you find something better  the man turned away apparently not delighted at the prospect of wheeling rock and geoffrey faced about to greet the spectators  i dont fancy youll get much work out of that fellow observed savine  i did not expect to see you so soon and am pleasantly surprised said geoffrey who warned by something in helens face restrained the answer he was about to make  you will be tired after your rough ride and it is very hot out here  if you will come into my office tent i can offer you some slight refreshment  helen noticed every appointment of the double tent which was singularly neat and trim  its flooring of packed twigs gave out a pleasant aromatic odor  the instruments scattered among the papers on the maple desk were silvermounted  the tall dusty man in toilstained jean produced thin glasses into which he poured mineral waters and california wine  a tin of english biscuits was passed with the cooling drinks  thurston was a curious combination she fancied for having seen him covered with the grime of hard toil she now beheld him in a new rôlethat of host  they chatted for halfanhour and then there was an interruption for the young englishman who had grown tired of wheeling the barrow stood outside the tent demanding to see his employer  geoffrey strode out into the sunshine  the stranger said that he had a backache besides blisters on his hands and that wheeling a heavy barrow did not agree with him  he added with an easy assurance that drew a frown to the contractors face its a considerable comedown for me to have to work hard at all and i was told you were generally good to a distressed countryman cant you really give me anything easier  i try to be helpful to my countrymen when theyre worth it answered geoffrey dryly  would you care to hold a rock drill or swing a sledge instead  i hardly think so he returned dubiously  you see i havent been trained to manual labor and im not so strong as you might think by looking at me  geoffrey lost his temper  the drill might blister your fingers i dare say he admitted  im afraid you are too good for this rude country and i have no use for you  i could afford to be decent  perhaps so but i earn my money with considerably more effort than you seem willing to make  the cook will give you dinner with the other men today then you can resume your search for an easy billet  we have no room in this camp for idlers  savine chuckled but helen who had a weakness for philanthropy and small practical experience of its economic aspect flushed with indignation pitying the stranger and resenting what she considered thurstons brutality  her father rose when the contractor came in to say that he wanted to look around the workings  he suggested that helen should remain somewhere in the shade  when thurston had placed a canvas lounge for her outside the tent the girl turned towards him a look of severe disapproval  why did you speak to that poor man so cruelly she asked  perhaps i am transgressing but it seems to me that one living here in comfort even comparative luxury might be a little more considerate towards those less fortunate  please remember that i was once what you term less fortunate myself geoffrey reminded helen who answered quickly one would almost fancy it was you who had forgotten  on the contrary i am not likely to forget how hard it was for me to earn my first fee here in this new country he declared looking straight at her  i was glad to work up to my waist in icewater to make at first scarcely a dollar and a half a day  one must exercise discretion miss savine and that man so far as i could see had no desire to work  it was a pity that geoffrey did not explain that he meant bransomes payment by the words my first fee for helen had never forgotten how she had failed in the attempt to double the amount for which he had bargained  she had considered him destitute of all the gentler graces but now she was surprised that he should apparently attempt to wound her  is it right to judge so hastily she inquired mastering her indignation with difficulty  the poor man may not be fit for hard worki think he said soand i cannot help growing wrathful at times when i hear the stories which reach me of commercial avarice and tyranny  geoffrey blew a silver whistle which summoned the foreman to whom he gave an order  your protégé shall have an opportunity of proving his willingness to be useful by helping the cook thurston said with a smile at helen  why did you do thatnow she asked uncertain whether to be gratified or angry and geoffrey answered because i fancied it would meet with your approval  then declared helen looking past him if that was your only motive you were mistaken  the conversation dragged after that and they were glad when savine returned to escort his daughter part of the way to the ranch  when he rode back into camp alone an hour later he dismounted with difficulty and his face was gray as he reeled into the tent  give me some wine thurstonbrandy if you have it and dont ask questions  i shall be better in five minutesi hope he gasped  geoffrey had no brandy but he broke the neck off a bottle of his best substitute and savine lay very still on a canvas lounge gripping one of its rails hard for long anxious minutes before he said it is over and i am myself again  hope i didnt scare you  i was uneasy thurston replied  dare i ask sir what the trouble was  savine who evidently had not quite recovered looked steadily at the speaker  ill tell you in confidence but neither my daughter nor my rivals must hear of this he said at length  it is part of the price i paid for success  i have an affection of the heart which may snuff me out at any moment or leave me years of carefullyguarded life  i dont quite understand you but perhaps i ought to suggest that you sit still and keep quiet for a time geoffrey replied and savine answered no  save for a slight faintness i am as well asi usually am  when one gets more than his due share of this worlds good things he must generally pay for itsee  if you dont remember as an axiom that one can buy success too dearly  meantime and to come back to this questions everyday aspect i want your promise to say nothing of what you have seen  helen must be spared anxiety and i must still pose as a man without a weakness whatever it costs me  you have my word sir said geoffrey and savine who nodded appeared satisfied  as i said before i can trust you thurston and though ive many interested friends im a somewhat lonely man  i dont know why i should tell you this it isnt quite like me but the seizure shook me and i just feel that way  besides in return for your promise i owe you the confidence  give me some more wine and ill try to tell you how i spent my strength in gaining what is called success  i won by hard work started life as a bridge carpenter and starved myself to buy the best textbooks savine began presently  bid always for something better than what i had and generally got it ran through a big bridgebuilding contract at twentyfive and fell in love with my daughters mother when id finished it  i had risen at a bound from working foremanshe was the daughter of one of the proudest povertystricken frenchmen in old quebec  well it would make a long story but i married her and she taught me much worth knowing besides helping me on until when i had all my savings locked up in apparently profitless schemes i tried for a great bridge contract  i also got it but there was political jobbery and the opposition learning from my rival how i was fixed required a big deposit before the agreement was signed  savine paused a full minute and helped himself to more wine before he proceeded  the deposit was to be paid in fourteen days from the time i got the notice or the tender would be advertised for again and i hadnt half the amount handy  i couldnt realize on my possessions without an appalling loss but i swore i would hold on to that contract and i did it  it was always my way to pick up any odd information i could and i learned that a certain mining shaft was likely to strike highpay ore  i got the information from a workman who left the mine to serve me so i caught the first train made a long journey and rode over a bad pass to reach the shaft  how i dealt with the manager doesnt greatly matter but though i neither bribed nor threatened him he showed me what i wanted to see  i rode back over pass and down moraine through blinding snow went on without rest or sleep to the city borrowed what i couldi wasnt so well known then and it was mighty littleand bought up as much of that mines stock on margins as the money would cover  the news was being held back but other men were buying quietly  stillwell they had to sleep and get their dinners and i who could do without either came out ahead of them  market went mad in a day or two over the news of the crushing i sold out at a tremendous premium and started to pay my deposit  i did it in person came back with the sealed contracthadnt eaten decently or slept more than a few hours in two anxious weekswent home triumphant and collapsedas i did not long agowhile i told my wife  there was silence for several minutes inside the tent  then geoffrey said i thank you for your confidence sir and will respect it but even yet i am not quite certain why considering that you held my unconditional promise you gave it me  as i said before i felt like it answered savine  still theres generally a commonsense reason somewhere for what i do and it may help you to understand me  i heard of you at your first beginning  i figured that you were taking hold as i had done before you and thought i might have some use for a man like you  perhaps ill tell you more if we both live long enough some day  it was in the cool of the evening that savine and his daughter who had been waiting at a house far down the trail rode back towards the railroad leaving geoffrey puzzled at the uncertain ways of women  what do you think of my new assistant helen asked savine  you generally have a quick judgment and you havent told me yet  i hardly know was the answer  he is certainly a man of strong character but there is something about him which repels onesomething harsh almost sinister though this would of course in no way affect his business relations with you  for instance you saw how he lives and yet he turned away a countryman who appeared destitute and hungry  savine laughed  you did not see how he lived  the good things in his tent were part of his business property handy when some mining manager who may want work done comes alongor perhaps brought in by mounted messenger for miss savines special benefit  thurston lives on pork and potatoes and eats them with his men  the fellow you pitied was a lazy tramp  it maynt greatly matter to you or me but thurston will do great things some day  it is perhaps possible assented helen  the men who are hard and cruel are usually successful  you have rather a weakness father for growing enthusiastic over what you call a live assistant  you have sometimes been mistaken remember     chapter xi  an inspiration  more than twelve months had passed since thurstons first visit to high maples when he stood one morning gazing abstractedly down a misty valley  below him a small army of men toiled upon the huge earth embankments which halfhidden by thin haze divided the river from the broad swamps behind it  but geoffrey scarcely saw the men  he was looking back upon the events of the past year and was oblivious to the present  he had made rapid progress in his profession and had won the esteem of julius savine but he felt uncertain as to how far he had succeeded in placating miss savine  on some of his brief visits to high maples helen had treated him with a kindliness which sent him away exultant  at other times however she appeared to avoid his company  presently dismissing the recollection of the girl with a sigh geoffrey glanced at the strip of paper in his hand  it was a telegraphic message from savine and ran   want you and all the ideas you can bring along at the chalet tomorrow  expect deputation and interesting evening   savine had undertaken the drainage of the wide valley which the rising waters periodically turned into a morass and had sublet to geoffrey a part of the work  each of the neighboring ranchers who would benefit by the undertaking had promised a prorata payment and the crown authorities had conditionally granted to savine a percentage of all the unoccupied land he could reclaim  previous operations had not however proved successful for the snowfed river breached the dykes and the leaders of a syndicate with an opposition scheme were not only sowing distrust among savines supporters but striving to stir up political controversy over the concession  geoffrey did not agree with the contractor on several important points but deferred to the older mans judgment  he had however already made his mark and could have obtained profitable commissions from both mining companies and the smaller municipalities had he desired them  while geoffrey was meditating the mists began to melt before a warm breeze from the pacific  sliding in filmy wisps athwart the climbing pines they rolled clear of the river leaving bare two huge parallel mounds between which the turbid waters ran  geoffrey surveying the waste of tall marsh grasses stretching back to the forest knew that a rich reward awaited the man who could reclaim the swamp  he was reminded of his first venture which was insignificant compared to this greater one and as suddenly as the mists had melted the uncertainty in his own mind concerning savines plan vanished too and he saw that the contractor was wrong  what he had done for bransome on a minute scale must be done here on a gigantic one  a bold man backed with capital might blast a pathway for the waters through the converging rocks of the cañon and without the need of costly dykes both swamp and the wide blue lake at the end of the valley would be left dry land he stood rigidly still for ten minutes while his heart beat fast  then he strode hurriedly towards the gap in the ranges  there was much to do before he could obey savines summons  it was towards the close of that afternoon when julius savine lounged on the veranda of a wooden hotel for tourists which was built in a gorge of savage beauty  in spite of all that modern art could do the building looked raw and new out of place among the immemorial pines climbing towards snowy heights unsullied by the presence of man helen who sat near her father glanced at him keenly before she said  you have not looked well all day  is it the hot weather or are you troubled about the conference tonight  savine at first made no reply  the furrows deepened on his forehead and helen felt a thrill of anxiety as she watched him  she had noticed that his shoulders were losing their squareness and that his face had grown thin  i must look worse than i feel he declared after a little while but though there is nothing to worry about the reclamation scheme is a big one and some of my rancher friends seem to have grown lukewarm latterly  if they went over to the opposition the plea that my workings might damage their property if encouraged by meddlesome politicians would seriously hamper me  still i shall certainly convince them and that is why i am receiving the deputation tonight i wish thurston had come in earlier i want to consult with him  what has happened to you asked helen laying her hand affectionately upon his arm  you never used to listen to anybodys opinions and now you are always consulting thurston  sometimes i fancy you ought to give up your business before it wears you out  after all you have not known thurston long  perhaps so savine admitted and when he looked at her helen became interested in an eagle which hung poised on broad wings above the valley  i feel older than i used to and may quit business when i put this contract through  it is big enough to wind up with  if id known thurston for ages i couldnt be more sure of him  i am a little disappointed that you dont like him  you go too far  helen still concentrated her attention upon the dusky speck against the blue  i have no reason for disliking mr thurston indeed i do not dislike him and my feeling may be mere jealousy  you givehimmost of your confidences now and i should hate anybody who divided you from me  savine lifted her little hand into his own and patted it playfully as he answered  you need never fear that  helen you are very like your mother as she was thirty years ago  there was a sparkle of indignation in helens eyes and a suspicion of telltale color in her face  she remembered that when he first met her mother her fathers position much resembled thurstons and the girl wondered if he desired to remind her of it  the cars are in sight  perhaps i had better see whether the hotel people are ready for your guests she remarked with indifference  the hotel was famous for its cuisine and the dinner which followed was for various reasons a memorable one though some of the guests appeared distinctly puzzled by the sequence of viands and liquors still even those who appreciating the change from leathery venison and grindstone bread had eaten too much at the first course struggled manfully with the succeeding and good fellowship reigned until the cloth was removed and the party prepared to discuss business  savine sat at the head of the table the gray now showing thickly in his hair  his expression was perhaps too languid for one of his guests whispered that the daring engineer was not what he used to be the man glanced at thurston who sat stalwart keen and determined of face beside his chief and added i know which id sooner run up against now and it wouldnt be his deputy subcontractor or whatever the fellow is  finding that our correspondence was using up no end of time and ink i figured it would be better for us to talk things over together comfortably and as some of you come from vancouver and some from round the lake this place appeared a convenient center began savine now gentlemen im ready to discuss either business or anything else you like  there was a murmur and the guests looked at one another  they were a somewhat mixed companyseveral speculators from the cities two credited with political influence welleducated englishmen who had purchased land in the hope of combining sport with cattle raising and wiry axemen who lived in rough surroundings while they drove their clearings further into the forest field by field  then ill start right off with business said a city man  i bought land up yonder and signed papers backing you  i thought there would be a boom in the valley when you got through but ive heard some talk lately to the effect that the river is going to beat you and in any case youre making slow headway  what i what we all want to know is when youre going to have the undertaking completed  applause and a whispering followed and another man said our sentiments exactly  guess youve seen the freespeakers article  i have savine acknowledged coolly  it suggested that i have no intention of carrying out my agreement that i am hoodwinking the authorities for some indefinite purpose mysteriously connected with maintaining our present provincial rulers in power  the things absurd on the face of it when im spending my money like water and you ought to know me better  i wont even get the comparatively insignificant bonus until the work is finished  several of the listeners rapped upon the table one or two growled suspiciously and a big sunburnt englishman stood up  well let the article in question pass he said  it is clearly written with personal animus  as you say we know you better but see here savine this is going to be a serious business for us if you fail  weve helped you with free labor hauled your timber in lent you oxen and in fact done almost everything besides giving you our bonds for a good many dollars and signing full approval of your scheme  by doing this we have barred ourselves from encouraging the other fellows plans  after similar but less complimentary speeches had been made thurston who had been whispering to savine claimed attention  he cast a searching glance round the assembly  any sensible man could see that the opposition scheme is impracticable he declared  i am afraid some of you have been sent here well primed  his last remark was perhaps combatant rashness or possibly a premeditated attempt to force the listeners to reveal their actual sentiments  if he wished to get at the truth he was successful for several men began to speak at once and while disjointed words interloped his remarks the loudest of them said  you cant fool us savine  were poor men with a living to earn but were mighty tough and nobody walks over us with nails in their boots if you cant hold up that river where are we going to be  id sooner shove in the giant powder to blow them up than stand by and see my crops and cattle washed out when your big dykes bust  so would i cried several voices and there was a rapid crossfire of question and comment  not the men to be fooled with  stand by our rights appeal to legislation and choke this thing right up  can you make your dykes stand water at all  give the mana fair show how many years do you figure on keeping us waiting  savine rose somewhat stiffly from his chair and thurston noted an ominous grayness in either cheek  there are just two things you can do savine said appeal to your legislators to get my grants canceled or sit tight and trust me  for thirtyfive years ive done my share in the development of the dominion and i never took a contract i didnt put through  this has proved a tough one but if it costs me my last dollar  the honest persons among the malcontents were mostly struggling men who having expected the operations would bring them swift prosperity had been the more disappointed  still the speakers sincerity inspired returning confidence and when he paused there was a measure of sympathy for him for he seemed haggard and ill and was one against many  his guests began to wonder whether they had not been too impatient and suspicious and one broke in apologetically thats good  were not unreasonable  but we like straight talkingwhat if the dykes keep on bursting  then there was consternation for savine collapsed into his chair after he had said mr thurston will tell you  remember he acts for me  to geoffrey he whispered i dont feel well  help me out and then go back to them  sit still  stand back  you have done rather too much already geoffrey declared turning fiercely upon the men who hurried forward one with a water decanter and another with a wine glass  the guests fell back before thurston as he led savine who leaned heavily upon him from the banquet room  as they entered a broad hall helen and her aunt passed along the veranda upon which it opened  they must not know keep them out gasped the contractor  get me some brandy and ring for the stewardquick  you have got to go back and convince those fellows thurston  good lordthis is agony  savine sank into a chair  his twitching face was livid and great beads of moisture gathered upon his forehead  thurston pressed a button then strode swiftly towards the door hoping that helen who passed outside with a laugh upon her lips might be spared the sight of her fathers suffering  but mrs savine gazing in through a long window started as she exclaimed helen your fathers very sick  run along and bring me the elixir out of my valise  helen turned towards the window and geoffrey who groaned inwardly placed himself so that she could not see  there was a rustle of skirts and swift light footsteps approached  what is the matter  why do you stand there  let me pass at once cried helen in a voice trembling with fear  please wait a few moments answered geoffrey standing between the suffering man and his daughter  your father will be better directly and you must not excite him  there was no mistaking the color in helens face now  if her eyes were anxious the crimson in her cheeks and on her forehead was that of anger  geoffrey felt compassionate but he was still determined to spare her  for your fathers sake and your own dont go to him just yet miss savine he pleaded but with little fingers whose grip felt steely the girl wrenched away his detaining arm  is there no limit to your interference or presumption she asked sweeping past him to fall with a low cry beside the big chair upon which her father was reclining  the cry pierced to thurstons heart  helen had seen little of either sickness or tragedy  savine sat still as if he did not see her his face contracted into a ghastly grin of pain  the attendant who came to them deftly aided geoffrey to force a little cordial between the sufferers teeth  savine made no sign forgetting her indignation in her terror helen glanced at geoffrey in vague question but he merely raised his hand with a restraining gesture  we had better get him onto a sofa sir whispered the attendant presently  not very heavy  perhaps you and i could manage  it was when he was being lifted that savine first showed signs of intelligence  he glanced at geoffrey and attempted to beckon towards the room they had left  when he seemed slightly better thurston said  i am going sir  stay here a few minutes and then call somebody waiter  i cannot stay any longer  savine made an approving gesture but helen said with fear and evident surprise you will not leave us now mr thurston  i must answered geoffrey restraining an intense longing to stay since she desired it but loyal to his masters charge  i believe your father is recovering and it is his especial wish  i can do nothing and he needs only quiet  helen said nothing further  she began to chafe her fathers hand while thurston went back pale and grim to the head of the long table  mr savine was seized by a passing faintness but is recovering he said  nevertheless he may not be able to return and as i am interested with him in the drainage scheme he has appointed me his deputy  therefore in brief answer to your questions i would say that if either of us lives you shall have good oat fields instead of swamp grass and muskeg  it is a solemn promisewe intend to redeem it  i want to ask just two questions announced a sunbronzed man in picturesque jacket of fringed deerskin  who are thewe and how are you going to build dykes strong enough to stand the river when the lakes full of melting snow and sends the water down roaring under a twentyfoot head  the speaker had touched the one weak spot in savines scheme but geoffrey rose to the occasion and there was a wondering hush when he said in answer to the first questionjulius savine and i are the we  secondly we will if necessary obliterate the lake  it can be done  the boldness of the answer from a comparatively unknown man held the listeners still until there were further questions and finally amid acclamation one of the party said  then its a bargain and well back you solid through thick and thin isnt that so gentlemen  if the opposition try to make legal trouble as the holders of the cleared land likely to be affected weve got the strongest pull  we came here doubting you have convinced us  i hardly think you will regret it geoffrey assured them  now as i must see to mr savine you will excuse me  savine lay breathing heavily when geoffrey rejoined him but he demanded what had happened and nodded approval when told  then geoffrey withdrew beckoning to helen who rose and followed him  this is no time for useless recrimination or i would ask how you could leave one who has been a generous friend helpless and suffering the girl said reproachfully  my father is evidently seriously ill and you are the only person i can turn to for the hotel manager tells me there is no doctor within miles of us  so in my distress i must stoop to ask you for his sake what i can do  will you believe not only that i sympathize but that i would gladly have given all i possess to save you from this shock thurston began but helen cut him short by an impatient wave of the hand and stood close beside him with distress and displeasure in her eyes  all that is outside the questionwhat can we do she asked imploringly  only one thing answered geoffrey  bring up the best doctor in vancouver by special train  im going now to hold up the fast freight gather your courage  i will be back soon after daylight with skilled assistance  he went out before the girl could answer and comforted helen hurried back to her fathers side  whatever his failings might be thurston was at least a man to depend upon when there was need of action  there was a little platform near the hotel where trains might be flagged for the benefit of passengers but the office was locked thurston who knew that shortly a freight train would pass broke in the window borrowed a lantern lighted it and hurried up the track which here wound round a curve through the forest and over a trestle it is not pleasant to cross a lofty trestle bridge on foot in broad daylight for one must step from sleeper to sleeper over wide spaces with empty air beneath and as the ties are just wide enough to carry the single pair of rails it would mean death to meet a train geoffrey nevertheless pressed on fast the light of the blinking lantern dazzling his eyes and rendering it more difficult to judge the distances between the tiesuntil he halted for breath a moment in the center of the bridge  white mist and the roar of hurrying water rose out of the chasm beneath but another sound broke through the noise of the swift stream  geoffrey hear the vibratory rattle of freight cars racing down the valley and he went on again at a reckless run leaping across black gulfs of shadow  the sound had gained in volume when he reached firm earth and ran swiftly towards the end of the curve from which down a long declivity the engineer could see his lantern  panting he held the light aloft as a great fanshaped blaze of radiance came flaming like a comet down the track  soon he could dimly discern the shape of two huge mountain engines while the rails trembled beside him and a wall of rock flung back the din of whirring wheels  the fast freight had started from the head of atlantic navigation at montreal and would not stop until the huge cars rolled alongside the empress liner at vancouver for part of their burden was being hurried west from england around half the world to china and the east again  the track led downgrade and the engineers who had nursed the great machines up the long climb to the summit were now racing them down hill  waving the lantern geoffrey stood with a foot on one of the rails and every sense intent until the first engines cowcatcher was almost upon him  then he leaped for his life and stood halfblinded amid whirling ballast and a rushing wind as veiled in thick dust the great box cars clanged by  he was savage with dismay for it seemed that the engineer had not seen his signal then his heart bounded a shrill hoot from two whistles was followed by the screaming of brakes when he came up with the standing train at the end of the trestle one engineer leaning down from the rail of the cab said  i saw your light away back but was too busy trying to stop without smashing something to answer  say has the trestle caved in or what in the name of thunder is holding us up  the trestle is all right answered geoffrey climbing into the cab i held you up and im going on with you to bring out a doctor to my partner who is dangerously ill  the engineers comments were indignant and sulphurous while the big fireman turned back his shirt sleeves as if preparing to chastise the man rash enough to interfere with express freight traffic  geoffrey reaching for a shovel said  when we get there ill go with you to your superintendent at vancouver but if either of you try to put me off or to call assistance ill make good use of this  i tell you its a question of life and death and two at least of your directors are good friends of the man i want to help  they wouldnt thank you for destroying his last chance  meantime youre wasting precious moments  start the train  hold fast commanded the grizzled engineer opening the throttle when shes under way ill talk to you and unless you satisfy me by the time we reach vancouver there wont be much of you left for the police to take charge of  then the two locomotives started the long cars on their interocean race again     chapter xii  geoffrey tests his fate  it was a lowering afternoon in the fall when thurston and julius savine stood talking together upon a spraydrenched ledge in the depths of a british columbian cañon  on the crest of the smoothscarped hillside which stretched back from the sheer face of rock far overhead stood what looked like a tiny fretwork in ebony and consisted of twohundredfoot conifers  here and there a clamorous torrent had worn out a gully and with thurstons assistance savine had accomplished the descent of one of the less precipitous  elsewhere the rocks had been rubbed into smooth walls between which the river had fretted out its channel during countless ages  the water was coming down in a mad green flood for the higher snows had melted fast under the autumn sun and the clay beneath the glaciers had stained it foam licked the ledges a roaring white wake streamed behind each boulders ugly head and the whole gloomy cañon rang with the thunder of a rapid whose filmy stream whirled in the chilly breeze  savine gazed at the rapid and the whirlpool that fed it distinguishing the roar of scoring gravel and grind of broken rock from its vibratory booming and though he was a daring man his heart almost failed him  it looks ugly horribly ugly and i doubt if another man in the dominion would have suggested tackling the river here but you are right he admitted  human judgment has its limits and the constant bursts have proved that no dykes which wouldnt ruin me in the building could stand highwater pressure long  if you dont mind thurston well move farther from the edge  ive been a little shaky since that last attack  the climb down was awkward but you have looked better lately declared geoffrey and savine sighed  i guess my best days are done and that is one reason why i wish to end up with a big success he said  i got a plain warning from the vancouver doctor you brought me in that morning  you managed it smartly  i was lucky said thurston laughing  at first i expected to be ignominiously locked up after the engineer and fireman had torn my clothes off me  but we did not climb down here to talk of that  no and savine looked straight at his companion  this is a great scheme thurston the biggest i have ever undertaken  there will be room for scores of ranches herds of cattle wheat fields and orchards if we can put it throughand we have just got to put it through those confounded dykes have drained me heavily and theyll keep right on costing money  still even to me it looks almost beyond the power of mortal man to deepen the channel here  the risk will figure high in money but higher in human life  you feel quite certain you can do it  yes asserted geoffrey  i believe i canin winter when the frost binds the glaciers and the waters shrink  once it is done and the only hard rock barrier that holds the water up removed the river will scour its own way through the alluvial deposits  i have asked a long price but the work will be difficult  savine nodded  he knew that it would be a task almost fit for demigods or giants to cut down the bed of what was a furious torrent thick with grinding débris and scoring ice and that only very strong bold men could grapple with the angry waters amid blinding snow or under the bitter frost of the inland ranges in winter time  the price is not too heavy but i dont accept your terms savine said  hold on until i have finished and then begin your talking ill offer you a minor partnership in my business instead  take time and keep your answer until i explain things in my offices in case you find the terms onerous but there are many men in this country who would be glad of the chance youre getting  geoffrey stood up his lean brown face twitching  he walked twice along the slippery ledge and then halted before savine  i will accept them whatever they are on one condition which i hardly dare hope you will approve he replied  that is regarding the partnership for in any case holding to my first suggestion you can count on my best help down here  i dont forget that i owe you a heavy debt of gratitude sir though as you know i have had several good offers latterly  savine who had been abstractedly watching the mad rush of the stream looked up as he inquired  what is the condition  you seem unusually diffident today thurston  it is a great thing i am going to ask  geoffrey standing on the treacherous ledge above the thundering river scarcely looked like a suppliant as he put his fate to the test  it is your permission to ask miss savine to marry me when the time seems opportune  it would not be surprising if you laughed at me but even then i should only wait the more patiently  this is not a new ambition for one day when i first came a poor man into this country i set my heart upon it and working ever since to realize it i have so far at least as worldly prospects go lessened the distance between us  savine who betrayed no surprise was silent for a little while  then he answered quietly  i am according to popular opinion anything but a poor man and though those dykes have bled me such a match would as you suggest be unequal from a financial point of view unless helen marries against my wishes  then she should marry without a dollar  does that influence you  thurston spread out his hands with a contemptuous gesture which his quiet earnestness redeemed from being theatrical  for my own sake i should prefer it so  dollars  how far would anyone count dollars in comparison with miss savine  but i do not fear being able to earn all she needs  when the time seems opportune the inequality may be less  it is possible continued savine  one notices that the man who knows exactly what he wants and doesnt fool his time away over other things not infrequently gets it  you have not really surprised me nowand i want a straight answerwhy did you leave the old country  for several reasons  i lost my money mining  the lady whom i should have married according to arrangements made for us tired of me  it is a somewhat painful story but i was bound up in the mine and there were no doubt ample excuses for her  we were both of us almost too young to know our own minds when we fell in with our relatives wishes and though i hardly care to say so it was perhaps well we found out our mistake in time  all said savine  were there no openings for a live man in the old country and have you told me all  i could not find any place for a man in my position geoffrey let the words fall slowly  i come of a reckless hardliving family and i feared that some of their failings might repeat themselves in me  i had my warnings  had i stayed over there a disappointed man they might have mastered me and so when there was nothing to keep me i turned my backand ran  out here any man who hungers for it can find quite sufficient healthful excitement for his needs and excitement is as wine to me  these i know seem very curious qualifications for a soninlaw but it seemed just to tell you  need i explain further  no answered savine whose face had grown serious  thanks for your honesty  i guess i know the weaknesses you meanthe greatest of them is whiskey  ive had scores of brilliant men it has driven out from europe to shovel dirt for me  its not good news thurston  how long have you made head against your inherited failings  since i could understand things clearly was the steady answer  i feared only what might happen and would never have spoken had i not felt that this country had helped me to break the entail and set me free  you know all sir and to my disadvantage i have put it before you tersely but there is another aspect  thurstons tone carried conviction with it but savine cut him short it is the practical aspect that appeals to me he said  he stared down at the river for several minutes before he asked  have you any reason to believe that helen reciprocates the attachment  no  geoffreys face fell  once or twice i ventured almost to hope so more often i feared the opposite  all i ask is the right to wait until the time seems ripe and know that i shall have your good will if it ever does  i could accept no further benefits from your hands until i had told you  you have it now savine declared very gravely  as you know my life is uncertain and i believe you faithful and strong enough to take care of helen  after all what more could i look for  still if she does not like you there will be an end of the matter  it may be many would blame me for yielding but i believe i could trust you thurstonand there are things they do not know  savine sighed after the last words  his face clouded  then he added abruptly speak when it suits you thurston and good luck to you there are reasons besides the fact that im an old man why i should envy you  had geoffrey been less exultant he might have noticed something curious in savines expression but he was too full of his hearts desire to be conscious of more than the one allimportant fact that helens father wished him well  it was in a mood of high hopefulness he assisted mr savine during the arduous scramble up out of the cañon  later his elation was diminished by the recollection that he had yet to win the good will of miss savine                                  some time had passed after the interview in the cañon when one afternoon geoffrey walked out on the veranda at high maples in search of helen savine  it was winter time but the climate near the southwestern coast is mild  high maples was sheltered and the sun was faintly warm  there were a few hardy flowers in the borders fringing the smooth green lawn a striking contrast to the snowsheeted pines of the icebound wilderness in which thurston toiled  helen was not on the veranda and not knowing where to search further the young man sank somewhat heavily into a chair  geoffrey had ridden all night through powdery snowdrifts which rose at times to the stirrup and at others so high that his horse could scarcely flounder through them  he had made out lists of necessary stores as the jolting train sped on to vancouver and had been busy every moment until it was time to start for high maples  though he would have had it otherwise he dare not neglect one item when time was very precious  he had not spared himself much leisure for either food or sleep of late for by the short northern daylight and flame of the roaring lucigen through the long black nights he and his company of carefully picked men had fought stubbornly with the icy river  the suns rays grew brighter there was still no sign of helen  tired in mind and body geoffrey sat still lost in a reverie  he had left the camp in a state of nervous suspense but overtaxed nature had conquered and now he waited not less anxious than he had been but with a physical languidness due to the reaction  when helen savine finally came out softly through a long window geoffrey did not at first see her and she had time to cast more than a passing glance at him as he sat with head resting gratefully on the back of the basket chair  his face deeply tanned by the snow had grown once more worn and thin  there were lines upon the forehead and wrinkles about his eyes one bronzed hand lay above the other on his knee as the complement of a pose that suggested the exhaustion of overfatigue  the sight roused her pity and she felt unusually sympathetic towards the tired man  then geoffrey started and rose quickly  helen noticed how he seemed to fling off his weariness as he came towards her hat in hand  i have made a hurried journey to see you miss savine he said  i have something to tell you something concerning which i cannot keep silence any longer  if i am abrupt you will forgive me but will you listen a few moments and then answer me a question  the mans tone was humble if his eyes were eager and helen who was sensible of a tremor of emotion leaned against the rails of the veranda  the winter sunlight shone full upon her and either that or the cold breeze that she had met on the headland accounted for the color in her cheeks  she made a dainty picture in her fur cap and closefitting jacket whose rich fur trimming set off the curves of a shapely figure  the mans longing must have shown itself in his eyes for helen suddenly turned her glance away from him  again she felt a curious thrill almost of pleasure and wondered at it  if she had guessed his meaning correctly she would have felt merely sorry for him and yet there was no mistaking an indefinite sense of satisfaction  do you remember what i once told you at grahams ranch he asked  i was a needy adventurer then and guilty of horrible presumption but though the words came without my definite will i meant every one of them  i knew there could be only one woman in the world for me and i solemnly determined to win her  it seemed madnessi was a poor unknown manbut the thought of you drove me resistlessly on until at last the gulf between us has been narrowed and may be narrower still that is i have striven to lessen it in the one way i canin all others without your help it must remain impassable  heaven knows how far i am beneath you and the daring hope has but one excusei love you and shall always do so  is what i hope for quite impossible  while helen would have told herself ten minutes earlier that she almost disliked the pleader she was conscious of a new emotion  she had regarded other suitors with something like contempt but it was not so with thurston  even if he occasionally repelled her it was impossible to despise him  i am sorry she said slowly  sorry that you should have told me this because i can only answer that it is impossible  geoffrey evinced no great surprise  his face became stern instead of expectant his toilhardened frame was more erect as he answered with unusual gentleness  i have endeavored to prepare myself for your reply  how could i hope to win youas it were for the askingeasily  still though i am painfully conscious of many possible reasons may i venture to ask why it is impossible miss savine  helen answered i am sorry it is sobut why should i pain you  can you not take my answer without the reasons  no not if you will give them persisted geoffrey  i have grown accustomed to unpleasant things and it is to be hoped there is truth in the belief that they are good for one  the truth from your lips would hurt me less  will you not tell me  i will try if you demand it  helen who could not help noticing how unflinchingly he had received what was really a needlessly cold rebuff hoped she was lucid as she began  i have a respect for you mr thurston buthow shall i express italso a shrinking  youplease remember you insistedseem so hard and overbearing and while power is a desirable attribute in a man  but will you force me to go on  i beg you to go on said geoffrey with a certain grimness  in spite of a popular fallacy i could not esteem aa husband i was afraid of  a man should be gentle pitiful and considerate to all women  without mutual forbearance there could be no true companionshipand  you are right  geoffreys voice was humble without bitterness  i have lived a hard life and perhaps it has made me compared with your standard brutal  still i would ask again are these all your reasons  is the other difference between us too greatthe distance dividing the man you gave the dollar to from the daughter of julius savine  no answered helen  that difference is after all imaginary  we do not think over here quite as you do in england and if we did are you not a thurston of crosbie  but please believe that i am sorry andyou insisted on the explanationforgive me if i have said too much  there is a long future before youand men change their minds  geoffreys face darkened and helen who regretted the last hasty words which escaped her without reflection watched him intently until he said  musker must have told you about something in my life  but i was not inconstant though the fault was doubtless mine  that is a story which cannot be mentioned again miss savine  i had never meant to refer to it helen apologized with some confusion but since you have mistaken me i must add that another friend of yoursa ladygave me a version that bore truth stamped upon the face of it  one could imagine that you would not take kindly to the fate others arranged for you  but how do you know you are not repeating the same mistake  the fancy which deceived you then may do the same again  how do i know geoffreys voice rang convincingly as he turned upon the questioner stretched out an arm towards her and then dropped it swiftly  i know what love is now because you have taught me listen miss savine i am as the almighty made me a plainand sometimes an illtempered man who would gladly lay down his life to save you sorrow but if what you say divides us is all there is then as long as you remain helen savine i shall cling fast to my purpose and strive to prove myself worthy  again you were righthow could you be otherwisebut i shall yet convince you that you need not shrink from me  it would be wiser to take a definite no for answer said helen why should this fancy spoil your life for you  you cannot take all hope from me geoffrey declared  would you suspect me of exaggerated sentiment if i said my life has been yours for a long time and is yours now for it is true  i will go back to the work that is best for me merely adding that if ever there is either trouble or adversity in which i can aid youthough god forbid for your sake that should ever be soyou have only to send for me  i can at least sincerely wish you success in your great undertaking helen offered him her hand and was conscious of a faint disappointment when barely touching it he turned hurriedly away she watched him cross the lawn towards the stables and then waited until a rapid thud of hoofs broke the silence of the woods  gone and i let him carry that hope away she said still looking towards the forest with troubled eyes  yesterday i could never have done so but yesterday he was gone and now  helen did not finish her sentence but as the beat of hoofs died away glanced at the hand which for a moment had rested in geoffreys  what has happened to me and is he learning quickly or growing strangely timid she asked herself  thurston almost rode over julius savine near the railroad depot and reined in his horse to say  i have my answer sir but do not feel beaten yet  some unholy luck insists that all my affairs must be mixed with my daily business and because of what was said in the cañon i must ask you now of all times to let me hold the option of that partnership or acceptance of the offer i made you until we vanquish the river  he went off at a gallop as the cars rolled in leaving savine smiling dryly as he looked after him     chapter xiii  a test of loyalty  it was during a brief respite from his task which had been suspended waiting the arrival of certain tools and material that thurston accompanied savine and helen to a semipublic gathering at the house of a man who was a power in the mountain province just outside vancouver politicians landspeculators railroad and shipping magnates were present with their wives and daughters and most of them had a word for savine or a glance of admiration for helen  savine moved among guests chatting with the brilliancy which occasionally characterized him and always puzzled thurston  thurston was rarely troubled by petty jealousies but the homage all men paid to helen awoke an unpleasant apprehension within him  he did not know many of the men and women who laughed and talked in animated groups and at length found himself seated alone in a quiet corner the ground floor of the rambling house consisted of various rooms some of which opened with archways into one another  he could see into the one most crowded where helen formed the center of an admiring circle there was no doubt that miss savine owed much to the race from which she sprang on her mothers side  dark beauty grace of movement and when she chose to indulge in it vivacious speech all betokened a latin extraction while the slight haughtiness which thurston thought wonderfully became her was the dowry of a line of autocratic landowners  that she was pleasant to look upon was proved by the convincing testimony of other mens admiration as well as by his own senses  now when the distance between them was in some respects diminishing she seemed even further away from him  in her presence he felt himself a plain unpolished man and knew he would never shine in the light play of wit and satire which characterized the society for which she was fitted  he decided also that she had probably remained unmarried because she could find no one who came up to her standard and feared that he himself would come very far beneath it  it appeared doubtful that he could ever acquire the gentler virtues helen had described  nevertheless his face grew set as he determined that he could prove his loyalty in the manner that best suited himby serving her father faithfully  a capitalist for whom geoffrey had undertaken several commissions halted before him  hello  quite alone thurston and worrying over something as usual he began with western brusqueness  what has gone wrong  have more of your dams burst up yonder  one would fancy that floundering around through the ice and snow up there would be more congenial than these frivolities  im not great on them either but its a matter of dollars and cents with me  you perhaps know a little about this selfmadethats your british term i thinkcompany  not so much as you do answered geoffrey  still i have been wondering how some of the men earned their money  i understand that they have sense enough to be proud of their small beginnings but they do not furnish instructive details as to the precise manner in which they achieved their success  the capitalist who was one of the class described laughed goodhumoredly as he seated himself beside thurston  well how are you getting on up in the valley he inquired and geoffreys eyes expressed faint amusement as he answered  as well as we expected and if we had our difficulties you would hardly expect me to tell them to a director of the industrial enterprise company  perhaps not the capitalist smiled for the industrial enterprise was the corporation which had opposed savines reclamation scheme anyway the company is a speculation with me my colleagues manage it without much of my assistance  but say whats the matter with your respected chief  he has come right out of his shell tonight  the speaker glanced towards savine who was surrounded by a group of wellknown men  i tell you thurston theres something uncanny about that man of late he continued  however knowing theres no use trying to fool you ill give you a fair warning and come straight to something i may as well say now as later  savine will go down like a house of cards some day and those who lean upon him will find it in our language frosty weather  now suppose we made you a fair offer would you join us  a curt refusal trembled upon geoffreys lips when he reflected that as soon as the work was finished his relations with savine would be drawn closer still  in the meantime it was not advisable to give any hint to a possible enemy  i couldnt say until i heard what the offer is he answered cautiously  youre a typical coldblooded britisher asserted the other man  i dont know either  i leave all details to the members of the company but weve a secretary who understands all about it in this house tonight  were half of us here on business directly or indirectly and not for pleasure so its possible he may talk to you  but i see our hostess eying us and its time we walked along  they moved forward together and the woman whom they approached beckoning geoffrey whom she had for some reason taken under her patronage said  theres a countrywoman of yours present who doesnt know many of our people yet  i should like to present you to her  she comes i understand from the same wilds which sheltered you  mrs leslie this is a special protégé of mine mr thurston who could give you all information about the mountains in which your husband talks of banishing you  a handsome tastefullydressed woman turned more fully towards them and for a moment geoffrey stood still in blank astonishment  the average man would find it disconcerting to be brought without warning suddenly face to face in a strange country with a woman who had discarded him and thurston showed slight embarrassment  mrs henry leslie  but you evidently know each other exclaimed the hostess whose quick eyes had noticed his startled expression  millicent had changed since the last time geoffrey saw her  she had lost her fresh cream and rose prettiness but had gained something in place of it and though her pale blue eyes were too deeply sunk her face had acquired strength and dignity  she was as he had always found her perfectly selfpossessed  with a quick glance which expressed appeal and warning she said  we are not quite strangers  i knew mr thurston in england  the young englishman and his countrywoman moved away together and geoffrey presently found himself standing in a broad corridor with millicents hand upon his arm  through a long window which opened into a balcony the clear moonlight shone  a wide vista of forest and sparkling sea lured them out of doors  a breath of fresh air would be delightful  it would be quiet out there and i expect you have much to tell me  it was millicent who spoke with quiet composure and her companion wondered at his own lack of feeling  after the first shock of the surprise he was sensible of no particular indignation or emotion  it seemed as if any tenderness that he had once felt for her had long since disappeared  there was little that he cared to tell her but prompted by some impulse which may have been mere curiosity he drew the window open and they passed out upon the balcony  this reminds one of other days said the woman with a sigh  had i known you were here i should have dreaded to meet you but it is very pleasant to see you again  you have surely altered geoffrey  i should hardly have expected to find you so friendly  i am not in the least inclined to reproach you for the past was the sober answer  geoffrey was distinctly perplexed for he had acquired a clearer perception of millicents character since he left england and now he felt almost indignant with himself for wondering what she wanted  glancing at her face he was conscious of a certain pity as well as a vague distrust for it was evident that her life had not been altogether smooth or her health really robust  but the fact that she should recall the faroff days in england jarred upon him  it is a relief to learn that you are not angry at least  what are you doing over here geoffrey she asked  reclaiming a valley from a river  living up among the mountains in the snow was the answer  and you like it  you can find happiness in the hard life  better than anything i ever undertook before  happiness is a somewhat indefinite term and perhaps because i have seldom found leisure to consider whether i am happy or not the presumption is that i am at least contented  millicent sighed and her face grew sad while thurston rebelled against an instinctive conviction that she knew a wistful expression was becoming to her and was calculated to appeal to a male observer  one could envy you she said softly and geoffrey rising superior to all critical thoughts felt only sincere pity  have you not been happy incanada millicent he inquired and if the woman noticed how nearly he had avoided a blunder which is distinctly probable she at least made no sign  i cant resist the temptation to answer you frankly geoffrey she replied  i have had severe trials and some i fear have left their mark on me  there are experiences after which one is never quite the same  you heard of the financial disaster which overtook us  yes black days followed it but mr leslie has hopes of succeeding in this country and that will brighten the futureindirectly evenfor me  ah  geoffrey spoke with a peculiar inflection of the voice for though he could forgive the woman now he could not forget his resentment towards the man who had supplanted him  for your sake i hope he will  millicent glanced at him sideways and as if anxious to change the subject asked  is it the orchard valley you are endeavoring to reclaim  yes  i might have guessed it  i have heard people say that the scheme of mr savine if that is his name is impracticable  it is characteristic of you geoffrey to play out a losing game but with ones future at stake is it wise  i do not know that i was ever particularly remarkable for wisdom geoffrey answered with a shake of the head  the scheme in question is however by no means so impracticable as some persons imagine it to be  then you still hope for success  have you not failed in one or two of your efforts  millicents voice was politely indifferent but a certain keenness in her eyes which did not escape geoffreys notice betrayed more than a casual interest  thurston afterwards decided that the shock of the unexpected meeting had the effect of rendering his perceptions unusually quick  i have not been often successful he admitted with a laugh but my employer is as you may have heard a sanguine person and has not hitherto been beaten  i hope he will not be in this instance said millicent and it occurred to geoffrey that she was concealing a sense of disappointment they talked a little longer and then she remarked i am afraid we have been shamefully neglecting our social duties but as we shall in all probability meet now and then i hopein spite of all that has happenedit will be as good friends  again the man felt that the meeting had not been brought about wholly by accident but he bent his head as he answered  if ever you should need a friend you can for the sake of old times count on me  one of the finest views in the province said a voice behind them we are proud of the prospect from this balcony  if you stand here miss helen you can enjoy it and tell me if you have anything better at high maples  most romantic spot on such a night for a quiet chat and if i was only twenty years younger my dear young lady  then the speaker evidently retired with some precipitation from the window as he added no never mind drawing the curtain savine  if she is not over tired i can show your daughter something interesting in the conservatory instead  romantic spot occupied already  the laugh which accompanied the sound of retreating footsteps and the rustle of drapery was unmistakably that of julius savine  geoffrey who fumed inwardly at the reflection that his attitude was distinctly liable to misconception straightened himself with perhaps too great a suddenness while the faint amusement in his companions face heightened his displeasure  millicent had managed to obtain a survey of the intruders and when sure that they had moved away she rose saying so that is the beautiful miss savine  no doubt you have seen her and like all the rest admire her  yes confessed geoffrey  i can honestly say i do  millicent regarded him curiously  you have heard that we women seldom praise one another and therefore while admitting that she is coldly handsome i should imagine miss savine to be a trying person she commented  now we must return to our social dutiesin my case at least no one could call them pleasures  some little time later helen whose eyes had kindled for a moment when her grayhaired escort led her towards the balcony heard the bluff canadian answer the question that had been in her mind  who was the lady  cant exactly say  her husbands leslie the britisher who started the landagency offices you will remember there was trouble about and is now i believe secretary to the industrial enterprise  frankly i dont like the manstrikes me as a smart adventurer and my wife does not take to mrs leslie  the man on the balcony was thurston savines assistant and a good fellow  he generally follows humbly in miss savines train and considering leslies connection with the rival company i dont quite see what he could be doing in that gallery  helen was piqued  she was too proud to admit to herself that she was jealous but she had not risen superior to all the characteristics of her sex and knowing something of her fathers business affairs she was also puzzled  thurstons attitude towards his companion had not been that of a casual acquaintance to say the least and helen could not help wondering what could be his connection with the wife of one whose interests she gathered must be diametrically opposed to her fathers  then though endeavoring to decide that it did not matter she determined to put thurston to the test at the first opportunity  meantime geoffrey stood alone for a few minutes looking out into the moonlit night  i am growing brutally suspicious and poor millicent has sufferedshe cant well hide it he told himself  well we were fond of each other once and whether its her husband or adversity whenever i can help her i must try to do so  it was the revolt of an open nature against the evidence of his senses but even while geoffrey framed this resolution something seemed to whisper was she ever fond of you  there is that in the womans voice which does not ring true  he had hardly turned back to rejoin the other members of his party when a business acquaintance met him  i want you to spare a few minutes for a countryman who has been inquiring about you said the man  mr leslie this is mr thurstonthe secretary of the industrial enterprise  the business acquaintance withdrew and geoffreys lips set tight as he turned towards leslie who betrayed a certain uneasiness in spite of his nonchalant manner  he was a darkhaired man with a pale face which had grown more heavy and sensual than it was as geoffrey remembered it  i dont know whether i should say this is a pleasure leslie remarked lightly  there is no use disguising the fact that we last met under somewhat unfortunate circumstances but i give you my word that it was too late to suggest that my employers should choose another emissary when i discovered your identity  where commercial interests are concerned surely we can both rise superior to mere sentiment  there are things which it is uncommonly hard to forget geoffrey replied coldly  the question is however  what do you want with me  he meant his tone and pose to be anything but conciliatory  i want the favor of a business interview before you return said leslie trying to hide his discomfiture and geoffrey answered  that is hardly possible  i return early tomorrow  can you drive over to my quarters now  no  i desire to see my chief before i go  it is confoundedly unfortunate leslie commented apparently glad of some excuse for expressing his disgust  well perhaps nobody will disturb us for a few minutes in yonder corridor  you can regard me as a servant of the industrial enterprise  will you listen to what i have to say  im ready to listen to the great companys secretary said geoffrey with a bluntness under which the other winced as he turned towards the corridor  ill be brief began leslie  the fact is that we want a capable man accustomed to the planning and construction of irrigation works and two of our directors rather fancy you  the right man would have full control of practical operations and i have a tolerably free hand in respect to financial conditions  the main thing we wish to discover is are you willing to consider an offer of the position  it was on the surface a simple business proposition but thurstons nostrils dilated and his brows contracted for he guessed what lay behind it  ive heard savine is a liberal man continued leslie who mistook thurstons hesitation  still considering your valuable experience in the orchard valley i have power to outbid him  you certainly will not lose financially by throwing in your lot with us  then thurstons anger mastered him and he flung prudence to the winds  your employers have chosen a worthy messenger he declared so fiercely that leslie recoiled  did you suppose that i would sell my benefactor for that is what it amounts to  confusion to you and the rogues behind you  theres another score between us and i feel greatly tempted to  he looked ready to yield to the unmentioned temptation  leslie glancing around anxiously backed away from him but restrained himself with an effort  thurston stood panting with rage  there was a sound of approaching footsteps and the secretary slipped away leaving the irate engineer face to face with an amused elderly gentleman and helen savine  geoffrey did not know how much or how little they had seen helen beckoned to him  my father has looked tired during the last hour she said aside  i have been warned that excitement may prove dangerous but hardly care to remind him of it  would you as a favor to me persuade him to return home with you  there was no doubt of thurstons devotion for helen had eyes to see and she sighed a little but contentedly when he hurried away nevertheless she was still perplexed for she had seen mrs leslie looking at him pleadingly and now mr leslie shrank away from him mrs leslie was certainly attractive and yet helen thought that she knew thurstons character  geoffrey found savine who appeared to have suddenly collapsed as if the fire of brilliancy had burned itself out  with more tact than he usually possessed thurston persuaded the older man to take his leave  as they all stood on the broad wooden steps helen stretched out her hand to thurston  thank you geoffrey she said softly  believe me i am grateful  standing bareheaded beside a pillar thurston looked after them as they drove away  it was the first time helen had called him geoffrey and he fancied that he had seen even more than kindness in her eyes  and it is her father whom they tempted me to betray  damn them he growled  the only honest man among them included me among those who lean upon savine  savine will need a stay himself presently and one at least will not fail him  ah againwhat the devil are you wanting  the last words were spoken clearly but leslie to whom they were addressed smiled malevolently  it would pay you to be civil he threatened  i have no particular reason to love you and might prove a troublesome enemy  however because my financial interests which are bound up with my employers come first i warn you that you are foolish to hold on to an associate who has strong men against him a speculator whose best days are over ill give you time to cool down and think over my suggestion  you and i can have no dealings declared geoffrey  whats done cannot be undonebut keep clear of me  as sure as theres a justice which will bring you to book even without my help well crush you if you get in savines way or mine  i think this is hardly becoming to either of us and the next time the company wants your views it can send another envoy asserted leslie  in the expressive western idiom it would save trouble if you keep on thinking in just that way geoffrey rejoined  the two men parted leslie to go back to where millicent was holding a group of men interested by her forced gayety and geoffrey to walk slowly out into the moonlight where he could think of helen and wonder how confidently he might hope to win her love     chapter xiv  the work of an enemy  it was a bitter morning when a weary man sprinkled white with powdery snow came limping into thurstons camp which was then pitched in the cañon  a pitiless wind swept down from the range side across the thrashing pines and filled the deep rift with its shrill moaning which sounded above the diapason of the shrunken river  a haze of frostdried snow infinitesimally fine which stung the unprotected skin like the prick of hot needles whirled before the wind and then thinned leaving bare the higher shoulders of the hills though a rush of dingy vapor hid the iceribbed peaks above  the cañon was a scene of appalling desolation but few of the longbooted men who hurried among the boulders had leisure to contemplate it  the men were working for geoffrey thurston who did not encourage idleness  so the stranger came almost unnoticed into the center of the camp where thurston saw him and asked sharply where do you come from and what do you want  im a framecarpenter answered the new arrival  got fired from the hastings sawmill when work slacked down  couldnt find anybody who wanted me at vancouver so i struck out for the mountains and mines found worse luck up here spent all my money and wore my clothes out but the boss of the orchard mill who took me for a few days said i might tell you he recommended me  im about played out with getting here and im mighty hungry  geoffrey looked the man over and decided there was truth in the latter part of his story  take this spanner and wade across to the reef yonder he said  you can begin by giving aid to those men who are bolting the beams down  the stranger glanced dubiously at the rush of icy water thick with jagged cakes of frozen snow then at his dilapidated foot gear and hesitated  im not great at swimming  it looks deep he objected  you can walk i suppose geoffrey answered  if you do it wont drown you  the man prepared to obey  he had reached the edge of the water when geoffrey called him  i see youre willing and ill take you for a few weeks any way he said  in the meantime a rest wouldnt do you much harm and the cook might find you something to keep you from starving until supper if you asked him civilly  thanks the man answered with a curious expression in his face  i am a bit used up and i guess ill see the cook  work proceeded until the winters dusk fell when a bountiful supper was served  the stranger who did full justice to the meal showed himself a capable hand when work was resumed under the flaring light of several huge lamps  that night two of his new comrades sat in the cookshed discussing the stranger  one was james gillow whom geoffrey had first employed at helens suggestion and now replaced the man he formerly assisted  he was apparently without ambition and chiefly remarkable for an antipathy to physical effort  although he had a good education he found that cooking suited him  he sat upon an overturned bucket discoursing whimsically while mattawa tom who acted as thurstons foreman peeled potatoes for him  the cookshanty was warm and snug and gillow made those to whom he granted the right of entry work for the privilege  strikes me as queer said the big axeman with a grin when the cook halted to refill his pipe  strikes me as queer it does that some of you fellows who know so much kin do so little  knowledge aint worth a cent unless youve got the rustle  now theres the boss  you talk the same talk an he cant well know more than you seem to do but look where he is while you stop right down at the bottom running a cookshanty  guess you were born tired english jim  i dare say youre right answered gillow  other folks in the old country have said the same thing though they didnt put it so neatly the fact is some men like thurston are born to wear themselves out trying to manage things while i was intended for philosophic contemplation  hes occasionally hard to get on with but since i came here im willing to acknowledge that men of his species are useful and i have struck harder masters in this great dominion  mattawa tom laughed hoarsely as he responded i should say  you found him hard the day you ran black lines all over his drawings and nearly burnt his shanty up trying to prove he didnt know his business when you was brimfull of red pine whiskey  it was poison said gillow with unruffled good humor  several bottles of genuine whiskey would not confuse me but i have sworn off since the day you mention partly to oblige thurston who seemed to desire it and because i cant get any decent liquor  but what do you think of our latest acquisition  he kin work which is more than you could before the boss taught you was the dry answer  but theres something odd about him  you saw the outfit he came in with  couldnt have swapped it with a siwash indianwell the man has better clothes than you or i on underneath and if he was so blame hard up what did he offer jake five dollars for his old gum boots for  afraid of wetting his feet  most sensible person considering the weather remarked gillow indifferently  fraid of wetting his feet  this is just where horse sense beats knowledge  that fellow is scared of nothing around this camp  hasnt it struck you the boss is going to put through a big contract in a way thats not been tried before and that there are some folks who would put up a good many dollars to see him let down nicely  well gillow questioned with a show of interest and the foreman nodded sagaciously as he answered  whoever busts the boss up will have to get both feet on the neck of mattawa tom first and thats not going to be easy  ill keep my eyes right on to that fellow  tom went out and gillow awakening at midnight saw that his blankets were still empty  the same thing happened several times and it was well for thurston that he had the true leaders gift of inspiring his followers with loyalty for one night a week later the foreman who had kept his own counsel shook gillow out of his slumber  the sleepy man who groped for a boot to fling at the disturber of his peace abandoned the benevolent intention when he saw his comrades face under the hanging lamp  dont ask no fool questions but get your things on and come with me tom commanded  five minutes later gillow shivering and reluctant turned out into the frost  it was a bitter night and his breath froze upon his mustache the snow and froth of the river glimmered spectrally and when they had left the camp some distance behind there was light enough to see a black figure crawl up a ladder leading to a wire rope stretched tight in midair above the torrent  a trolley hung beneath it by means of which men and material were hauled across the chasm  get down here whispered tom  well watch him  if we should fall over any more of these blame rocks hed see us certain  gillow was glad to obey for though there was faint moonlight he had already cut one knee cruelly  it was bitterly cold beneath the boulder where he crouched in the snow and when the black object which worked its way along the bending cable had disappeared in the gloom of overhanging rocks on the opposite shore there was nothing to see but the tossing spray of the river  the stream was still a formidable torrent though now that the feeding snows were frozen fast it was shrunken far below its summer level  a good many minutes had passed with painful slowness when gillow who regretted that he had left the snug cookshed said  this is distinctly monotonous and its about time we struck back to camp  guess that fellow has tackled too much red pine whiskey and is just walking round to cool himself  in answer the foreman grasped the speakers shoulder and stretched out a pointing hand  the moonlight touched one angle of the rock upon the opposite shore which encroached upon the frothing water and the dark figure showed sharply against it  the figure vanished reappeared and sank from sight again  when this had happened several times gillow remarked perhaps we had better go over  the mans clean gone mad  no sir objected mattawa tom  no more mad than you  see what hes after  no  you dont remember either how mighty hard it was to wedge in the holdfasts for the chain guys stiffening the front of the dam or how the keys work loose  there wouldnt be much of the boring machines or dam framing left if the chains pulled those wedges out catch on to the idee  gillow gasped  the huge timber framing which held back the river so that the costly boring machines could work upon the reef cumbering part of its bed had been built only with the greatest difficulty and when finished thurston had found it necessary to strengthen it by heavy chains made fast in the rock above  the sockets to which these were secured had been wedged into deepsunk holes but more than once some of the hard wood keys had worked loose and gillow could guess what would happen if many were partially set free at the same time  if he hammered three or four of those wedges clear it would only need a bang on another one to give the river its way gillow said excitedly  then it would take thurston six months to fix up the damage if he ever did and nobody would know how it happened  the coldblooded brutes in the maintenance gang  just so  a blame smart man too asserted mattawa tom  i guess the boss wouldnt want everybody to know  rustle back your hardest and bring him along  fifteen minutes later thurston took his place behind the boulder and because the light was clearer now he could dimly see the man swinging a heavy hammer against the rock  he knew that the miscreant whose business was to prevent the possibility of such accidents need only start a few more keys which he would probably do when the dam was clear of men and many thousand dollars worth of property and the result of months of labor would be swallowed by the river  his face paled with fierce anger when he recognized this fact  i want that man he declared with shut teeth  i want him so badly that id forfeit five hundred dollars sooner than miss him  slip forward gillow as much out of sight as you can and hide yourself on the other side of the ladder  mattawa and i will wait for him here and among us three we ought to make sure of him  gillow who stole forward stooping swore softly as he fell over many obstacles on the way  the man they wanted became visible ascending another ladder across the river  then hanging in the suspended trolley he moved a black shape clear against the snowalong the wire which stretched high across the gulf  while the others watched him his progress grew slower on reaching the hollow where the cable bent slightly under the weight at its center  suddenly the cars progress was checked altogether and it began to move in the opposite direction more rapidly than before while thurston sprang to his feet  slack the setting up tackles gillow  hurry for your life he shouted  hell cast the cable loose and be off by the indian trail into the ranges if he once gets across  gillow ran his best where running of any kind was barely possible even by daylight  he knew that his master was slow to forgive those whose carelessness thwarted any plan and that while taking the easier way over instead of crawling round a ledge he had probably alarmed the fugitive  he reached the foot of the ladder  climbing up in a desperate hurry he cast loose the end of the tackle by means of which the cable was set up taut but neglected in his haste to take a turn with the hemp rope about a post which would have eased him of most of the strain  got him safe cried tom from mattawa scrambling to the top of the boulder as the curve of the wire rope high above their heads increased  in spite of the fugitives efforts the trolley from which he was suspended ran back to the slackest part of the loop that sagged down nearer the river  thurston who watched him nodded with a sense of savage satisfaction  he did not for a moment believe that of his own initiative any workman would have made a long journey or would have run considerable personal risk to do him an injury  that was why he was so anxious to secure the offender  the curve grew rapidly deeper until the rope stretched into two diagonals between its fastenings on either shore  then the trolley descended with a run towards the river and geoffrey ran forward shouting the weights too much for gillow  bring along the coil of line from the tool locker tom  hurry i dont want to drown the rascal  what had happened was simple  the cook endeavoring to take a turn of the line too late had failed and the hemp ran through his halffrozen fingers chafing the skin from them  seeing thurston floundering in his direction over the boulders he valiantly strove to check it regardless of the pain until it was whipped clear of his slackening grasp and the trolley rushed downwards towards the torrent  thurston was abreast of it before it splashed in and had just time to see its occupant still clutching the rope drawn under by the sinking wire before he plunged recklessly into the foam  the water was horribly cold and the first shock left him gasping and almost paralyzed  the stream was running fast and rebounding in white foam from great stones and uneven ledges below  but the distance was short and thurston was a strong swimmer so almost before the man had risen he was within a few yards of the struggling figure  hardly had geoffrey clutched the man before mattawa tom who had meantime run down stream whirling a coil of line loosed it and the folds well directed shot through the air towards geoffrey uncoiling as they came  by good fortune thurston was able to seize the end and to pass it around them both whenfor gillow had by this time joined his companionthe two men blundered backwards up the contracted beach and thurston and the fugitive were drawn shorewards together until their feet struck bottom  breathless and dripping they staggered out and because geoffrey still clutched the strangers jacket the man said  mightily obliged to you  but you can let up now theres no more swimming  i couldnt run very far if it was worth while trying to  you neednt trouble to thank me was the answer  it wasnt because i thought the world would miss you that i went into the water but i cant expect much sense from a halfdrowned man  do you think the rest of the boys have heard us tom  the foreman glanced towards the tents clustered in the mouth of a ravine above and seeing no sign of life there shook his head whereupon geoffrey directed  take him quietly to the cookshed and give him some whiskey  ive no doubt that in spite of my orders you have some  lend him dry clothes and bring him along to my shanty as soon as hes ready  meantime rouse the maintenance foreman and if any wedges have worked loose let him drive them home  youre a nice man commented mattawa tom surveying the stranger disgustedly as the man stood with the water draining from him in the cookshed  here get into these things and keep them as a present  i wouldnt like the feel of them after theyd been on to you  thats all right was the cool answer  i expect the games up and im quite ready to buy them of you  by the way partner you helped your boss to pull me out didnt you  as i said before im not great on swimming  im almost sorry i had to said mattawa tom who was a loyal partisan  but dont call me partner or therell be trouble  the stranger laughed as after a glass of hot liquor he arrayed himself beside the bankedup stove and presently marched under escort towards thurstons wood and bark winter dwelling  mattawa tom followed close behind him with a big ax on his shoulder  i might be a panther youd corralled  how do you know i havent a pistol in my pocket if it was any use turning ugly the prisoner inquired  im quite certain about you because your pistol is in my pocket was the dry answer and tom chuckled  you werent quite smart enough when you slipped off your jacket  from the door of his shanty thurston called them and mattawa thrusting his prisoner in proceeded to mount guard close outside until thurston reappeared to ask angrily  what are you doing there  i figured you might want me sir  that mans not to be trusted answered tom and thurston laughed as he said  go back see that the maintenance man has made a good job of the wedges and if any of the boys should ask questions youll tell themnothing geoffrey commanded  you dont suppose ive suddenly grown helpless do you  mattawa tom withdrew with much reluctance and it was long before any person knew exactly what geoffrey and the stranger said to each other though gillow informed his comrade that the captured man said to him by way of explanation before sleeping  your boss is considerably too smart a man for me to bluff and ive kind of decided to help him  shouldnt wonder if he didnt beat my last one who would have seen me roasted before hed have gone into a river for me  im not fond of being left out in the rain with the losing side either see  its not my tip to talk too much and i guess thats about good enough for you  youre going to help him commented gillow ironically  all things considered thats very kind of you  next morning thurston who summoned the cook and foreman before him said i want you two to keep what happened last night a close secret and while i cannot tell you much i may say that the man who will remain in camp was as you have no doubt guessed only the cats paw of several speculators whom it wouldnt suit to see our employer savine successful  but mightnt he try the same game again asked mattawa and thurston answered  he might but i hardly think he will  i intend to keep him here under my own eyes until i want him  theres no particular reason why you shouldnt see that he earns his wages tom  gillow its perhaps not wholly unfortunate you dropped him into the river  kind of trump ace up your sleeve suggested mattawa and his master answered with a smile  not exactly  the other side is quite smart enough to know who holds the aces but i fancy the complete disappearance of this fewspot card will puzzle them  now forget all about it  i wouldnt have said so much but that i know i can trust you two     chapter xv  a great undertaking  except for the wail of a wet breeze from the pacific and the moaning of the pines outside there was unusual quietness in the woodbuilt villa looking down upon the valley of the hundred springs on the night that the american specialist came up to consult with savines doctor from vancouver  the master of high maples had been brought home unconscious some days earlier and had lain for hours apparently on the point of death  during this time it was thurston who took control of the panicstricken household  it was he who telegraphed thomas savine to bring his wife  he had sent for the famous american physician and had allayed helens fears  when the girls aunt arrived he had prevented that lady from undertaking the cure of the patient by her own prescription  geoffreys temper was never very patient but he held it well in hand for helens sake  on the night in question geoffrey anxiously awaited the physicians verdict  he was in the library with thomas savine and had made spasmodic attempts to divert the attention of the kindly grayhaired gentleman from the illness of his brother  at last when the tension grew almost unbearable thomas savine said  they cannot be much longer and well hear their verdict soon  im trying to hope for the best thurston knowing it cant be good all the time  this has been a blow to me  you see we were a oneman family and it was julius who started off all the rest of us  he must have been mighty sick of us several times after he married but he never showed a sign of impatience  what a man he wastireless indefatigable nothing too big for himuntil his wife died  then all the grit seemed to melt right out of him and during the last few years i knew what mighty few people besides yourself know now that julius was just a shadow of what he had been  he held all the wires in his own hands too long and as he hadnt an understudy with the grit to act by himself i was glad when he took hold of you  he has always been a generous and considerate employer interposed geoffrey  but i had better leave you  i hear the doctors coming  savine laid a detaining grasp upon his arm with the words i want you right here  its your concern as well as mine  the two doctors entered and the one from vancouver said  i will let my colleague express his opinion and may say that our patient admitted to him a complicating weakness which i had suspected i wish we had better news to give you but while it was your brothers wish that mr thurston should know i should almost prefer first to communicate with his own family  you can both speak right out only be quick about it thomas savine told him  it is tolerably simple and while i sympathize with you i must not disguise the truth said the keeneyed leanfaced american  though mr savine will partly recover from this attack his career as an active man is closed  his heart may hold out a few years longer if you follow my instructions or it may at any time fail himif he worries over anything it certainly will  in any case he will never be strong again  mental powers and physical vigor have been reduced to the lowest level by overwork and excessive if intermittent indulgence in what i may call a very devilish druga particular chinese preparation of opium not generally known even on this opiumconsuming coast  under its influence he may still be capable of spasmodic fits of energy but while each dose will assist towards his dissolution i dare notat this stagerecommend complete deprivation i have arranged with your own adviser as to the best treatment known to modern science but fear it cannot prove very efficacious  thats about all i can tell you in general terms gentlemen  it is worse than i feared said thomas savine leaning forward in his chair with his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands  before the two doctors withdrew the canadian said  he is anxious to see mr thurston and in an hour or so it could do no harm  i will rejoin you shortly mr savine  the door closed behind them and thomas savine looked straight at thurston as he observed i know little about his business but shall have to look into it for his daughters sake  you will help me  yes replied geoffrey  it seems out of place now but i cannot honestly cooperate with you without mentioning a conditional promise your brother made to me  perhaps you can guess it  i can said savine stretching out his hand  i wont say that i hadnt thought helen might have chosen among the highest in the dominion just because it wouldnt be true but youll have my good wishes if you will see my poor brother through his immediate difficulties at least  you had mrs savines approval long ago after a pause he added there is one part of juliuss trouble helen must never know  the two mens fingers met in a grip that was more eloquent than many protestations and geoffrey went out into the moaning wind and bareheaded paced to and fro until he was summoned to the sick mans room  the few days that had passed since he had seen his employer had set their mark upon savine  the sick man lay in his plainlyfurnished room  with bloodless lips drawn face and curiouslyglazed eyes he was strangely different from his usual self but he looked up with an attempt at his characteristic smile as geoffrey approached  at a signal the nurse slipped away  i asked them to tell you so you might know the kind of man i am said savine  you have got to exercise that partnership option one way or another right now  it is not too late to back out and i wouldnt blame you  i should blame myself to my last day if i did sir answered geoffrey trying to hide the shock he felt and savine beckoned him nearer  its a big thing you are going into but youll do it with both eyes wide open he declared  for the past few years julius savine has been a shadow and an empty name and his affairs are mixed considerably  reckless contracts taken with a muddled brain and speculation to make up the losses have between them resulted in chaos  im too sick to value what i own and no accountant can  i ran things myself too long and no one was fit to take hold when i slackened my grip  but theres still the business and theres still the name and the one man in this province i can trust them to is you i should have let go before but i was greedygreedy for my daughters sake  it is comprehensible  geoffrey spoke with conviction  so far as i can serve you you can command me  i know it was the answer  whats more i feel it in me that you will not lose by it  lord how hard it is but theres no use whining when brought up sharp by ones own folly  but see here geoffrey thurston if helen will take you willingly i can trust her to you but if when i go under she looks beyond you and you attempt to trade upon her gratitude or her aunts favor my curse will follow you besides if i know helen savine she will be able to repay you full measure should you win her so  for just a moment the old flame of quick anger burned in geoffreys eyes  then he responded  i regret you even imagine i could take an dishonorable advantage of your daughter  god forbid that i should ever bring sorrow upon miss savine  all i ask is a fair field and the right to help her according to her need  forgive me returned savine  of late i have grown scared about her future  i believe you thurston i cant say more  i felt the more sure of you when you told me straight out about what was born in you lord how i envied you  the man who can stand those devils off can do most anything  it was when my wife died they got their claws on me  i was trying to forget my troubles by doing three mens work but you cant fool with nature and id done it too long already  anyway when i couldnt eat or sleep they had their opportunity  at first they made my brain work quicker but soon after i fell in with you i knew that unless he had a good man beside him savines game was over  but i wouldnt be beaten  i was holding on for helens sake to leave her a fortune and a name  all this is getting monotonous to you but let me finish when i can savine waited a moment to regain his breath  i cheated the nurse and doctor today and ill be very like a dead man tomorrow  you must go down to my offices and overhaul everything then come right back and well see if we can make a deal  ill have my proposition fixed up straight and square but this is the gist of it  while doing your best for your own advantage hold julius savines name clean before the world win the most possible for helen out of the wreck and rush through the reclamation schemewhich is the key to all  as you saidits a big undertaking but ill do my best began geoffrey but savine checked him  go down and see what you make of things  maybe the sight of them will choke you off  ill take no other answer  send tom to me he commanded  it was the next day when geoffrey had an interview with helen who sent for him  she was standing beside a window when he came in  she looked tall in a long sombertinted dress which emphasized the whiteness of her full round throat and the pallor of her face  the faint olive coloring of her skin had faded there were shadows about her eyes  at the first glance geoffreys heart went out towards her  it was evident the verdict of the physicians had been a heavy shock but he fancied that she was ready to meet the inevitable with undiminished courage still her fingers were cold when for a moment they touched his own  sit down geoffrey  i have a great deal to say to you and dont know how to begin she said  but first i am sincerely grateful for all you have done  we will not mention that  neither i hope need i say that miss savine of all people could never be indebted to me  you must know it already  helen thanked him with her eyes as she sank into the chair he wheeled out so that the light left her face in shadow  geoffrey stood near the window framing and he did not look directly towards her  helen appreciated the consideration which prompted the action and the respect implied by his attitude  i am going to ask a great deal of you and remind you of a promise you once made  there was a little tremor in her voice  you will not think it ungracious if i say there is no one else who can do what seems so necessary and ask you if you do not consider that you owe something to my father  it is hard for me not because i doubt you but because  geoffrey checked her with a halfraised hand  please dont miss savinei can understand  you find it difficult to receive when as yet you have you think but little to give  would that make any difference  the littlejust to know that i had helped youwould be so much to me  again helen was grateful  the look of anxiety and distress returned as she went on  i dare spare no effort for my fathers sake  he has always been kindness itself to me and it is only now that i know how much i love him  hitherto i have taken life too easily forgetting that sorrow and tragedy could overtake me  i have heard the physicians verdict and know my father cannot be spared very long to me  i also know how his mind is set upon the completion of his last great scheme  that is why and because of your promise i have dared ask help ofyou  will it make it easier if i say that quite apart from his daughters wishes i am bound in honor to protect the interests of julius savine so far as i can interposed geoffrey  your father found me much as you did a struggling adventurer and with unusual kindness helped me on the way to prosperity  all i have i owe to him and perhaps the more so because we have cunning enemies my own mind is bent on the completion of the scheme  i believe that we shall triumph miss savine and i use the word advisedly still expecting much from your fathers skill  helen gravely shook her head  i recognize your kind intentions but you must expect nothing  it is a hard thing for me to say but the truth is always best and again it is no small favor i ask from youto do the work for the credit of anothers nametaking his task upon your shoulders to make a broken mans last days easier  i want you to sign the new partnership agreement and am glad you recognize that my father was a good friend to you  the girls courage nearly deserted her for helen was young still and had been severely tried  while geoffrey who felt that he would give his life for the right to comfort her could only discreetly turn his face away  i will do it all miss savine he said gravely  i had already determined on as much but you must try to believe that the future is not so hopeless as it looks  you will consider that i have given you a solemn pledge  then i can only say god speed you for my thanks would be inadequate helens voice trembled as she spoke  but i must also ask your forgiveness for my presumption in judging you that day  i now know how far i was mistaken  geoffrey knew to what she referred  the day had been a memorable one for him and with pulses throbbing he moved forward a pace his eyes fixed upon the speakers face  for a moment forgetting everything his resolutions were flung to the winds and he trembled with passion and hope  then he remembered his promise to the sick man and helens own warning and recovered a partial mastery of himself  it was a mere sense of justice which prompted the girls words his reason warned him but he felt instinctively that they implied more than this though he did not know how much  he stood irresolute until helen looked up and if it had ever existed the time for speech was past  i fear i have kept you too long but there is still a question i must ask  you have seen my father in many of his moods and there is something in the state of limp apathy he occasionally falls into which puzzles me  i cannot help thinking there is another danger of which i do not know  can you not enlighten me  helen leaned forward a strange fear stamped upon her face  fresh from the previous struggle geoffrey whose heart yearned to comfort her felt his powers of resistance strained to the utmost  still it was a question that he could not answer  remembering savines injunctionto hold her fathers name cleanhe said quickly there is nothing i can tell you  you must remember only that the physician admitted a cheering possibility  i will try to believe in it  the trouble deepened in helens face while her voice expressed bitter disappointment  you have been very kind and i must not tax you too heavily  geoffrey turned away distressed for her and inwardly anathematized his evil fortune in being asked that particular question  he had he felt faltered when almost within sight of victory neglecting to press home an advantage which might have won success  it is perhaps the first time i have willfully thrown away my chancesthe man who wins is the one who sees nothing but the prize he told himself  but i could not have taken advantage of her anxiety for her father and gratitude to me while if i had and won there would be always between us the knowledge that i had not played the game fairly  thomas savine came into the room  i was looking for you and want to know when youll go down to vancouver with me to puzzle through everything before finally deciding just what youre going to do he said  they talked a few moments  after the older man left him geoffrey found himself confronted by mrs savine  i have been worried about you she asserted  youre carrying too heavy a load and its wearing you thin  you look a very sick man today and ought to remember that the main way to preserve ones health is to take life easily  i have no doubt of it madam thurston fidgeted fearing what might follow but unfortunately one cannot always do so  mrs savine held out a little phial as she explained a simple restorative is the next best thing and you will find yourself braced in mind and body by a few doses of this  it is what i desired to fix up my poor brotherinlaw with when you prevented me  then the least i can do is to take it myself said geoffrey smiling to hide his uneasiness  i presume you do not wish me to swallow it immediately  mrs savine beamed upon him  you might hold out an hour or two longer but delays are dangerous she warned him  kindness  well theres a tolerable reason why we should be good to you and for i guess youre not a clever man all round geoffrey thurston you have piled up a considerable obligation in your favor in one direction  may i ask you to speak more plainly mrs savine geoffrey requested and she answered  you may but i cant do it  still what you did because you thought it the fair thing wont be lost to you  now dont ask any more fool questions but go right away take ten drops of the elixir and dont worry  it will all come right some day  the speakers meaning was discernible and geoffrey having a higher opinion than many people of mrs savines sagacity went out into the sunlight satisfied  he held up the phial and was about to hurl it among the firs but either grateful for the donors words or softened by what he had heard and seen he actually drank a little of it instead  then came a revulsion from the strain of the last few days and he burst into a laugh  it would have been mean and i dare say i havent absorbed sufficient of the stuff to quite poison me he said     chapter xvi  millicent turns traitress  it was with a heavy sense of responsibility that geoffrey returned from a visit to savines offices in vancouver and yet there was satisfaction mingled with his anxiety  thomas savine who knew little of engineering was no fool at finance and the week they spent together made the situation comparatively plain  it was fraught with peril and would have daunted many a man but the very uncertainty and prospect of a struggle which would tax every energy appealed to thurston  he felt also that here was an opportunity of proving his devotion to helen in the way he could do it best  im uncommonly thankful we didnt send for an accountant the fewer folks who handle those books the better declared thomas savine  i was prepared for a surprise thurston but never expected this  i suppose things can be straightened out but when id fixed up that balance it just took my breath away  more than half the assets are unmarketable stock and ventures no man could value while whether they will ever realize anything goodness only knows  its mighty certain julius doesnt know himself what he has been doing the last two years i can let my partners run our business down in oregon and stay right here for a time counting on you to do the outside work if what you have seen hasnt clicked you off  you havent signed the agreement yet  how does the whole thing strike you  as chaos that can and must be reduced to order answered geoffrey with a reckless laugh  i intend to sign the agreement and foreseeing that you may have trouble about the money which i propose to spend freely i am adding all my private savings to the working capital  it is therefore neck or nothing with me now as i fear it is with the rest of you and in my opinion we should let everything but the reclamation scheme go  it will either ruin us or pay us fivefold if we can put it through  just so and savine nodded  i leave that end to you but ive got to explain things to helen and i dont like the thought of it  my niece has talents  as her future lies at stake she has a right to know but it will be another shock to her  poor julius brought her up in luxury and i expect has been far too mixed of late to know that he was tottering towards the verge of bankruptcy  a smart outside accountant would have soon scented trouble but i dont quite blame my brothers cashier who is a clerk and nothing more for taking everything at its book value  that afternoon helen sat with the two men in the library at high maples  a roll of papers was on the table before her  when thomas savine had made the condition of things as plain as possible she leaned back in her chair with crossed hands for a time  i thank you for telling me so much and i can grasp the main issues she said at length  if my opinion is of value i would say i agree with you that the bold course is best  but you will need much money and as it is evident money will not be plentiful so i must do my part in helping you  because this establishment and our mode of life here is expensive while it will please my father to be near the scene of operations we will let high maples and retire to a mountain ranch  i fear we have maintained a style circumstances hardly justified too long  its a sensible plan all through  i must tell you mr thurston has began savine and ceased abruptly when geoffrey who frowned at him broke in  we have troubled miss savine with sufficient details and i fancy the arrangement suggested would help to keep her father tranquil especially as our progress will be slow  spring is near and in spite of our efforts we shall not be able to deepen the pass in the cañon before the waters rise  that means we can do nothing there until next winter and must continue the dyking all summer  it is very brave of you miss savine  helen smiled upon him as she answered  the compliment is doubtful  did you suppose i could do nothing  but we must march out with banners flying or more prosaically paragraphs in the papers stating that julius savine will settle near the scene of his most important operations  while you are here you should show yourself in public as much as possible mr thurston  whenever i can help you you must tell me and i shall demand a strict account of your stewardship from both of you  the two men went away satisfied  savine said  i guess some folks are mighty stupid when they consider that only the ugly women are clever  theres my niecewell nobody could call her plain and you can see how shes taking hold instead of weakening some women never show the grit thats in them until theyre fighting for their children but you can look out for trouble thurston if you fool away any chances while helen savines behind you fighting for her father  a few days later henry leslie confidential secretary to the industrial enterprise company sat with a frown upon his puffy face in his handsome office  he wore a silkbound frock coat a garment not then common in vancouver and a floral spray from mexico in his buttonhole but he was evidently far from happy and glanced with illconcealed dismay at the irate specimen of muscular manhood standing before him the man who was a sturdy british agriculturalist had forced his way in defying the clerks specially instructed to intercept him  leslie had first set up in business as a land agent a calling which affords a promising field for talents of his particular description and having taken the new arrivals money had by a little manipulation of the survey lines transferred to him mostly barren rock and giant trees instead of land for hop culture  it was a game which had been often played before but the particular rancher was a determined man and had announced his firm intention of obtaining his money back or wreaking summary vengeance on his betrayer  danged if thee hadnt more hiding holes than a rotten but ive hunted thee from one to one and now ive found thee i want my brass shouted the brawny loudvoiced briton  leslie answered truthfully  i tell you i havent got it even if you had any claim on me and its not my fault youre disappointed if you foolishly bought land before you could understand a canadian survey plan  then thoult better get it was the uncompromising answer understand a plan  ive stuck to the marked one i got from thee and theres lawyers in this country as can  it was good soil and maples i went up to see and how the  can anybody raise crops off the big stones thou sold me  im going to have my rights and meantime im trapesing round all the bars in this city talking about thee  theres a good many already as believe me  then you had better look out  confound you threatened leslie taking a bold course in desperation  theres a law which can stop that game in this country and ill set it in motion  anyway i cant have you making this noise in my private office  go away before i call my clerks to throw you out  the effort at intimidation was a distinct failure for the aggrieved agriculturalist who was not quite sober laughed uproariously as he seized a heavy ruler  thats a good yan he roared  thou darsent for thy life go near a court with me and the first clerk who tries to put me out danged if i dont pound half the life out of him and thee im stayin here comfable until i get my money  he pulled out a filthy pipe and filled it with what when he struck a match turned out to be particularly vile tobacco and leslie who fumed in his chair said presently  you are only wasting your time and mineand for heavens sake take a cigar and fling that pipe away  i havent got the money by me and its the former owners business not mine but if youll call round say the day after tomorrow ill see what we can do  he named the day knowing that he would be absent then and the stranger heaving his heavy limbs out of an easy chair helped himself to a handful of choice cigars before he prepared to depart saying dubiously  ill be back on wednesday bright and early bringing several friends as will see fair play with me  one of them will be a lawyer and if hes no good either look out mister for ill find another way of settling thee  there are in canada as well as other british colonies capitalists dealing in lands and financing mines whose efforts make for the progress of civilization and the good of the community  there are also others described by their victims as a curse to any country representatives of both descriptions were interested in the industrial enterprise  therefore the unfortunate secretary groaned when one of the latter class who passed his visitor in the doorway came in smiling in a curious manner  leslie who hoped he had not heard much was rudely undeceived  im hardly surprised at certain words i heard in the corridor he commenced  your english friend was telling an interesting tale about you to all the loungers in the rideau bar today  they seemed to believe himhe told it very creditably  when are you going to stop it leslie  when i can pay him the equivalent of five hundred sterling in blackmail  i am afraid it will be a long time answered the secretary ruefully  then i would advise you to beg borrow or steal the money  a man of your abilities and practical experience oughtnt to find much difficulty in this part of the world said the newcomer  the tale may have been a fabrication but it sounded true and while i dont set up as a reformer i am a director of this company and cant have those rumors set going about its secretary  no i dont want to hear your side of the caseits probably highly creditable to youbut i know all about the kind of business you were running and a good many other folks in this province do too  who in the name of perdition would lend me the money  and it takes every cent ive got to live up to my post  you dont pay too liberally sneered the unfortunate man stung into brief fury by the reference to his character  i will was the answer  that is to say ill fix things up with the plainspoken britisher and take your acknowledgment in return for his written statement that he has no claim on you  i know how to handle that breed of cattle and maynt press you for the money until you can pay it comfortably  what are you doing it for asked leslie dubiously  for several reasons i dont mind mentioning a few  i want more say in the running of this company and i could get at useful facts my colleagues didnt know through its secretary  i could also give him instructions without the authority of a board meeting see  and i fancy i could put a spoke in savines wheel best by doing it quietly my own way  one live man can often get through more than a squabbling dozen and the money is really nothing much to me  i had better sue the englishman for defamation and prove my innocence even if the legal expenses ruin me said leslie and the other who laughed aloud checked him  pshaw  it is really useless trying that tone with me especially as i have heard about another dispute of the kind you once had at westminster  youre between the devil and the deep sea but if you dont start kicking youll get no hurt from me  call it a dealand to change the subject wheres the man you sent up to worry thurston  i dont know said leslie  i gave him a round sum part of it out of my own pocket for i couldnt in the meantime think of a suitable entryall the directors dont agree with you  i know he started but he has never come back again  then you have got to find him was the dry answer  well have lawsuits and land commissions before were through and if thurston has corralled or bought that man over and plays him at the right moment it would certainly cost you your salary  i cant find him ive tried asserted leslie  then you had better try again and keep right on trying  get at thurston through his friends if you cant do it any other way  your wife is already a figure in local society  that night leslie leaned against the mantelpiece in his quarters talking to his wife  they had just returned from some entertainment and millicent in beautiful evening dress lay in a lounge chair watching him keenly  you would not like to be poor again millicent he said fixing his glance not upon her face but on her jeweled hands and the woman smiled somewhat bitterly as she answered  poor again  that would seem to infer that we are prosperous now  do you know how much i owe half the stores in this city harry  i dont want to said leslie with a gesture of impatience  your tastes were always extravagant and i mean the kind of poverty which is always refused credit  my tastes and millicents tone was indignant  i suppose i am fond of money or the things that it can buy and you may remember you once promised me plenty  but why cant you be honest and own that the display we make is part of your programme  i have grown tired of this scheming and endeavoring to thrust ourselves upon people who dont want us and if you will be content to stay at home and progress slowly harry i will gladly do my share to help you  millicent leslie was ambitious but the woman who endeavors to assist an impecunious husbands schemes by becoming a social influence usually suffers even if successful in the process and millicent had not been particularly successful  she was also subject to morbid fits of reflection accompanied by the framing of good resolutions which for the moment at least she meant to keep  it is possible that night might have marked a turningpoint in her career had her husband listened to her but before she could continue his thin lips curled as he said  isnt it a little too late for either of us to practice the somewhat monotonous domestic virtues  you need not be afraid of hurting my feelings millicent by veiling your meaning  but in the first place at the time you transferred your affections to me i had the money and in the second i must either carry out what you call my programme or go down with a crash shortly  if luck favors me the prize i am striving for is however worth winning but things are going most confoundedly badly just now  in fact i shall be driven into a corner unless you can help me  mrs leslie possessed no exalted code of honor but in her present frame of mind her husbands words excited fear and suspicion and she asked sharply what is it you want me to do  i will try to explain  you know something of my business  i sent up a clever rascal towell to pass as a workman seeking employment and so enable us to forestall some of savines mechanical improvements  he took the money i gave him and started but we have never seen him since and it is particularly desirable that i should know whether he tried and failed or what has become of him  if the man made his exact commission known it would cost me my place  the very people who would applaud me if successful would be the first to make a scapegoat of me otherwise  your explanation is not quite lucid but how could i get at the truth  ingratiate yourself with miss savine or get that crackbrained aunt of hers to cure your neuralgia  there are also two young premium pupils sons of leading montreal citizens in mr savines service who dance attendance upon the fair helen continually  it shouldnt be difficult to flatter them a little and set them talking  do you think women are utterly foolish or that they converse about dams and earthworks asked millicent trying to check her rising indignation  no but i know a good many of you have the devils own cunning and there can be but few much keener than you  women in this country know a great deal more about their lawful protectors affairs than they generally do at home and miss savine is sufficiently proud not to care whose wife you were if she took a fancy to you  it would be utterly useless  leslie looked his wife over with coolly critical approval noting how the soft lamplight sparkled in the pale gold clusters of her hair the beauty that still hung to her somewhat careworn face and how the costly dress enhanced the symmetry of a finelymoulded frame  then why cant you confine your efforts to the men  you are pretty and clever enough to wheedle secrets out of thurstons self even now you have apparently become reconciled to him  for the first time since the revelations that followed leslies downfall a red brand of shame and anger flamed in millicents cheeks she rose facing the speaker with an almost breathless how dare you is there no limit to the price i must pay for my folly  thurston was  but how could any woman compare him with you  sit down again millicent suggested leslie with an uneasy laugh these heroics hardly become youand nobody can extort a great deal in return fornothing better than you  in any case its no use now debating whether one or both of us were foolish  im speaking no more than the painful truth when i say that if i cant get the man back into my hands i shall have to make a break without a dollar from british columbia  since you have offended your english friends past forgiveness god knows what would become of you if that happened while thurston would marry miss savine and sail on to richesconfusion to him  millicent was never afterwards certain why she accepted the quest from which she shrank with loathing at first  while her husband proceeded to substantiate the truth of his statement she was conscious of rage and shame as well as a profound contempt for him and because of it she felt an illogical desire to inflict suffering upon the man whom she now considered had too readily accepted his rejection  naturally she disliked miss savine  she was possessed by an abject fear of poverty and so turning a troubled face towards the man she said  i dont know that i shall ever forgive you and i feel that you will live to regret this nights work bitterly  however as you say it is over late for us to fear losing the selfrespect we parted with long ago  rest contentedi will try  that is better  we are what illluck or the devil made us replied leslie laying his hand on his wifes white shoulder but in spite of her recent declaration millicent shrank from his touch  your fingers burn me  take them away  as i said i will help you but if there was any faint hope of happiness or better things left us you have killed it she declared in a decided tone  i should say the chance was hardly worth counting on answered leslie as he withdrew to soothe himself with a brandyandsoda millicent sat still in her chair with her hands clenched hard on the arms of it staring straight before her     chapter xvii  the infatuation of english jim  it was perhaps hardly wise of geoffrey thurston to suddenly promote english jim from the position of camp cook to that of amanuensis geoffrey however found himself hard pressed when it became necessary to divide his time between vancouver and the scene of practical operations and he remembered that the man he had promoted had been helens protégé  james gillow was a fair draughtsman also and if not remarkable otherwise for mental capacity wielded a facile pen and geoffrey found it a relief to turn his rapidlyincreasing correspondence over to him  it was for this reason gillow accompanied him on a business trip to victoria  english jim enjoyed the visit the more so because he found one or two acquaintances who had achieved some degree of prosperity in that fair city  he was entertained so well that on the morning of geoffreys return he boarded the steamer contented with himself and the world in general  he was perfectly sober so he afterwards decided or on board a rolling vessel he could never have succeeded in working out quantities from rough sketches thurston gave him  but he had breakfasted with his friends just before sailing and the valedictory potations had increased instead of assuaging his thirst  the steamer was a fast one  the day was pleasant with the first warmth of spring and geoffrey sat under the lee of a deckhouse languidly enjoying a cigar and looking out across the sparkling sea  gillow who came up now and then for a breath of air envied him each time he returned to pore over papers that rose and fell perplexingly on one end of the saloon table  it was hard to get his scale exactly on the lines of the drawings the sunrays that beat in through the skylights dazzled his eyes and his sight did not become much keener after each visit to the bar  nevertheless few persons would have suspected english jim of alcoholic indulgence as he jotted down weights and quantities in his pocketbook  meantime thurston began to find the view of the snowclad olympians grow monotonous  it is true that every pinnacle was silhouetted a spire of unsullied whiteness against softest azure  the peaks towered a sight to entrance the visionethereally majestic above a cerulean seabut geoffrey had seen rather too much snow unpleasantly close at hand within the last few months  therefore he opened the newspaper beside him and frowned to see certain rumors he had heard in victoria embodied in an article on the crown lands policy  anyone with sufficient knowledge to read between the lines could identify the writers instances of how gross injustice might be done the community with certain conditional grants made to savine  that man has been well posted  he may have been influenced by a mistaken public spirit or quite possibly by a less praiseworthy motive but if we have any more bad breakdowns i can foresee trouble geoffrey said to himself  then he turned his eyes towards the groups of passengers and presently started at the sight of a lady carrying a camp chair a book and a bundle of wrappings along the heaving deck  it was millicent leslie and there was no doubt that she had recognized him for she had set down her burden and was waiting for his assistance  geoffrey was at her side in a moment and presently ensconced her snugly under the lee of the deckhouse where he waited by no means wholly pleased at the meeting  he had spent most of the previous night with certain men interested in finance and provincial politics and being new to the gentle art of wirepulling had not quite recovered his serenity  he regretted the good cigar he had thrown away and scarcely felt equal to sustaining the semisentimental trend of conversation millicent had affected whenever he met her but she was alone and cut off all hope of escape by saying  you will not desert me  one never feels solitude so much as when left to ones own resources among a crowd of strangers  certainly not if you can put up with my company but where is your husband geoffrey responded  millicent looked up at him with a chastened expression  enjoying himself  some gentlemen whose goodwill is worth gaining asked him to go inland for a few days fishing and he said it was necessary he should accept the invitation  accordingly i am as usual left to my own company while i make a solitary journey down the sound it is hardly pleasant but i suppose all men are much the same and we poor women must not complain  millicent managed to convey a great deal more than she said and her sigh suggested that she often suffered keenly from loneliness but while geoffrey felt sorry for her he was occupied by another thought just then and did not at first answer  what are you puzzling over geoffrey she asked and the man smiled as he answered  i was wondering if the same errand which took your husband to victoria was the same that sent me there  i cannot say  millicents gesture betokened weariness  i know nothing of my husbands business and must do him the justice to say that he seldom troubles me about it  i have little taste for details of intricate financial scheming but practical operations like your task among the mountains would appeal to me  it must be both romantic and inspiring to pit ones self against the rude forces of nature but one grows tired of the prosaic struggle which is fought by eating ones enemies dinners and patiently bearing the slights of lukewarm allies wives  however since the fear of poverty is always before me i try to play my part in it  helen savine had erred strangely when she concluded that geoffrey thurston was without sympathy  hard and painfully blunt as he could be he was nevertheless compassionate towards women though not always happy in expressing his feelings and when millicent folded her slender hands with a pathetic sigh he was moved to sincere pity and indignation  he knew that some of the worthy colonials wives and daughters could be on occasion almost brutally frank and that in spite of his efforts leslie was not wholly popular  i can quite understand  it must be a trying life for you but there are always chances for an enterprising man in this country and you must hope that your husband will shortly raise you above the necessity of enduring uncongenial social relations  please dont think i am complaining  millicent read his sympathy in his eyes  it was only because you looked so kind that i spoke so frankly  i fear that i have grown morbid and said too much  but onesided confidence is hardly fair and to change the subject tell me how fortune favors you  where shall i begin  millicent smiled as most men would have fancied bewitchingly  you need not be bashful  tell me about your adventures in the mountains with all the hairbreadth escapes fantastic coloring and romantic medley of incidents that must be crowded into the life of anyone engaged in such work as yours  i am afraid the romance wears thin leaving only a monotonous not to say sordid reality while details of cubic quantities would hardly interest you  still and remember you have brought it upon yourself i will do my best  geoffrey reluctantly began an account of his experiences speaking in an indifferent manner at first but warming to his subject until he spoke eloquently at length  he was not a vain man but millicent had set the right chord vibrating when she chose the topic of his newworld experiences  he stopped at last abruptly with an uneasy laugh  there  i must have tired you but you must blame yourself he said  no millicent assured him  i have rarely heard anything more interesting  it must be a very hard battle well worth winning but you are fortunate in one respecthaving only the rock and river to contend against instead of human enemies  i am afraid we have both was the incautious answer and millicent looked out across the whiteflecked waters as she commented indifferently but there can be nobody but simple cattleraisers and forestclearers in that region and what could your enemies gain by following you there  they might interfere with my plans or thwart them  one of them nearly did so and geoffrey hesitating glanced down at his companion just a second too late to notice the look of suspiciouslyeager interest in her face for millicent had put on the mask again  she was a clever actress quick to press into her service smile or sigh where words might have been injudicious and with feminine curiosity and love of unearthing a secret was bent on drawing out the whole story  it did not necessarily follow that she should impart the secret to her husband she said to herself  geoffrey was for the moment off his guard and victory seemed certain for the woman  how did that happen she asked outwardly with languid indifference inwardly quivering with suspense but as luck would have it the steamer entering one of the tide races which sweep those narrow waters rolled wildly just then and geoffrey held her chair fast while the book fell from her knee and went sliding down the slanted deck vexed and nervously anxious millicent bit one red lip while thurston pursued the volume and she could hardy conceal her chagrin when he returned with it  it flew open and a page or two got wet in the scuppers  still it will soon dry in the sun and because i did my best you will excuse me being a few seconds too slow to save it geoffrey apologized  millicent was willing to allow him to deceive himself as to the cause of her annoyance  it was a borrowed book and i can hardly return it in this condition it is really vexatious she replied wondering how to lead the conversation back to the place where it was interrupted  she might have succeeded but fate seemed against her  a passenger who knew them both strolled by and nodded to geoffrey  i have been looking for you thurston and if mrs leslie accepting my excuses can spare you for a few minutes i have something important to tell you said the man  i wouldnt have disturbed you but well be alongside vancouver wharf very shortly  millicent could only bow in answer and after an apologetic glance in her direction geoffrey followed the passenger  mrs leslies a handsome woman though one would guess she had a temper of her own  perhaps you didnt notice it but she just looked daggers at you when you let that book get away observed the companion who smiled when geoffrey answered  presumably you didnt take all this trouble to acquaint me with that fact  no admitted the man with a whimsical gesture  it was something much more interestingabout the agitation some folks are trying to whoop up against your partner  geoffrey found the information of so much interest that the steamer was sweeping through the pineshrouded narrows which forms the gateway of vancouvers landlocked harbor when he returned to millicent with english jim following discreetly behind him  i am sorry that as we are halfanhour late i shall barely have time to keep an important business appointment said thurston  however as the sound boat does not sail immediately my assistant mr gillow will be able to look after your baggage and secure a good berth for you  you will get hold of the purser and see mrs leslie is made comfortable in every way before you follow me gillow  i shall not want you for an hour or two  millicent smiled on the assistant who took his place beside her as the steamer ran alongside the wharf and his employer hurried away english jim was a young goodlooking man of some education and since his promotion from the cookshed had indulged himself in a former weakness for tasteful apparel  he had also though thurston did not notice it absorbed just sufficient alcoholic stimulant to render him vivacious in speech without betraying the reason for it and millicent who found him considerably more amusing than geoffrey wondered whether since she had failed with the one she might not succeed with the other  english jim no more connected her with the servant of the corporation whose interests were opposed to savines than he remembered the brass baggage checks in his pocket  his gratified vanity blinded him to everything besides the pleasure of being seen in his stylish companions company  he found a sunny corner for her beside one of the big sound steamers paddle casings from which she could look across the blue waters of the forestgirt inlet brought up a chair and some english papers and after millicent had chatted with him graciously was willing to satisfy her curiosity to the utmost when she said with a smile  you are a confidential assistant of mr thurstons  he is an old friend of mine and knowing his energy i dare say he works you very hard  hard is scarcely an adequate term madam answered english jim nothing can tire my respected chief and unfortunately he expects us all to equal him  he found me occupationwriting his lettersuntil 1 am this morning and i believe must have remained awake himself until it was almost light making drawings which i have had the pleasure of poring over all the way across  dont you think madam that it is a mistake to work so hard that one has never leisure for the serene contemplation which is one of theone of the best things in life  besides people who do so are also apt to deprive others of their opportunities  perhaps so though i hardly think mr thurston would agree with you for instance asked millicent finding his humor infectious for english jim could gather all the men in camp about him when half in jest and half in earnest he began one of his discourses  these was the answer and the speaker thrust his hand into his jacket pocket  if mr thurston had not been of such tireless nature i might have found leisure to admire the beauty of this most entrancing coast scenery instead of puzzling over weary figures in a particularly stuffy saloon  he held up a large handful of papers as he spoke glanced at them disdainfully and pointing vaguely across the inlet continued is not an hours contemplation of such a prospect better than many days labor  millicent laughed outright and because though english jims voice was even and his accent crisp and clean his fingers were not quite so steady as they might have been one of the papers fluttered unnoticed by either of them to her feet  i feel tempted to agree with you millicent rejoined wishing that she need not press on to the main point for english jim promised to afford the sort of entertainment which she enjoyed  but a man of your frame of mind must find scanty opportunity for considering such questions among the mountains  that is so was the rueful answer  we commence our toil at daybreak and too often continue until midnight  there are times when the monotony jars upon a sensitive mind as the camp cooking does upon a sensitive palate  but our chief never expects more from us than he will do himself and is generous in rewarding meritorious service  so i should suppose commented millicent  knowing this you will all be very loyal to him  every one of us  the loyalty of english jim who gracefully ignored the inference and fell into the trap was evident enough  of course we do not always approve of being tired to death but where our chief considers it necessary we are content to obey him  in fact it would not make much difference if we were not he added whimsically  there was however one instance of a black sheep or rather wolf of the contemptible coyote species in sheeps clothing whom i played a minor part in catching  but naturally you will not care to hear about this  i should exceedingly  did i not say that i am one of mr thurstons oldest friends  i should very much like to hear about the disguised coyote  i presume you do not mean a real one and are speaking figuratively  gillow was flattered by the glance she cast upon him and remembering only that this gracious lady was one of his employers friends proceeded to gratify her by launching into a vivid description of what happened on the night when he dropped the prowler into the river  he had however sense enough to conclude with the capture of the man  but you have not told me the sequel said millicent  did you lynch the miscreant in accordance with the traditional customs of the west or how did mr thurston punish him  he is not a man who lightly forgives an injury  no replied gillow rashly  against my advice though my respected employer is difficult to reason with he kept the rascal in camp both feeding and paying him well  you surprise me  i should have expected a more dramatic finale millicents tone might have deceived a much more clever man who did not know her husbands position  why did he do so  there were however limits to english jims communicativeness and he answered mr thurston did not explain his motives and it is not always wise to ask him injudicious questions  millicent having learned what she desired to know rested content with this and chatted on other subjects until the big bell clanged and the whistle shrieked out its warning  then the dismissed gillow with her thanks and the last she saw of him he was being held back by a policeman as he struggled to scale a lofty railing while the steamer slid clear of the wharf  he waved an arm in the air shouting frantically and through the thud of paddles she caught the disjointed sentences very sorry  forgot baggage checksall your boxes here leave first steamersending checks by mail  it is impossible for us to turn back madam said the purser to whom millicent appealed  the baggage will no doubt follow the day after tomorrow  but that gentleman has my ticket and doesnt know my address protested the unfortunate passenger and the purser answered  i really cannot help it but i will telegraph to any of your friends from the first wayport we call at madam  when the steamer had vanished behind the stately pines shrouding the narrows english jim sat down upon a timberhead and swore a little at what he called his luck before he uneasily recounted the folded papers in his wallet  a pretty mess ive made of it all and therell be no end of trouble if thurston hears of this he said aloud so that a loafing porter heard and grinned  ill write a humble letterbut confound it i dont know where shes going to and now here is one of those distressful tracings missing  it must have been that old sketch of savines and thurston will never want it while nobody but a draughtsman could make head or tail of the thing  anyway ill get some dinner before i decide what is best to be done  while gillow endeavored to enjoy his dinner and being an easygoing man partially succeeded millicent who had picked up a folded paper leaned upon the steamers rail with it open in her hand  this is greek to me but i suppose it is of value  i will keep it and perhaps give it back to geoffrey she ruminated  the game was amusing but i feel horribly mean and whether i shall tell harry or not depends very much upon his behavior     chapter xviii  the bursting of the sluice  one morning of early summer geoffrey thurston lay neither asleep nor wholly awake inside his double tent  the canvas was partly drawn open and from his campcot he could see a streak of golden sunlight grow broader across the valley while rising in fantastic columns the night mists rolled away  the smell of dewdamped cedars mingled with the faint aromatic odors of wood smoke  the clamor of frothing water vibrated through the sweet cool air for the river was swollen by melted snow  geoffrey lay still breathing in the glorious freshness drowsily content  all had gone smoothly with the works at least during the last month or two  each time that she rode down to camp with her father from the mountain ranch helen had spoken to him with unusual kindness  savine would when well enough spend an hour in geoffreys tent  while some of the contractors suggestions were characterized by his former genius most betrayed a serious weakening of his mental powers and it was apparent that he grew rapidly frailer physically  on this particular morning geoffrey found something very soothing in the rivers song and yielding to temptation he turned his head from the growing light to indulge in another halfhours slumber  suddenly a discordant note jarring through the deeptoned harmonies struck his ears which were quick to distinguish between the bass roar of the cañon and the higherpitched calling of the rapid at its entrance what had caused it he could not tell  he dressed with greatest haste and was striding down into the camp when mattawa tom and gillow came running towards him  sluice number six has busted and the waters going in over hudsons ranch shouted tom  ive started all the men theres room for heaving dirt in but the rivers going through in spite of them  geoffrey asked no questions but ran at full speed through the camp shouting orders as he went and presently stood breathless upon a tall bank of raw red earth  on one side the greenstained river went frothing past on the other a muddy flood spouted through a breach and already a shallow lake was spreading fast across the cleared land licking up long rows of potato haulm and timothy grass  men swarmed like bees about the sloping side of the bank hurling down earth and shingle into the aperture but a few moments inspection convinced geoffrey that more heroic measures were needed and that they labored in vain  raising his hand he called to the men to stop work and when the clatter of shovels ceased he quietly surveyed the few poor fields rancher hudson had won from the swamp  his lips were pressed tight together and his expression showed his deep concern  theres only one thing to be done  open two more sluice gates tom he commanded  youll drown out the whole clearing ventured the foreman and geoffrey nodded  exactly  cant you see the river will tear all this part of the dyke away unless we equalize the pressure on both sides of it  go ahead at once and get it done  the man from mattawa wondered at the bold order but his master demanded swift obedience and he proceeded to execute it while geoffrey stood fast watching two more huge sheets of froth leap out  he knew that very shortly rancher hudsons lowlevel possessions would be buried under several feet of water  its done sir and a blamed bad job it is said the foreman returning and geoffrey asked how did it happen  the sluice gate wasnt strong enough river rose a foot yesterday and she just busted  i was around bright and early and found her splitting  got a line round the piecestheyre floating beneath you  heave them up ordered geoffrey  he was obeyed and for a few minutes glanced at the timber frame with a puzzled expression then turning to gillow he said you know i condemned that mode of scarting and the whole things too light  what carpenters made it  its one of mr savines gates sir  ive got the drawing for it somewhere was the answer and geoffrey frowned  then you will keep that fact carefully to yourself he replied  it is particularly unfortunate  this is about the only gate i have not overhauled personally but one cannot see to quite everything and naturally the breakage takes place at that especial point  very good sir remarked gillow  things generally do happen in just that way  heres rancher hudson coming and he looks tolerably angry  the man who strode along the dyke was evidently infuriated a fact which was hardly surprising considering that he owned the flooded property  the workmen who now leaned upon their shovels waited for the meeting between him and their master in the expectation of amusement  what in the name of thunder do you mean by turning your infernal river loose on my ranch inquired the newcomer  thurston rejoined  may i suggest that you try to master your temper and consider the case coolly before you ask any further questions  consider it coolly shouted hudson  coolly when the blame waters washing out my good potatoes by the hundred bushel and slooshing mud and shingle all over my hay  great columbus  ill make things red hot for you  see here and there were signs that thurston was losing his temper what we have done was most unfortunately necessary but while i regret it at least as much as you do you will not be a loser financially  as soon as the river falls well run off the water measure up the flooded land and pay you current price  for the crop at average acre yield  as you will thus sell it without gathering or hauling to market its a fair offer  most of the forest ranchers in that region would have closed with the offer forthwith but there were reasons why the one in question who was moreover an obstinate cantankerous man should seize the opportunity to harass thurston  its not half good enough for me he said  howm i going to make sure you wont play the same trick again while its tolerably certain you cant keep on paying up for damage done forever  then when youre cleaned out wherell i be  this scheme which youll never put throughs a menace to the whole valley and  youll be rich i hope by that time but if youll confine yourself to your legitimate grievance or come along to my tent ill talk to you said geoffrey  if on the other hand you cast doubt upon my financial position or predict my failure before my men ill take decided measures to stop you  you have my word that you will be repaid every cents worth of damage done and that should be enough for any reasonable person  its notnot enough for me by a long way shouted the rancher ill demand a government inspection illill break you  will you show mr hudson the quickest and safest way off this embankment tom requested geoffrey coolly and there was laughter mingled with growls of approval from the men as the irate rancher hurling threats over his shoulder was solemnly escorted along the dyke by the stalwart foreman  he turned before descending and shook his fist at those who watched him  i think you can close the sluices said geoffrey when the foreman returned  then set all hands filling in this hole  i want you gillow  we are going to have trouble he predicted when english jim stood before him in his tent  hudson unfortunately is either connected with our enemies or in their clutches and hell try to persuade his neighbors to join him in an appeal to the authorities  send a messenger off at once with this telegram to vancouver but stayfirst find me the drawing of the defective gate  english jim spent several minutes searching before he answered im sorry i cant quite lay my hands upon it  it may be in vancouver and ill write a note to the folks down there  he did so and when he went out shook his head ruefully  that confounded sketch must have been the one i lost on board the steamer he decided with a qualm of misgiving  however there is no use meeting trouble halfway by telling thurston so until im sure beyond a doubt  some time had passed and the greater portion of hudsons ranch still lay under water when in consequence of representations made by its owner and some of his friends a government official armed with full powers to investigate held an informal court of inquiry in the big store shed at which most of the neighboring ranchers were present geoffrey and thomas savine who brought a lawyer with him awaited the proceedings with some impatience  i have nothing to do with any claim for damages  if necessary the sufferers can appeal to the civil courts announced the official  my business is to ascertain whether as alleged the way these operations are conducted endangers the occupied and unappropriated crown lands in this vicinity  i am willing to hear your opinions gentlemen beginning with the complainants  rancher hudson was the first to speak and he said  no sensible man would need much convincing that its mighty bad for growing crops to have a fullbore flood turned loose on them  whats the use of raising hay and potatoes for the river to wash away  and its plain that what has just happened is going to happen again before savine began these dykes the river spread itself all over the lower swamp now the walls hold it up and each time it makes a hole in them our propertys most turned into a lake  im neither farming for pleasure nor running a salmon hatchery  there was a hum of approval from the speakers supporters whose possessions lay near the higher end of the valley and dissenting growls from those whose boundaries lay below  after several of the ranchers from the lower valley had spoken the official said  i hardly think you have cited sufficient to convince an unprejudiced person that the works are a public danger  you have certainly proved that two holdings have been temporarily flooded but the first speaker pointed out that this was because the river was prevented from spreading all over the lower end of the valley as it formerly did now a portion of the district is already under cultivation and even the area under crop exceeds that of the damaged plots by at least five acres to one  there was applause from the men whose possessions had been converted into dry land and hudson rose redfaced and indignant to his feet again  has savine bought up the whole province government and all  thats what im wanting to know he rejoined indignantly  what is it we pay taxes to keep you fellows for  to look the other way when the rich man winks and stand by seeing nothing while he ruins poor settlers hardwon holdings  im a lawabiding man i am but im going to let nobody tramp on me  a burst of laughter filled the rear of the building when one of hudsons supporters pulled him down by main force and held him fast observing you just sit right there and look wise instead of talking too much  i guess youve said enough already to mix everything up  the official raised his hand  i am here to ask questions and not answer them he said  any more speeches resembling the last would be likely to get the inquirer into trouble  i must also remind mr hudson that after one inundation he signed a document signifying his approval of the scheme and i desire to ask him what has caused the change in his opinions  again there was laughter followed by a few derisive comments from the party favoring thurstons cause while one voice was audible above the rest hudsons been buying horses  some vancouver speculators check  the rancher shaking off his followers grasp bounded to his feet and glared at the men behind him  ill get square with some of you fellows later on he threatened  turning towards the officer he went on just because im getting tired of being washed out ive changed my mind  when hes had two crops ruined a man begins to get uneasy about the third onesee  it is a sufficient reason answered the official  now gentlemen i gather that some of you have benefited by this scheme  if you have any information to give me i shall be pleased to hear it  several men told how they had added to their holdings many acres of fertile soil which had once been swamp and the crown official said  i am convinced that two small ranches have been temporarily inundated and six or seven benefited  so much for that side of the question  i must now ascertain whether the work is carried out in the most efficient manner and how many have suffered in minor ways by the contractors willful neglect as the petitioners allege  hudson and his comrades testified at length but each in turn after making the most of the accidental upset of a barrowload of earth among their crops or the blundering of a steer into a trench harked back to the broken sluice  when amid some laughter they concluded others who favored savine described the precautions thurston had taken  then the inquirer turned over his papers and thomas savine whispered to geoffrey its all in our favor so far but im anxious about that broken sluice  its our weak point and hes sure to tackle it  yes agreed geoffrey whose face was strangely set  i am anxious about it too  can you suggest anything i should do mr gray  the vancouver lawyer who had a long experience in somewhat similar disputes hitched forward his chair  not at present he answered i think with mr savine that the question of the sluice gate may be serious  allowances are made for unpreventable accidents and force of circumstances but a definite instance of a wholly inefficient appliance or defective workmanship might be most damaging  it is particularly unfortunate it was framed timber of insufficient strength that failed  geoffrey made no answer but thomas savine who glanced at him keenly fancied he set his teeth while the lawyer turning to the official inquirer said  these gentlemen have given you all the information in their power and if you have finished with them i would venture to suggest that any technical details of the work concern only mr thurston and yourself  there was a protest from the assembly and the officer beckoned for silence before he answered  you gentlemen seem determined between you to conduct the whole case your own way  i was about to dismiss with thanks the neighboring landholders who have assisted me to the best of their ability  with some commotion the storeshed was emptied of all but the official his assistant and thurstons party  beckoning to geoffrey the official held up before his astonished eyes a plan of the defective gate  do you consider the timbering specified here sufficient for the strain he asked  i cannot press the question but it would be judicious of you to answer it  no replied geoffrey divided between surprise and dismay  the drawing was savines  he could recognize the figures upon it but it had evidently been made when the contractor was suffering from a badlyclouded brain  the broken gate itself was damaging evidence but this was worse for a glance at the design showed him that the artificers who worked from it had without orders even slightly increased the dimensions  any man with a knowledge of mechanical science would condemn it but while he had often seen savine incapable of mental effort of late this was the first serious blunder that he had discovered  the mistake he knew would be taken as evidence of sheer incapacity if further inquiry followed perhaps it would be published broadcast in the papers and geoffrey was above all things proud of his professional skill  still he had pledged his word to both his partner and his daughter and there was only one course open to him if the questions which would follow made it possible  the lawyer leaning forward whispered to thomas savine and then said aloud if that drawing is what it purports to be it must have been purloined  may we ask accordingly how it came into your possession  one of the complainants forwarded it to me  he said heobtainedit was the dry answer  under the circumstances i hesitate to make direct use of it but by the firms stamp it appears genuine  that mr savine could personally be capable of such a mistake as this is impossible on the face of it said the inquirers professional assistant  it is the work of a halftrained man and suggests two questions do you repudiate the plan and if you do not was it made by a responsible person  i presume you have a draughtsman  there is no use repudiating anything that bears our stamp said geoffrey disregarding the lawyers frown and looking steadily into the bewildered face of thomas savine  i work out all such calculations and make the sketches myself  my assistant sometimes checks them  the official who had heard of the young contractors reputation for daring skill looked puzzled as he commented  from what you say the only two persons who could have made the blunder are mr savine and yourself  i am advised and agree with the suggestion that mr savine could never have done so  from what i have heard i should have concluded it would have been equally impossible with you but i cant help saying that the inference is plain  is not all this beside the question interposed the lawyer  the junior partner admits the plan was made in the firms offices and that should be sufficient  geoffrey held himself stubbornly in hand while the officer answered that he desired to ascertain if it was the work of a responsible person  he knew that this blunder would be recorded against him and would necessitate several brilliant successes before it could be obliterated but his resolution never faltered and when the legal adviser laying a hand upon his arm whispered something softly he shook off the lawyers grasp  the only two persons responsible are mr savine and myselfand you suggested the inference was plain he asserted  here gillow who had been fidgeting nervously opened his lips as if about to say something but closed them again when his employer moving one foot beneath the table trod hard upon his toe  i am afraid i should hardly mend matters by saying i am sorry it is said the official dryly  however a mistake by a junior partner does not prove your firm incapable of highclass work and i hardly think you will be troubled by further interference after my report is made my superiors may warn youbut i must not anticipate  it is as well you answered frankly as otherwise i should have concluded you were endeavoring to make your profits at the risk of the community but i cannot help saying that the admission may be prejudicial to you mr thurston if you ever apply individually for a government contract here is the drawing  it is your property  geoffrey stretched out his hand for it but savine was too quick for him and when he thrust it into his pocket the contractor rising abruptly stalked out of the room  gillow who followed and overtook him said  i cant understand this at all sir  mr savine made that drawing  i know his arrows on the measurement lines and i was just going to say so when you stopped me  i have a confession to make  i believe i dropped that paper out of my wallet on board the steamer  you have a very poor memory gillow and thurston stared the speaker out of countenance  i fear your eyes deceive you at times as well you must have lost it somewhere else  in any case if you mention the fact to anybody else or repeat that you recognise mr savines handiwork i shall have to look for an assistant who does not lose the documents with which he is entrusted  gillow went away growling to himself but perfectly satisfied with both his eyesight and memory  thurston had hardly dismissed him than thomas savine approached holding out the sketch  see here geoffrey began the contractors brother and one glance at the speaker was sufficient for thurston who stopped him  are you coming to torment me about that confounded thing  give it to me at once he said  he snatched the drawing from savines hand tore it into fragments and stamped them into the mould  now thats done with at last he said  no was the answer  theres no saying where a thing like this will end if public mischiefmakers get hold of it  you have your future which means your professional reputation to think of  in all human probability my poor brother cant last very long and this may handicap you for years  i cannot  damn my professional reputation  cant you believe your ears geoffrey broke in  im not blind yet and would sooner trust my eyes was the dry answer  nobody shall persuade me that i dont know my own brothers figures  there are limits geoffrey and neither helen nor i would hold our peace about this  listen to me  geoffreys face was as hard as flint  i see i cant bluff you as easily as the government man but i give you fair warning that if you attempt to make use of your suspicions ill find means of checkmating you  just supposing youre not mistaken a young man with any grit in him could live down a dozen similar blunders and if he couldnt what is my confounded personal credit in comparison with what your brother has done for me and my promise to miss savine  so far as i can accomplish it julius savine shall honorably wind up a successful career and if you either reopen the subject or tell his daughter about the drawing there will be war between you and me  that is the last word i have to say  i wonder if helen knows the grit there is in that man pondered savine when seeing all protests were useless he turned away divided between compunction and gratitude  neither he nor the lawyer succeeded in finding out how the drawing fell into hostile hands while if geoffrey had his suspicions he decided that it might be better not to follow them up     chapter xix  the abduction of black christy  these were weighty reasons why christy black whose comrades reversed his name and called him black christy instead remained in thurstons camp as long as he did  although a good mechanic he was by no means fond of manual labor and he had discovered that profitable occupations were open to an enterprising and not overscrupulous man  on the memorable night when thurston fished him out of the river his rescuer had made it plain that he must earn the liberal wages that were promised to him  as a matter of fact black had made the most of his opportunities and in doing so had brought himself under the ban of the law during an altercation over a disputed mineral claim  black who then called himself by another name disappeared before an inquiry as to how the body of one of the owners of the claim came into a neighboring river  only one comrade and a minefloating speculator who stood behind the humbler disputants knew or guessed at the events which led up the fatality  the comrade shortly afterwards vanished too but the richer man who had connived at blacks disappearance kept a close hand on him forcing him as the price of freedom to act as catspaw in risky operations until black tired of tyranny had been glad to tell thurston part of the truth and to accept his protection the man from whose grip he hoped he had escaped was the one who had helped leslie out of a difficulty  black christy found however that a life of virtuous toil grew distinctly monotonous and one morning when mattawa toms vigilance was slack he departed in search of diversion in the settlement of red pine which lay beyond the range  he found congenial society there and unfortunately for himself went on with a boon companion next morning to a larger settlement beside the railroad track  he intended to complete the orgie there and then to return to camp  accordingly it happened that when afternoon was drawing towards a close he sat under the veranda of a rickety wooden saloon hurling drowsy encouragement at the freighter who was loading rockboring tools into a big wagon  he wondered how far his remaining dollar would go towards assuaging a thirst which steadily increased and two men who leaned against the wagon chuckled as they watched him  the hands of one of the men were busy about the brass cap which decorated the hub of the wheel but neither black nor the teamster noticed this fact  black had seen one of the men before for the two had loafed about the district ostensibly prospecting for minerals and had twice visited thurstons camp  it was a pity black had absorbed sufficient alcohol to confuse his memory for when the men strolled towards him he might have recognized the one whose hat was drawn well down  as it was he greeted them affably  nice weather for picnicking in the woods  not found that galena yet i guess somebody in the city is paying you by the week he observed jocosely  thats about the size of it  the speaker laughed  but weve pretty well found what we wanted and were pulling out with the pacific express  there dont seem very much left in your glass  anything the matter with filling it up with me  im not proud was the answer  im open to drink with any man wholl set them up for me  when the prospector called the bartender black proceeded to prove his willingness to be treated  nothing moved in the unpaved street of the sleepy settlement when the slowfooted oxen and lurching wagon had lumbered away  the sun beat down upon it pitilessly and the drowsy scent of cedars mingled with the odors of baking dust which eddied in little spirals and got into the loungers throats  the bartender was liberal with his ice however and black became confidential  when he had assured them of his undying friendship one of the prospectors asked  whats a smart man like you muling rocks around in a riverbed for anyway  cant you strike nothing better down to the cities  no declared black thickly  couldnt strike a job nohow when i left them  british columbia played outand i had no money to take me to california  well said the prospector winking at his comrade there is something we might put you on to  the first question is what kin you do  according to blacks not overcoherent answer there was little he could not do excellently  after he had enumerated his capabilities the other man said  i guess thats sufficient  come right back with us to frisco and well have a few off days before we start you  this is no country for a live man anyway  black nodded sagaciously and tried hard to think  he was afraid of thurston but more so of the other man connected with the enterprise company  in san francisco he would be beyond the reach of either and the city offered many delights to a person of his tastes with somebody else willing to pay expenses  ill come he promised thickly  so long as youve got the dollars ill go right round the earth with either of you  good man commended the prospector  bring along another jugful bartender  the attendant glanced at the three men admiringly for the speaker was plainly sober and he knew how much money black had paid him  he went back to his bottles and there was nobody to see the other prospector who had kept himself in the background pour something from a little phial beneath his hand into blacks liquor  not quite so good as last one  i know frisco  great time at china joes you an me murmured black as he collapsed with his head upon the table  he was soon snoring heavily  your climate has been too much for him one of the men declared when the saloonkeeper came in  say hadnt you better help us heave him in some place where he can sleep unless youd prefer to keep him as an advertisement  black was stored away with some difficulty and two hours later he was wheeled on a baggagetruck into the station where half the inhabitants of the settlement assembled to see him off  the big cars were already clanging down the track when a tall man riding a lathered horse appeared among the scattered pines on the shoulder of the hill above the settlement  a bystander commented  thurstons foreman coming round for some of his packages  as usual hes in an almighty hurry  that place is most as steep as a roof and hes coming down it at a gallop  the prospectors glanced at each other and one of them said lend me a hand somebody to heave our sick partner aboard  black was unceremoniously deposited upon the platform of the nearest car where he sat blinking vacantly at the assembly while the conductor leaning out from the door of the baggagecar looked back towards the rider who was clattering through a dust cloud down the street as he asked anybody else besides the tired man  is that fellow yonder coming  no answered the prospector  hes only wanting one of those cases youve just dumped out  likes to fancy his times precious  i know him  the conductor waved his hand the big bell clanged and the train had just rolled with a rattle over a trestle ahead when mattawa tom grimed with thick red dust flung himself down beside the agents office  has a darkfaced thief in a plug hat with two holes in the top of it gone out on the cars he shouted and the spectators admitted that such a person boarded the train  why didnt you come in two minutes earlier tom one of them inquired  he lit out with two strangers  has he been stealing something  hes been doing worse and id have been in on time but that i stopped ten minutes to help freighter louis cut loose the two live oxen left him said the foreman breathlessly  one wheel came off his wagon going down the clearwater trail and the whole blame outfit pitched over into a ravine  theres several thousand dollars worth of our boring machines smashed up and louis who has pretty well split his head is cussing the man who took the cotter out of his wheel hub  the two prospectors were heartily tired of their charge by the time they passed him off as the sick employé of an american firm at the nearest station to the washington border  when black showed signs of waking up he was soothed with medicated liquor and his guardians who several times had high words with the conductor at last unloaded him in a station hewn out of the forests encircling puget sound where they managed to hoist him into a spring wagon  black leaned against one of the men for he was feeling distressfully ill  his head throbbed his vision was hazy and his throat was dry  blinking down at the rows of wooden houses among the firs and the tall spars of vessels behind them he said this isnt frisconot half big enough  somebody made mistake somewhere  say  lemme out im going back to the depot  youre coming along with us was the decided answer  sit down at once before we make you  black slowly doubled up a still formidable fist and grasping a rail lurched to and fro unsteadily  lemme out fore i kill somebody claim rightsh of british citizensh he said  youll get them if youre not careful was the threat and the speaker jerked blacks feet from under him  i was told to remind you if you made trouble that a sheriff on this side of the frontier had some papers describing you  theres one or two patrolmen yonder handy  it was an accident temporized black endeavoring to pull his scattered wits together  juss so was the answer given with a gesture of indifference  i was only told a name for the patrolmen and to remind you that a man who knows all about it has got his eye on you  black leered upon him with drunken cunning then his face grew stolid and he said nothing further until the wagon drew up in a bystreet before a door hung across with quaint signboards of chinese characters  the door opened and closed behind him when his companions knocked and black who recognized a curious sour smell choked out gimme long drink of ice watah  he drained the cool draught that was brought him then flinging himself on a pile of matting in a corner of a dim room sank forthwith into slumber  he had intended to pretend to sleep but to lie awake and think  his custodians however had arranged things differently and blacks wits were not working up to their usual power  whenever railroad extension or mining enterprise provided high wages for all strong enough to earn them and crews deserted wholesale seamen were occasionally shipped in a very irregular fashion from the ports of the pacific slope  at the time black was brought into one of the seaboard cities the purveying of drugged and kidnaped mariners had risen to be almost a recognized profession  it accordingly happened that when the unfortunate black first became clearly conscious of anything again he heard the gurgle of sliding water close beside his head and opening his eyes caught sight of a smoky lamp that reeled to and fro in very erratic fashion  moisture dripped from the beams above him and there was a sickly smell which seemed familiar  black who had been to sea before decided that he caught the aroma of bilge water  rows of wooden shelves tenanted by recumbent figures became discernible and he started with dismay to the full recognition of the fact that he was in a vessels forecastle  somebody or something was pounding upon the scuttle overhead  a black gap opened above him a rush of cold night wind swept down followed by a gruff order  turn out watch below and help get sail upon her  stir round before i put a move on to you  men scrambled from the wooden shelves growling as they did so  two lost their balance on the heaving floor went down headlong and lay where they fell  when a man in long boots floundered down the ladder black sat up in his bunk  now theres going to be trouble  some blame rascals have run me off aboard a lumber ship he said  correct observed a man who was struggling into an oilskin jacket youre blame well shanghaied like the rest of us and as the mates a rustler youve got to make the best of it  hello  whats the matter with you  not feeling spry this morning or is it hot water youre waiting for the mate said jerking black out of his bunk as he spoke  great columbus  what kind of a stiff do you call yourself  up you go  black went with all the expedition he was capable of and blundering out through the scuttle stood shivering on a slant of wet and slippery deck  a brief survey showed him that he was on board a fullrigged ship timber laden about to be cast off by a tug  there was a fresh breeze abeam  looking forward he could see dark figures hanging from the highpointed bowsprit that rose and dipped and beyond them the lights of a tug reeling athwart a strip of whitestreaked sea mountains dimly discernible towered in the distance and he fancied it was a little before daybreak  bursts of spray came hurtling in through the foremast shrouds and the whine and rattle of running wire and chain fell from the windy blackness overhead whence the banging of loosened canvas came to his ears  glancing aloft he watched the great arches of the halfsheeted topsails swell blackly out and then collapse again with a thunderous flap  somebody was shouting from the slanted topgallantyard that swung in a wide arc above them but black had no time for further inspection  lay aloft and loose maintopsails  are you figuring we brought you here to admire the scenery a hoarse voice challenged  halfdazed and sullenly savage black had still sense enough to reflect that it would be little use to expect that the harassed mate would listen to reason then  clawing his way up the ratlines he laid his chest upon the maintopsailyard and worked his way out to the lower end of the long inclined spar  here still faint and dizzy he hung with the footrope jammed against his heel as he felt for the gasket that held the canvas to the yard  swinging through the blackness across a space of tumbling foam he felt a horrible unsteadiness  there were other men behind him for he could hear them swearing and coughing until a black wall of banging canvas sank beneath him when somebody roared sheet her home  then a hail came down across the waters from the tug  there was a loud splash beneath the bows while shadowy figures that howled a weird ditty as they hove the hawser in rose and fell black against the foamflecked sea on the dripping forecastle  nobody had missed black who now sat astride the yard watching the tug as the ship listing over further and commencing to hurl the spray in clouds about her plunging bows gathered way  the steamboat would slide past very close alongside and he saw a last chance of escape  moving out to the very yardarm he clutched the leebrace which rope led diagonally downwards to the vessels depressed rail  he looked below a moment bracing himself for the perilous attempt  the tug was close abreast of the ships forecastle now evidently waiting with engines stopped until the vessel should pass her  the crew was still heaving in the cable or loosing the topgallants and froth boiled almost level with the depressed rail  black was a poor swimmer but he could keep his head above water for a considerable time  if the tug did not start her engines within the next few seconds she must drive close down on him  otherwisebut filled with the hope of escape and the lust for revenge black was willing to take the risk  he hooked one knee around the brace gripped it between his ankles and slackened the grip of his hands  the topsails slid away from him the spray rushed up below his feet struck the rail and the next moment he was down in utter blackness and conscious of a shock of icy cold water he rose gasping and swung around buffeted in the vessels eddying wake  there was no shouting on board her and with a choking cry he struck out for the black shape of the tug now only a short distance away  somebody heard and flung down a line  he clutched at it and by good fortune grasped it  head downward he was drawn on board by the aid of a long boathook and hauled dripping before the skipper  did you fall or jump in asked the skipper  i jumped confessed black putting a bold face on it and the master of the towboat laughed  shanghaied i guess he said  well i dont blame you for showing your grit  the master of that lumber wagon is a blame avaricious insect  he beat us down until all we got out of him will hardly pay for the coal we usedthats what he did  so if you slip ashore quietly when we tie up hell think you pitched over making sail and ill keep my mouth shut  accordingly it happened that next morning black who had left the wooden city before daylight to tramp back to the bush sat down to consider his next move  theres one thing tolerably certain black christys drowned and hell just stop drowned until it suits him he decided  next though hes not over fond of it theres lots of work for a good carpenter in this country and newspapers are cheap  so when its worth his while to strike in with the thurston company and get even with the other side hell probably hear of it  he laughed a little as he once more read the message on a strip of pulpy paper somebody had slipped into his pocket   you are going to china for your health and you had better stop there if you want to keep clear of trouble   black christy got upon his feet again and departed into the bush where he wandered for several weeks building fences and splitting shingles for the ranchers in return for food and shelter until he found work and wages at a sawmill  shortly after he was employed at the mill the director who held leslies receipt sat in his handsome offices with the englishman  a newspaper lay open on the table before him and the director smiled as he read ship maria carmony timber laden for china meeting continuous headwinds after sailing from this port put into cosechas cal for shelter and her master reported the loss of a seaman when making sail in the straits of san juan  the mans name was t slater and must have been a stranger as nobody appears to have known him in this city  those fellows havent managed it badly he commented  anyway theres an end of him  they told me they had some trouble over it and i gave them fifty dollars extra said leslie  they used the hint you mentionedsaid it worked well  but the two men are always likely to turn up unfortunately  it wouldnt count the other answered confidently  you will have to bluff them off if they do  deny the whole thingnobody would believe themits quite easy  it would have been different with that confounded black for he would have had thurstons testimony  the joke of the whole thing is that although he knew i held evidence which would likely hang him with a jury of miners its tolerably certain black never did the thing he was wanted for  thus the two parties interested remained contented and only thurston was left bewildered and furious at the loss of a witness who might be valuable to him  moreover the destruction of machinery which having been made specially for thurston in england could not be replaced for months  and not once did it ever occur to his subordinate english jim that he himself had furnished the clue which led to the abduction of the missing man     chapter xx  under the stanley pines  it was a pleasant afternoon when millicent leslie stood in the portico of her villa which looked upon the inlet from a sunny ridge just outside vancouver  like the other residences scattered about the dwelling quaintly suggested a dolls houseit was so diminutively pretty with its carved veranda bright green lattices and spotless white paint picked out with shades of paler green and yellow  flowers filled tiny borders and behind the house small firs spared by the ax stood rigid and somber  with clear sunshine heating upon it and the blue waters sparkling close below the tiny villa was so daintily attractive that one might almost suppose its inhabitants could carry neither care nor evil humor across its threshold but there was disgust and weariness in millicents eyes as she glanced from the little ponycarriage waiting at the gate to her husband leaning against a pillar  leslie was evidently in a complacent frame of mind and he did not notice his wifes expression  there was a smile upon his puffy face which suggested pride of possession  it was justifiable for mrs leslie was still a distinctly handsome woman and she knew how to dress herself  you will meet very few women who excel you and the team is unique he remarked exultantly  drive around by some of the big stores and let folks see you before you turn into the park  since that affair of thurstons i am almost beginning to grow proud of you  isnt it somewhat late in the day was the answer and millicents tone was chilly  if you had wished to pay me a compliment that was not intended ironically it would have been wiser to omit all reference to the subject you mentioned  it is done nowand heaven knows why i told youbut i cant thank you for reminding me of a deed i am ashamed of  further i understood the ponies were for my pleasure and i have stooped far enough in your interest without displaying myself as an advertisement of a prosperity which does not exist  leslie laughed unpleasantly noticing the flash in the speakers eyes before he rejoined perhaps it is tardy praise i give you but regarding your last remark to pretend you have achieved prosperity is so far as i can see the one way to attain it and i have a promising scheme in view  it is not a particularly pleasant part to play and there was a time when it appeared very improbable that either of us would be forced as you say to stoop to it  neither was it my ambition which brought about the necessity  as to the poniesi had fancied they might do their part too but they are a reward for services rendered in finding me a clue to the missingman mystery nobody need know that theyre not quite our own  now you have got them isnt it slightly unfair to blame me because you were willing to earn them  i suppose so admitted millicent  still i cant help remarking that you take the mans usual part of blaming the woman for whatever happens  today i will not drive through the city but straight into the park  leslie said nothing further but followed his wife to the gate  on his way to his office he turned and looked after her with a frown as she rattled her team along the uneven road  she was a vain and covetous woman with a bias towards intrigue but there had been times since her marriage when she despised herself and as a natural consequence blamed her husband  sometimes she hated thurston also though more often she was sensible of vague regrets and grew morbid thinking of what might have been  now she flushed a little as she glanced at the ponies and remembered that they were the price of treachery  the animals were innocent but she found satisfaction in making them feel the sting of the whip  she looked back at the city  it rose in terraces above the broad inleta maze of wooden buildings giving place to stone  over its streets hung a wire network raised high on lofty poles which would have destroyed the beauty of a much fairer city  back of the city rose the somber forest over which at intervals towered the blasted skeleton of some gigantic pine  millicent felt that she detested both the city with its crude mingling of primitive simplicity and western luxury and the life she lived in it  it was a life of pretense and struggle in which she suffered bitter mortifications daily  presently she reined the team in to a walk as she drove under the cool shade of the primeval forest which with a wisdom not common in the west the inhabitants of vancouver have left unspoiled as nature  a few drives have been cut through the trees and between the long rows of giant trunks she could catch at intervals the silver shimmer of the straits  in this park there was only restful shadow  its silence was intensified by the soft thud of hoofs  a dim perspective of tremendous trees whose great branches interlocked forming arches for the roof of somber green very far above lured her on  millicent felt the spell of the silence and sighed remembering how the lover whom she had discarded once pleaded that she would help him in a life of healthful labor  she regretted that she had not consented to flee with him to the new country  now she was tied to a man she despised and who had put her so she considered to open shame  she could not help comparing his weak greedy yet venomous nature with the others courage clean purpose and transparent honesty  i was a fool ten times a fool but it is too late she told herself and then tightening her grip on the reins she started with surprise the man to whom her thoughts had strayed was leaning against a hemlock with his eyes fixed on her face  it was the first time they had met since she played the part of delilah and in spite of her customary selfcommand millicent betrayed her agitation  a softer mood was upon her and she had the grace to be ashamed  still it appeared desirable to discover whether he suspected her  i was quite startled to see you geoffrey but i am very glad  it is almost too hot for walking  wont you let me drive you she said with flurried haste  if geoffrey hesitated millicent noticed no sign of it beyond that he was slow in answering  he was conscious that mrs leslie looked just then a singularly attractive companion but she was the wife of another man and of late he had felt a vague alarm at the confidences she seemed inclined to exchange with him  nevertheless he could find no excuse at the moment which would not suggest a desire to avoid her and with a word of thanks he took his place at her side  i came down to consult my friend mr thomas savine on business he explained  i had one or two other matters to attend to and promised to overtake him and his wife during their stroll  i must have missed them  what a pretty team  have you had the ponies long  millicents wellgloved fingers closed somewhat viciously upon the whip for the casual question was unfortunate but she smiled as she answered and she chatted gayly until in an interlude thurston felt prompted to say  coincidences are sometimes striking are they not  you remember the last time we met suggesting that i was fortunate in having no enemies among the mountains  yes she replied shrinking a little i dobut do you know that it makes one shiver to talk about glaciers and snow on such a perfect day  a man of keener perceptions reading the speakers face would have changed the subject at once and millicent had earned his tactful consideration  it was a good impulse which prompted her to place herself beyond the reach of further temptation  geoffrey however was unobservant that afternoon  i am certainly tired of glaciers and snow and other unpleasant things myself and was merely going to say that shortly after i last talked with you i discovered another instance of an unknown enemys ingenuity he went on  a wagon we had chartered upset down a steep ravine and several costly pieces of machinery i had brought out from england and can hardly replace were smashed to pieces  ah responded millicent staring straight before her  what a pity still accidents of that description must be fairly common where the mountain roads are bad  they are but this was not an accident  we found that somebody had pulled out the cotter or iron pin which held the wagon wheel on  did any of your own men do it millicent inquired concealing her eagerness and thurston answered with pride in his tone  my own men risk their lives almost every day in my service  there is not one among them capable of treacherynow  we made tolerably certain it was the work of two strangers who hung about the neighboring settlement and disappeared immediately after the accident  millicents eyes flashed her white teeth were set together and filled with hot indignation against her husband she lashed the ponies viciously  there were several reasons for what she had done including a dislike to miss savine but perhaps the greatest was the sordid fear of poverty  now she saw that her husband had tricked her  she had stooped to save his position and not to enable him to work further injury for thurston  the innocent ponies were leslies gift and the smart of the lash she drew across their sleek backs appeared vicarious punishment  have i displeased you geoffrey asked  no replied millicent  displeased me  how could i resent anything you might either say or do  have i not heaped injury upon you  she turned to gaze straight at him with a curious glitter in her eyes thurston bewildered by it and by the traces of illsuppressed passion in her voice grew distinctly uneasy  he was glad that one of the ponies showed signs of growing restive under its punishment  steady millicent  theyre a handsome pair but not far off bolting and theres no parapet to yonder bridge he cautioned  in place of an answer the woman again flicked one of the beasts viciously with the whip and next moment the light vehicle lurched forward with a whir of gravel hurled up by the wheels  the team had certainly shied and the road curved sharply to the unguarded bridge over a little creek  this is my business declared geoffrey wrenching the reins from her grasp  sit well back throw the whip down and clutch the rail fast then he stood upright grasping the lines in his hard hands  it was however evident that he could not steer the ponies around the bend and the fall to the rocks beneath the bridge might mean death  hold fast for your life he shouted and let the team run straight on  there was a heavy shock as the light wheels struck a fallen branch on leaving the graded road  the vehicle lurched and millicent whose eyes were wide with terror screamed faintly  geoffrey still stood upright driving the team straight ahead down a more open glade of the forest  he knew that the stems of the fern and the soft ground beneath would soon bring them to a standstill if they did not strike a treetrunk first  the going was heavy and with a plunge or two the ponies stopped on the edge of a thicket  geoffrey alighting soothed the trembling creatures with some difficulty led them back to the road and taking his place again turned towards millicent  it appeared necessary that he should soothe her too for though generally a selfpossessed person the emotions of the last few minutes had proved too much for her  she had suffered from remorse disgust with herself rage against her husband and to these there had also been added the fear of sudden death  it ended better than it might have done said geoffrey awkwardly very sorry but you must really be careful in using the whip to the ponies  shall i get down and bring you some water millicent  you look faint  the fright has made you ill  no millicent denied  i am not ill only startled a littleand very grateful  instinctively she moved a little nearer him when geoffrey handed her the reins again  he bent his head and smiled reassuringly  millicent was white in the face and shivered a littleshe was also very pretty and it would have been unkind not to try to comfort her  whether it was love of power dislike to her husband or perhaps something more than this even the woman was not then sure but she took full advantage of the position and the ponies walked undirected while geoffrey essayed to chase away her fears  he bent his head lower towards her and millicent smiled at him with apparently shy gratitude  lifting his eyes a moment geoffrey set his teeth as he met the coldly indifferent gaze of helen who came towards them in company with mr and mrs thomas savine  millicent also saw the three savines and either tempted by jealousy of the girl or by mere vanity managed to convey a subtle expression of triumph in her smile of greeting possibly neither thomas savine nor geoffrey would have understood the meaning of the smile had they seen it but helen read it and it was with the very faintest bend of her head that she acknowledged thurstons salutation  geoffrey was silent after they had driven by but millicent who seemed to recover her spirits chatted gayly and even said flattering things of miss savine  meantime helen felt confused hurt and angry  it was true that she had rejected thurstons suit but she had found his loyalty pleasant and had believed implicitly in his rectitude  now a hot color rose to her temples as she remembered that it was the second time she had seen him under circumstances which suggested that he had transferred the homage offered her to a married woman  she felt the insult as keenly as if he had struck her  the dominion had not progressed so far in one direction as the great republic to the south of it neither are friendships or flirtations of the kind looked upon as leniently as they are in tropical colonies and there was a good deal of the puritan in helen savine  well imjust rattled  thats mrs leslie remarked thomas savine thurston goes straight and steady but what in the name of  mrs savine whose one weakness was medicine flashed a warning glance at him and hastened to answer perhaps for the benefit of helen who came up just then  there is not a straighter man in the dominion and one could stake their last cent on the honor of geoffrey thurston she declared from several things ive heard ive settled thats just a dangerous woman  helen heard and knowing her friendship for the young engineer guessed her aunts motive  the explanation in any case would not have improved the position much for if the woman were utterly unprincipled which she could well believe why should the man who had of his own will pledged himself to herbut she flushed again as she refused to follow that line of thought further  nevertheless she clenched a little hand in a manner that boded ill for thurston when next he sought speech with her  afterwards she endeavored to treat the incident with complete indifference and succeeded in deceiving her uncle only for in spite of her efforts her face and carriage expressed outraged dignity  her aunt was not in the least deceived and her eyes twinkled now and then as she chattered on diverse topics while the party drove leisurely towards the city  when leslie returned home from his office he found his wife awaiting him with the disdainful look upon her face which he had learned to hate  whats the matter now millicent  has something upset your usually pacific temper he asked with a sneer  yes was the direct answer  when you last asked my assistance you as usual lied to me  i helped you to trace youryour confederate because you told me it was the only way to escape ruin  for once i believed you which was blindly foolish of me  i met mr thurston and learned from him how somebody had plotted to destroy his machinery  he did not know it was you and i very nearly told him  dont be a fool millicent leslie admonished  im sick of these displays of temperthey dont become you  i tell you i plotted nothing except to get my man into my own hands again  the other rascals exceeded their orders on their own responsibility  oh you would wear out any poor mans patience  folks in my position dont do such childish things as hire people to upset wagons loaded with machinery  i do not believe you replied millicent and leslie laughed ironically  i dont know that it greatly matters whether you do or not  have you any more such dutiful things to say  just this  one hears of honor among thieves and it is evident you cannot rise even to that  you have once more tricked me and henceforward i warn you that you must carry on your work in your own way  further if i hear of any more plotting to do thurston injury i shall at once inform him  then leslie gripped her arm until his fingers left their mark on the soft white flesh i warn you that it will be so much the worse for you  good heavens why dont youbut go and dont tempt me to say what i feel greatly tempted to  millicent shook off his grasp moved slowly away turning to fling back a bitter answer from the halfopened door  confound her said leslie refilling the glass upon the table  now what the devil tempted me to ruin all my prospects by marrying that woman     chapter xxi  reparation  you will have to go said henry leslie glancing sharply at his wife across the breakfasttable as he returned her an open letter which had lately arrived by the english mail  i hardly know where to find the money for your passage out and home just now and you will want new dresseswomen always seem to  still we cant afford to miss an opportunity and it may prove a good investment he added reflectively  millicent sighed as she took the letter and ignoring her husbands words read it through again  it had been written by a relative a member of the legal profession and requested her to return at once to england  the stern old man who had reared her was slowly dying and had expressed an urgent wish to see her  isnt that the man who wanted you to marry thurston and when you disappointed him washed his hands of both of you leslie inquired there were reasons why i hadnt the pleasure of duly making the acquaintance of your relatives but i think you said he was tolerably wealthy and as he evidently desires a reconciliation you must do your best to please him  let me see  you might catch the next new york cunarder or the allan boat from quebec  millicent looked up at him angrily  she was not wholly heartless and her kinsman had not only provided for her after her parents died in financial difficulties but in his own austere fashion he had been kind to her  accordingly her husbands comments jarred upon her  i should certainly go even if i had to travel by colonist car and steerage she declared  i should do so if there were no hope of financial benefit which is after all very uncertain for anthony thurston is not the man to change his mind when he has once come to a determination  the fact that he is dying and asks for me is sufficientthough it is perhaps useless to expect you to believe it  we must all die some day was the abstracted answer  hardly an original observation is it  but it would be folly to let such a chance pass and i must try to spare you  if you really feel it i sympathize with you and had no intention of wounding your sensibilities but as unfortunately circumstances force us to consider these questions practically you willwell you will do your best with the old man millicent  to put it so you owe a duty to me  leslie and his wife had by this time learned to see each others real self naked and stripped of all disguise and the sight was not calculated to inspire either with superfluous delicacy  the man however overlooked the fact that his partner in life still clung to a last grace of sentiment and could on occasion deceive herself  i owe you a duty  how have you discharged yours to me she said reproachfully  do not force me to oppose you harry but if you are wise go around to the depot and find out when the steamers sail  yes my dear leslie acquiesced with a smile which he did not mean to be wholly ironical  would it be any use for me to say that i shall miss you  no answered millicent though she returned his smile  you really would not expect me to believe you  still if only because of the rareness of such civility i rather like to hear you say so  mrs leslie sailed in the first cunarder and duly arrived at a little station in the north of england where a dogcart was waiting to drive her to crosbie ghyll  she had known the man who drove it long before and he told her with full details how anthony thurston having come down from an ironworking town to visit the owner of the dilapidated mansion had been wounded by a gun accident while shooting  the wound was not of itself serious but the old mans health was failing and he had not vitality enough to recover from the shock  meantime while millicent leslie was driven across the bleak brown moorlands anthony thurston lay in the great bare guestchamber at crosbie ghyll  he had been a hard determined man a younger son who had made money in business while his brothers died poor clinging to the land and it was with characteristic grimness that he was quietly awaiting his end  the narrow deepsunk window in front of him was open wide though the evening breeze blew chilly from the fells which rose blackly against an orange glow  though he manifested no impatience the sunset light beating in showed an expectant look in his eyes  a much younger man sat at a table close by and laid down the pen he held when the other said  that will do halliday  is there any sign of the dogcart yet  you are sure she will come tonight  there is a vehicle of some kind behind the larches but i cannot see it clearly was the answer  you can rest satisfied sir for if mrs leslie has missed the train she will arrive early tomorrow  tomorrow may be too late said the old man  i do not feel well tonight  yes she will come  millicent is like her father and though he ruined himself it was not because he hadnt a keen eye for the main chance  because i was a lonely man and because in my struggling days her mother was kind to me i was fond of her  you neednt be jealous halliday  you will have the winding up of my estate and it wont affect your share  there was a vein of misanthropic irony in most of what anthony thurston said but the other man had the same blood in him and answered quickly  my own business is flourishing and i have tried to serve you hitherto because of the relationship  i have no other reason sir  no assented thurston with something approaching a laugh  there is no doubt you are genuine  millicent took after her father and in spite of it i was fond of her  tell me again  did you consider her happy when you saw her in canada  as i said before it is a delicate question but i did not think so her husband struck me as a particularly poor sample sir  ah  she married the rascal suddenly out of pique perhaps when geoffrey left her  i could never quite get at the truth of that story which of course was framed in the conventional way but even now though hes nearer of kin than millicent i cant quite forgive geoffrey  you saw him you said on your last visit to those mines  the speakers tone was indifferent but his eyes shoved keen interest and halliday answered  if ever the whole truth came out i dont think you would blame geoffrey sir  individually i would take his word againstwell against any womans solemn declaration  yes i saw him  he was making a pretty fight singlehanded against almost overwhelming natural difficulties  why asked anthony thurston  a woman out there eh  are you pleading his cause halliday  remember if you convince me he may be another participant in the property  he did not explain all his motives to me and nobody ever gained much by attempting to force a thurstons confidence  if you were not my kinsman and were in better health i should feel tempted to recommend you to place your affairs in other hands  confound the property  there was a curious cackle in the sick mans throat and the flicker of a smile in his sunken eyes  i can believe it  you are tarred with the same brush as geoffrey the obstinate fool must go out there with a couple of hundred pounds or so when he knew he had only to humor me by marrying millicent and wait for prosperity  and yet in one way im glad he did  he never wrote me to apologize or explainstill thats hardly surprising either  i dont know that any of us ever troubled much about other folks opinions or listened to advice  here am i who might have lived another ten years dying because when an officious keeper warned me i went the opposite way  i hear wheels halliday  it is the dogcart halliday announced  yesi see mrs leslie  thank god said the sick man  bring her here as soon as shes ready  meantime send in the doctor  i feel worse tonight  the light was dying fast when millicent leslie came softly into the great bare room and for anthony thurston had paid for overtaxing his waning strength her heart smote her as she looked upon him  she could recognize the stamp of fast approaching death  there was an unusual gentleness in his eyes which brightened at her approach and with the exception of geoffrey whose sympathy filled her with shame it was long since anyone had looked upon her with genuine kindliness  so it was with real sorrow she knelt beside the bed and kissed him  i was shocked to hear of your accident but it was some time ago and you are recovering she remarked trying to speak hopefully but with a catch in her breath  i am dying was the answer and millicent sobbed when the withered fingers rested on her hair  i wanted to see you before i went  i was fond of you milly and youyou and geoffrey angered me  it was not your fault the somewhat strained voice added wistfully  hei dont wish to hurt you or hear the stereotyped version he of course endorsed  he left you  millicent leslie was not wholly evil  she had a softer side and in the moment of reconciliation dreaded to inflict further pain upon one to whom she owed much  if the truth was not in her there was one thing in her favor so at least the afterwards tried to convince herself  prompted by a desire to soothe a dying mans last hours she voluntarily accepted a very unpleasant part  she was thankful her head was bent as she said it was perhaps my fault  i would noti could not consent to humor him in what appeared a senseless projectand so geoffrey went to canada  she felt the old mans hand move caressingly across her hair  poor millicent he sympathized  and you chose another husband  are you happy with him out there  but stay it is twilight and the old place is gloomy  if you would like them ask for candles geoffreygeoffrey left you  millicent did not desire candles but gently drew herself away anthony thurstons tenderness had touched her and with sudden compunction she remembered that she had deceived a dying man  he believed her but she did not wish him to see her face  she drew a chair towards the bed and for a moment looked about her striving to collect her scattered thoughts  framed by the stoneribbed window the afterglow still shimmered a pale luminous green and one star twinkled over the black shoulder of crosbie fell  curlews called mournfully down in the misty mosses and when she turned her head the sick mans face showed faintly livid against the darker coverings of the bed  for a moment she felt tempted to make full confession or at least excuses for geoffrey but anthony thurston spoke again just then and the moment was lost  i asked are you happy in canada millicent he repeated and there was command as well as kindness in his tone  anthony thurston mine owner and iron works director was dying but he had long been a ruler of stiffnecked men and the habit of authority still remained with him  it struck millicent that he was in many ways very like geoffrey  i am not she admitted  i would not have told you if you had not insisted  it is the result of my own folly and there is no use complaining  anthony thurston stretched out a thin clawlike hand and laid it on one of her own  tell me he said  we are poor  that is my husbands position is precarious and it is a constant struggle to live up to it  then why do you try  millicent sighed as she answered  it is i believe necessary or he would lose it while he aims at obtaining sufficient influence to win him a connection if he resumed his former land business  from what i know it is a rascally business but there is more than this  my time is very short millicent but it seems such a very little while since a brighthaired girl who atoned for anothers injury sat upon my knee and for the sake of those days i can still protect you  your husband treats you ill  there was a vibration in the strained voice which more strongly reminded the listener of geoffreys and awoke her bitterness against the man she had married  it was so long since she had taken a living soul into her confidence that she answered impulsively there is no use hiding the truth from you  he does not treat me well  then she related the story of her married life and anthony thurston listened gravely comprehending more than she meant to tell him for when she had finished he commented you have neither been over loyal nor over wisetoo quick to see the present gain blind to the greater one behindbut it is my part to help not blame you and i will try to do so  it is dark now  please ask for my draught and the candles then i want you to tell me about geoffrey  you have met him in canada  millicent retiring stood for a few minutes looking down from a narrow window in the bare stone corridor on to the moor  there was no moon but the night was luminous for the stars twinkled with a windy glitter that was flung back by a neighboring tarn  the call of the curlew seemed more mournful the crying of lapwing rose from the meadow land and she started at a hollow hoot as an owl swept by on muffled wing the night voices filled her with an eerie sensationthere was she recollected always something creepy about crosbie ghyll and for millicent was superstitious she shivered again at the reflection that she had cheated a dying man  but she could make partial reparation to the living at least and when she came back with the candles there was resolve in her face  you asked me about geoffrey  he has no reason to be ashamed of his record in canada she said  i will tell you what i know from the beginningand i hope i shall tell it well  it was a relief to do so and the story of geoffreys struggle and prospective triumph was a stirring one as it fell from the lips of the woman who had thrice wronged him  she guessed how her husbands employers had plotted having gathered much from the talk of his guests and the old man listened eagerly until he struck the coverlet when she concluded  grim satisfaction was stamped upon his twitching face  it is a brave story  i thank you millicent you told it very well ay the old blood tellsand i was proud of the lad  went his own way in spite of mehe is my kinsman what should i expect of him standing alone for a broken master with cunning and wealth against him and his last dollar in the scheme  quite in keeping with traditions and therell be broken crowns before they beat him down  the dying man who had fought perhaps as stubbornly all his life long gasped once or twice before he added you must go now millicent send halliday to me  millicent went out with a throbbing pulse and downcast eyes and when the lawyer came in thurston said read over that partly completed will  had you not better rest until tomorrow sir was the answer  dr maltby warned you  you ought to know by this time that i seldom take a warning and tomorrow may be too late  write and write quickly  after payment of all bequests above balance of real estate to yourself and forsyth as trustees to apply and use for the individual benefit of millicent leslie  if her husband lays hands upon it ill haunt you  you have power to nominate geoffrey thurston as your cotrustee  god knows what may happen and her rascally husband may get himself shot by somebody he has swindled some day  what i wished for mightnt follow then  im paying you to make my will and not dictate to me  repeat it as many times as may appear necessary to let my meaning show clearly through your legal phraseology  i have got it down sir the writer told him presently  now after deductions enumerated all my floating investments in mines stocks and shares to geoffrey thurston to hold or sell as pleases him unconditionally  bequeathed in the hope that this will help him to confound his enemies  it was written signed and witnessed by musker and the surgeon then anthony thurston asked once more and very faintly for millicent  he drew her down beside him and took her hand in his thin gnarled one before he said  i have done my best for you millyand again thank you for the story after what halliday said it has helped to conquer an old bitterness andfor my work is finishedi can die contented  i may be gone tomorrow and my strength is spent  goodby milly  god bless you  millicent stooped and kissed him with a sense of shame  before morning all power of speech or volition left anthony thurston and twelve hours later he was dead     chapter xxii  a reprieve  it was with a heavy heart that geoffrey thurston turned over the papers thomas savine spread out before him in the vancouver offices  im almost scared to do any more figuring said savine  money is going to be uncommonly tight with us and to make things worse i can neither realize nor borrow  my brothers investments are way below par now and the first sign of any weakness would raise up an opposition that would finish us  i cant stay here forever and poor julius is steadily getting worse instead of better  are you still certain you can get the work done before the winters through  yes asserted geoffrey  if i can get the machinery and sufficient menwhich means money  theres a moderate fortune waiting us once we can run the water out of the valley and its worth a desperate effort to secure it  we have made a good many daring moves since my brother gave me his power of attorney and i have sunk more of my own money than my partners who have backed me pluckily care about  still i cant see how im going to meet your estimate nohow  you have just got to do it geoffrey insisted  it is the part you chose  at my end ill stop for nothing short of manslaughter  we simply cant afford to be beaten and were not going to be  i hope not and thomas savine sighed dubiously  your assurance is refreshing geoffrey but i own up i cant seewell weve done enough for one day  come round and spend the evening with me  mrs savine is anxious to see you  geoffrey hesitated for a few seconds and thomas savine smiled at something which faintly amused him  remembering helens freezing look and his occupation when she last saw him geoffrey felt that it might not be pleasant to meet her so soon  then because he was a proud man he endeavored to accept the invitation with cordiality  i am glad you will come said thomas savine with a trace of the dry humor which occasionally characterized him  geoffrey who felt that in this instance the pleasure was hardly mutual and that helen might not share it with her uncle said nothing further on that subject until mrs savine met him in the hotel corridor  a friendship had grown up between them since the day geoffrey endured the elixir after mending the bicycle and there was a mischievous amusement in the ladys eyes as she said my compliments geoffrey  you are a brave man  i dont deserve them madam  wherein lies the bravery  being at present in perfect health i have no cause to fear you  mrs savine laughed goodnaturedly then laid her hand upon his arm with a friendly gesture  sober earnest i am glad you came  i believe in you geoffrey and like to see a man show the grit thats in him  i am honored returned geoffrey with a little bow  there was a grateful look in his brown eyes which did not quail in the slightest under the ladys scrutiny  in spite of her goodwill he however derived little pleasure from that evening of relaxation  helen showed no open displeasure but he was painfully conscious that what she had seen had been a shock to her it was impossible for him to volunteer an explanation  he was glad to retire with savine and a cigarbox to the veranda and trying to console himself with the reflection that he had at least shown no weaknesshe took his leave early  helen was not present when he bade mrs savine farewell but she saw him stride away over the gravel though she would not ask herself why she felt gratified that he had not stayed away  it was some time later when one day of early winter he sat in his wooden shanty which at that season replaced the tent above the cañon close by english jim was busy writing and geoffrey gnawing an unlighted pipe glanced alternately through the open door at his hurrying workmen and at the letter from thomas savine which he held in his hand  the letter expressed a fear that a financial crisis was imminent tell him he must settle all local bills up to the minute said thurston throwing it across to his amanuensis  i daresay the english makers will wait a little for payment due on machinery  did you find that the amount i mentioned would cover the wages through the winter  only just was the answer  that is unless you could cut some of them a little  not a cent geoffrey replied  the poor devils who risk their lives daily fully earn their money  do you know their wages equal the figure the strikers demanded and you refused to pay  summers told me about that dispute sir ventured english jim  the strikers were not prepared to earn higher payand that one word demanded makes a big difference  hello who is the stranger  mattawa tom was directing a horseman towards the shanty and geoffrey who watched the newcomer with growing interest found something familiar in his face and figure until he rose up in astonishment when the man rode nearer  halliday by all thats wonderful he cried  uncommonly glad to see you but whatever brought you back to this faroff land again  several things was the answer as halliday shaking the snow from his furs dismounted stiffly  strain of overwork necessitated a change my doctor told me  trust estate im winding up comprised doubtful british columbian mining interests and last but not least to see you geoffrey  the mans fur coat was open now and geoffrey who glanced at the black coat beneath it said  im glad you wanted to see me anyway but come in  here jake take the horse to the stable  are my sympathies needed hallidayany of my new friends over yonder dead  halliday stared at him blankly  havent you read the letter i sent you  do you get no english papers he questioned  no to both  i fancy very few people over yonder trouble themselves as to whether im living  how did you address your letter  orchard city or was it orchardville  mrs leslie told me the name of the postoffice and i looked it up on a map  geoffrey thrust his guest into a chair  that explains it  this is orchard valley the other place is away across the province a forlorn hamlet and some oxdriving postmaster has no doubt returned your letter  do you bring bad news  dont keep me in suspense  anthony thurstons dead  died in your old place partly the result of a gun accident answered halliday and geoffrey sat silent for a moment  im sorryyes sincerely he said at last  i can say it freely because as i daresay you know i disappointed him and can in no way benefit by his death  in fact he had the power to refuse me what was morally my right and no doubt he exercised it  still now its too late i feel ashamed that i never tried to patch up the quarrel  poor old anthony  halliday smiled  you are a better fellow than you often lead folks to suppose geoffreyand i quite believe you  such regrets are however generally useless are they not  in this case especially so for anthony thurston forgot the quarrel before he died and sent you his very good wishes  i see i have a surprise in store  you are a beneficiary  he has bequeathed you considerably more than your moral share in the property  thurston strode up and down the shanty before he halted  im glad that though perhaps i deserved it he didnt carry the bitterness into the grave with him he declared with earnestness  we were too much like each other to get on well but there was a time when he was a good friend to me  its no use pretending im not pleased at what you tell meit means a great deal to me  but you must be tired and hungry and i want to talk by the hour to you  halliday did full justice to the meal which the camp cook produced and afterwards the two men sat talking until the short winter afternoon had drawn to a close and the first stars were blinking down on untrodden snows  answering a question halliday said  your shareill show you a complete list when i unpack my thingswill if left invested provide you with a moderate income for a single man  indeed with your spartan tastes you might live in what you would consider luxury  as usual however in such cases the securities are not readily marketable and your interest in some ventures could hardly be summarily realized at any sacrifice  the whole is left to you unconditionally but my advice is decidedly that you hold on  i am sorry geoffrey replied because even at a sacrifice i intend to sell  if youre not too tired to listen a little longer ill try to explain why  halliday listened gravely  then he commented  as anthony thurston said it is characteristic of you and its possible that he would have approved of what on the surface looks like folly  he stated that he hoped the bequest would help you to confound your enemies  but you must act as a business man  you say that if you go deeper your firm might still wind up just solvent then why not abandon the apparently hopeless project and withdraw  follow your profession if you must work or live upon your income  this drainage scheme looks tolerably desperate on your own showing and if selling at a sacrifice you sink all your new possessions in it you may be left utterly cleaned out a beggar  you have no other relatives likely to leave you another competence geoffrey  it cant be helpedor rather i dont want to help it  ive pledged my word and honor to see this undertaking through and i mean to redeem it if it ruins me  now what were you telling me about mrs leslie  halliday explained for some minutes before he said  you are on the spot and its your duty to join us  anthony thurston was always eccentric and has left us a very troublesome charge  her husband is not to get at the money and this discrimination between man and wife is going to be confoundedly awkward  however as im going to stay some little time and if possible shoot a mountain sheep we can discuss it at leisure  thomas savine who came up in a day or two speedily became good friends with halliday  geoffrey had his work to superintend and was suspicious that halliday seized the opportunity his absence afforded to explain what appeared to him a sacrifice of anthony thurstons legacy one evening when halliday was down in the cañon watching the workmen toiling in the river under the lurid blaze of the lucigen thomas savine said  im going to talk straight geoffrey  your friend told me the whole thing and i agree with his opinion  see here you are safe for life if you hold fast to what you have got nowand the lord knows whether we will ever be successful in the cañon  of course the money would help us but it isnt sufficient to make victory dead certain and it would be a drop in the bucket if we came down with a bang as we may very well do  even considering whats at stake i couldnt let you make the plunge without protesting  if i had ten times as much or ten times as little it would all go after the rest replied geoffrey  i appreciate your good intentions but you cant and never will convince me so theres no use talking you will in the meantime say not a word to miss savine on the subject  next morning geoffrey said to his guest  i want you to write out a telegram to your partner in england yonders a mounted messenger waiting for it  hes to sell everything bequeathed to me at the best price he can  you have done your best halliday and i suppose i ought to be more grateful than i am but you see im rather fond than otherwise of a big risk  well ride over with mr savine and call upon my partner today  it was late in the afternoon when the two arrived at the ranch which savine had rented  it was the nearest dwelling to the camp that could be rendered comfortable but lay some distance from it over a very bad trail  helen was not cordial towards geoffrey who left her to entertain halliday and slipped away to the room looking down the valley where his partner sat with a fur robe wrapped about his bent shoulders  savines face had grown very hollow and his eyes were curiously dim  it was good of you to come geoffrey he said how are you getting on in the cañon  famously sir  we are certainly going to beat the river was the prompt answer and remembering the accession of capital geoffreys cheerfulness was real  im hoping to ask miss savine to fire the final shot some time before the snows melt  savine looked at him with a trace of his old keenness and appeared satisfied that the speaker believed in his own prediction  then he smiled as he answered  you do me good geoffrey  good news is better than gallons of medicine and when you make such a promise i feel i can trust you  im grateful but its mighty trying to lie here helpless while another man plays out my last and boldest game for me  lord what wouldnt i give for just three months of my old vigor  still ill never be fit again and as i must lean on somebody im glad it should be you  lean on me  you have given me the chance of my life sir  you dont look quite comfortable there  let me settle that rug for you said geoffrey and as with clumsy gentleness he rearranged the sick mans wrappings helen came unobserved into the room  she read the pity beneath the smile on the younger mans bronze face and noticed how willingly his hard fingers did their unaccustomed work  her heart grew soft towards geoffrey as she heard her fathers sigh of content  the sight touched though for a reason she was ashamed of it also troubled her  unwilling to disturb them she merely smiled when thurston saw her and found herself a seat in a corner  my brains not so clear as it used to be  no use hiding things why began savine and geoffrey who surmised that he had not seen his daughter knocked over a medicine bottle with his elbow and spent some time noisily groping under the table for it  the action might have deceived one of his own sex but helen who wondered what his motive was grew piqued as well as curious  ive been worrying over things lately continued savine  there was one of the ranchers hired men in and he told our folks a mixed story about a sluice gate bursting  you never mentioned it to me  now i have a hazy notion that i made a drawing for a gate one day when i wassick well say  i looked for it afterwards and couldnt find it ive been thinking over it considerable lately  then you are very foolish sir declared geoffrey  of course we have had one or two minor breakages but nothing we were unable to remedy  just now everything is going ahead in the most satisfactory manner  helen who watched the speaker decided that he was concealing something and also fancied her father did not seem quite satisfied  ive been wondering whether it was that gate which burst  see here geoffrey i feel you have had bad trouble isnt it a little mean not to tell me  you will remember im still julius savineand only a little while ago there was no man in the province who dared to try to fool me  a measure of the speakers former spirit revealed itself in a clearer vibration of his voice and raising himself in his chair savine became for a moment almost the man he had been  thurston had determined to hold his fallen leaders credit safe not only before the eyes of others but even in his own and was doing it to the best of his ability  of course we have had troublelots of it but nothing we could not overcome he repeated  if everything went smoothly it would grow monotonous  still you can rest perfectly contented sir and assist us with your judgment in the difficult cases  for instance would you let me know what you think of these specifications  savine who seemed to find a childish pleasure in being consulted forgot his former anxiety and geoffrey leaving him contented slipped out of the ranch and finding a sheltered path among the redwoods paced to and fro  he was presently surprised to see helen move out from among the trees  she had a fur about her shoulders which set off the finelychiselled face above it  nevertheless for once at least he was by no means pleased to see her  i wish to ask you a question she said  of course i have heard there was an inquiry into the breaking of the sluice but neither you nor my uncle thought fit to give me any definite information on the subject  unfortunately my father heard distorted rumors of the accident and has been fretting ever since  as you know this is most detrimental to his failing health and so that i may be the better able to soothe him i want you to tell me all that happened  there is absolutely no cause for uneasiness  as i said we had one or two difficulties which may have been vanquished  your uncle will bear me out in this answered geoffrey who would have spoken more freely had he not feared the girls keenness  helens face which was at first scornful grew anxious as she responded  i have no doubt he would  in fact when i asked him he explained with such readiness that i cannot help concluding you have both conspired to keep me in the dark  can you not see that situated as i am in caring for an invalid who will not let his mind rest uncertainty is almost worse than the knowledge of disaster to me  will you not tell me frankly what you fear  i would do anything to drive your fears away  geoffrey who felt helpless beneath the listeners searching eyes spoke with sympathy in his voice  but i can only say again there is very slight cause for anxiety  helen turned half from him angrily then she faced round again  you are not a good dissembler  if quick at making statements you are not prepared to substantiate them she declared  you would do anything to dispel my fearsbut the one most necessary thing i ask  you have passed through or are now facing a crisis and though some knowledge of it would be of great help to me you do not consider me worthy of your confidence  heaven forbid that i should think so  there is no one more worthybut  helen checked him with a gesture  i desire the simple truth and not indifferent compliments she said you will not tell it to me and i will plead with you no further even for my fathers sake  when will you men learn that a womans discretion is at least equal to your own  with a flash in her eyes she added how dare you once offer what you did to a woman you had no trust in  you are almost cruel geoffrey answered clenching his hand as he mastered his own anger  some day perhaps you will yet believe i tried to do what was best  meantime since i dare not presume to resent it i must try to bear your displeasure patiently  he might have said more but that helen left him abruptly  it is confoundedly hard  once strike a certain vein of bad luck and you can neither get around nor under it but theres no use groaningand what on earth could i have done he said to the whispering firs  he went back presently to the ranch and found helen who apparently did not notice his return chatting with halliday  when the two men bade their host farewell halliday who lingered a few minutes observed to thomas savine  i always knew my friend was reckless but when i spoke as i did i failed to comprehend what was at once his incentive and justification i must thank you for your attempt to aid me but even against the dictates of my judgment i cant help sympathizing with him now  if you dont mind my saying sobecause i see you knowi think what he hopes to win is very well worth the risk  i certainly know and perhaps i am prejudiced in favor of my niece but i feel tempted to agree with you answered savine  there are few better women in the dominion but she is wayward and whether geoffrey will ever win her only heaven knows  meantime though we depend so much upon him i am often ashamed to let him take his chances with us believe me i have endeavored to dissuade him  halliday smiled  i am a kinsman of his and know him well he said it is quite in keeping with traditions that he should be perfectly willing to ruin himself for a woman and i am at least thankful that the woman proves worthy  in this case however i venture to hope the end may be the achievement of prosperity  i generally speak my mind and hope i have not offended you     chapter xxiii  the ultimatum  winter creeping down from the high peaks held the whole valley fast in its icy grip when mrs thomas savine who was seldom daunted by the elements went up from vancouver to persuade her niece to seek sheltered quarters on the sunny coast until spring  her visit was however in this respect a failure for julius savine insisted upon remaining within touch of the reclamation works  though seldom able to reach them he looked eagerly forward to geoffreys brief visits which alone seemed to arouse him from his lethargy  mrs savine and helen sat in the general livingroom at the ranch one day when her brotherinlaw came in leaning heavily upon his partners arm  geoffrey had set his carpenters to build a sleigh and from one hill shoulder bare of timber it was possible with good glasses to see what went on in the cañon  savine was listening with evident satisfaction to the tall frostbronzed man who led him towards the room that he delighted to call his office and mrs savine noticing it smiled gratefully upon geoffrey  worn by anxious watching helen was possibly a little out of humor that afternoon and the sight awoke within her a certain jealousy  she had done her best and had done it very patiently but she had failed to arouse her father to the animation he showed in geoffreys presence  i havent felt so well since i saw you last observed savine oblivious for the moment of his daughter  you wont fail to come back as soon as ever you cansay the day after tomorrow  geoffrey glanced towards helen who made no sign and mrs savine noticed that for a moment his face clouded  then as he turned towards his partner he seemed to make an effort and his expression was confident again  i am afraid i cannot leave the works quite so often  yeswe are progressing at least as well as anyone could expect he said  i will come and consult you whenever i can  in fact there are several points i want your advice upon  come soon urged savine with a sigh  it does me good to talk to youafter the life ive lived this everlasting loafing comes mighty hard to me  i believe once i knew we were victorious i could let go everything and die happy  helen heard and overwrought as she was by nights of assiduous care the speech both pained and angered her  geoffreys answer was not audible as they passed on  he came back alone off his guard for a moment looking worn and weary and mrs savine said  you are tired geoffrey and if you dont appear more lively next time i will attend to you  nodont get scared  it is not physic im going to prescribe now  take this lounge and just sit here where its cosy  talk to helen and me until suppers ready  thurston had been crawling over icecrusted rocks and wading kneedeep in water most of the preceding night  the chair stood temptingly between the two ladies and near the stove  he glanced towards it and helen longingly  some impulse tempted the girl to say  mr thurston has usually so little time to spare that it would be almost too much to hope that he could devote an hour to us  the tone was ironical and geoffrey excusing himself went out  he sighed as he floundered down the snowcumbered trail  there was indignation in the elder ladys voice as she declared  i am ashamed of you helen  the poor man came in too late for dinner and he must be starving  if you had just seen how he looked at you  youd feel mean and sorry if they found him tomorrow frozen hard in the snow  helen could not fancy geoffrey overcome by such a journey because he had missed two meals and she smiled at her aunts dismal picture answering her with a flippancy which increased the elder ladys indignation mr thurston is not a cannibal auntie  i cant figure why you are fooling with that man if you dont want him said mrs savine  oh yes youre going to sit here and listen to some straight talking  isnt he good enough for you  helens face was flushed with angry color  you speak with unpleasant frankness but i will endeavor to answer you she responded  i have told mr thurstonthat is i have tried to warn him that he was expecting the impossible and what more could i do  he is my fathers partner and i cannot refuse to see him  i  mrs savine leaning forward took her nieces hands in her own saying gravely are you certain it is quite impossible  for a moment helen looked startled and her eyes fell  then raising her head she answered have i not told you so  i have been anxious about my father lately and do not feel myself today  surely you have no wish further to torment me  no but i mean to finish what i have to say  do you know all that man is doing for you  he has  but mrs savine ceased abruptly remembering she had in return for her husbands confidence promised secrecy  yes  i think i know everything replied helen with something suspiciously like a sob while her aunt broke her pledge to the extent of shaking her head with a gesture of negation  itit makes it worse for me  i dare not bid him go away and i grow horribly ashamed becausebecause it hurts one to be conscious of so heavy a debt besides he is consoling himself with mrs leslie  geoffrey thurston would be the last man to consider you owed him anything and as to mrs lesliepshaw  its as sure as death geoffrey doesnt care two bits for her  he would never let you feel that debt my dear but the debt is there  from what tom has told me he has declined offer after offer and you know that if he carries this last scheme through the credit and most of the money will fall to your father  i know  the moisture gathered in helens eyes  i am grateful very gratefulas i said ashamed too but my father comes first  i tried to warn geoffrey but he would not take no  i feel almost frightened sometimes lest he will force me to yield against my will but you know that would be a wrong to himand what can i do  helen unclasping her hands from her aunts looked straight before her and mrs savine answered gently not that  noif you cant like him it would not be fair to him  only try to be kind and make quite sure it is impossible  it might have been better for poor geoffrey if he had never mixed himself up with us  you with all your good points are mighty proud my dear but i have seen proud women find out their mistake when it was too late to set things straight  wait and without the help of a meddlesome old woman it will perhaps all come right some day  auntie said helen looking down some minutes later  though you meant it in kindness i am almost vexed with you  i have never spoken of these things to anyone before and though it has comforted me you wont remind mewill you  no  the older woman smiled upon the girl  of course not  but you are pale and worried and i believe that there is nothing that would fix you better than a few drops of the elixir  i think i sent you a new bottle  then though her eyes were misty helen laughed outright as she replied  it was very kind of you but i fear i lost the bottle and have wasted too much time over my troubles  what can i tempt my father with for supper   when geoffrey returned to camp halliday who had arrived that day from vancouver had much to tell him  ive sold your english property and the value lies to your credit in the b o m agency  all you have to do is to draw upon your account he said  as you intend to sink the money in these works i can only wish you the best of good luck  now im starting for home tomorrow and theres the other questionhow to protect the interests of mrs leslie  anthony thurston made a just will and her share while enough to maintain her is not a large one but i dont see yet just how its to be handled  it was the testators special wish that you should join the trustees and that her husband should not lay his hands upon a dollar  from careful inquiries made in vancouver i judge hes a distinctly bad lot  anyway youll have to help us in the meantime geoffrey and in opening a small bank account i made your signature necessary on every check  its a confoundedly unpleasant position under the circumstances  what on earth could my kinsman have been thinking of when he forced it upon me of all men geoffrey responded with a rueful face  still i owe him a good deal and suppose that i must cheerfully acquiesce to his wishes  i cannot take upon myself to determine what the testator thought was the dry answer  he said the estimable mr leslie might either shoot or drink himself to death some day  the late anthony thurston was a tenacious person and you must draw your own conclusions  if there was one thing which more than another tempted me to refuse you every scrap of assistance it was the conclusion i arrived at said geoffrey  however ill try to keep faith with the dead man and heaven send me sense sufficient to steer clear of difficulties  i can trust your honesty any way remarked halliday  theres a heavy load off my mind at last  you are a good fellow geoffrey and excuse the frankness even in questions beyond your usual scope not so simple as you sometimes look  a day or two before this conversation took place henry leslie sitting at his writingtable in the villa above the inlet laid down his pen and looked up gratefully at his wife who placed a strip of stamped paper before him  millicent both smiled and frowned as she noticed how greedily his fingers fastened upon it  it is really very good of you  you dont know how much this draft means to me he said  i wish i neednt take it but i am forced to its practically the whole of the first dole your skinflint trustee made you isnt it  it is a large share was the answer  almost a years allowance and im going to pay off our most pressing debts with the rest  but i am glad to give it to you harry and we must try to be better friends and keep on the safe side after this  i hope we shall replied the man who was touched for once  its tolerably hard for folks like us who must go when the devil drives to be virtuous but i got hold of a few mining shares which promise to pay well now for almost nothing and if they turn up trumps id feel greatly tempted to throw over the company and start afresh  he hurriedly scribbled a little note and millicent turned away with a smile that was not far from a sigh  she had returned from england in a repentant mood and her husband whose affairs had gone smoothly was almost considerate so that following a reconciliation there were times when she cherished an uncertain hope that they might struggle back to their former level  it was on one of the occasions when their relations were not altogether inharmonious that she had promised to give him a draft to redeem the loan director shackleby held like a whip lash over him  had leslie been a bolder man it is possible that his wifes aspirations might have been realized for millicent was not impervious to good influences  unfortunately for her however a freespoken man called shackleby who said that he had been sent by his colleagues who managed the industrial enterprise company called upon thurston and savine together in their city offices  he came straight to the point after the fashion of western business men  julius savine has rather too big a stake in the orchard valley for any one man he said  its ancient history that if as usual with such concerns as ours we hadnt been a day or two too slow we would have held the concessions instead of him  neither need i tell you about the mineral indications in both the reefs and alluvial  now we saw our way to rake a good many dollars out of that valley but when savine got in ahead we just sat tight and watched him ready to act if he found the undertaking too big for him  it seems to me that has happened which explains my visit today  we might be open to buy some of those conditional lands from you  they may never be ours to sell though i hope for the contrary geoffrey replied  exactly said the other  that is why were only ready to offer you outdistrict virgin forest value for the portions colored blue in this plan  in other words we speculate by advancing you money on very uncertain security  geoffrey laughed after a glance at the plan  you have a pretty taste after giving you all the best for a tithe of its future value where do we come in  on the rest declared shackleby coolly  we would pay down the money now and advance you enough on interest to place you beyond all risks in completing operations  though you might get more for the land without this assistance you might get nothing and it will be a pretty heavy check  i suppose i neednt say it was not until lately that we decided to meet you this way  by your leave broke in thomas savine who had been scribbling figures on a scrap of paper which he passed to geoffrey  it bore a few lines scrawled across the foot of it value absurdly low but it might be a good way to hedge against total loss and we could level up the average on the rest  what do you think  geoffrey grasped a pen and the paper went back with the brief answer that it would be a willful sacrifice of miss savines future  suppose we refuse he asked and shackleby stroked his mustache meditatively before he made answer  dont you think that would be foolish  you see we were not unanimous by a long way on this policy and several of our leaders agree with me that we had better stick to our former one  its a big scheme and accidents will happen however careful one may be  then theres the risk of new conditions being imposed upon you by the authorities besides you have a time limit to finish in and mightnt do it especially without the assistance we could in several ways render you you cant have a great many dollars left eithersee  i do said geoffrey with an ominous glitter in his eyes  you neednt speak more plainly  accidents no doubt of the kind you refer to have happened already  they have not however stopped us yet and are not going to  i of course appreciate your delicate reference to your former policy i conclude it was your policy individually  i dont like threats even veiled ones and nobody ever succeeded in coercing me  accordingly when we have drained it well sell you all the land you want at its market value  you cant have an acre at anything like the price you offer now  thats your ultimatum  yes  then im only wasting time and hope you wont be sorry returned shackleby  when he went out geoffrey turned to thomas savine  a declared enemy is preferable to a treacherous ally he observed dryly  that man would never have kept faith with us  i dont know was the answer  of course hes crooked but he has his qualities  anyway id sooner trust him than the invertebrate crawler leslie  a day or two later shackleby called upon leslie in his offices and with evident surprise received the check millicent had given to her husband  i wasnt in any hurry  have some of your titled relatives in the old country left you a fortune he inquired ironically  no was the answer  my folks are mostly distinctly poor commoners i welli have been rather fortunate lately  heres your receipt said shackleby with an embarrassing stare adding when leslie after examining it carefully thrust the paper into the glowing stove careful man  nobody is going to get ahead of you but cant you see that blame paper couldnt have made a cents worth of difference between you and me  well if you still value your connection with the company i have something to tell you  that infernal idiot thurston wont hear of making terms and as you know theres a fortune waiting if we can corral the valley  i can see the desirability but not the means of accomplishing it replied leslie  no and the speaker glanced at him scornfully  well thurston must finish by next summer or his conditional grants are subject to revision while its quite plain he can only work in the cañon in winter  something in the accident line has got to happen  it failed before  shackleby laughed  whats the matter with trying again and keeping on trying  ive got influence enough to double your salary if thurston doesnt get through it will be tolerably easy for this time i dont count on trusting too much to you  ill send you along a man and youll just make a bet with himwell fix the odds presently and theyll be heavy against usthat thurston successfully completes the job in the cañon  the other man bets he doesnt  when it appears judicious well contrive something to draw thurston away for a night or two  but if you know the man and its so easy why not make the bet yourself shackleby smiled pleasantly  because im not secretary hoping to get my salary doubled and a land bonus  there are other reasons but i dont want to hurt your feelings any more than i wish to lacerate those of my worthy colleagues theyll ask no questions and only pass a resolution thanking you for your zealous services  nothing is going to slip up the wrong way but if it did you could only lose your salary and id see you safe on the way to mexico with say enough to start a store and you would be no worse off than before because i figure youd lose the berth unless you chip in with me  leslie realized that this might well be so but he made a last attempt suppose in desperation i turned round on you  id strike you for defamation and conspiracy publish certain facts in your previous record and nobody would believe you or dare to say so besides you havent got grit enough in you by a long way and thats why im taking your consent for granted  by the way i forgot to mention that confounded britisher raked an extra hundred dollars out of me  said id got to pay for his traveling and hotel expenses  im not charging you leslie and you ought to feel grateful to me     chapter xxiv  an unexpected ally  winter was drawing towards its close at last when on the evening of a day in which the result of a heavy blasting charge had exceeded his utmost expectations geoffrey thurston stood beside his foreman in his workmens mess shanty  tin lamps hung from the beams blackened with smoke and sturdy men were finishing their six oclock supper beneath them  the men were the pick of the province for until tempted by the contractors high wages most of them had been engaged in laying the foundations of its future greatness by wresting new spaces for corn and cattle from the forest  they ate as they worked heroically  the supper was varied and bountiful for geoffrey who was conscious of a thrill of pride as he glanced down the long rows of weatherbeaten faces fed his workmen well  they had served him faithfully through howling gale and long black night under scorching sun and bitter frost and now that the result of that days operations had brought the end of the work in sight there was satisfaction in the knowledge that he had led such men  theyre a fine crowd tom and ill be sorry to part with them he said  its hard to believe after all we have struggled with that less than three weeks will see us through but id give many dollars for every hour we can reduce the time by  send for a keg of the hardest cider and ill tell them so  there was applause when the keg was lifted to the table with its head knocked in  geoffrey who had filled a tin dipper said heres my best thanks for the way you have backed me boys  since they carried the railroad across beaver creek few men in the province have grappled as you have with a task like this but its sometimes just possible to go a little better than what looks like ones best and im asking as a favor from all of you that you will redouble your efforts  i estimate that well finish this tough section in eighteen days from now but i want the work done in less time and accordingly ill promise a bonus to every man if we can fire the last big shot a fortnight from today  stan by shouted a big section foreman as he hove himself upright fill every can up an wait until ive finished  now mr thurston im talking for the rest  youve paid us good wages an weve earned them every cent though that wasnt much to our credit for tom from mattawa saw we did  still even dollars wont buy everything and what you cant pay us for were ready to give  if flesh an blood can do it a fortnight will see us through an the next contract you take if its to wipe out the coast range or run off the pacific were coming along with you  ive nailed you to the bargain boys an heresthe boss victorious an to  with his bonus  the long shanty rang to the roar that followed and when it died away geoffrey who set down his can turned to his foreman  who is the little man next to walla jake he asked  an old partner of his from oregon  came in one day when you were away and as jake allowed he was a square man i took him on  found him worth his money and fancied id told you  you did not said geoffrey  jakes quite trustworthy but watch the stranger well  no doubt hes honest but im getting nervous now were so near the end  the foreman answered reassuringly and geoffrey who turned away rode beneath the snowsprinkled firs to savines ranch  it was late when he reached it but his partner and helen were expecting him  savine sighed with satisfaction when geoffrey said  in all probability we shall fire the decisive shot a fortnight from today  it is great news replied julius savine  as i have said already it was a lucky day for meand minewhen i first fell in with you  two more anxious weeks and then the suspense will be over and i can contentedly close my career  lord it will be well worth the living forthe consummation of the most daring scheme ever carried out in the mountain province  i wont see your next triumph geoffrey but it can hardly be greater than this you have won for me  you exaggerate sir said geoffrey  it was you who won the concession and overcame all the initial difficulties while we would never have gone so far without your assistance  such a task would have been far beyond me alone  nothough it is good of you to say so  there were times when i tried to fancy i was running the contract but that was just a sick mans craze  you have played out the game well and bravely geoffrey as only a true man could  perhaps helen will thank youjust now i dont feel quite equal to it  savines voice broke a little and he glanced at helen who sat very still with downcast eyes  geoffrey also looked at her for a second and his elation was tinged with bitterness  he could see that she was troubled and with a pang of sudden misgiving he watched her anxiously  without the one prize he had striven for the victory would be barren to him  still he desired to save her embarrassment and when she raised her head to obey her father he broke in  miss savine can place me under an obligation by firing the fateful charge instead  it was her first commission which brought good luck to me and it is only fitting she should complete the result of it by turning the firing key  helens eyes expressed her gratitude as consenting she turned them upon the speaker  geoffrey rising to the occasion said  did you ever hear the story of the first contract i undertook in british columbia sir  may i tell it to your father miss savine  helen was quick to appreciate his motive and allowed him to see it while seizing the opportunity to change the subject geoffrey told the story whimsically  humor was not his strong point but he was capable of brilliancy just then  julius savine laughed heartily and when the tale was finished all had settled down to their normal manner  when geoffrey took his leave however helen followed him to the veranda and held out her hand  she stood close to him with the moonlight full upon her and it was only by an effort that the man who gripped the slender fingers conquered his desire to draw her towards him  helen never had looked so desirable  then he dropped her hand and stood impassively still waiting for what she had to say  i could not thank you before my father but neither could i let you go without a word she said with a quiet composure which because she must have guessed at the struggle within him was the badge of courage you have won my undying gratitude and  that is a great deal very well worth the winning he responded  it will be one pleasant memory to carry away with me  to carry with you  you are not going away asked helen with an illogical sense of dismay which was not however in the least apparent  she knew that any sign of feeling would provoke the crisis from which she shrank  yes declared geoffrey  once this work is completed i shall seek another field  you must not  though her voice was strained helen who dared not do otherwise looked him steadily in the eyes  you must not go  now when if you stay in the province fame and prosperity lie within your grasp you will not overwhelm me by adding to the knowledge of all i have robbed you of  it is hard for me to express myself plainlybut i dare not take this from you too  can you not guess how hard it all is for me  he strode a few paces apart from her while the words fell from his lips  then he halted again and turned towards her  i had not meant to distress youbut how can i go on seeing you so near me hearing your voice when every word and smile stir up a longing that at times almost maddens me  what i have done i did for you and did it gladly but this new command i cannot obey  fame and prosperity  what are either worth to me when the one thing i would sell my life for is you have told me not to be attained  i am sorry faltered helen whose breath came faster  more sorry than i can well express  i dare not ruin a bright future for you  is there nothing i can say that will prevent you  only one thing geoffrey moving nearer looked down upon her until his gaze impelled helen to lift her eyes  there was no longer any trace of passion in his face which in spite of its firm lines had grown gentle  only one thing he repeated  please listenit is necessary even if it hurts you  i cannot blame you for my own folly but my love is incurable  you are a dutiful daughter with an almost exaggerated idea of justice and i know the power circumstances give me  still i am so covetous that i must have all or nothing i love you so that i dare not use the advantage chance has given me  nevertheless i will not despair even yet and some day when perhaps absence has hidden some of my many shortcomings i will come back and beg speech with you  you are very generous  the words vibrated with sincerity oncealwaysi have cruelly wronged you but here geoffrey raised his hand and looked at the girl with a wry smile that had no mirth in it  you have never wronged me miss savine  once you spoke with a marvelous accuracy and i am not generous only so unusually wise that you must have inspired me  i cannot be content with less than the best and what that isagain if i am brutal you must remember i cannot help my naturei will tell you  he stooped and before she realized his intentions deftly caught helens hands in each of his own tightening his grip on them masterfully until he forced her to look up at him  helen trembled as she met his eyes  the man had spoken no more than the truth when he said he could not help his nature and suddenly transformed it was the former geoffrey thurston she had shrunk from who held her fast  yes i am wise  i know i could bend you to my will now and that afterwards you would hate me for it he told her  ii would not take you so not if you came to me  further for we have dropped all disguises and face the naked truth i have striven and starved and suffered for you risked my life oftenand you shall not cheat me of my due which alone is why because my time is not come yet i shall go away  the one reward that will satisfy me is this that of your own will you will once more hold my hands and say i love you geoffrey thurston and i can wait with patiencefor you will come to me thus some day  he bent his head and helen felt her heart leap but it was only her fingers upon which his lips burned hot  the next moment he had gone while leaning breathless against the balustrade she gazed after him  geoffrey did not glance behind him until when some distance from the ranch he reined his horse in and wiped his forehead  he had yielded at last to an uncontrollable impulse which was perhaps part of his inheritance from the old moss troopers who had carried off their brides on the crupper  as he walked his horse a muffled beat of hoofs came up the trail and he fancied he heard a voice say the twentiethill be ready  then a mounted figure appearing for a moment vanished among the firs geoffrey turning back to camp noticed that beside the hollows the hoofs had made there was the print of human feet in the powdery snow  there is nothing to bring any rancher down this way and a man must have walked beside the rider he speculated  who on earth could it be  dismissing the incident from his mind he went on his way  it was only afterwards that the significance of the footprints became apparent  there was a light in geoffreys quarters when at last he approached them and the foreman met him at the door  that blame waster black has come back  rode in quietly after dark and none of the boys have set eyes on him he said and noting his masters surprise he added with a chuckle i put him in there for safety and waited right here to take care of him  geoffrey went into the shanty carefully closed the door and turned somewhat sternly upon the visitor  blacks outer appearance suggested a degree of prosperity but his face was anxious as he said i guess youre surprised to see me  i am was the answer  in view of the fact that it is my duty to hand you over to the nearest magistrate my surprise is hardly astonishing  no agreed black it is not  still i dont think youll surrender me  anyway youve got to listen to a little story first  you didnt hear the whole of it last time  i figure i can trust you to do the square thing  be quick then  geoffrey leaned against the table while his visitor began  youve heard of the blue bird mine and how one of the men who relocated the lapsed claim was found in the river with a gash which a rock might have made in the back of his head  of course you have well it was me and bob morgan who located the blue bird  morgan was a good prospector but the indications were hazy and he got drunk when he could  i knew mighty little of minerals and we done nothing with it until the time to put in our legal improvements was nearly up  then morgan struck rich pay ore and we worked night and day  but we werent quite quick enoughone night two jumpers pulled our stakes up oh yes they had the law behind them for says the crown unless youve developed your claim within the legal limit it lapses and any free miner can relocate  come to the point said thurston  im sleepy  im coming black continued morgan had no grit  he got on to the whiskey and talked about shooting himself  i swore id shoot the first of the other crowd who set foot on the claim instead and half the boys who started driving pegs all round us heard me  there was a doubt as to whether the jumpers had hit the time putting their stakes in and the boys were most for me but as usual the thieves had a man with money behind them  his name was shackleby  ah  i begin to understand things now said geoffrey  i was sitting alone in my tent at night when one of them jumpers came in black went on unheeding  all the rest were sleeping and the bush was very still  hed a roll of dollar bills to give me if id light out quietly  said id nothing to stand on but the man behind him didnt want to figure in the papers if it went to court  well i wouldnt take the money and ran him out of my tent  when he touched his pistol i had an ax in my hand and it was a poor mans luck that one of the boys must come along  when hed slouched off i began to hanker for the money went after the jumper to see if i could raise his price missed him and came back again but i struck his tracks in the mud beside a creek with another mans hoofmarks behind them  well next morning that jumper was found in the river with no money in his wallet and the boys looked black at me until i had an interview with mr shackleby  hed fixed the whole thing up good enough to hang me and nailed me down to blame hard terms as the price of my liberty youre getting tiredno  shackleby got the blue bird and kept his claws on me until his man leslie sent me up to bust your machines but shackleby has worn me thin until im ready to stand my trial sooner than run any more of his mean jobs for him and now to cut the long end off do you believe me  i think i do replied geoffrey  what made you bolt from here and what do you want from me  is it the same promise as before  black related the incidents of his abduction  he raised his right hand with a dramatic gesture as he concluded  as i have been a liar this is gospel truth shelp me  whoever killed that jumperand i figure shackleby knowsit wasnt me  the night you fished me out of the river i said heres a man with sand enough to stand right up to shackleby and ill make a deal with you  the terms said geoffrey  rather better than before  on your part a smart lawyer to take my case if shackleby sets the police on me  on minewith you behind me i can tell a story that will bring two companies down on shackleby what brought me to the scratch now was that i read in the colonist that youd be through shortly and i guessed shacklebys insect leslie would have another shot at you  im open to take my chances of hanging to get even with them  the mingled fear and hatred in the speakers face was certainly genuine and geoffrey said briefly if i thought you guilty id slip irons on to you  as it is im willing to close that deal  youll have to take my word and lie quiet until youre wanted where i hide you  i guess that is good enough for me black declared exultantly     chapter xxv  millicents revolt  i really feel mean over it and of course i will pay you back but unless i get the money to meet the call i shall have to sacrifice the stock said henry leslie glancing furtively at his wife across the breakfasttable  leslie was seldom at his best in the morning but he seemed unusually nervous and the coffeecup shook in his fingers as he raised it  its the last ill ask you for he continued and if you press him thurston will sign the check  he said he was coming did he not  yes was the answer  here is his note  it must be the last harry for i have overdrawn my allowance already  you will notice that geoffrey hesitates and will not sign the check without seeing me  he will be here on thursday  leslie took the letter with an eagerness which did not escape his wife while as the sum in question was small she could not quite understand the satisfaction in his face  it had grown soddened and coarse of late and there were times when she looked upon her husband with positive disgust  still she had in spite of occasional disputes resumed her efforts to play the part of a dutiful wife and it was easier to pay her husband money than respect the more so because he had usually some specious excuse which appealed both to her ambition and her gambling instinct  at times he handed her small amounts of money said to be her share of the profits on speculations for which he required the loans  pressure of work but must make an effort to see you as you suggest leslie read aloud  hm  limit exceeded already  will be in town and try to call upon you on thursday   it is very good of him remarked millicent  he evidently finds every minute precious and i am very reluctant to bring him here  i gather that except for my request he would have deferred his other business  still i suppose you must have the money harry  i must was the answer and leslie who did not look up busied himself with his plate  better write that you expect him and i will post the note  by the way i must remind you that we take the eastern fishery delegates on their steamer trip the day after tomorrow and though there may be rather a mixed company i want you to turn out smartly and get hold of the best people  it would be well to see a mention of the handsome mrs leslie in the newspaper report  millicent frowned  she was a vain woman but she had some genuine pride and there were limits to her forbearance  by the time her husband had induced her to withdraw her refusal to accompany him it was too late further to discuss thurstons visit which was exactly what leslie desired  accordingly well pleased with himself he set out for his office with a letter in his hand  mrs leslie had reason to remember the steamer excursion  a party of prominent persons had been invited to accompany the fishery delegates on the maritime picnic organized for the purpose of displaying the facilities that coast afforded for the prosecution of a new industry it was difficult for the committee to draw a rigid line and the company was decidedly mixed more so than even millicent at first surmised  her husband who acted as marshal was kept busy most of the time but she noticed a swift look of annoyance on his face when before the steamer sailed a tastefullydressed young woman ascended the gangway where he was receiving the guests  there was nothing dubious in the appearance of the lady or her elderly companion and yet millicent felt that leslie was troubled by their presence and hesitated to let them pass  the younger lady however smiled upon him in a manner that suggested they had met before and leslie stood aside when shackleby beckoned him with what looked like an ironical grin then the gangway was run in and the engines started  it was a mild day for the season and millicent who found friends dismissed the subject from her thoughts when she saw her husband exchange no word with his latest guests  she was sitting with a young married lady where the sun shone pleasantly in the shelter of the great white deckhouse when a sound of voices came out with the odor of cigar smoke from an open window  you fixed it all right observed one voice which sounded familiar and there was a laugh which though muffled was more familiar still while with curiosity excited millicent listened a companion broke in  wheres mr leslie  i have scarcely seen him all morning  making himself useful as usual  discoursing on fisheries and harbors of which he knows nothing to men who know a good deal and no doubt doing it very neatly said millicent smiling  why do you let him asked the other with a little gesture of pride which became her  now my husband knows better than to stay away from me even if he wanted to  ah here he is bringing good things from the sunny south piled up on a tray  perhaps it was the contrast for millicent felt both resentful and neglected when a young man approached carrying choice fruits and cakes upon a nickeled tray but before he reached them a voice came through the window again  youre quite certain  that man has eyes all over him and it wont do to take any chances with him  he must be kept right here in vancouver all night and the game will be in our own hands before he gets back again  ive done my best was the answer and millicent fancied but was not certain that it was her husband who spoke  i have fixed things so that he will come to vancouver  the only worry is can we depend upon the fellow i laid the odds with  oh yes responded the second voice  i guess he knows better than fail me  by the way you nearly made a fool of yourself over coralie  somebody inside there talking secrets observed the younger lady  i think it is mr shackleby and i dont like that man  charley set down that tray and carry my chair and mrs leslies at least a dozen yards away  millicent at the risk of being guilty of eavesdropping would have greatly preferred to stay where she was but when the man did his wifes bidding she could only follow and thank him  lifting a cluster of fruit from the tray she asked one question  can you tell me mr nelson who is coralie  nelson looked startled for a moment and found it necessary to place another folding chair under the tray  he did not answer until his wife said  didnt you hear mrs leslies question charley  who is coralie  sounds like the name of a variety actress answered the man by no means glibly  why should you ask me  i really dont know  im not good at conundrums  isnt this a beautiful view  i fancied youd have a better appetite up here than amid the crowd below  millicents curiosity was further excited by the speakers manner but she could only possess her soul in patience until presently it was satisfied on one point at least  she sat alone for a few minutes on the steamers highest deck against the colored glass dome of the great white and gold saloon  several of the brassguarded lights were open wide and hearing a burst of laughter she looked down  the young woman who had spoken to leslie at the gangway sat at a corner table partly hidden by two carved pillars below  she held a champagne glass in a lavishly jeweled hand and there was no doubt that she was pretty but there was that in her suggestive laugh and mocking curve of the full red lips something which set millicents teeth on edge  if more were needed to increase the unpleasant impression a rich mine promoter sat near the young woman trying to whisper confidentially and another man whose name was notorious in the city laughed as he watched them but millicent had seen sufficient and turning her head looked out to sea  there were however several men smoking on the opposite side of the dome and one of them also must have looked down for his comment was audible  theyre having what you call a good time down there  who and what is she  mamselle coralie  ostensibly a clairvoyante was the dry reply  clairvoyante repeated the first unseen speaker who by his clean intonation millicent set down as a newlyarrived englishman  do you mean a professional soothsayer  something of the kind said the other with a laugh  were a curious people marching in the forefront of progress so we like to think and yet we consult hypnotists and all kinds of fakirs even about our business  walk down  street and youll see halfadozen of their nameplates  when theyre young and handsome they get plenty of customers and its suspected that coralie with assistance runs a select gambling bank of evenings  the charlatan is not tied to one profession  i catch oncorrect phrase isnt it rejoined the englishman  of course youre liberal minded and free from effete prejudice but i hardly fancied the wives of your best citizens would care to meet such ladies  they wouldnt if they knew it was the answer  coralies a newcomer such women are birds of passage and before she grows too famous the police will move her on  in fact ive been wondering how she got on board today  leslie passed her up the gangway said another man adding with a suggestive laugh as he answered another question why did he do it well perhaps hes had his fortune told or you can ask him  anyway although i think he wanted to he dared not turn her back  millicent rising slipped away  trembling with rage she was glad to lean upon the steamers rail  she had discovered long ago that her husband was not a model of virtue but the knowledge that his shortcomings were common property was particularly bitter to her  of late she had dutifully endeavored to live on good terms with him and it was galling to discover that he had only it seemed worked upon her softer mood for the purpose of extorting money to lavish upon illicit pleasures  she felt no man could sink lower than that and determined there should be a reckoning that very night  my dear mrs leslie said a voice beside her  why you look quite ill  my husband brought a bottle of stuff guaranteed to cure steamboat malady  run and get it charley and millicent turned to meet her young married friend  please dont trouble mr nelson  i am not in the least seasick millicent replied  you might however spread out that deck chair for me  it is a passing faintness which will leave me directly  she remembered nothing about the rest of the voyage except that when the steamer reached the wharf her husband who helped her down the gangway said  i have promised to go to the conference and afterwards dine with the delegates millicent so i dare say you will excuse me  i shall not be late if i can help it and you might wait up for me  millicent who had intended to wait for him in any case merely nodded and went home alone  she sat beside the english hearth all evening with an open book upside down upon her knee and her eyes turned towards the clock which very slowly ticked away the last hours she would spend beneath her husbands roof  there was spirit in her and though she hardly knew why she dressed herself for the interview carefully  when leslie entered his eyes expressed admiration as she rose with cold dignity and stood before him  leslie was sober but unfortunately for himself barely so for the delegates had been treated with lavish western hospitality and there had been many toasts to honor during the dinner  he leaned against the wall with one hand on a carved bracket looking down upon her with what seemed to be a leer of brutal pride upon his slightlyflushed face  you excelled yourself today millicent  i saw no end of folks admiring you he said  most satisfactory day  everything went off famously  enjoyed yourself eh  i can hardly say i did but that is not what you asked me to wait for was the cold answer and millicent with native caution waited to hear what the man wanted before committing herself  no  i meant it but it wasnt  i couldnt help saying i was proud of you  leslie paused doubtless satisfied his wife thought that he had smoothed the way sufficiently by a clumsy compliment  his abilities were not at their best just then  millicents thin lips curled scornfully as she listened  thurston will be here on thursday he continued  never liked the man but he has behaved decently as your trustee and i want to be fair to him  besides hes a rising genius and its as well to be on good terms with him  couldnt you get him to stay to dinner and talk over the way theyve invested your legacy  do you think he would care to meet you asked millicent cuttingly  perhaps he mightnt  you could have the nelsons over and press of business might detain me  anyway youll have no time to settle all about that money and your english property if he goes out on the atlantic train  you two seem to have got quite friendly again and im tolerably sure hed stay if you asked him  millicents anger was rising all the time but because her suspicions increased every moment she kept herself in hand  feeling certain this was part of some plot and that her husband was not steady enough to carry out his rôle cleverly she desired to discover his exact intentions before denouncing him  why should i press him  had it been before the dinner leslie might have acted more discreetly as it was he looked at the speaker somewhat blankly  why  because i want you to  now dont ask troublesome questions or put on your tragedy air millicent but just promise to keep him here until after the eastbound train starts anyway  im not asking for capriceii particularly want a man to see him who will not be in the city until the following day  then remembering what she had heard outside the steamers deck house a light suddenly broke in upon the woman  the man whose keen eyes would interfere with shacklebys plans must be thurston and it was evident there was a scheme on hand to wreck his work in his absence once she had halfwillingly assisted her husband to thurstons detriment but much had changed since then and remembering that she had already without knowing it played into the confederates hands by writing to him her indignation mastered her  i could not persuade him against his wishes and would not do so if i could she declared turning full upon her husband  you can and must replied leslie whose passion blazed up  im about sick of your obstinacy and fondness for dramatic situations  you could do anything with any man you laid yourself out to inveigle as i know to my cost and in this caseby the lord ill make you  i will not  millicents face was white with anger as she fixed her eyes on him  for a few moments you shall listen to me  what you and shackleby are planning does not concern me but i will not move a finger to help you  once before you saidwhat you have doneand if i have never forgotten it i tried to do so  this time i shall do neither  i have borne very much from you already but sunk almost to your level as i am there are things i cannot stoop to countenance for instance the draft i am to cajole from thurston is not intended for a speculation in mining shares butfor coralie  the little carved bracket came down from the wall with a crash and leslie whose face was swollen with fury gripped the speakers arm savagely  after tomorrow you can do just what pleases you and go where you will he responded in a voice shaking with rage and fear but in this i will make you obey me  as to coralie somebody has slandered me  the money is for what i told you and nothing else  millicent with an effort wrenched herself free  it is useless to protest for i would not believe your oath she said looking at him steadily with contempt showing in every line of her pose  obeyyou as the man i with blind folly abandoned for you warned me you are too abject a thing  liar thief have i not said sufficientadulterer  quite cried leslie who yielded to the murderous fury which had been growing upon him and leaning down struck her brutally upon the mouth what i am you have made meand by heaven it is time i repaid you in part  millicent staggered a little under the blow which had been a heavy one but her wits were clear and moving swiftly to a bell button the pressure of her finger was answered by a tinkle below  i presume you do not wish to make a public scandal she said thickly for the lace handkerchief she removed from her smarting lips was stained with blood  then as their chinese servant appeared in the doorway your master wants you john  before leslie could grasp her intentions she had vanished there was a rustle of drapery on the stairway followed by the jar of a lock and he was left face to face was the stolid asiatic  wantee someling sah the chinaman asked  leslie glared at him speechless until with a humble little nod the servant said  linga linga bell too much hullee john quick come  wantee someling linga linga bell  go the devil  oh get out before i throw you roared leslie and john vanished with the waft of a blue gown while millicents book crashed against the door close behind his head     chapter xxvi  a reckless journey  the rising moon hung low above the lofty pines behind the city when millicent sank shivering into a chair beside the window of her bedroom under the impact of the blow her teeth had gashed her upper lip but she did not feel the pain as she sat with hands clenched looking down on the blaze of silver that grew broader across the inlet  she was faint and dizzy incapable as yet of definite thought but confused memories flashed through her brain one among them more clearly than the rest  instead of landlocked water shimmering beneath the western pines she saw dim english beeches with the coppery disk of the rising moon behind and she heard a tall man speak with stinging scorn to one who cowered before him among the shadows  i was mad that night and have paid for the madness ever since  now when it is too late i know what i have lost she gasped with a catch of the breath that was a sob repressed  there was a heavy step on the stairway and millicent shrank with the nausea of disgust as somebody tried the door  she drew a deep breath of relief when the steps passed on unevenly  the memories returned  they led her through a long succession of mistakes falsehoods slights and wrongs up to the present and she shivered again while a heavy drop of blood splashed warm upon her hand  then she was mistress of herself once more and a hazy purpose grew into definite shape  she could at least warn the man whom she had wronged and so make partial reparation  it was not a wish for revenge upon her husband which prompted her to desire that amends might be made for her past treachery  smarting with shame she longed only to escape from him  after the days revelations she could never forgive that blow  millicent was a woman of action and it was a relief to consider practical details  she decided that a telegram might lie for days at the station nearest the cañon while what distance divided one from the other she did not know  there was no train before noon the next day and she feared that the plot might be put into execution as soon as geoffrey left his camp  therefore she must reach it before he did so afterwardsbut she would not consider the future then and if she could but warn him nothing mattered greatly neither physical peril nor the risk of her good name  it was long before millicent leslie had thought all this out but when once her way seemed clear exhausted by conflicting emotions she sank into heavy slumber and the sun was high before she awakened  leslie had gone to his office and she ate a little chose her thickest furs and waited for noon in feverish suspense  her husband might return and prevent her departure by force  she feared that should he guess her intention a special locomotive might be hired even after the train had started  it was therefore necessary to slip away without word or sign unless indeed she could mislead him and smiling mirthlessly she laid an open letter inside her writingcase  at last the time came and she went out carrying only a little handbag passed along the unfrequented water side to the station by the wharf and ensconced herself in the corner of the car nearest the locomotive counting the seconds until it should start  once she trembled when she saw shackleby hurry along the platform but she breathed again when he hailed a man leaning out from the vestibule of a car  at last the big bell clanged and the atlantic express rolling out of the station began its race across the continent  it was nearly dusk when with a scream of brakes the cars lurched into a desolate mountain station and millicent shivered as she alighted in the frostdried dust of snow  a nipping wind sighed down the valley the tall firs on the hillside were fading into phantom battalions of climbing trees and above them towered a dim chaos of giant peaks weirdly aweinspiring under the last faint glimmer of the dying day  a few lights blinked among the lower firs and millicent hurrying towards them at the station agents direction was greeted by the odors of coarse tobacco as she pushed open the door of the new eldorado saloon  a group of bronzefaced men some in jackets of fringed deerskin and some in coarse blue jean sat about the stove and though millicent involuntarily shrank from them there was no reason why she should feel any fear in their presence  they were rude of aspecton occasion more rude of speechbut in all the essentials that become a man she would have found few to surpass them in either english or western cities there was dead silence as she entered and the others copied him when one of the loungers rising took off his shapeless hat not ungracefully  i want a guide and good horse to take me to thurstons camp in the orchard river cañon tonight she said  the men looked at one another and the one who rose first replied sorry to disappoint you maam but its clean impossible  well have snow by morning and its steep chances a man couldnt get through in the dark now the shelf on the wagon trails down  i must go  it is a matter of life and death and im willing to pay whoever will guide me proportionate to the risk insisted millicent shaking out on the table a roll of bills  then because she was a woman of quick perceptions and noticed something in the big axemans honest face she added quickly i am in great distress and disaster may follow every moment lost  is there nobody in this settlement with courage enough to help me  this time the listeners whispered as they glanced sympathetically at the speaker  the big man said  if youre willing to face the risk ill go with you  you can put back most of your money but because were poor men youll be responsible for the horses  millicent felt the cold strike through her with the keenness of steel when the went out into the night  somebody lifted her to the back of a snorting horse and a man already mounted seized its bridle  there was a shout of good luck and they had started on their adventurous journey  loose floury snow muffled the beat of hoofs the lights of the settlement faded behind and the two were alone in a wilderness of awful white beauty wherein it seemed no living thing had broken the frozen silence since the world was made  staring vacantly before her millicent saw the shoulders of the mighty peaks looming far above her through a haze of driving snow which did not reach the lower slopes where even the wind was still  the steam of the horses hung in white clouds about them as they climbed apparently for hours past scattered vedettes of dwindling pines  after a long pull on a steep trail the man checked the horses on the brink of a chasm filled with eddying mist  that should have been our way but the whole blame trail slipped down into the valley the man said  let me take hold of your bridle and trust to me  were going straight over the spur yonder until we strike the trail again  it was no longer a ride but a scramble  even those surefooted horses stumbled continually and where the wind had swept the thin snow away the iron on the sliding hoofs clanged on icestreaked rock or hundredweights of loose gravel rattled down the incline  then there was juniper to be struggled through  they came to slopes almost precipitous up which the panting guide somehow dragged the horses but one strong with muscular vigor and the other sustained by sheer force of will the two riders held stubbornly on  millicent had risen superior to physical weakness that night  four hours to the big divide  weve pretty well equaled thurstons record said the guide striking a match inside his hollowed palm to consult his watch  its all down grade now but well meet the wind in the long pass and maybe the snow  millicents heart almost failed her when as the match went out she gazed down into the gulf of darkness that opened at her feet but she answered steadily press on  i must reach the camp by daylight whatever happens  they went on  the pace instead of a scramble became in places a wild glissade and no beast of burden but a mountain packhorse could have kept its footing ten minutes  dark pines rose up from beneath them and faded back of them here and there a scarred rock or whitened boulder flitted by and then millicents sight was dimmed by a whirling haze of snow  how long the descent lasted she did not know  she could see nothing through the maze of eddying flakes but that a figure magnified by them to gigantic proportions rode close beside her until they left the cloud behind and wound along the face of a declivity which dipped into empty blackness close beneath  suddenly her horse stumbled there was a flounder and a shock and millicent felt herself sliding very swiftly down a long slope of crusted snow  hoarse with terror she screamed once then something seized and held her fast and she rose shaking in every limb to cling breathless to the guide  hurt bad he gasped  noim mighty glad  snow slide must have gouged part of the trail out  can you hold up a minute while i tend to the horse  i dont think i am much hurt stammered millicent whose teeth were chattering and the man floundering back a few paces stooped over a dark object that struggled in the snow  she fancied that he fumbled at his belt after which there was a horrible gurgle and he returned rubbing his fingers suggestively with a handful of snow  poor brutes done fori had to settle him he explained  it will cost youbut we can fix that when we get through  ill have to change your saddle and the sooner we get on the better  wont keep you five minutes maam  millicent felt very cold and sick for the unfortunate horse still struggled feebly while the gurgle continued and she was devoutly thankful when they continued their journey  the traveling was if possible more arduous than before  at times they forced a passage through climbing forest and again over slopes of treacherous shale where a snow slide had plowed a great hollow in the breast of the hill the puffs of snow which once more met them grew thicker until millicent was sheeted white all over  at last the man said  it cant be far off daylight and im mighty thankful  ive lost my bearings but were on a trail which must lead to somewhere at last stick tight to your saddle and ill bring you through all right maam  millicent was too cold to answer  a blast that whirled the drifts up met her in the face numbing all her faculties and rendering breathing difficult  the hand that held the bridle was stiffened into uselessness  still while life pulsed within her she was going on and swaying in the saddle she fixed her eyes ahead  at last the trail grew level the snow thinner  in the growing light of day a cluster of roofs loomed up before her and she made some incoherent answer when her guide confessed  i struck the wrong way at the forking of the trail  heres a ranch however and the camp cant be far away  horse is used up and so am i but you could get somebody to take thurston a message  some minutes later he lifted millicent from the saddle and she leaned against him almost powerless as he pounded on the door  the loud knocking was answered by voices within the door swung open and millicent reeled into a long hall  two women rose from beside the stove and for it was broad daylight now stared in bewilderment at the strangers  the guide leaned wearily against the wall while millicent overcome by the change of temperature stood clutching at the table and swaying to and fro  then her failing strength deserted her  somebody who helped her into a chair presently held a cup of warm liquid to her lips  she gulped down a little and recovering command of her senses found herself confronted by helen savine  it was a curious meeting and even then millicent remembered under what circumstances they had last seen each other  it appeared probable that helen remembered too for she showed no sign of welcome and mrs thomas savine who picked up the fallen cup watched them intently  i see you are surprised to find me here said millicent with a gasp i left the railroad last night for geoffrey thurstons camp  we lost the trail and one of the horses in the snow and just managed to reach this ranch  we can drag ourselves no further  i did not know the ranch belonged to you  thats about it the guide broke in  this lady has made a journey that would have killed some menit has pretty well used me up anyway ill sit down in the corner if you dont mind  cant keep myself right end up much longer  please make yourself comfortable said helen with a compassionate glance in his direction  i will tell our chinaman to see to your horse  she turned towards millicent and her face was coldly impassive  anyone in distress is welcome to shelter here  you were going to mr thurstons camp  even mrs savine had started at millicents first statement and now she read contemptuous indignation in helens eyes  it was certain her nieces voice though even was curiously strained  yes answered millicent rapidly  i was going to geoffrey thurstons camp  it is only failing strength that hinders me from completing the journey  somebody must warn him at once that he is on no account to leave for vancouver as he promised me that he would there is a plot to ruin him during his absencea traitor among his workmen i think  at any moment the warning may be too late  he was starting west today to call on me  millicent was halfdazed and perhaps did not reflect that it was possible to draw a damaging inference from her words  nevertheless there was that in helens expression which awoke a desire for retaliation  helen asked but one question you risked your life to tell him this and when millicent bent her head the guide interposed you can bet she did and nearly lost it  then said the girl the warning must not be thrown away unfortunately we have nobody i could send just now  auntie you must see to mrs leslie i will go myself  im very sorry miss  if you like ill do my best but can hardly promise that i wont fall over on the way apologized the guide but helen hastened out of the room and now that the strain was over millicent lay helpless in her chair  still she was conscious of a keen disappointment  after all she had dared and suffered it was helen who would deliver the warning  thurston was standing kneedeep in groundup stone and mire inside a coffer dam about which the river frothed and roared when a man brought him word that miss savine waited for him  he hurried to meet her and presently halted beside her horsea burly figure in shapeless slouch hat with a muddy oilskin hanging from his shoulders above the stained overalls and long boots  helen sat still in the saddle a strange contrast to him for she was neat and dainty down to the little foot in indian dressed deerskin against the horses flank  she showed no sign of pleasure as she returned his greeting but watched him keenly as she said  mrs leslie arrived this morning almost frozen at the ranch  she left the railroad last night to reach your camp but her guide lost the trail  the man was certainly startled but his face betrayed no satisfaction its most visible expression was more akin to annoyance  could she not have waited he asked impatiently adding somewhat awkwardly did mrs leslie explain why she wanted to see me so particularly  yes was the quick answer  she has reason to believe that while you journeyed to vancouver to visit her an attempt would be made to wreck these workings  she bade me warn you that there is a traitor in your camp  ah replied geoffrey a flush showing through the bronze on his forehead  he thought hastily of all his men and came back to the consciousness of helens presence with a start  it was very good of you to face the rough cold journey but you cannot return without rest and refreshment he said with a look that spoke of something more than gratitude  i will warn my foremen and when it seems safe will ride back with you  if helen had been gifted with a wider knowledge of life she might perhaps have noticed several circumstances that proved thurston blameless  as it was she had a quick temper and at first glance facts spoke eloquently against him  you cannot was the cold answer  the warning was very plain and considering all that is at stake you must not leave the workings a moment  neither are any thanks due to me  i am an interested party and the person who has earned your gratitude is mrs leslie  the day is clear and fine and i can dispense with an escort  you shall not go alone declared thurston doggedly  you can choose between my company and that of my assistant  and you shall not go until you rest  further i must ask you a favor  will you receive mrs leslie until i have seen her and arranged for her return  there is no married rancher within some distance and i cannot well bring her here  you cannot agreed helen averting her eyes  if only on account of the service she has rendered mrs leslie is entitled to such shelter as we can offer her as long as it appears necessary  thanks said thurston gravely  you relieve me of a difficulty then stung by the girls illconcealed disdain into one of his former outbreaks he gripped the horses bridle and backed the beast so that he and its rider were more fully face to face  am i not harassed sufficiently  good lord do you think he began  i have neither the right nor desire to inquire into your motives responded helen distantly  we will as i say shelter mrs leslie and since you insist will you ask your assistant to accompany me  geoffrey raising his hat a moment swung round upon his heel and blew a silver whistle  tom he said to the man who came running up tell john to get some coffee and the nicest things he can in a hurry for miss savine straighten up my office room and lay them out there  english jim is to ride back with miss savine when she is ready  send a mounted man to allertons to bring black in see that no man you wouldnt trust your last dollar to lays hand on a machine  that would stop half the work in camp  it wouldntconfound youyou know what i mean  call in all explosives from the shotfiring gang  nobodys to slip for a moment out of sight of his section foreman  helen heard the crisp sharp orders as she rode up the hill and glanced once over her shoulder  she had often noticed how the whole strength of geoffreys character could rise to face a crisis  still appearances were terribly against him  geoffrey taking breath for a moment scowled savagely at the river  if ever there was an unfortunate devilbut i suppose it cant be helped  damn the luck that dogs me he ejaculated as he turned to issue more specific commands     chapter xxvii  mrs savine speaks her mind  millicent slept brokenly while helen carried her message and awakening feverish felt relieved to discover that the girl was still absent miss savine was younger than herself and of much less varied experience but the look in the girls eyes hurt her nevertheless  i am ashamed to force myself upon you she said to mrs savine who had shown her many small courtesies but i am afraid i cannot manage the journey back to the railroad today  i must also see mr thurston before i leave for england and it would be a great favor if i could have the interview here  we are glad to have you with us said mrs savine who was of kindly nature and fancied she saw her opportunity  yes i just mean it  the journey has tried you so much that you are not fit for another now besides i have heard so much about you that i want a talk with you  you have probably heard nothing that makes this visit particularly welcome answered millicent bitterly and the elder lady smiled  i guess folks are apt to make the most of the worst points in all of us she observed  but that is not what we are going to talk about you are an old friend of a man we are indebted to and just because i believe theres no meanness in geoffrey thurston you are very welcome to the best that we can do for you  i will ask him over to meet you  millicent flushed  under the circumstances she was touched by the speakers sincerity and grateful for the way she expressed herself perhaps it was this which prompted her to an almost involuntary outpouring of confidence  i am the woman who should have married him she said simply  mrs savine merely nodded and dipped her needle somewhat blindly into the embroidery on her knee before she replied i had guessed it already  you missed a very good husband my dear  i dont want to force your confidence but i imagine that you have some distress to bear and i might help you  i have seen a good deal of trouble in my time  millicent was unstable by nature  she was also excited and feverish afterwards she wondered why a kindly word from a woman she knew so slightly should excite in her such a desire for advice and sympathy in spite of her occasional brusqueries it was hard for anyone to say no to mrs savine  so millicent answered with a sigh  i know it now when it is too lateno one knows it better  you do well to believe in geoffrey thurston  mrs savine looked at her very keenly then nodded  i believe in you too  there  i guess you can trust me  millicent bent her head and her eyes were misty  a raw wound which the frost had irritated marred the delicate curve of her upper lip it became painfully visible  it is only fit that i should tell you since i am your guest she said touching the scar with one finger  that is the mark of my husbands hand and i am leaving him forever because i would not connive at geoffreys ruin  geoffrey is acting as trustee for my property and i cannot leave for england without consulting him  so much is perhaps due to you andbecause of your kindness i should not like you to think too ill of mei will tell you the rest  to begin with geoffrey has never shown me anything but kindness  mrs savine gently patted the speakers arm and millicent related what had led up to her journey or part of it  when she had finished the elder lady commented  you are doing a risky thing but i cant quite blame you and if i could i would not do it now  you will stay right here until geoffrey has fixed up all plans for your journey and you can trust me to be kind to you  still theres one favor im going to ask  i want you to let me tell my niece as much of what you have told me as i think desirable  remember geoffrey has been good to you  for a moment millicents face grew hard and her eyes defiant  she smiled sadly as she answered it is his due and can make no difference now  tell her what seems best  meanwhile geoffrey was busy in the cañon camp  with black and mattawa tom beside him he stood holding as symbol both of equality and authority a bright ax in his hand while driller laborer and machinetender wondering greatly were passed in review before him black had been boarded with a trust rancher some distance from the camp  at last a certain rock driller passed in turn and tom from mattawa explained hes a friend of walla jake and as i told you the last man we put on  thats the blame reptile who backed up shacklebys story at the blue bird mine cried black excitedly  if theres anyone up to mischief you can bet all youve got hes the man  stop there you  geoffreys voice was sharp and stern  cut him down if he feels for a revolver or tries to make a break of it section foreman  come here close in behind him you two  after a swift glance over his shoulder the man who was summoned advanced scowling darkly  he sullenly obeyed geoffreys second command stand therenow a few steps aside leaving his footprints clearly outlined in a patch of otherwise untrodden snow  good observed geoffrey  lay your template transcribers note corrected from templet on those marks tom  after the foreman had produced a paper pattern which fitted them thurston added  were going to make a prisoner of you and jail you ourselves until we can get a formal warrant  what for  well youre going to be tried for conspiracy among the other things  you see that pattern  it fits the foot of a man who went out one night with a spy shackleby sent over to see how and when you would play the devil with our work in the cañon  it even shows the stump of the filedoff creeperspike on your right boot  theres no use protestinga friend of yours here will help us to trace your career back to the finding of the blue bird mine take him along and lock him into the galvanized store shed  the prisoner was taken away and geoffrey turned to his foreman  he was in the drilling gang tom  juss so  working under the wall bed of the cañon  that lets some light on to the subject  you can dismiss the others come with me tom  twenty minutes later geoffrey stood among the boulders that the shrunken river had left exposed near the foot of a giant cliff which instead of overhanging thrust forward a slanting spur into the rush of water and so formed a bend  it was one of the main obstacles geoffrey who wondered at the formation had determined to remove by the simultaneous shock of several heavy blasting charges  to that end a gang of men had long been drilling deep holes into the projecting spur and on the preceding day charges of high explosives had been sunk in most of them with detonators and fuses ready coupled for connection to the igniting gear  geoffrey stood upon a boulder and looked up at the tremendous face of rock which rising above the spur held up the hill slope above  the stratification was looser than usual and several mighty masses had fallen from it into the river  there were also crannies at its feet  youve seen all the drilled holes  anything strike you yet inquired mattawa tom  yes was the answer  it occurs to me that french louis said he couldnt tally out all the sticks of giant powder that hed stowed away a week or two ago  i think you foolishly told him he couldnt count straight  i did admitted tom from mattawa  louis aint great at counting and he allowed hed never let go of the key to the powder magazine  i fancy a smart mechanic could make a key that would do as well remarked geoffrey  it strikes me also after considering the strata yonder that if sufficient shots were fired in those crannies they would bring the whole cliff and the hillside above it down on top of usyoull remember i cautioned you to drill well clear of the rock face itself  now if coupled fuses were led from the shot holes we filled to those we didnt so that both would fire simultaneously nobody afterwards would find anything suspicious under several thousand tons of debris  im inclined to think there are such fuses  take your shovel and well look for them  they worked hard for half an hour and then geoffrey chuckled  lifting what looked like a stout black cord from among the rubble where it was carefully hidden mattawa tom said this time i guess youve struck it dead  follow the thing up geoffrey commanded  this was done and further searching revealed the charges for which they were searching skillfully concealed in the crannies  geoffreys face was grim as he said  it was planned well  they would have piled half yonder shoulder of the range into the cañon if they had got their devilish will  pull up every fuse and fix fresh detonators to all the charges  change every man in that gang and never leave this spot except when the section boss replaces you until were ready for firing  thank heaven that will be in a few more days and my nerves may hold out that long  ive hardly had an hours sleep in the last week tom  while geoffrey was acting in accordance with the warning she had delivered helen was on her way back to the ranch with his assistant as her escort  helen had not forgotten that it was her remonstrance which had originally obtained a humble appointment for english jim  he had several times visited the ranch with messages and was accordingly invited to enter when they reached the house  he recognized mrs leslie at once but he could be discreet and warned by something in her manner addressed no word to her until he found opportunity for a few moments private speech before leaving  you remember me i see millicent said and english jim bowed  i do perhaps because i have reason to  though most reluctant to say so i lost a valuable paper the last time i was in your presence and that paper was afterwards used against my employer  pardon me for speaking so plainly you said you were a friend of mr thurstons  you need not be diffident replied millicent checking him with a wave of her hand  suppose it was i who found the drawing you would be willing to keep silence in return for  it was english jim who interrupted now  in return for your solemn promise to render no more assistance to our enemies  i do not forget your kindness and hate the painful necessity of speaking so to you but i am thurstons man soul and body  i ask your pardon said millicent  will you believe me if i say that i lately ran some risk to bring mr thurston a muchneeded warning i am going to england in a day or two and shall never come back again  therefore you can rely upon my promise  implicitly returned english jim  you must have had some reason i cannot guess for what you did  that sounds like presumption doesnt it  but you can count upon my silence madam  you are a good man  millicent impulsively held out her hand to him i have met very few so loyal or so charitable  may i wish you all prosperity in your career  english jim merely bowed as he went out and millicents eyes grew dim as she thought of her treachery to geoffrey  there are good men in the world after all though it has been my misfortune to chiefly come across the bad she admitted to herself  darkness had fallen when thurston rode up to the ranch  he passed half an hour alone with millicent and went away without speaking to anyone else  after he had gone millicent said to mrs savine  i start for england as soon as possible and mr thurston is going to the railroad with me  i shall never return to canada  pleading fatigue she retired early and for a time mrs savine and helen sat silently in the glow of the great hearth upon which immense logs were burning  there was no other light in the room and each flicker of the fire showed that helens face was more than usually serious  did you know that it was mrs leslie geoffrey should have married asked mrs savine at length  no answered helen flushing  with feeling she added  perhaps i ought to have guessed it  she leaves shortly does the not  it will be a relief  she must be a wicked woman but please dont talk of her  that is just what im going to do declared her aunt gravely  i wouldnt guarantee that she is wholly good but i blame her poisonmean husband more than her  anyway she is better than you suppose her  i made no charge against her and am only glad she is going said helen savine  mrs savine smiled shrewdly  well i am going to show you there is nothing in that charge  not quite logical is it but sit still there and listen to me  helen listened at first very much against her will presently she grew halfconvinced and at last wholly so  she blushed crimson as she said  may i be forgiven for thinking evilbut such things do happen and though i several times made myself believe even against the evidence of my eyes that i was wrong appearances were horribly against her  i am tired and will say goodnight auntie  not yet interposed mrs savine laying a detaining grasp upon her sit still my dear im only beginning  appearances dont always count for much  now theres mrs christopher who started in to copy my elixir  oh yes it was like it in smell and color but she nearly killed poor christopher with it  she said it cured him completely commented helen hoping to effect a diversion but mrs savine would not be put off  we wont argue about that though therell be a coroner called in the next time she makes a foolish experiment  now im going to give my husbands confidences away  hardly fair to tom but ill do it because it seems necessary and the last time i didnt go quite far enough  to begin with  did you know the opposition wanted to buy geoffrey over paying him two dollars for every one he could have made out of your father  no answered helen starting  it was very loyal of him to refuse why did he do so  mrs savine smiled goodhumoredly  i guess you think thats due to your dignity but you dont fool me  look into your mirror helen if you really want to know  did you hear that he put every dollar hed made in canada into the scheme  of course you didnt he made tom promise he would never tell you  besidesbut i forgot i must not mention that  please spare me any more auntie pleaded helen who was overcome by a sudden realization of her own injustice and absolute selfishness  no mercy this time was the answer given almost genially  like the elixir which doesnt taste pleasant its good for you  you didnt know either for the same reason that not long ago tom was badly scared for fear hed have to let the whole thing go for lack of money it would have been the end of julius savine if he had been forced to give up this great enterprise  i never thought things were so bad but how does it concern mr thurston helen questioned her aunt in a voice that was trembling  geoffrey straightened out all the financial affairs in just this way a relative in england left an estate to be divided between him and mrs leslie  there was enough to keep him safe for life if hed let it lie just where it was but he didnt  no he sold out all that would have earned him a life income for any price he could and turned over every cent of it to help your father  now ive about got through but ive one question to ask you  would the man who did all thatyou can see whybe likely to fool with another mans wife even if it was the handsome mrs leslie  no said helen whose cheeks which had grown pallid flushed like a blush rose  i am glad you told me auntie but i feel i shall never have the courage to look that man in the face again  mrs savine smiled though her eyes glistened in the firelight as she laid a thin hand on one of helens which felt burning hot as the fingers quivered within her grasp  you will or that will hurt him more than all she replied  it wasnt easy to tell you this but ive seen too many lives ruined for the want of a little commonsense talkingand i figure jacob wouldnt come near beating geoffrey thurston  helen rose abruptly  auntie you will see to fatherhe has been better latelyfor just a little while will not you she asked mrs crighton has invited me so often to visit her and i really need a change  this valley has grown oppressive and i must have time to think  yes assented mrs savine  but you must stand by your promise to fire the final shot  the door closed and mrs savine removing her spectacles wiped both them and her eyes as she remarked i hope the almighty will forgive a meddlesome old woman for interfering knowing she means well     chapter xxviii  leslie steps out  henry leslie did not return home at noon on the day following the altercation with his wife  millicent had an ugly temper but she would cool down if he gave her time he said to himself  in the evening he fell in with two business acquaintances from a mining district who were visiting the city for the purpose of finding diversion and they invited him to assist them in their search for amusement  leslie though unprincipled lacked several qualities necessary for a successful rascal and oppressed by the fear of shacklebys displeasure should thurston return to the mountains prematurely and uncertain what to do was willing to try to forget his perplexities for an hour or two  the attempt was so far successful that he went home at midnight somewhat unsteadily a good many dollars poorer than when he set out trying the door of his wifes room he found it locked  he did not suspect that it had been locked on the outside and that millicent had thrown the key away  he was however rather relieved than otherwise by the discovery of the locked door and sleeping soundly wakened later than usual next morning  millicent however was neither at the breakfasttable nor in her own room when he pried the door open  he saw that some garments and a valise were missing and decided that she had favored certain friends with her company and returning mollified would make peace again as had happened before  still he was uneasy until he espied her writingcase with the end of a letter protruding reading the letter he discovered it to be an invitation to victoria he noticed on the blotter the reversed impression of an addressed envelope which showed that she had answered the invitation  two days passed and hearing nothing he grew dissatisfied again and drafted a diplomatic telegram to the friends in victoria  it happened that shackleby was in his office when the answer arrived  has thurston come into town yet  you told me you saw your way to keep him here said shackleby  didnt you mention he had the handling of a small legacy left mrs leslie  it is strange but he has not arrived was the answer  my wife is an old friend of his and i had counted on her help in detaining him but unfortunately she considered it necessary to accept an invitation to victoria somewhat suddenly  i should hardly have fancied thurston was an old friend ofyours shackleby remarked with a carelessness which almost blunted the sneer im also a little surprised at what you tell me because i saw mrs leslie hurrying along to the atlantic express  she couldnt book that way to victoria  you must have been mistaken said leslie who turned towards a clerk holding out a telegraphic envelope  he ripped it open and read the enclosure with a smothered ejaculation   cant understand your wire  mrs leslie not here  wrote saying she could not come   excuse the liberty  i believe i have a right to inspect all correspondence observed shackleby coolly leaning over and picking up the message  then he looked straight at leslie and there was a moments silence before he asked how much does mrs leslie know about your business  i dont know answered the anxious man in desperation  i had to tell her a little so that she could help me  so i guessed commented shackleby  now i dont want to hurt your feelings but you cant afford to quarrel with me if i do  youre coming straight with me to the depot to find out where mrs leslie bought a ticket to  ill see you hanged first broke out leslie  isnt it enough that you presume to read my private correspondence  ill suffer no interference with my domestic affairs  shackleby laughed contemptuously  youll just come along instead of blusteringtheres not an ounce of real grit in you  this is no time for sentiment and you have admitted that mrs leslie was on good terms with thurston  if she has warned him one of us at least will have to make a record break out of this country  if he doesnt it wont be the divorce court hell figure in  leslie went without further protest and shackleby looked at him significantly when the bookingclerk said if i remember right mrs leslie bought a ticket for thompsons  its a flag station at the head of the new road thats to be driven into the orchard valley  i guess thats enough remarked shackleby  you and i are going there by the first train too  oh yes im coming with you whether you like it or not for it strikes me our one chance is to bluff thurston into a bargain for the cessation of hostilities  its lucky hes supposed to be uncommonly short of money  geoffrey thurston mrs leslie and thomas savine of course could not know of this conversation but the woman was anxious as they rode together into sight of the little flag station shortly before the atlantic express was due  when the others dismounted thomas savine who had been summoned by telegram from vancouver remained discreetly behind  it was very cold darkness was closing down on the deep hollow among the hills and some little distance up the ascending line a huge freight locomotive was waiting with a string of cars behind it in a side track  thurston pointed to the fanshaped blaze of the great head lamp  we have timed it well  theyre expecting your train now he said  i am glad was millicents answer  i shall feel easier when i am once upon the way for all day i have been nervously afraid that harry might arrive or something unexpected might happen to detain me  there will be only time to catch the allan boat you say and once the train leaves this station nobody could overtake me  of course not answered geoffrey reassuringly  it is perhaps natural that you should be apprehensive but there is no reason for it whether you are doing right or wrong i dare not presume to judge and under the circumstances i wish there had been somebody else to counsel you but if your husband has treated you cruelly and you are in fear of him i cannot venture to dissuade you  you will write to me when you have settled your plans  yes she promised  after a moments pause she went on i have hardly been able to consider the position yet but i will never go back to harry  my trustees must either help me to fight him or bribe him not to molest me  it is a hateful position but though i have suffered a great deal there are things i cannot countenance  the hoot of a whistle came ringing up the valley the light of another head lamp growing brighter flickered among the firs and millicent looked up at her companion as she said  i may never see you again geoffrey but i cannot go without asking you to forgive me  you do not know and i dare not tell you in how many ways i have injured you  i would like to think that you do not cherish any illwill against me  you may be quite sure of it was the answer and geoffrey smiled upon her  what i shall remember most clearly is how much you risked to warn me and that the safe completion of the work i have set my heart on is due to you  we will forget all the unpleasant things that have happened in the past and meet as good friends next time millicent  the womans voice trembled a little as she replied i hope when one by one you hear of the unpleasant things you will be charitable  but a last favoryou will not tell harry where i have gone until i am safely on my way to england  no promised geoffrey  you can depend upon that  i have not forgiven your husband but the train is coming in and it will only stop a few seconds  with couplings clashing the long cars lurched in  geoffrey hurried millicent into one of them  he felt his hand grasped fervently and fancied he saw a tear glisten in millicents eyes by the light of the flashing lamps  then the great engine snorted and he sprang down from the vestibule footboard as the train rolled out  turning back towards the station to join thomas savine he found himself confronted by two men who had just alighted  their surprise was mutual but thomas savine who stood beside a box just hurled out of the baggage car had his wits about him  heres one case geoffrey  the conductor thinks that some fool must have labelled the others wrong and theyll come on by first freight he said  this was an accurate statement and for millicents sake geoffrey was grateful that his comrade should make it so opportunely  it accounted for his presence at the station  it cant be helped he said and then turned stiffly towards shackleby and henry leslie who waited between him and the roadway  we want a few words with you but didnt expect to find you here abruptly remarked shackleby  is there any place fit to sit in at the saloon yonder  i really dont know geoffrey replied  having no time to waste in conversation neither do i care  if you have anything to say to me you can say itvery brieflyhere  shackleby pinched the cigar he was smoking  laying his hand on leslies shoulder warningly he whispered keep still you fool  i dont know that i can condense what i have to say he answered airily addressing thurston  fact is in the first place and before mr leslie asks a question i want to know whether wethat is ican still come to terms with you  its tolerably wellknown that my colleagues are so to speak men of straw and individually i figure it might be better for both of us if we patched up a compromise  i cant sketch out the rest of my programme in the open air but as a general idea what do you think mr savine  that your suggestion comes rather late in the day was the answer  shackleby was silent for a moment though for it was quite dark now that the train had gone  savine could not be quite certain whether he moved against leslie by accident or deliberately hustled him a few paces away  geoffrey however felt certain that neither had seen millicent nor thanks to savine suspected that she was on board the departing cars  just then a deeptoned whistle vibrated across the pines somebody waved a lantern between the rails and the panting of the freight locomotives pump became silent  the track led down grade past the station towards the coast  better late than never said shackleby  my hands a good one still im not sure i wont call you  to save time ill show you mine a little sooner than i meant to do and youll see the games up replied geoffrey grimly  it may prevent you from worrying me during the next week or two and you cant well profit by it  ive got black who is quite ready to go into court at any time where you cant get at him  ive got the nearest magistrates warrant executed on the person of your other rascal and black will testify as to his record which implies the throwing of a sidelight upon your own  no doubt to save himself the other man will turn against you  in addition if its necessary which i hardly think possible i have even more damaging testimony  i have sworn a statement before the said magistrate for the crownlands authorities and purpose sending a copy to each of your directors individually that ought to be sufficient and i have no more time to waste with you  but you have me to settle with or ill blast your name throughout the province if i drag my own in the mud  wheres my wife snarled leslie wrenching himself free from his confederates restraining grasp  if youre bent on making a fool of yourself and i guess you cant help it go on your own way interposed shackleby with ironical contempt  i have no intention of telling you where mrs leslie is asserted geoffrey  you will hear from her when she considers it advisable to write  a whir of driver wheels slipping on the rails came down the track followed by a shock of couplings tightening and the snorting of a heavy locomotive but none of the party noticed it  she was here you cant deny it shouted leslie who had yielded to a fit of rabid fury  he was not a courageous man and had been held in check by fear of shackleby but there was some spirit in him and perhaps because he had injured thurston had always hated him  now when his case seemed desperate with the boldness of a rat driven into a corner he determined to tear the hand that crushed him  ill take action against you  ill blazon it in the press  ill close every decent house in the province against you he continued working himself up into a frenzy  where have you hidden my wife  by heaven ill make you tell me  take care warned geoffrey straightening himself and thrusting one big hand behind his back  it is desperately hard for me to keep my fingers off you now but if you say another word against mrs leslie look to yourself  shackleby you have heard him now for the womans sake listen to me  i have never wronged your wife by thought or word leslie and the greatest indiscretion she was ever guilty of was marrying you  you have hidden her almost screamed the desperate man  ill have satisfaction one way if youre too strong for me another  liar traitor sed  geoffrey strode forward before the last word was completed leslie flung up one hand but shackleby struck it aside in time and something that fell from it clinked with a metallic sound  exactly how what followed really happened was never quite certain  leslie blind with rage either tripped over his confederates outstretched foot or lost his balance for just as a blaze of light beat upon the group he staggered clutched at thurston and missing him stepped over the edge of the platform and fell full length between the rails  there was a yell from a man with a lantern and a sudden hoot from the whistle of the big locomotive  savines face turned white under the glare of the headlight  with a reckless leap geoffrey followed his enemy  only conscious of the mans peril he acted upon impulse without reflection  good god  theyll both be killed exclaimed shackleby  thurston was strong of limb and every muscle in him had been toughened by strenuous toil but leslie had struck his head on the rails and lay still stunned and helpless  the lift was heavy for the man who strove to raise him and though the brakes screamed along the line of cars the locomotive was almost upon them  standing horrified and without power to move the two spectators saw geoffrey still gripping his enemys shoulders heave himself erect in a supreme effort then the cowcatcher on the engines front struck them both and savine felt rather than heard a sickening sound as the huge machine swept resistlessly on  afterward he declared that the suspense which followed while the long boxcars rolled by was horrible for nothing could be seen and the two men shivered with the uncertainty as to what might be happening beneath the grinding wheels  when the last car passed both leapt down upon the track and a man joined them holding a lantern aloft  savine stooped over thurston who lay just clear of the rails looking strangely limp  another second would have done itdid i heave him clear he gasped he tried to raise himself by one hand but fell back with a groan  i guess not answered a railroad employé holding the lantern higher and while two others ran up the tracks the light fell upon a shapeless huddled heap  that one has passed his checks in certain the holder of the lantern announced  within ten minutes willing assistants from the tiny settlement were on the spot and stretchers were improvised  savine had bidden the agent telegraph for a doctor and the two victims were slowly carried towards the new eldorado saloon  when they were gently laid down an elderly miner familiar with accidents pointing to thurston after making a hasty examination said  this one has got his arm broken collarbone gone too but if theres nothing busted inside hell come round  the other one has been stone dead since the engine hit him  there were further proffers of help from several of his comrades who as usual with their kind possessed some knowledge of rude surgery when all that was possible had been done for the living savine was drawn aside by shackleby  this is what he dropped on the platformi picked it up quietly he said holding out an ivoryhandled revolver  no use letting any ugly tales get round or raking up that other story is it  i dont know whether thurston induced leslies wife to run off or notfrom what i have heard of him i hardly think he didbut one may as well let things simmer down gracefully  i am grateful for your thoughtfulness replied savine  probably it is more than he would have done for you  this is hardly the time to discuss such questions but what has happened cant affect our position  still personally i may not feel inclined to push merely vindictive measures against you  i didnt think it would change matters said shackleby with a shrug if i should be wanted im open to describe theaccidentand let other details slide  the railroad fellows suspect nothing  thurston has made your side a strong one and in a way i dont blame him  if he had stood in with me wed have smashed up your brother completely     chapter xxix  a revelation  two persons were strangely affected and stirred to unexpected action by the news of thurstons injury and the first of these was julius savine  it was late next night when his brothers messenger arrived at the ranch for thomas had thought of nothing but the sufferers welfare at first and savine lay a very frail wasted figure dozing by the stove  his sisterinlaw sat busy over some netting close at hand both were startled when a man who held out a soiled envelope came in abruptly  savine read the message and tossed the paper across to mrs savine before he rose shakily to his feet  i would sooner have heard anything than that geoffrey was badly hurt he exclaimed with a quaver in his voice  to the chinaman who brought the stranger in he gave the order get him some supper and tell fontaine i want him at once  poor geoffrey  we must hope it is not serious cried mrs savine with visible distress  but sit down  you cant help him and may bring on a seizure by exciting yourself julius  savine who did not answer her remained standing until the hired hand whom he had summoned entered  ride your hardest to the camp and tell foreman tom im coming over to take charge until mr thurston who has met with an accident recovers he said  hes to send a spare horse and a couple of men to help the sleigh over the washedout trail  come back at your best pace  i must reach the cañon before morning  are you mad julius asked his sisterinlaw when the men retired its even chances the excitement or the journey will kill you  then i must take the chances declared savine  while there was a man i could trust to handle things i let this weakness master me  now the poor fellows helpless somebody must take hold before chaos ensues and i havent quite forgotten everything  youll have to nurse geoffrey and its no use trying to scare me  fill my big flask with the old brandy and get my furs out  mrs savine saw further remonstrance would be useless  she considered her brotherinlaw more fit for his grave than to complete a great undertaking but he was clearly bent on having his way  when she hinted something of her thoughts he answered that even so he would rather die at work in the cañon than tamely in his bed  so shivering under a load of furs he departed in the sleigh and after several narrow escapes of an upset reached the camp in the dusk of a nipping morning  help me out  mr thurston i am sorry to say has met with a bad accident and you and i have got to finish this work without him he said to the anxious foreman  from what he told me i can count upon your doing the best thats in you tom  i wont go back on nothing mr thurston said was the quiet answer but when tom from mattawa left savine whose nerveless fingers spilled half the contents of the silver cup he strove to fill gasping beside the stove in thurstons quarters he gravely shook his head  several days elapsed after helens departure for vancouver before mrs savine who had gone at once to the scene of the accident considered it judicious to inform her of geoffreys condition and so it happened that one evening helen accompanied her hostess to witness the performance of a western dramatic company  despite secondrate acting the play was a pretty one and each time the curtain went down helen found the combination of bright light pretty dresses laughter and merry voices strangely pleasant after her isolation  at times her thoughts would wander back to the icebound cañon and the man who had pitted himself against the thundering river in its gloomy depths perhaps the very contrast between this scene of brightness and luxury and the savage wilderness emphasized the selfabnegation he had shown she knew now that he had toiled beyond most mens strength when he might have rested and casting away what would have insured him a life of ease had voluntarily chosen an almost hopeless struggle for her sake  few women had been wooed so she reflected and then she endeavored to confine her attention to the play for as yet though both proud and grateful she could not admit that she had been won  presently the son of her hostess who joined the party between the acts handed her a note  i am sorry i could not get here before but found this waiting and thought id better bring it along  i hope its not a summons of recall he said  helen opened the envelope and the hurriedlywritten lines grew blurred before her eyes as she read i am grieved to say that geoffrey has been seriously injured by an accident  the doctor has however some hopes of his recovery though he wont speak definitely yet  if you can find an intelligent woman in vancouver you could trust to help me nurse him send her along  didnt write before because  what is it  no bad news of your father i hope her hostess asked and the son a fine type of the young western citizen noticed the dismay in helens face as she answered  nothing has happened to my father  his partner has been badly hurt i must return tomorrow and as it is a tiresome journey if you will excuse me i would rather not sit out the play  the young man noticed that helen seemed to shiver while her voice was strained  he discreetly turned away his head though he had seen sufficient to show him that certain latelyrenewed hopes were vain  miss savine has not been used to gayety of late and i warned her she must take it quietly especially with that ride through the ranges before her  this place is unsufferably hot and you can trust me to see her safe home mother he said  helens grateful thank you was reward enough but it was in an unenviable humor that the young man returned to the theater when she sought refuge in her own room  solitude appeared a vital necessity for at last helen understood ever since thurston first limped footsore and hungry into her life she had been alternately attracted and repelled by him  his steadfast patience and generosity had almost melted her at times but from the beginning circumstances had seemed to conspire against the man shadowing him with suspicion and forcing him into opposition to her will  mrs savines story had made his unswerving loyalty plain and helen had begun to see that she would with all confidence trust her life to him but she was proud and knowing how she had misjudged him hesitated still  as long as a word or a smile could bring him to her feet she could postpone the day of reckoning at least until his task was finished and thus allow him to prove his devotion to the uttermost test  now however fate had intervened tearing away all disguise and her eyes were opened  she knew that without him the future would be empty and the revelation stirred every fiber of her being  growing suddenly cold with a shock of fear she remembered that she had perhaps already lost him forever  it might be that another more solemn summons had preceded her own and that she might call and geoffrey thurston would not hear  he had won his right to rest by work well done but sheit now seemed that a lifetime would be too short to mourn him  helen shivered at the thought then she felt as if she were suffocating turning the light low she flung the long window open  beyond the electric glare of the city with its shapeless pile of roofs and towering poles the mountains rose serenely majestic in robes of awful purity  they were beckoning her she felt  the man whom she had learned to love too late lay among them perhaps with the strong hands that had toiled for her folded in peace at last and living or dead she must go to him  she remembered that the message saidhire a capable woman in vancouver and it brought her a ray of comfort  if the time was not already past she would ask nothing better than to wait on him herself  presently when there was a hum of voices below helen white of face but steady in nerves descended to meet her hostess  i must go back tomorrow and as it is a fatiguing journey you will not mind my retiring early she said to excuse her absence from the supper party that was assembled after the play  on reaching the railroad settlement helen found the doctor in charge of thurston willing to avail himself of her assistance  the physician had barely held his own in several encounters with her aunt whom he suspected of endeavoring to administer unauthorized preparations to his patient while on her part mrs savine freely admitted that at her age she could not sit up all night forever  so helen was installed and it was midnight when she commenced her first watch  you will call me at once if the patient wakes complaining of any pain said the surgeon  do i think he is out of danger  well he is very weak yet my dear young lady but if you will carry out my orders i fancy we may hope for the best  but you must remember that a nurses chief qualifications are presence of mind and a perfect serenity  i will not fail you promised helen choking back a sob of relief and trusting that the doctor did not see her quivering face she added softly heaven is merciful  she had been prepared for a change but she was startled at the sight of thurston  he lay with blanched patches in the paling bronze on his face which had grown hollow and lined by pain  still he was sleeping soundly and did not move when she bent over him  she stooped further and touched his forehead with her lips rose with the hot blood pulsing upwards from her neck and stood trembling while either dreaming or stirred by some influence beyond mans knowledge the sleeper smiled murmuring helen  it was daylight when thurston awakened and stared as if doubtful of his senses at his new nurse until approaching the frame of canvas whereon he lay helen with a gentle touch caressingly brushed the hair from his forehead  i have come to help you to get better  we cannot spare you geoffrey she said simply  the sick man asked no question nor betrayed further astonishment  he looked up gratefully into the eyes which met his own for a moment and grew downcast again  then i shall certainly cheat the doctors yet he declared  under the circumstances his words were distinctly commonplace but speech is not the sole means of communion between mind and mind and for the present both were satisfied  helen laughed and blushed happily when as by an after thought geoffrey added it is really very kind of you  you must not talk she admonished with a halfshy assumption of authority strangely at variance with her former demeanor  i shall call in my aunt with the elixir if you do  geoffrey smiled but the brightness of his countenance was not accounted for by his answer i believe she has treated me with it once or twice already and i still survive  in fact i am inclined to think the doctor caught her redhanded on one occasion and there was trouble  after that geoffrey recovered vigor rapidly and the days passed quickly for helen as she watched over him in the dilapidated frame house to which he had been removed after the accident  no word of love passed between them nor was any word necessary  the man still weak and languid appeared blissfully contented to enjoy the present and helen who was glad to see him do so abided her time  meanwhile supported by sheer force of will and a nervous exaltation that would vanish utterly when the need for it ceased julius savine leaning on his foremans arm or sitting propped up in a rude jumper sleigh directed operations in the cañon  he knew he was consuming the vitality that might purchase another few years life in as many weeks of effort but he desired only to see the work finished and was satisfied to pay the price  he slept little and scarcely ate holding on to his work with desperate purpose and living on cordials  though progress was much slower than it would have been under geoffreys direction he accomplished that purpose  one afternoon thomas savine entered the sick mans room in a state of complacent satisfaction  glad to see you getting ahead so fast and you must hurry for well want you soon he said  the great charge is to be fired the day after tomorrow  shackleby who was at the bottom of the whole opposition has cleared out with considerable expedition  sold all his stock in the company and if his colleagues knew much about his doings which is quite possible they emphatically disown them  as a result ive made one or two good provisional deals with them and expect no more trouble  in short everything points to a great success  when savine went out geoffrey beckoned helen to him  i am getting so well that you must leave me to your aunt tomorrow he said  you remember your promise to fire the decisive charge for me and i hope when you see it you will approve of the electric firing key  tell your father i owe more to him than the doctor for i should have worried myself beyond the reach of physic if he had not been there to take charge instead of methat is to say before you came to cure me  i will go agreed helen with signs of suppressed agitation that puzzled geoffrey  she knew that after that charge had been fired their present relations pleasant as they were could not continue  it appeared to her the climax to which all he had dared and suffered and with a humility that was yet akin to pride she had determined in reparation voluntarily to offer him that which whether victorious or defeated otherwise he had with infinite patience and loyal service won  it was early one clear cold morning when helen savine stood on a little plank platform perched high in a hollow of the rock walls overhanging the river opposite thurstons camp  each detail of the scene burned itself into her memory as she gazed about her under a tense expectancythe rift of blue sky between the filigree of dark pines high above the rush of whitestreaked water thundering down the gorge below and frothing high about the massive boulders and one huge fang of promontory which a touch of her finger would if all went well reduce to chaotic débris  groups of workmen waited on the opposite side of the flood all staring towards her expectantly and thomas savine stood close by holding an insignificant box with wires attached to it in a hand that was not quite steady  tom from mattawa sat perched upon a spire of rock holding up a furled flag and her father leaned heavily upon the rails of the staging  no one spoke or stirred and in spite of the roar of hurrying water a deep oppressive silence seemed to brood over cañon and camp  this is the key said thomas savine  it is some notion of geoffreys and he had it made especially in toronto  you fit it in here  helen glanced at the diminutive object before she took the box  the finger grip had been fashioned out of a dollar cut clean across bearing two dates engraved upon it  the first it flashed upon her was the one on which she had given the wornout man that very coin while the other had evidently been added more recently with less skill by some camp artificer  its today said thomas savine following her eyes and helen noticed that his voice was strained  geoffrey told me to get it done  quaint idea dont know what it means  but put us out of suspense  were all waiting  helen knew what the dates meant and appreciated the delicate compliment  it was she who had started the daring contractor on his career who was to complete his triumph and she drew a deep breath as she looked down into the thundering gorge realizing it was a great fight he had won  human courage and dogged endurance inspired by him had mocked at the might of the river and blasting a new pathway for it through the adamantine heart of the hills would roll back the barren waters from a good land that the stout of heart and arm might enter in  swamps would give place to wheat fields orchards blossom where willow swale had been herds of cattle fatten on the levels of the lake and the smoke of prosperous homesteads drift across dark forests where for centuries the wolf and deer had roamed undisturbed that was one aspect only but she knew the man who loved her had won a greater triumph over his own nature and others passions and infirmities  it was with a thrill of pride that the girl realized all that he had done for her and yet for a few seconds she almost shrank from the responsibility as high above the waiting men the stood with slender fingers tightening upon the key  the issues of what must follow its turning would be momentous for it flashed upon her that the tiny combination of copper and silver might with equal chance open the way to a golden future or let in overwhelming disaster upon all she loved then the doubt appeared an injustice to geoffrey thurston and those who had followed him through frost and flood and whirling snow and with a color on her forehead and a light in her eyes she pressed home the key  then there was bustle and hurry  julius savine raised his hand and tom from mattawa whirled high the unfurled flag  somebody beat upon an iron sheet invisible below and the strip of beach in the depths of the cañon became alive with running men  next followed a deep stillness intensified by the clamor of the river which would never raise the same wild harmonies again for the slender hand of a woman had bound it fast henceforward under mans dominion  the hush was ended suddenly  for a second the great hollow seemed filled with tongues of flame then while thick smoke quenched them and crag and boulder crumbled to fragments a stunning detonation rang from rock to rock and rolled upwards into the frozen silence of untrodden hills  huge masses which eddied and whirled filling the gorge with the crash of their descent leaped out of the vapor there was a ceaseless shock and patter of smaller fragments and then while long reverberations rolled among the hills the roar of the tortured river drowned the mingled din  rising tremendous in its last revolt its majestic diapason was deepened by the boom of grinding rock and the detonation of boulders reduced to powder  the draught caused by the waters passage fanned the smoke away and the blue vapor curling higher drifted past the staging so that helen could only dimly see a great muddy wave foam down the cañon bursting here and there into gigantic upheavals of spray  she watched it held silent awestricken by the sound and sight  at last mattawa tom appeared again and his voice was faintly audible through the dying clamors as he waved his hands juss gorgeous  gone way better than the best we hoped he hailed  his comrades heard and answered  they were not mere hirelings toiling for a daily wage but men who had a stake in that regions future and would share its prosperity and had it been otherwise they were human still  toiling long with stubborn patience often in imminent peril of life and limb winning ground as it were by inches and sometimes barely holding what they had won fulfilling their races destiny to subdue and people the waste places of the earth with the faith which when aided by modern science is greater than the mountains immobility they too rejoiced fervently over the consummation of the struggle  twice a roar that was scarcely articulate filled the cañon and then growing into the expression of definite thought it flung upward their leaders name  helen listened breathless intoxicated as by wine  julius savine stood upright with no trace of weakness in his attitude  then suddenly he seemed to shrink together and with the power gone out of him caught at the rails as he turned to his daughter  we have won  it is geoffreys doing and my last task is done he spoke in a voice that sounded faint and faraway  fast horses and bold riders i can trust you too are waiting  tell him  helen noticed a strange wistfulness in her fathers glance but she asked no question and turned to thomas savine  i leave him in your charge  i will go she said  that afternoon passed very slowly for geoffrey  he lay near a window which he insisted should be opened glancing alternately at his watch and the trail that wound down the hillside as the minutes crept by  he was hardly civil to the doctor and almost abrupt with mrs savine who knowing his anxiety straightway forgave him  you tell me i must avoid excitement and await the news with composure for heavens sake man be reasonable  you might as well recommend your next moribund victim to get up and take exercise he grumbled to the physician  but the longest afternoon passes at length and when the sunset glories flamed in the western sky and the great peaks put on fading splendors of saffron and crimson three black moving objects became visible on a hillcrest bare of the climbing firs  geoffrey watched them with straining eyes and it was a wonderful picture that he looked uponblack gorge darkening forest drifting haze in the hollows and unearthly splendors above but he regarded it only as a fit setting for the slight figure in the foreground that swayed to the stride of a galloping horse  he was not surprisedit seemed perfectly appropriate that helen should bring him the newsthough his fingers trembled and his lips twitched  we shall know the best or worst in five minutes  you have done your utmost doctor but ill get up and annihilate you with your own bottles if you give me good advice now he said and the surgeon seeing protests were useless laughed  mrs savine said nothing  she was in a state of nervous tension too and merely laid her hand on the patient restrainingly as he strove with small success to raise himself a little  meantime the horse came nearer its bridle dripping with flakes of spume  its rider was sprinkled with snow and her skirt was besmeared with lather but she came on at a gallop until she reined in the panting horse beneath the window and flinging one arm aloft sat in the saddle with her flushed face turned towards the watchers  no bearer of good tidings ever appeared more beautiful to an anxious man  it is triumph she cried  thank god answered mrs savine who slipped quietly from the room  little time elapsed before helen entered the room where geoffrey impatiently waited for her but brief as it was there was no sign of hurried travel about her  her apparel was fresh and dainty and there was even a flower from mexico at her belt  she went straight to geoffrey and bent over him  all has gone wellbetter i understand than you even hoped for and you have done a great thing geoffrey she said  you have saved me my inheritancewhich is of small importanceandi know all nowmy fathers honor  you have repaid him tenfold and gratified his hearts desire  then i am thankful answered geoffrey very quietly  he lay still a moment looking at her with a great longing in his eyes  helen was very beautiful more beautiful even than usual it seemed to him  he did not guess that she had an offering to make and for the sake of the man at whose feet she would lay it would not even so far as trifles went depreciate the gift hence her careful attire  helens eyes fell beneath his gaze  she discerned what he was thinking and though the words hearts desire were accidental there was no mistaking the suggestion  she said slowly  i have been unjust proud and willfuland i am going to do full penance  you have surely the gift of prophecy  do you remember your last bold prediction  geoffreys lip twitched  he strove to raise himself that he might see the speaker more clearly and still almost helpless in his bandages slipped back again  helen slipped her hand into his  i have come to beg you not to go away  there is one thing that would prevent me  geoffrey bewildered seemed to lose his usual crispness of speech but helen checked him  therefore and helens voice was very low while surging upwards from her neck a swift wave of color flushed cheek and brow  i have come of my own will to say what you asked of me  you have loved and served me faithfully and it is not gratitudeonlywhich prompts me now  there was a space in which helen caught her breath  then she lifted her head and said proudly  geoffrey thurstoni love you
