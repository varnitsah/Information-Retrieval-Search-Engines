56335028	the real thing  by henry james     chapter i    when the porters wife she used to answer the housebell announced a gentlemanwith a lady sir i had as i often had in those days for the wish was father to the thought an immediate vision of sitters  sitters my visitors in this case proved to be but not in the sense i should have preferred  however there was nothing at first to indicate that they might not have come for a portrait  the gentleman a man of fifty very high and very straight with a moustache slightly grizzled and a dark grey walkingcoat admirably fitted both of which i noted professionallyi dont mean as a barber or yet as a tailorwould have struck me as a celebrity if celebrities often were striking  it was a truth of which i had for some time been conscious that a figure with a good deal of frontage was as one might say almost never a public institution  a glance at the lady helped to remind me of this paradoxical law  she also looked too distinguished to be a personality  moreover one would scarcely come across two variations together  neither of the pair spoke immediatelythey only prolonged the preliminary gaze which suggested that each wished to give the other a chance  they were visibly shy they stood there letting me take them inwhich as i afterwards perceived was the most practical thing they could have done  in this way their embarrassment served their cause  i had seen people painfully reluctant to mention that they desired anything so gross as to be represented on canvas but the scruples of my new friends appeared almost insurmountable  yet the gentleman might have said i should like a portrait of my wife and the lady might have said i should like a portrait of my husband perhaps they were not husband and wifethis naturally would make the matter more delicate  perhaps they wished to be done togetherin which case they ought to have brought a third person to break the news  we come from mr rivet the lady said at last with a dim smile which had the effect of a moist sponge passed over a sunk piece of painting as well as of a vague allusion to vanished beauty  she was as tall and straight in her degree as her companion and with ten years less to carry  she looked as sad as a woman could look whose face was not charged with expression that is her tinted oval mask showed friction as an exposed surface shows it  the hand of time had played over her freely but only to simplify  she was slim and stiff and so welldressed in dark blue cloth with lappets and pockets and buttons that it was clear she employed the same tailor as her husband  the couple had an indefinable air of prosperous thriftthey evidently got a good deal of luxury for their money  if i was to be one of their luxuries it would behove me to consider my terms  ah claude rivet recommended me i inquired and i added that it was very kind of him though i could reflect that as he only painted landscape this was not a sacrifice  the lady looked very hard at the gentleman and the gentleman looked round the room  then staring at the floor a moment and stroking his moustache he rested his pleasant eyes on me with the remark  he said you were the right one  i try to be when people want to sit  yes we should like to said the lady anxiously  do you mean together  my visitors exchanged a glance  if you could do anything with me i suppose it would be double the gentleman stammered  oh yes theres naturally a higher charge for two figures than for one  we should like to make it pay the husband confessed  thats very good of you i returned appreciating so unwonted a sympathyfor i supposed he meant pay the artist  a sense of strangeness seemed to dawn on the lady  we mean for the illustrationsmr rivet said you might put one in  put one inan illustration i was equally confused  sketch her off you know said the gentleman colouring  it was only then that i understood the service claude rivet had rendered me he had told them that i worked in black and white for magazines for storybooks for sketches of contemporary life and consequently had frequent employment for models  these things were true but it was not less true i may confess it nowwhether because the aspiration was to lead to everything or to nothing i leave the reader to guess that i couldnt get the honours to say nothing of the emoluments of a great painter of portraits out of my head  my illustrations were my potboilers i looked to a different branch of art far and away the most interesting it had always seemed to me to perpetuate my fame  there was no shame in looking to it also to make my fortune but that fortune was by so much further from being made from the moment my visitors wished to be done for nothing  i was disappointed for in the pictorial sense i had immediately seen them  i had seized their typei had already settled what i would do with it  something that wouldnt absolutely have pleased them i afterwards reflected  ah youreyourea i began as soon as i had mastered my surprise  i couldnt bring out the dingy word models it seemed to fit the case so little  we havent had much practice said the lady  weve got to do something and weve thought that an artist in your line might perhaps make something of us her husband threw off  he further mentioned that they didnt know many artists and that they had gone first on the offchance he painted views of course but sometimes put in figuresperhaps i remembered to mr rivet whom they had met a few years before at a place in norfolk where he was sketching  we used to sketch a little ourselves the lady hinted  its very awkward but we absolutely must do something her husband went on  of course were not so very young she admitted with a wan smile  with the remark that i might as well know something more about them the husband had handed me a card extracted from a neat new pocket book their appurtenances were all of the freshest and inscribed with the words major monarch  impressive as these words were they didnt carry my knowledge much further but my visitor presently added  ive left the army and weve had the misfortune to lose our money  in fact our means are dreadfully small  its an awful bore said mrs monarch  they evidently wished to be discreetto take care not to swagger because they were gentlefolks  i perceived they would have been willing to recognise this as something of a drawback at the same time that i guessed at an underlying sensetheir consolation in adversitythat they had their points  they certainly had but these advantages struck me as preponderantly social such for instance as would help to make a drawingroom look well  however a drawingroom was always or ought to be a picture  in consequence of his wifes allusion to their age major monarch observed  naturally its more for the figure that we thought of going in  we can still hold ourselves up  on the instant i saw that the figure was indeed their strong point  his naturally didnt sound vain but it lighted up the question  she has got the best he continued nodding at his wife with a pleasant after dinner absence of circumlocution  i could only reply as if we were in fact sitting over our wine that this didnt prevent his own from being very good which led him in turn to rejoin  we thought that if you ever have to do people like us we might be something like it she particularlyfor a lady in a book you know  i was so amused by them that to get more of it i did my best to take their point of view and though it was an embarrassment to find myself appraising physically as if they were animals on hire or useful blacks a pair whom i should have expected to meet only in one of the relations in which criticism is tacit i looked at mrs monarch judicially enough to be able to exclaim after a moment with conviction  oh yes a lady in a book  she was singularly like a bad illustration  well stand up if you like said the major and he raised himself before me with a really grand air  i could take his measure at a glancehe was six feet two and a perfect gentleman  it would have paid any club in process of formation and in want of a stamp to engage him at a salary to stand in the principal window  what struck me immediately was that in coming to me they had rather missed their vocation they could surely have been turned to better account for advertising purposes  i couldnt of course see the thing in detail but i could see them make someones fortunei dont mean their own  there was something in them for a waistcoatmaker an hotelkeeper or a soapvendor  i could imagine we always use it pinned on their bosoms with the greatest effect i had a vision of the promptitude with which they would launch a table dhote  mrs monarch sat still not from pride but from shyness and presently her husband said to her  get up my dear and show how smart you are  she obeyed but she had no need to get up to show it  she walked to the end of the studio and then she came back blushing with her fluttered eyes on her husband  i was reminded of an incident i had accidentally had a glimpse of in parisbeing with a friend there a dramatist about to produce a playwhen an actress came to him to ask to be intrusted with a part  she went through her paces before him walked up and down as mrs monarch was doing  mrs monarch did it quite as well but i abstained from applauding  it was very odd to see such people apply for such poor pay  she looked as if she had ten thousand a year  her husband had used the word that described her  she was in the london current jargon essentially and typically smart  her figure was in the same order of ideas conspicuously and irreproachably good  for a woman of her age her waist was surprisingly small her elbow moreover had the orthodox crook  she held her head at the conventional angle but why did she come to me  she ought to have tried on jackets at a big shop  i feared my visitors were not only destitute but artistic which would be a great complication  when she sat down again i thanked her observing that what a draughtsman most valued in his model was the faculty of keeping quiet  oh she can keep quiet said major monarch  then he added jocosely  ive always kept her quiet  im not a nasty fidget am i mrs monarch appealed to her husband  he addressed his answer to me  perhaps it isnt out of place to mentionbecause we ought to be quite businesslike oughtnt we that when i married her she was known as the beautiful statue  oh dear said mrs monarch ruefully  of course i should want a certain amount of expression i rejoined  of course they both exclaimed  and then i suppose you know that youll get awfully tired  oh we never get tired they eagerly cried  have you had any kind of practice  they hesitatedthey looked at each other  weve been photographed immensely said mrs monarch  she means the fellows have asked us added the major  i seebecause youre so goodlooking  i dont know what they thought but they were always after us  we always got our photographs for nothing smiled mrs monarch  we might have brought some my dear her husband remarked  im not sure we have any left  weve given quantities away she explained to me  with our autographs and that sort of thing said the major  are they to be got in the shops i inquired as a harmless pleasantry  oh yes hersthey used to be  not now said mrs monarch with her eyes on the floor    chapter ii    i could fancy the sort of thing they put on the presentationcopies of their photographs and i was sure they wrote a beautiful hand  it was odd how quickly i was sure of everything that concerned them  if they were now so poor as to have to earn shillings and pence they never had had much of a margin  their good looks had been their capital and they had goodhumouredly made the most of the career that this resource marked out for them  it was in their faces the blankness the deep intellectual repose of the twenty years of countryhouse visiting which had given them pleasant intonations  i could see the sunny drawingrooms sprinkled with periodicals she didnt read in which mrs monarch had continuously sat i could see the wet shrubberies in which she had walked equipped to admiration for either exercise  i could see the rich covers the major had helped to shoot and the wonderful garments in which late at night he repaired to the smokingroom to talk about them  i could imagine their leggings and waterproofs their knowing tweeds and rugs their rolls of sticks and cases of tackle and neat umbrellas and i could evoke the exact appearance of their servants and the compact variety of their luggage on the platforms of country stations  they gave small tips but they were liked they didnt do anything themselves but they were welcome  they looked so well everywhere they gratified the general relish for stature complexion and form they knew it without fatuity or vulgarity and they respected themselves in consequence  they were not superficial they were thorough and kept themselves upit had been their line  people with such a taste for activity had to have some line  i could feel how even in a dull house they could have been counted upon for cheerfulness  at present something had happenedit didnt matter what their little income had grown less it had grown leastand they had to do something for pocketmoney  their friends liked them but didnt like to support them  there was something about them that represented credittheir clothes their manners their type but if credit is a large empty pocket in which an occasional chink reverberates the chink at least must be audible  what they wanted of me was to help to make it so  fortunately they had no childreni soon divined that  they would also perhaps wish our relations to be kept secret  this was why it was for the figurethe reproduction of the face would betray them  i liked themthey were so simple and i had no objection to them if they would suit  but somehow with all their perfections i didnt easily believe in them  after all they were amateurs and the ruling passion of my life was the detestation of the amateur  combined with this was another perversityan innate preference for the represented subject over the real one  the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of representation  i liked things that appeared then one was sure  whether they were or not was a subordinate and almost always a profitless question  there were other considerations the first of which was that i already had two or three people in use notably a young person with big feet in alpaca from kilburn who for a couple of years had come to me regularly for my illustrations and with whom i was stillperhaps ignoblysatisfied  i frankly explained to my visitors how the case stood but they had taken more precautions than i supposed  they had reasoned out their opportunity for claude rivet had told them of the projected edition de luxe of one of the writers of our daythe rarest of the novelistswho long neglected by the multitudinous vulgar and dearly prized by the attentive need i mention philip vincent had had the happy fortune of seeing late in life the dawn and then the full light of a higher criticisman estimate in which on the part of the public there was something really of expiation  the edition in question planned by a publisher of taste was practically an act of high reparation the woodcuts with which it was to be enriched were the homage of english art to one of the most independent representatives of english letters  major and mrs monarch confessed to me that they had hoped i might be able to work them into my share of the enterprise  they knew i was to do the first of the books rutland ramsay but i had to make clear to them that my participation in the rest of the affairthis first book was to be a testwas to depend on the satisfaction i should give  if this should be limited my employers would drop me without a scruple  it was therefore a crisis for me and naturally i was making special preparations looking about for new people if they should be necessary and securing the best types  i admitted however that i should like to settle down to two or three good models who would do for everything  should we have often toaput on special clothes mrs monarch timidly demanded  dear yesthats half the business  and should we be expected to supply our own costumes  oh no ive got a lot of things  a painters models put onor put offanything he likes  and do you meanathe same  the same  mrs monarch looked at her husband again  oh she was just wondering he explained if the costumes are in general use  i had to confess that they were and i mentioned further that some of them i had a lot of genuine greasy last century things had served their time a hundred years ago on living worldstained men and women  well put on anything that fits said the major  oh i arrange thatthey fit in the pictures  im afraid i should do better for the modern books  i would come as you like said mrs monarch  she has got a lot of clothes at home  they might do for contemporary life her husband continued  oh i can fancy scenes in which youd be quite natural  and indeed i could see the slipshod rearrangements of stale propertiesthe stories i tried to produce pictures for without the exasperation of reading themwhose sandy tracts the good lady might help to people but i had to return to the fact that for this sort of workthe daily mechanical grindi was already equipped the people i was working with were fully adequate  we only thought we might be more like some characters said mrs monarch mildly getting up  her husband also rose he stood looking at me with a dim wistfulness that was touching in so fine a man  wouldnt it be rather a pull sometimes to haveato have  he hung fire he wanted me to help him by phrasing what he meant  but i couldnti didnt know  so he brought it out awkwardly  the real thing a gentleman you know or a lady  i was quite ready to give a general assenti admitted that there was a great deal in that  this encouraged major monarch to say following up his appeal with an unacted gulp  its awfully hardweve tried everything  the gulp was communicative it proved too much for his wife  before i knew it mrs monarch had dropped again upon a divan and burst into tears  her husband sat down beside her holding one of her hands whereupon she quickly dried her eyes with the other while i felt embarrassed as she looked up at me there isnt a confounded job i havent applied forwaited for prayed for  you can fancy wed be pretty bad first  secretaryships and that sort of thing  you might as well ask for a peerage  id be anythingim strong a messenger or a coalheaver  id put on a goldlaced cap and open carriagedoors in front of the haberdashers id hang about a station to carry portmanteaus id be a postman but they wont look at you there are thousands as good as yourself already on the ground  gentlemen poor beggars who have drunk their wine who have kept their hunters  i was as reassuring as i knew how to be and my visitors were presently on their feet again while for the experiment we agreed on an hour  we were discussing it when the door opened and miss churm came in with a wet umbrella  miss churm had to take the omnibus to maida vale and then walk halfamile  she looked a trifle blowsy and slightly splashed  i scarcely ever saw her come in without thinking afresh how odd it was that being so little in herself she should yet be so much in others  she was a meagre little miss churm but she was an ample heroine of romance  she was only a freckled cockney but she could represent everything from a fine lady to a shepherdess she had the faculty as she might have had a fine voice or long hair  she couldnt spell and she loved beer but she had two or three points and practice and a knack and motherwit and a kind of whimsical sensibility and a love of the theatre and seven sisters and not an ounce of respect especially for the h  the first thing my visitors saw was that her umbrella was wet and in their spotless perfection they visibly winced at it  the rain had come on since their arrival  im all in a soak there was a mess of people in the bus  i wish you lived near a stytion said miss churm  i requested her to get ready as quickly as possible and she passed into the room in which she always changed her dress  but before going out she asked me what she was to get into this time  its the russian princess dont you know i answered the one with the golden eyes in black velvet for the long thing in the cheapside  golden eyes  i say cried miss churm while my companions watched her with intensity as she withdrew  she always arranged herself when she was late before i could turn round and i kept my visitors a little on purpose so that they might get an idea from seeing her what would be expected of themselves  i mentioned that she was quite my notion of an excellent modelshe was really very clever  do you think she looks like a russian princess major monarch asked with lurking alarm  when i make her yes  oh if you have to make her he reasoned acutely  thats the most you can ask  there are so many that are not makeable  well now heres a ladyand with a persuasive smile he passed his arm into his wifeswhos already made  oh im not a russian princess mrs monarch protested a little coldly  i could see that she had known some and didnt like them there immediately was a complication of a kind that i never had to fear with miss churm  this young lady came back in black velvetthe gown was rather rusty and very low on her lean shouldersand with a japanese fan in her red hands  i reminded her that in the scene i was doing she had to look over someones head  i forget whose it is but it doesnt matter  just look over a head  id rather look over a stove said miss churm and she took her station near the fire  she fell into position settled herself into a tall attitude gave a certain backward inclination to her head and a certain forward droop to her fan and looked at least to my prejudiced sense distinguished and charming foreign and dangerous we left her looking so while i went downstairs with major and mrs monarch  i think i could come about as near it as that said mrs monarch  oh you think shes shabby but you must allow for the alchemy of art  however they went off with an evident increase of comfort founded on their demonstrable advantage in being the real thing  i could fancy them shuddering over miss churm  she was very droll about them when i went back for i told her what they wanted  well if she can sit ill tyke to bookkeeping said my model  shes very ladylike i replied as an innocent form of aggravation  so much the worse for you  that means she cant turn round  shell do for the fashionable novels  oh yes shell do for them my model humorously declared  aint they had enough without her i had often sociably denounced them to miss churm    chapter iii    it was for the elucidation of a mystery in one of these works that i first tried mrs monarch  her husband came with her to be useful if necessaryit was sufficiently clear that as a general thing he would prefer to come with her  at first i wondered if this were for proprietys sakeif he were going to be jealous and meddling  the idea was too tiresome and if it had been confirmed it would speedily have brought our acquaintance to a close  but i soon saw there was nothing in it and that if he accompanied mrs monarch it was in addition to the chance of being wanted simply because he had nothing else to do  when she was away from him his occupation was goneshe never had been away from him  i judged rightly that in their awkward situation their close union was their main comfort and that this union had no weak spot  it was a real marriage an encouragement to the hesitating a nut for pessimists to crack their address was humble i remember afterwards thinking it had been the only thing about them that was really professional and i could fancy the lamentable lodgings in which the major would have been left alone  he could bear them with his wifehe couldnt bear them without her  he had too much tact to try and make himself agreeable when he couldnt be useful so he simply sat and waited when i was too absorbed in my work to talk  but i liked to make him talkit made my work when it didnt interrupt it less sordid less special  to listen to him was to combine the excitement of going out with the economy of staying at home  there was only one hindrance  that i seemed not to know any of the people he and his wife had known  i think he wondered extremely during the term of our intercourse whom the deuce i did know  he hadnt a stray sixpence of an idea to fumble for so we didnt spin it very finewe confined ourselves to questions of leather and even of liquor saddlers and breechesmakers and how to get good claret cheap and matters like good trains and the habits of small game  his lore on these last subjects was astonishing he managed to interweave the stationmaster with the ornithologist  when he couldnt talk about greater things he could talk cheerfully about smaller and since i couldnt accompany him into reminiscences of the fashionable world he could lower the conversation without a visible effort to my level  so earnest a desire to please was touching in a man who could so easily have knocked one down  he looked after the fire and had an opinion on the draught of the stove without my asking him and i could see that he thought many of my arrangements not half clever enough  i remember telling him that if i were only rich i would offer him a salary to come and teach me how to live  sometimes he gave a random sigh of which the essence was  give me even such a bare old barrack as this and id do something with it  when i wanted to use him he came alone which was an illustration of the superior courage of women  his wife could bear her solitary second floor and she was in general more discreet showing by various small reserves that she was alive to the propriety of keeping our relations markedly professionalnot letting them slide into sociability  she wished it to remain clear that she and the major were employed not cultivated and if she approved of me as a superior who could be kept in his place she never thought me quite good enough for an equal  she sat with great intensity giving the whole of her mind to it and was capable of remaining for an hour almost as motionless as if she were before a photographers lens  i could see she had been photographed often but somehow the very habit that made her good for that purpose unfitted her for mine  at first i was extremely pleased with her ladylike air and it was a satisfaction on coming to follow her lines to see how good they were and how far they could lead the pencil  but after a few times i began to find her too insurmountably stiff do what i would with it my drawing looked like a photograph or a copy of a photograph  her figure had no variety of expressionshe herself had no sense of variety  you may say that this was my business was only a question of placing her  i placed her in every conceivable position but she managed to obliterate their differences  she was always a lady certainly and into the bargain was always the same lady  she was the real thing but always the same thing  there were moments when i was oppressed by the serenity of her confidence that she was the real thing  all her dealings with me and all her husbands were an implication that this was lucky for me  meanwhile i found myself trying to invent types that approached her own instead of making her own transform itself in the clever way that was not impossible for instance to poor miss churm  arrange as i would and take the precautions i would she always in my pictures came out too talllanding me in the dilemma of having represented a fascinating woman as seven feet high which out of respect perhaps to my own very much scantier inches was far from my idea of such a personage  the case was worse with the majornothing i could do would keep him down so that he became useful only for the representation of brawny giants  i adored variety and range i cherished human accidents the illustrative note i wanted to characterise closely and the thing in the world i most hated was the danger of being ridden by a type  i had quarrelled with some of my friends about iti had parted company with them for maintaining that one had to be and that if the type was beautiful witness raphael and leonardo the servitude was only a gain  i was neither leonardo nor raphael i might only be a presumptuous young modern searcher but i held that everything was to be sacrificed sooner than character  when they averred that the haunting type in question could easily be character i retorted perhaps superficially  whose  it couldnt be everybodysit might end in being nobodys  after i had drawn mrs monarch a dozen times i perceived more clearly than before that the value of such a model as miss churm resided precisely in the fact that she had no positive stamp combined of course with the other fact that what she did have was a curious and inexplicable talent for imitation  her usual appearance was like a curtain which she could draw up at request for a capital performance this performance was simply suggestive but it was a word to the wiseit was vivid and pretty  sometimes even i thought it though she was plain herself too insipidly pretty i made it a reproach to her that the figures drawn from her were monotonously betement as we used to say graceful  nothing made her more angry  it was so much her pride to feel that she could sit for characters that had nothing in common with each other  she would accuse me at such moments of taking away her reputytion  it suffered a certain shrinkage this queer quantity from the repeated visits of my new friends  miss churm was greatly in demand never in want of employment so i had no scruple in putting her off occasionally to try them more at my ease  it was certainly amusing at first to do the real thingit was amusing to do major monarchs trousers  they were the real thing even if he did come out colossal  it was amusing to do his wifes back hair it was so mathematically neat and the particular smart tension of her tight stays  she lent herself especially to positions in which the face was somewhat averted or blurred she abounded in ladylike back views and profils perdus  when she stood erect she took naturally one of the attitudes in which courtpainters represent queens and princesses so that i found myself wondering whether to draw out this accomplishment i couldnt get the editor of the cheapside to publish a really royal romance a tale of buckingham palace sometimes however the real thing and the makebelieve came into contact by which i mean that miss churm keeping an appointment or coming to make one on days when i had much work in hand encountered her invidious rivals  the encounter was not on their part for they noticed her no more than if she had been the housemaid not from intentional loftiness but simply because as yet professionally they didnt know how to fraternise as i could guess that they would have likedor at least that the major would  they couldnt talk about the omnibusthey always walked and they didnt know what else to tryshe wasnt interested in good trains or cheap claret besides they must have feltin the airthat she was amused at them secretly derisive of their ever knowing how  she was not a person to conceal her scepticism if she had had a chance to show it on the other hand mrs monarch didnt think her tidy for why else did she take pains to say to me it was going out of the way for mrs monarch that she didnt like dirty women  one day when my young lady happened to be present with my other sitters she even dropped in when it was convenient for a chat i asked her to be so good as to lend a hand in getting teaa service with which she was familiar and which was one of a class that living as i did in a small way with slender domestic resources i often appealed to my models to render  they liked to lay hands on my property to break the sitting and sometimes the chinai made them feel bohemian  the next time i saw miss churm after this incident she surprised me greatly by making a scene about itshe accused me of having wished to humiliate her  she had not resented the outrage at the time but had seemed obliging and amused enjoying the comedy of asking mrs monarch who sat vague and silent whether she would have cream and sugar and putting an exaggerated simper into the question  she had tried intonationsas if she too wished to pass for the real thing till i was afraid my other visitors would take offence  oh they were determined not to do this and their touching patience was the measure of their great need  they would sit by the hour uncomplaining till i was ready to use them they would come back on the chance of being wanted and would walk away cheerfully if they were not  i used to go to the door with them to see in what magnificent order they retreated  i tried to find other employment for themi introduced them to several artists  but they didnt take for reasons i could appreciate and i became conscious rather anxiously that after such disappointments they fell back upon me with a heavier weight  they did me the honour to think that it was i who was most their form  they were not picturesque enough for the painters and in those days there were not so many serious workers in black and white  besides they had an eye to the great job i had mentioned to themthey had secretly set their hearts on supplying the right essence for my pictorial vindication of our fine novelist  they knew that for this undertaking i should want no costumeeffects none of the frippery of past agesthat it was a case in which everything would be contemporary and satirical and presumably genteel  if i could work them into it their future would be assured for the labour would of course be long and the occupation steady  one day mrs monarch came without her husbandshe explained his absence by his having had to go to the city  while she sat there in her usual anxious stiffness there came at the door a knock which i immediately recognised as the subdued appeal of a model out of work it was followed by the entrance of a young man whom i easily perceived to be a foreigner and who proved in fact an italian acquainted with no english word but my name which he uttered in a way that made it seem to include all others  i had not then visited his country nor was i proficient in his tongue but as he was not so meanly constitutedwhat italian isas to depend only on that member for expression he conveyed to me in familiar but graceful mimicry that he was in search of exactly the employment in which the lady before me was engaged  i was not struck with him at first and while i continued to draw i emitted rough sounds of discouragement and dismissal  he stood his ground however not importunately but with a dumb doglike fidelity in his eyes which amounted to innocent impudencethe manner of a devoted servant he might have been in the house for years unjustly suspected  suddenly i saw that this very attitude and expression made a picture whereupon i told him to sit down and wait till i should be free  there was another picture in the way he obeyed me and i observed as i worked that there were others still in the way he looked wonderingly with his head thrown back about the high studio  he might have been crossing himself in st peters  before i finished i said to myself  the fellows a bankrupt orangemonger but hes a treasure  when mrs monarch withdrew he passed across the room like a flash to open the door for her standing there with the rapt pure gaze of the young dante spellbound by the young beatrice  as i never insisted in such situations on the blankness of the british domestic i reflected that he had the making of a servant and i needed one but couldnt pay him to be only that as well as of a model in short i made up my mind to adopt my bright adventurer if he would agree to officiate in the double capacity  he jumped at my offer and in the event my rashness for i had known nothing about him was not brought home to me  he proved a sympathetic though a desultory ministrant and had in a wonderful degree the sentiment de la pose it was uncultivated instinctive a part of the happy instinct which had guided him to my door and helped him to spell out my name on the card nailed to it  he had had no other introduction to me than a guess from the shape of my high north window seen outside that my place was a studio and that as a studio it would contain an artist he had wandered to england in search of fortune like other itinerants and had embarked with a partner and a small green handcart on the sale of penny ices  the ices had melted away and the partner had dissolved in their train  my young man wore tight yellow trousers with reddish stripes and his name was oronte  he was sallow but fair and when i put him into some old clothes of my own he looked like an englishman  he was as good as miss churm who could look when required like an italian    chapter iv    i thought mrs monarchs face slightly convulsed when on her coming back with her husband she found oronte installed  it was strange to have to recognise in a scrap of a lazzarone a competitor to her magnificent major  it was she who scented danger first for the major was anecdotically unconscious  but oronte gave us tea with a hundred eager confusions he had never seen such a queer process and i think she thought better of me for having at last an establishment  they saw a couple of drawings that i had made of the establishment and mrs monarch hinted that it never would have struck her that he had sat for them  now the drawings you make from us they look exactly like us she reminded me smiling in triumph and i recognised that this was indeed just their defect  when i drew the monarchs i couldnt somehow get away from themget into the character i wanted to represent and i had not the least desire my model should be discoverable in my picture  miss churm never was and mrs monarch thought i hid her very properly because she was vulgar whereas if she was lost it was only as the dead who go to heaven are lostin the gain of an angel the more  by this time i had got a certain start with rutland ramsay the first novel in the great projected series that is i had produced a dozen drawings several with the help of the major and his wife and i had sent them in for approval  my understanding with the publishers as i have already hinted had been that i was to be left to do my work in this particular case as i liked with the whole book committed to me but my connection with the rest of the series was only contingent  there were moments when frankly it was a comfort to have the real thing under ones hand for there were characters in rutland ramsay that were very much like it  there were people presumably as straight as the major and women of as good a fashion as mrs monarch  there was a great deal of countryhouse lifetreated it is true in a fine fanciful ironical generalised wayand there was a considerable implication of knickerbockers and kilts  there were certain things i had to settle at the outset such things for instance as the exact appearance of the hero the particular bloom of the heroine  the author of course gave me a lead but there was a margin for interpretation  i took the monarchs into my confidence i told them frankly what i was about i mentioned my embarrassments and alternatives  oh take him mrs monarch murmured sweetly looking at her husband and what could you want better than my wife the major inquired with the comfortable candour that now prevailed between us  i was not obliged to answer these remarksi was only obliged to place my sitters  i was not easy in mind and i postponed a little timidly perhaps the solution of the question  the book was a large canvas the other figures were numerous and i worked off at first some of the episodes in which the hero and the heroine were not concerned  when once i had set them up i should have to stick to themi couldnt make my young man seven feet high in one place and five feet nine in another  i inclined on the whole to the latter measurement though the major more than once reminded me that he looked about as young as anyone  it was indeed quite possible to arrange him for the figure so that it would have been difficult to detect his age  after the spontaneous oronte had been with me a month and after i had given him to understand several different times that his native exuberance would presently constitute an insurmountable barrier to our further intercourse i waked to a sense of his heroic capacity  he was only five feet seven but the remaining inches were latent  i tried him almost secretly at first for i was really rather afraid of the judgment my other models would pass on such a choice  if they regarded miss churm as little better than a snare what would they think of the representation by a person so little the real thing as an italian streetvendor of a protagonist formed by a public school  if i went a little in fear of them it was not because they bullied me because they had got an oppressive foothold but because in their really pathetic decorum and mysteriously permanent newness they counted on me so intensely  i was therefore very glad when jack hawley came home  he was always of such good counsel  he painted badly himself but there was no one like him for putting his finger on the place  he had been absent from england for a year he had been somewherei dont remember whereto get a fresh eye  i was in a good deal of dread of any such organ but we were old friends he had been away for months and a sense of emptiness was creeping into my life  i hadnt dodged a missile for a year  he came back with a fresh eye but with the same old black velvet blouse and the first evening he spent in my studio we smoked cigarettes till the small hours  he had done no work himself he had only got the eye so the field was clear for the production of my little things  he wanted to see what i had done for the cheapside but he was disappointed in the exhibition  that at least seemed the meaning of two or three comprehensive groans which as he lounged on my big divan on a folded leg looking at my latest drawings issued from his lips with the smoke of the cigarette  whats the matter with you i asked  whats the matter with you  nothing save that im mystified  you are indeed  youre quite off the hinge  whats the meaning of this new fad and he tossed me with visible irreverence a drawing in which i happened to have depicted both my majestic models  i asked if he didnt think it good and he replied that it struck him as execrable given the sort of thing i had always represented myself to him as wishing to arrive at but i let that pass i was so anxious to see exactly what he meant  the two figures in the picture looked colossal but i supposed this was not what he meant inasmuch as for aught he knew to the contrary i might have been trying for that  i maintained that i was working exactly in the same way as when he last had done me the honour to commend me  well theres a big hole somewhere he answered wait a bit and ill discover it  i depended upon him to do so  where else was the fresh eye  but he produced at last nothing more luminous than i dont knowi dont like your types  this was lame for a critic who had never consented to discuss with me anything but the question of execution the direction of strokes and the mystery of values  in the drawings youve been looking at i think my types are very handsome  oh they wont do  ive had a couple of new models  i see you have  they wont do  are you very sure of that  absolutelytheyre stupid  you mean i amfor i ought to get round that  you cantwith such people  who are they  i told him as far as was necessary and he declared heartlessly ce sont des gens quil faut mettre a la porte  youve never seen them theyre awfully good i compassionately objected  not seen them  why all this recent work of yours drops to pieces with them  its all i want to see of them  no one else has said anything against itthe cheapside people are pleased  everyone else is an ass and the cheapside people the biggest asses of all  come dont pretend at this time of day to have pretty illusions about the public especially about publishers and editors its not for such animals you workits for those who know coloro che sanno so keep straight for me if you cant keep straight for yourself  theres a certain sort of thing you tried for from the firstand a very good thing it is  but this twaddle isnt in it when i talked with hawley later about rutland ramsay and its possible successors he declared that i must get back into my boat again or i would go to the bottom  his voice in short was the voice of warning  i noted the warning but i didnt turn my friends out of doors  they bored me a good deal but the very fact that they bored me admonished me not to sacrifice themif there was anything to be done with them simply to irritation  as i look back at this phase they seem to me to have pervaded my life not a little  i have a vision of them as most of the time in my studio seated against the wall on an old velvet bench to be out of the way and looking like a pair of patient courtiers in a royal antechamber  i am convinced that during the coldest weeks of the winter they held their ground because it saved them fire  their newness was losing its gloss and it was impossible not to feel that they were objects of charity  whenever miss churm arrived they went away and after i was fairly launched in rutland ramsay miss churm arrived pretty often  they managed to express to me tacitly that they supposed i wanted her for the low life of the book and i let them suppose it since they had attempted to study the workit was lying about the studiowithout discovering that it dealt only with the highest circles  they had dipped into the most brilliant of our novelists without deciphering many passages  i still took an hour from them now and again in spite of jack hawleys warning  it would be time enough to dismiss them if dismissal should be necessary when the rigour of the season was over  hawley had made their acquaintancehe had met them at my firesideand thought them a ridiculous pair  learning that he was a painter they tried to approach him to show him too that they were the real thing but he looked at them across the big room as if they were miles away  they were a compendium of everything that he most objected to in the social system of his country  such people as that all convention and patentleather with ejaculations that stopped conversation had no business in a studio  a studio was a place to learn to see and how could you see through a pair of feather beds  the main inconvenience i suffered at their hands was that at first i was shy of letting them discover how my artful little servant had begun to sit to me for rutland ramsay  they knew that i had been odd enough they were prepared by this time to allow oddity to artists to pick a foreign vagabond out of the streets when i might have had a person with whiskers and credentials but it was some time before they learned how high i rated his accomplishments  they found him in an attitude more than once but they never doubted i was doing him as an organgrinder  there were several things they never guessed and one of them was that for a striking scene in the novel in which a footman briefly figured it occurred to me to make use of major monarch as the menial  i kept putting this off i didnt like to ask him to don the liverybesides the difficulty of finding a livery to fit him  at last one day late in the winter when i was at work on the despised oronte he caught ones idea in an instant and was in the glow of feeling that i was going very straight they came in the major and his wife with their society laugh about nothing there was less and less to laugh at like countrycallers they always reminded me of thatwho have walked across the park after church and are presently persuaded to stay to luncheon luncheon was over but they could stay to teai knew they wanted it the fit was on me however and i couldnt let my ardour cool and my work wait with the fading daylight while my model prepared it  so i asked mrs monarch if she would mind laying it outa request which for an instant brought all the blood to her face  her eyes were on her husbands for a second and some mute telegraphy passed between them  their folly was over the next instant his cheerful shrewdness put an end to it  so far from pitying their wounded pride i must add i was moved to give it as complete a lesson as i could  they bustled about together and got out the cups and saucers and made the kettle boil  i know they felt as if they were waiting on my servant and when the tea was prepared i said  hell have a cup pleasehes tired  mrs monarch brought him one where he stood and he took it from her as if he had been a gentleman at a party squeezing a crushhat with an elbow  then it came over me that she had made a great effort for memade it with a kind of noblenessand that i owed her a compensation  each time i saw her after this i wondered what the compensation could be i couldnt go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them  oh it was the wrong thing the stamp of the work for which they sathawley was not the only person to say it now  i sent in a large number of the drawings i had made for rutland ramsay and i received a warning that was more to the point than hawleys  the artistic adviser of the house for which i was working was of opinion that many of my illustrations were not what had been looked for  most of these illustrations were the subjects in which the monarchs had figured without going into the question of what had been looked for i saw at this rate i shouldnt get the other books to do  i hurled myself in despair upon miss churm i put her through all her paces  i not only adopted oronte publicly as my hero but one morning when the major looked in to see if i didnt require him to finish a figure for the cheapside for which he had begun to sit the week before i told him that i had changed my mindi would do the drawing from my man  at this my visitor turned pale and stood looking at me  is he your idea of an english gentleman he asked  i was disappointed i was nervous i wanted to get on with my work so i replied with irritation  oh my dear majori cant be ruined for you  he stood another moment then without a word he quitted the studio i drew a long breath when he was gone for i said to myself that i shouldnt see him again  i had not told him definitely that i was in danger of having my work rejected but i was vexed at his not having felt the catastrophe in the air read with me the moral of our fruitless collaboration the lesson that in the deceptive atmosphere of art even the highest respectability may fail of being plastic  i didnt owe my friends money but i did see them again  they re appeared together three days later and under the circumstances there was something tragic in the fact  it was a proof to me that they could find nothing else in life to do  they had threshed the matter out in a dismal conferencethey had digested the bad news that they were not in for the series  if they were not useful to me even for the cheapside their function seemed difficult to determine and i could only judge at first that they had come forgivingly decorously to take a last leave  this made me rejoice in secret that i had little leisure for a scene for i had placed both my other models in position together and i was pegging away at a drawing from which i hoped to derive glory  it had been suggested by the passage in which rutland ramsay drawing up a chair to artemisias piano stool says extraordinary things to her while she ostensibly fingers out a difficult piece of music  i had done miss churm at the piano beforeit was an attitude in which she knew how to take on an absolutely poetic grace  i wished the two figures to compose together intensely and my little italian had entered perfectly into my conception  the pair were vividly before me the piano had been pulled out it was a charming picture of blended youth and murmured love which i had only to catch and keep  my visitors stood and looked at it and i was friendly to them over my shoulder  they made no response but i was used to silent company and went on with my work only a little disconcerted even though exhilarated by the sense that this was at least the ideal thing at not having got rid of them after all  presently i heard mrs monarchs sweet voice beside or rather above me  i wish her hair was a little better done  i looked up and she was staring with a strange fixedness at miss churm whose back was turned to her  do you mind my just touching it she went ona question which made me spring up for an instant as with the instinctive fear that she might do the young lady a harm  but she quieted me with a glance i shall never forget i confess i should like to have been able to paint thatand went for a moment to my model  she spoke to her softly laying a hand upon her shoulder and bending over her and as the girl understanding gratefully assented she disposed her rough curls with a few quick passes in such a way as to make miss churms head twice as charming it was one of the most heroic personal services i have ever seen rendered  then mrs monarch turned away with a low sigh and looking about her as if for something to do stooped to the floor with a noble humility and picked up a dirty rag that had dropped out of my paintbox  the major meanwhile had also been looking for something to do and wandering to the other end of the studio saw before him my breakfast things neglected unremoved  i say cant i be useful here he called out to me with an irrepressible quaver  i assented with a laugh that i fear was awkward and for the next ten minutes while i worked i heard the light clatter of china and the tinkle of spoons and glass  mrs monarch assisted her husbandthey washed up my crockery they put it away  they wandered off into my little scullery and i afterwards found that they had cleaned my knives and that my slender stock of plate had an unprecedented surface  when it came over me the latent eloquence of what they were doing i confess that my drawing was blurred for a momentthe picture swam  they had accepted their failure but they couldnt accept their fate  they had bowed their heads in bewilderment to the perverse and cruel law in virtue of which the real thing could be so much less precious than the unreal but they didnt want to starve  if my servants were my models my models might be my servants  they would reverse the partsthe others would sit for the ladies and gentlemen and they would do the work  they would still be in the studioit was an intense dumb appeal to me not to turn them out  take us on they wanted to saywell do anything  when all this hung before me the afflatus vanishedmy pencil dropped from my hand  my sitting was spoiled and i got rid of my sitters who were also evidently rather mystified and awestruck  then alone with the major and his wife i had a most uncomfortable moment he put their prayer into a single sentence  i say you knowjust let us do for you cant you i couldntit was dreadful to see them emptying my slops but i pretended i could to oblige them for about a week  then i gave them a sum of money to go away and i never saw them again  i obtained the remaining books but my friend hawley repeats that major and mrs monarch did me a permanent harm got me into a secondrate trick  if it be true i am content to have paid the pricefor the memory
