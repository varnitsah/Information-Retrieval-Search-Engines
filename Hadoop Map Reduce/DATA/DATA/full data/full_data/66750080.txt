 the arab steed  10 i gave the orse is evenin feed           and bedded of im down      and went to ear the singsong           in the barroom of the crown      and one young feller spoke a piece           as told a kind of tale      about an arab man wot ad           a certain orse for sale       i ave no grudge against the man mdash           i never eard is name      but if he was my closest pal           id say the very same      for wot you do in other things           is neither ere nor there 11 but wen it comes to orses           you must keep upon the square       now im tellin you the story           just as it was told last night      and if i wrong this arab man           then e can set me right      but sposin all these facs are facs           then i make bold to say      that i think it was not sportsmanlike           to act in sich a way       for as i understand the thing           e went to sell this steed mdash      which is a name they give a orse           of some outlandish breed mdash      and soon e found a customer           a proper sportin gent      who planked is money down at once           without no argument  12 now when the deal was finished           and the money paid youd think      this arab would ave asked the gent           at once to name is drink      or at least ave thanked im kindly           an wished im a good day      and own as ed been treated           in a very andsome way       but instead o this e started           atalkin to the steed      and speakin of its braided mane           an of its winged speed      and other sich expressions           with which i cant agree      for a orse with wings an braids an things           is not the orse for me  13 the moment that e ad the cash mdash           or wot e called the gold      e turned as nasty as could be           says e youre sold   youre sold      them was is words its not for me           to settle wot he meant      it may ave been the orse was sold           it may ave been the gent       ive not a word to say agin           his fondness for is orse      but why should e insinivate           the gent would treat im worse      an why should e go talkin           in that aggravatin way      as if the gent would gallop im           and wallop im all day  14 it may ave been an arness orse           it may ave been an ack      but a bargain is a bargain           an there aint no goin back      for when youve picked the money up           that finishes the deal      and after that your mouth is shut           wotever you may feel       supposin this ere arab man           ad wanted to be free      e could ave done it businesslike           the same as you or me      a fiver might ave squared the gent           an then e could ave claimed      as ed cleared imself quite andsome           and no call to be ashamed  15 but instead o that this arab man           went on from bad to worse      an took an chucked the money           at the cove wot bought the orse      ed ave learned im better manners           if ed waited there a bit      but e scooted on is bloomin steed           as ard as e could split       peraps e sold im after           or peraps e ires im out      but id like to warm that arab man           wen next e comes about      for wot e does in other things           is neither ere nor there      but wen it comes to orses           we must keep im on the square     a postimpressionist  16 peter wilson ara      in his small atelier      studied continental schools      drew by academic rules      so he made his bid for fame      but no golden answer came      for the fashion of his day      chanced to set the other way      and decadent forms of art      drew the patrons of the mart       now this poor reward of merit      rankled so in peters spirit      it was more than he could bear 17 so one night in mad despair      he took his canvas for the year      isle of wight from southsea pier      and he hurled it from his sight      hurled it blindly to the night      saw it fall diminuendo      from the open lattice window      till it landed with a flop      on the dustbins ashen top      where mid damp and rain and grime      it remained till morning time       then when morning brought reflection      he was shamed at his dejection      and he thought with consternation      of his poor illused creation      down he rushed and found it there      lying all exposed and bare 18 mudbespattered spoiled and botched      water sodden fungusblotched      all the outlines blurred and wavy      all

     an island or a lobsterpot       oh the wretched mans despair      was it lost beyond repair      swift he bore it from below      hastened to the studio      where with anxious eyes he studied      if the ruin blotched and muddied      could by any human skill      be made a normal picture still  19 thus in most repentant mood      unhappy peter wilson stood      when with pompous face selfcentred      willoughby the critic entered mdash      he of whom it has been said      he lives a century ahead mdash      and sees with his prophetic eye      the forms which time will justify      a fact which surely must abate      all longing to reincarnate       ah wilson said the famous man      turning himself the walls to scan      the same old style of thing i trace      workmanlike

    three women stood by the rivers flood           in the gaslamps murky light      a devil watched them on the left           and an angel on the right       the clouds of lead flowed overhead           the leaden stream below      they marvelled much that outcast three           why fate should use them so       said one i have a mother dear           who lieth ill abed      and by my sin the

  the third she sank a sinblotched face           and prayed that she might rest      in the weary flow of the stream below           as on her mothers breast       now past there came a godly man           of goodly stock and blood      and as he passed one frown he cast           at that sad sisterhood       sorely it grieved that godly man           to see so foul a sight      he turned his face and strode apace           and left them to the night  41 but the angel drew her sisters three           within her pinions span      and the crouching devil slunk away           to join the godly man

    he went off with louis botha           trekking for the british border       when natal was first invaded           he was fighting night and day      then he scouted and he raided           with de wet and delaney       till he had a brush with plumer           got a bullet in his arm      and returned in sullen humour           to the shelter of his farm  48 now it happened that the devons           moving up in that direction      sent their coloursergeant evans           foraging with half a section       by a friendly dutchman guided           a van eloff or de vilier      they were

communion           of our seagirt brotherhood     the wanderer 1 53  1 with acknowledgment to my friend sir a quillercouch       twas in the shadowy gloaming           of a cold and wet march day      that a wanderer came roaming           from countries far away       scant raiment had he round him           nor purse nor worldly gear      hungry and faint we found him           and bade him welcome here       his weary frame bent double           his eyes were old and dim      his face was writhed with trouble           which none might share with him  54 his speech was strange and broken           and none could understand      such words as might be spoken           in some far distant land       we guessed not whence he hailed from           nor knew what faroff quay      his roving bark had sailed from           before he came to me       but there he was so slender           so helpless and so pale      that my wifes heart grew tender           for one who seemed so frail       she cried but you must bide here           you shall no further roam      grow stronger by our side here           within our moorland home  55 she laid her best before him           homely and simple fare      and to his couch she bore him           the raiment he should wear       to mine he had been welcome           my suit of russet brown      but she had dressed our weary guest           in a loose and easy gown       and long in peace he lay there           brooding and still and weak      smiling from day to day there           at thoughts he would not speak       the months flowed on but ever           our guest would still remain      nor made the least endeavour           to leave our home again  56 he heeded not for grammar           nor did we care to teach      but soon he learned to stammer           some words of english speech       with these our guest would tell us           the things that he liked best      and order and compel us           to follow his behest       he ruled us without malice           but as if he owned us all      a sultan in his palace           with his servants at his call       those calls came fast and faster           our service still we gave      till i who had been master           had grown to be his slave  57 he claimed with grasping gestures           each thing of price he saw      watches and rings and vestures           his will the only law       in vain had i commanded           in vain i struggled still      servants and wife were banded           to do the strangers will       and then in deep dejection           it came to me one day      that my own wifes affection           had been beguiled away       our love had known no danger           so certain had it been      and now to think a stranger           should dare to step between  58 i saw him lie and harken           to the little songs she sung      and when the shadows darken           i could hear his lisping tongue       they would sit in chambers shady           when the light was growing dim      ah my ficklehearted lady           with your arm embracing him       so at last lest he divide us           i would put them to the test      there was no one there beside us           save  this  interloping  guest       so i took my stand before them           very silent and erect      my accusing glance passed oer them           though with no observed effect  59 but the lamp light shone upon her           and i saw each telltale feature      as i cried now on your honour           do or dont you love the

  he stumped the country preachin and you           bet he filled the hall       if you seed him in the pulpit ableatin           like a lamb      youd   never know   bold   bendigo   the           pride of nottingham       his hat was like a funeral hed got a           waiters coat      with a hallelujah collar and a choker round           his throat       his pals would laugh and say in chaff that           bendigo was right      in takin on the devil since hed no one           else to fight  63 but he was very earnest improvin day by           day      aworkin and apreachin just as his duty           lay       but the devil he was waitin and in the           final bout      he hit him hard below his guard and           knocked poor bendy out       now ill tell you how it happened he           was preachin down at brum      he was billed just like a circus you should           see the people come       the chapel it was crowded and in the fore           most row      there was half a dozen bruisers whod a           grudge at bendigo  64 there was tommy piatt of bradford           solly jones of perry bar      long connor from the bull ring the           same wot drew with carr       jack ball the fightin  gunsmith joe mur           phy from the mews      and iky moss the bettin boss the           champion of the jews       a very pretty handful asittin in a           string      full of beer and impudence ripe for any           thing       sittin in a string there right under           bendys nose      if his message was for sinners he could           make a start on those  65 soon he heard them chaflin hi bendy           heres a go      how much are you coppin by this jump           to glory show       stow it bendy left the ring  mighty           spry of you      didnt  everybody know  the  ring  was           leavin you       bendy fairly sweated as he stood above           and prayed      look down o lord and grip me with           a strangle hold he said       fix me with a strangle hold put a stop           on me      im slippin lord im slippin and im           clingin hard to thee  66 but the roughs they kept on chaffin and           the uproar it was such      that the preacher in the pulpit might be           talkin double dutch       till a workin man he shouted out a           jumpin to his feet      give us a lead your reverence and heave           em in the street       then  bendy  said good  lord since           first i left my sinful ways      thou knowest that to thee alone ive           given up my days       but now dear lordmdashand here he laid his           bible on the shelfmdash      ill take with your permission just five           minutes for myself  67 he vaulted from the pulpit like a tiger           from a den      they say it was a lovely sight to see him           floor his men       right and left and left and right straight           and true and hard      till the ebenezer chapel looked more like           a knackers yard       platt was standin on his back and lookup           at his toes      solly jones of perry bar was feelin for           his nose       connor of the bull ring had all that he           could do      rakin for his ivories that lay about the           pew  68 jack ball the fightin gunsmith was in a           peaceful sleep      joe murphy lay across him all tied up           in a heap       five of them was twisted in a tangle on           the floor      and iky moss the bettin boss had           sprinted for the door       five repentant fightin men sitting in a           row      listenin to words of grace from mister           bendigo       listenin to his reverence all as good           as gold      pretty little baalambs gathered to the           fold  69 so thats the way that bendy ran his           mission in the slum      and preached the holy gospel to the           fightin men of brum       the lord said he has given me his           message from on high      and if  you interrupt him i will know           the reason why       but to think of all your schooling clean           wasted thrown away      darned if i can make out what youre           learnin all the day       grubbin up old fairytales fillin up with           cram      and didnt know of bendigo the pride           of nottingham    71  ii philosophic verses     compensation 73       the grime is on the window pane           pale the london sunbeams fall      and show the smudge of mildew stain           which lies on the distempered wall       i am a cripple as you see           and here i lie a broken thing      but god has given flight to me           that mocks the swiftest eagle wing       for if i will to see or hear           quick as the thought my spirit flies      and lo the picture flashes clear           through all the mist of centuries  74 i can recall the tigris strand           where once the turk and tartar met      when the great lord of samarcand           struck down the sultan bajazet       under a tenleague swirl of dust           the roaring battle swings and sways      now reeling down now upward thrust           the crescent sparkles through  the             haze       i see the janissaries fly           i see the chainmailed leader fall      i hear the tekbar clear and high           the true believers battlecall       and tossing oer the press i mark           the horsetail banner over all 75 shaped like the smudge of mildew dark           that lies on the distempered wall       and thus the meanest thing i see           will set a scene within my brain      and every sound that comes to me           will bring strange echoes back again       hark now   in rhythmic monotone           you hear the murmur of the mart      the low deep unremitting moan           that  comes  from  weary londons             heart       but i can change it to the hum           of multitudinous acclaim      when triplewalled byzantium           reechoes the imperial name  76 i hear the beat of armed feet           the legions clanking on their way      the long shout rims from street to street           with rolling drum and trumpet bray       so i hear it rising falling           till it dies away once more      and i hear the costers calling           mid the weary london roar       who shall pity then the lameness           which still holds me from the ground      who commiserate the sameness           of the scene that girds me round       though i lie a broken wreck           though i seem to want for all      still the world is at my beck           and the ages at my call     the banner of progress 77       theres a banner in our van      and we follow as we can      for at times we scarce can see it      and at times it flutters high      but however it be flown      still we know it as our own      and we follow ever follow      where we see the banner fly       in the struggle and the strife      in the weariness of life      the bannerman may stumble      he may falter in the fight 78 but if one should fail or slip      there are other hands to grip      and its forward ever forward      from the darkness to the light     hope 79       faith may break on reason      faith may prove a treason           to that highest gift           that is granted by thy grace      but hope   ah let us cherish      some spark that may not perish           some tiny spark to cheer us           as we wander through the waste       a little lamp beside us      a little lamp to guide us           where the path is rocky           where the road is steep 80 that when the light falls dimmer      still some godsent glimmer           may hold us steadfast ever           to the track that we should keep       hope for the trending of it      hope for the ending of it      hope for all around us           that it ripens in the sun       hope for what is waning      hope for what is gaining      hope for what is waiting           when the long day is done       hope that he the nameless      may still be best and blameless           nor ever end his highest           with the earthworm and the slime 81 hope that oer

written all      and covers in his wideembracing self      the stolen fame of twenty smaller men           you  prate  about  my  learning   i             would urge      my want of learning rather as a proof      that i am still myself   have i not traced      a seaboard to bohemia and made      the cannons roar a whole wide century      before the first was forged   think you           then      that he the everlearned verulam      would have erred thus   so may my very           faults      in their gross falseness prove that i am true      and by that falseness gender truth in you      and

therefore his poetry      was secret   now that he is gone      tis so no longer   you may read his verse      and judge if mine be better or be worse      read  and pronounce   the  meed  of

    whose shrine commemorates the faith      which led him to a martyrs death      a high cathedral marks his grave      with noble screen and sculptured nave      from thence to hatfield lay our way      where the proud cecils held their sway      and ruled the country more or less      since the days of good queen bess      next through hitchins quaker hold      to bedford where in days of old 123 john bunyan the unorthodox      did a deal in local stocks      then from bedfords peaceful nook      our pilgrims progress still we took      until we slackened up our pace      in saint neots marketplace       next day the motor flying fast      through newark tuxford retford           passed      until at doncaster we found      that we had crossed broad yorkshires           bound      northward and ever north we pressed      the brontë country to our west      still on we flew without a wait      skirting the edge of harrowgate 124 and through a wild and dark ravine      as bleak a pass as we have seen      until we slowly circled down      and settled into settle town       on sunday in the pouring rain      we started on our way again      through kirkby lonsdale on we drove      the weary rainclouds still above      until at last at windermere      we felt our final port was near      thence the lake with wooded beach      stretches far as eye can reach      there above its shining breast      we enjoyed our welcome rest      tuesday saw us still in rain mdash      buzzing on our road again  125 rydal first the smallest lake      famous for great wordsworths sake      grasmere next appeared in sight      grim helvellyn on the right      till we made our downward way      to the streets of keswick gray      then amid a weary waste      on to penrith town we raced      and for many a flying mile      past the ramparts of carlisle      till we crossed the border line      of the land of auld lang syne      here we paused at gretna green      where many curious things were seen      at the grimy blacksmiths shop      where flying couples used to stop      and forge within the smithy door      the chain which lasts for evermore  126 theyd soon be back again i think      if blacksmiths skill could break the link      ecclefechan held us next      where old tom carlyle was vexed      by the clamour and the strife      of this strange and varied life      we saw his pipe we saw his hat      we saw the stone on which he sat      the solid stone is resting there      but where the sitter where oh where       over a dreary wilderness      we had to take our path by guess      for scotlands glories dont include      the use of signs to mark the road      for forty miles the way ran steep      over bleak hills with scattered sheep 127 until at last neath gloomy skies      we saw the stately towers rise      where noble edinburgh lies mdash      no city fairer or more grand      has ever sprung from human hand      but i must add the mores the pity      that though in fair dunedins city      scotlands taste is quite delightful      the smaller scottish towns are frightful       when in other lands i roam      and sing there is no place like home      in this respect i must confess      that no place has its ugliness      here on my mothers granite breast      we settled down and took our rest      on saturday we ventured forth      to push our journey to the north  128 past linlithgow first we sped      where the palace rears its head      then on by falkirk till we pass      the famous valley and morass      known as bannockburn in story      brightest scene of scottish glory      on pleasure and instruction bent      we made the stirling hill ascent      and saw the wondrous vale beneath      the  lovely  valley  of  monteith      stretching under sunlit skies      to where the trossach hills arise      thence we turned our willing car      westward ho   to callander      where childish memories awoke      in the wood of ash and oak      where in days so long gone by      i heard the woodland pigeons cry 129 and consternation in my face      legged it to some safer place       next morning first we viewed a mound      memorial of some saint renowned      and then the mouldered ditch and ramp      which marked an ancient roman camp      then past lubnaig on we went      gazed on ben ledis steep ascent      and passed by lovely stream and valley      through dochart glen to reach dalmally      where on a rough and winding track      we wished ourselves in safety back      till on our left we gladly saw      the spreading waters of loch awe      and still more gladly truth to tell mdash      a very uptodate hotel 130 with conans church within its ground      which gave it quite a homely sound      thither we came upon the sunday      viewed kilchurn castle on the monday      and tuesday saw us sally forth      bound for oban and the north       we came to oban in the rain      i need not mention it again      for you may take it as a fact      that in that western highland tract      it sometimes spouts and sometimes drops      but never never never stops      from oban on we thought it well      to take the steamer for a spell      but ere the motor went aboard      the pass of melfort we explored      a lovelier vale more full of peace      was never seen in classic greece 131 a wondrous gateway reft and torn      to open out the land of lome      leading on for many a mile      to the kingdom of argyle       wednesday saw us on our way      steaming out from oban bay      lord it was a fearsome day      to right and left we looked upon      all the lands of stevenson mdash      moidart morven and ardgour      ardshiel  appin  and  mamore mdash      if their tale you wish to learn      then to kidnapped you must turn      strange that one mans eager brain      can make those dead lands live again      from the deck we saw glencoe      where upon that night of woe      williams men did such a deed 132 as even now we blush to read      ben nevis towered on our right      the clouds concealed it from our sight      but it was comforting to say      that over there ben nevis lay      finally we made the land      at fort williams sloping strand      and in our car away we went      along that lasting monument      the good broad causeway which was made      by king georges general wade      he built a splendid road no doubt      alas he left the signposts out      and so we wandered sad to say      far from our appointed way      till twenty mile of rugged track      in a circle brought us back      but the incident we viwed 133 in a philosophic mood      tired and hungry but serene      we settled at the bridge of spean       our journey now we onward press      toward the town of inverness      through a country all alive      with memories of fortyfive      the noble clans once gathered here      where now are only grouse and deer      alas that men and crops and herds      should ever yield their place to birds      and that the splendid highland race      be swept aside to give more space      for forests where the deer may stray      for some rich owner far away      whose keeper guards the lonely glen      which once sent out a hundred men      when from inverness we turned 134 feeling that a rest was earned      we stopped at nairn for golf links famed      scotlands brighton it is named      though really when the phrase we heard      it seemed a little bit absurd      for brightons size compared to nairn      is just a mother to her bairn      we halted for a day of rest      but took one journey to the west      to view old cawdors tower and moat      of which unrivalled shakespeare wrote      where once macbeth the schemer deep      slew royal duncan in his sleep      but actors since avenged his death      by often murdering macbeth      hard by we saw the circles gray      where druid priests were wont to pray  135 three crumbling monuments we found      with stonehenge monoliths around      but who had built and who had planned      we tried in vain to understand      as future learned men may search      the reasons for our village church      this was our limit for next day      we turned upon our homeward way      passing   first   cullodens   plain      where the tombstones of the slain      loom above the purple heather      there the clansmen lie together mdash      men from many an outland skerry      men from athol and glengarry      camerons from wild  mamore      macdonalds from the irish shore      red macgregors and mcleods      with their tartans for their shrouds      menzies malcolms from the islands      frasers from the upper highlands mdash      callous is the passer by      who can turn without a sigh      from the tufts of heather deep      where the noble clansmen sleep      now we swiftly made our way      to kingussie in strathspey      skirting many a nameless loch      as we flew through badenoch      till   at   killiecrankies  pass      heather changing  into grass      we descended once again      to the fertile lowland plain      and by perth and old dunblane      reached the banks of allan water      famous for the millers daughter      whence at last we circled back 137 till we crossed our stirling track      so our little journey ended      gladness and instruction blended mdash      not a care to spoil our pleasure      not a thought to break our leisure      drifting on from sussex hedges      up through yorkshires fells and ledges      past the deserts and morasses      of the dreary border passes      through the scenes of scottish story      past the fields of battles gory       in the future it will seem      to have been a happy dream      but unless my hopes are vain      we may dream it soon again
