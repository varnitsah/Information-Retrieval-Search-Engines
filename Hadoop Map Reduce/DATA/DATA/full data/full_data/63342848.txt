                      editorial wild oats     my first literary venture   i was a very smart child at the age of thirteenan unusually smart child i thought at the time it was then that i did my first newspaper scribbling and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine sensation in the community it did indeed and i was very proud of it too i was a printers devil and a progressive and aspiring one my uncle had me on his paper the weekly hannibal journal two dollars a year in advancefive hundred subscribers and they paid in cordwood cabbages and unmarketable turnips and on a lucky summers day he left town to be gone a week and asked me if i thought i could edit one issue of the paper judiciously ah didnt i want to try higgins was the editor on the rival paper he had lately been jilted and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellows bed in which he stated that he could no longer endure life and had drowned himself in bear creek the friend ran down there and discovered higgins wading back to shore he had concluded he wouldnt the village was full of it for several days but higgins did not suspect it i thought this was a fine opportunity i wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter and then illustrated it with villanous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a jackknifeone of them a picture of higgins wading out into the creek in his shirt with a lantern sounding the depth of the water with a walkingstick i thought it was desperately funny and was densely unconscious that there was any moral obliquity about such a publication being satisfied with this effort i looked around for other worlds to conquer and it struck me that it would make good interesting matter to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality and see him squirm  illustration he had concluded he wouldnt  i did it putting the article into the form of a parody on the burial of sir john mooreand a pretty crude parody it was too  then i lampooned two prominent citizens outrageouslynot because they had done anything to deserve it but merely because i thought it was my duty to make the paper lively  next i gently touched up the newest strangerthe lion of the day the gorgeous journeyman tailor from quincy he was a simpering coxcomb of the first water and the loudest dressed man in the state he was an inveterate womankiller every week he wrote lushy poetry for the journal about his newest conquest his rhymes for my week were headed to mary in hl meaning to mary in hannibal of course but while setting up the piece i was suddenly riven from head to heel by what i regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of humor and i compressed it into a snappy footnote at the bottomthus    we will let this thing pass just this once but we wish mr j   gordon runnels to understand distinctly that we have a character   to sustain and from this time forth when he wants to commune   with his friends in hl he must select some other medium than   the columns of this journal  the paper came out and i never knew any little thing attract so much attention as those playful trifles of mine  for once the hannibal journal was in demanda novelty it had not experienced before the whole town was stirred higgins dropped in with a doublebarrelled shotgun early in the forenoon when he found that it was an infant as he called me that had done him the damage he simply pulled my ears and went away but he threw up his situation that night and left town for good the tailor came with his goose and a pair of shears but he despised me too and departed for the south that night the two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel and went away incensed at my insignificance the country editor pranced in with a warwhoop next day suffering for blood to drink but he ended by forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the drugstore to wash away all animosity in a friendly bumper of fahnestocks vermifuge it was his little joke my uncle was very angry when he got backunreasonably so i thought considering what an impetus i had given the paper and considering also that gratitude for his preservation ought to have been uppermost in his mind inasmuch as by his delay he had so wonderfully escaped dissection tomahawking libel and getting his head shot off but he softened when he looked at the accounts and saw that i had actually booked the unparalleled number of thirtythree new subscribers and had the vegetables to show for itcordwood cabbage beans and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years     journalism in tennessee      the editor of the memphis avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon     a correspondent who posted him as a radical while he was writing     the first word the middle dotting his is crossing his ts and     punching his period he knew he was concocting a sentence that was     saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehoodexchange   i was told by the physician that a southern climate would improve my health and so i went down to tennessee and got a berth on the morningglory and johnson county warwhoop as associate editor when i went on duty i found the chief editor sitting tilted back in a threelegged chair with his feet on a pine table there was another pine table in the room and another afflicted chair and both were half buried under newspapers and scraps and sheets of manuscript there was a wooden box of sand sprinkled with cigarstubs and old soldiers and a stove with a door hanging by its upper hinge the chief editor had a longtailed black cloth frockcoat on and white linen pants his boots were small and neatly blacked he wore a ruffled shirt a large seal ring a standing collar of obsolete pattern and a checkered neckerchief with the ends hanging down date of costume about 1848 he was smoking a cigar and trying to think of a word and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his locks a good deal he was scowling fearfully and i judged that he was concocting a particularly knotty editorial he told me to take the exchanges and skim through them and write up the spirit of the tennessee press condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of interest  i wrote as follows    spirit of the tennessee press    the editors of the semiweekly earthquake evidently labor   under a misapprehension with regard to the ballyhack railroad it   is not the object of the company to leave buzzardville off to one   side on the contrary they consider it one of the most important   points along the line and consequently can have no desire to   slight it the gentlemen of the earthquake will of course   take pleasure in making the correction    john w blossom esq the able editor of the higginsville   thunderbolt and battlecry of freedom arrived in the city   yesterday he is stopping at the van buren house    we observe that our contemporary of the mud springs morning   howl has fallen into the error of supposing that the election of   van werter is not an established fact but he will have   discovered his mistake before this reminder reaches him no   doubt he was doubtless misled by incomplete election returns    it is pleasant to note that the city of blathersville is   endeavoring to contract with some new york gentlemen to pave its   wellnigh impassable streets with the nicholson pavement the   daily hurrah urges the measure with ability and seems   confident of ultimate success  i passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance alteration or destruction he glanced at it and his face clouded he ran his eye down the pages and his countenance grew portentous it was easy to see that something was wrong presently he sprang up and said  thunder and lightning do you suppose i am going to speak of those cattle that way do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such gruel as that give me the pen  i never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously or plough through another mans verbs and adjectives so relentlessly while he was in the midst of his work somebody shot at him through the open window and marred the symmetry of my ear  ah said he that is that scoundrel smith of the moral volcanohe was due yesterday and he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired smith dropped shot in the thigh the shot spoiled smiths aim who was just taking a second chance and he crippled a stranger it was me merely a finger shot off  then the chief editor went on with his erasures and interlineations just as he finished them a handgrenade came down the stovepipe and the explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments however it did no further damage except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out  that stove is utterly ruined said the chief editor  i said i believed it was  well no matterdont want it this kind of weather i know the man that did it ill get him now here is the way this stuff ought to be written  i took the manuscript it was scarred with erasures and interlineations till its mother wouldnt have known it if it had had one it now read as follows    spirit of the tennessee press    the inveterate liars of the semiweekly earthquake are   evidently endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous   people another of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to   that most glorious conception of the nineteenth century the   ballyhack railroad the idea that buzzardville was to be left off   at one side originated in their own fulsome brainsor rather in   the settlings which they regard as brains they had better   swallow this lie if they want to save their abandoned reptile   carcasses the cowhiding they so richly deserve    that ass blossom of the higginsville thunderbolt and   battlecry of freedom is down here again sponging at the van   buren    we observe that the besotted blackguard of the mud springs   morning howl is giving out with his usual propensity for   lying that van werter is not elected the heavenborn mission of   journalism is to disseminate truth to eradicate error to   educate refine and elevate the tone of public morals and   manners and make all men more gentle more virtuous more   charitable and in all ways better and holier and happier and   yet this blackhearted scoundrel degrades his great office   persistently to the dissemination of falsehood calumny   vituperation and vulgarity    blathersville wants a nicholson pavementit wants a jail and a   poorhouse more the idea of a pavement in a onehorse town   composed of two ginmills a blacksmithshop and that   mustardplaster of a newspaper the daily hurrah the crawling   insect buckner who edits the hurrah is braying about this   business with his customary imbecility and imagining that he is   talking sense  now that is the way to writepeppery and to the point mushandmilk journalism gives me the fantods  about this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash and gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back i moved out of rangei began to feel in the way  the chief said that was the colonel likely ive been expecting him for two days he will be up now right away  he was correct the colonel appeared in the door a moment afterwards with a dragoon revolver in his hand  he said sir have i the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this mangy sheet  you have be seated sir be careful of the chair one of its legs is gone i believe i have the honor of addressing the putrid liar colonel blatherskite tecumseh  right sir i have a little account to settle with you if you are at leisure we will begin  i have an article on the encouraging progress of moral and intellectual development in america to finish but there is no hurry begin  both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant the chief lost a lock of his hair and the colonels bullet ended its career in the fleshy part of my thigh the colonels left shoulder was clipped a little they fired again both missed their men this time but i got my share a shot in the arm at the third fire both gentlemen were wounded slightly and i had a knuckle chipped i then said i believed i would go out and take a walk as this was a private matter and i had a delicacy about participating in it further but both gentlemen begged me to keep my seat and assured me that i was not in the way  they then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded and i fell to tying up my wounds but presently they opened fire again with animation and every shot took effectbut it is proper to remark that five out of the six fell to my share the sixth one mortally wounded the colonel who remarked with fine humor that he would have to say goodmorning now as he had business uptown he then inquired the way to the undertakers and left  the chief turned to me and said i am expecting company to dinner and shall have to get ready it will be a favor to me if you will read proof and attend to the customers  i winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers but i was too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to think of anything to say  he continued jones will be here at threecowhide him gillespie will call earlier perhapsthrow him out of the window ferguson will be along about fourkill him that is all for today i believe if you have any odd time you may write a blistering article on the policegive the chief inspector rats the cowhides are under the table weapons in the drawerammunition there in the cornerlint and bandages up there in the pigeonholes in case of accident go to lancet the surgeon downstairs he advertiseswe take it out in trade  illustration gillespie had called  he was gone i shuddered at the end of the next three hours i had been through perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were gone from me gillespie had called and thrown me out of the window jones arrived promptly and when i got ready to do the cowhiding he took the job off my hands in an encounter with a stranger not in the bill of fare i had lost my scalp another stranger by the name of thompson left me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags and at last at bay in the corner and beset by an infuriated mob of editors blacklegs politicians and desperadoes who raved and swore and flourished their weapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of steel i was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the chief arrived and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends then ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen or steel one either could describe people were shot probed dismembered blown up thrown out of the window there was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy with a confused and frantic wardance glimmering through it and then all was over in five minutes there was silence and the gory chief and i sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around us  he said youll like this place when you get used to it  i said ill have to get you to excuse me i think maybe i might write to suit you after a while as soon as i had had some practice and learned the language i am confident i could but to speak the plain truth that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences and a man is liable to interruption you see that yourself vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public no doubt but then i do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth i cant write with comfort when i am interrupted so much as i have been today i like this berth well enough but i dont like to be left here to wait on the customers the experiences are novel i grant you and entertaining too after a fashion but they are not judiciously distributed a gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples me a bombshell comes down the stovepipe for your gratification and sends the stovedoor down my throat a friend drops in to swap compliments with you and freckles me with bulletholes till my skin wont hold my principles you go to dinner and jones comes with his cowhide gillespie throws me out of the window thompson tears all my clothes off and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their warpaint and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks take it altogether i never had such a spirited time in all my life as i have had today no i like you and i like your calm unruffled way of explaining things to the customers but you see i am not used to it the southern heart is too impulsive southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger the paragraphs which i have written today and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of tennessean journalism will wake up another nest of hornets all that mob of editors will comeand they will come hungry too and want somebody for breakfast i shall have to bid you adieu i decline to be present at these festivities i came south for my health i will go back on the same errand and suddenly tennessean journalism is too stirring for me  after which we parted with mutual regret and i took apartments at the hospital     nicodemus dodgeprinter   when i was a boy in a printingoffice in missouri a loosejointed longlegged towheaded jeansclad countrified cub of about sixteen lounged in one day and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat whose broken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bugeaten cabbageleaf stared indifferently around then leaned his hip against the editors table crossed his mighty brogans aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth laid him low and said with composure  whars the boss  i am the boss said the editor following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its clockface with his eye  dont want anybody fur to learn the business taint likely  well i dont know would you like to learn it  paps so po he caint run me no mo so i want to git a show somers if i kin taint no diffunce

like to begin  now  so within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us and with his coat off and hard at it  beyond that end of our establishment which was farthest from the street was a deserted garden pathless and thickly grown with the bloomy and villanous jimpson weed and its common friend the stately sunflower in the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little frame house with but one room one window and no ceilingit had been a smokehouse a generation before nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber  the village smarties recognized a treasure in nicodemus right awaya butt to play jokes on it was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding george jones had the glory of perpetrating the first joke on him he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and winked to the crowd to come the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of nicodemuss eyebrows and eyelashes he simply said  i consider them kind of seegyars dangersomeand seemed to suspect nothing the next evening nicodemus waylaid george and poured a bucket of icewater over him  one day while nicodemus was in swimming tom mcelroy tied his clothes nicodemus made a bonfire of toms by way of retaliation  a third joke was played upon nicodemus a day or two laterhe walked up the middle aisle of the village church sunday night with a staring handbill pinned between his shoulders the joker spent the remainder of the night after church in the cellar of a deserted house and nicodemus sat on the cellar door till towards breakfasttime to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made some rough treatment would be the consequence the cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud  but i wander from the point it was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection before a very long time had elapsed the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from old shelby experimenters grew scarce and chary now the young doctor came to the rescue there was delight and applause when he proposed to scare nicodemus to death and explained how he was going to do it he had a noble new skeletonthe skeleton of the late and only local celebrity jimmy finn the village drunkarda grisly piece of property which he had bought of jimmy finn himself at auction for fifty dollars under great competition when jimmy lay very sick in the tanyard a fortnight before his death the fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton the doctor would put jimmy finns skeleton in nicodemuss bed  this was doneabout halfpast ten in the evening about nicodemuss usual bedtimemidnightthe village jokers came creeping stealthily through the jimpson weeds and sunflowers towards the lonely frame den they reached the window and peeped in there sat the longlegged pauper on his bed in a very short shirt and nothing more he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth and wheezing the music of camptown races out of a paperoverlaid comb which he was pressing against his mouth by him lay a new jewsharp a new top a solid indiarubber ball a handful of painted marbles five pounds of store candy and a wellknawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of sheet music he had sold the skeleton to a travelling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result  illustration wheezing the music of camptown races     mr blokes item   our esteemed friend mr john william bloke of virginia city walked into the office where we are subeditor at a late hour last night with an expression of profound and heartfelt suffering upon his countenance and sighing heavily laid the following item reverently upon the desk and walked slowly out again he paused a moment at the door and seemed struggling to command his feelings sufficiently to enable him to speak and then nodding his head towards his manuscript ejaculated in a broken voice friend of mineoh how sad and burst into tears we were so moved at his distress that we did not think to call him back and endeavor to comfort him until he was gone and it was too late the paper had already gone to press but knowing that our friend would consider the publication of this item important and cherishing the hope that to print it would afford a melancholy satisfaction to his sorrowing heart we stopped the press at once and inserted it in our columns    distressing accidentlast evening about six oclock as mr   william schuyler an old and respectable citizen of south park   was leaving his residence to go downtown as has been his usual   custom for many years with the exception only of a short interval   in the spring of 1850 during which he was confined to his bed by   injuries received in attempting to stop a runaway horse by   thoughtlessly placing himself directly in its wake and throwing   up his hands and shouting which if he had done so even a single   moment sooner must inevitably have frightened the animal still   more instead of checking its speed although disastrous enough to   himself as it was and rendered more melancholy and distressing   by reason of the presence of his wifes mother who was there and   saw the sad occurrence notwithstanding it is at least likely   though not necessarily so that she should be reconnoitring in   another direction when incidents occur not being vivacious and   on the lookout as a general thing but even the reverse as her   own mother is said to have stated who is no more but died in   the full hope of a glorious resurrection upward of three years   ago aged eightysix being a christian woman and without guile   as it were or property in consequence of the fire of 1849   which destroyed every single thing she had in the world but such   is life let us all take warning by this solemn occurrence and   let us endeavor so to conduct ourselves that when we come to die   we can do it let us place our hands upon our heart and say with   earnestness and sincerity that from this day forth we will beware   of the intoxicating bowlfirst edition of the californian  the head editor has been in here raising the mischief and tearing his hair and kicking the furniture about and abusing me like a pickpocket he says that every time he leaves me in charge of the paper for half an hour i get imposed upon by the first infant or the first idiot that comes along and he says that that distressing item of mr blokes is nothing but a lot of distressing bosh and has no point to it and no sense in it and no information in it and that there was no sort of necessity for stopping the press to publish it  now all this comes of being goodhearted if i had been as unaccommodating and unsympathetic as some people i would have told mr bloke that i wouldnt receive his communication at such a late hour but no his snuffling distress touched my heart and i jumped at the chance of doing something to modify his misery i never read his item to see whether there was anything wrong about it but hastily wrote the few lines which preceded it and sent it to the printers and what has my kindness done for me it has done nothing but bring down upon me a storm of abuse and ornamental blasphemy  now i will read that item myself and see if there is any foundation for all this fuss and if there is the author of it shall hear from me                                       i have read it and i am bound to admit that it seems a little mixed at a first glance however i will peruse it once more                                       i have read it again and it does really seem a good deal more mixed than ever                                       i have read it over five times but if i can get at the meaning of it i wish i may get my just deserts it wont bear analysis there are things about it which i cannot understand at all it dont say what ever became of william schuyler it just says enough about him to get one interested in his career and then drops him who is william schuyler anyhow and what part of south park did he live in and if he started downtown at six oclock did he ever get there and if he did did anything happen to him is he the individual that met with the distressing accident considering the elaborate circumstantiality of detail observable in the item it seems to me that it ought to contain more information than it does on the contrary it is obscureand not only obscure but utterly incomprehensible was the breaking of mr schuylers leg fifteen years ago the distressing accident that plunged mr bloke into unspeakable grief and caused him to come up here at dead of night and stop our press to acquaint the world with the circumstance or did the distressing accident consist in the destruction of schuylers motherinlaws property in early times or did it consist in the death of that person herself three years ago albeit it does not appear that she died by accident in a word what did that distressing accident consist in what did that drivelling ass of a schuyler stand in the wake of a runaway horse for with his shouting and gesticulating if he wanted to stop him and how the mischief could he get run over by a horse that had already passed beyond him and what are we to take warning by and how is this extraordinary chapter of incomprehensibilities going to be a lesson to us and above all what has the intoxicating bowl got to do with it anyhow it is not stated that schuyler drank or that his wife drank or that his motherinlaw drank or that the horse drankwherefore then the reference to the intoxicating bowl it does seem to me that if mr bloke had let the intoxicating bowl alone himself he never would have got into so much trouble about this exasperating imaginary accident i have read this absurd item over and over again with all its insinuating plausibility until my head swims but i can make neither head nor tail of it there certainly seems to have been an accident of some kind or other but it is impossible to determine what the nature of it was or who was the sufferer by it i do not like to do it but i feel compelled to request that the next time anything happens to one of mr blokes friends he will append such explanatory notes to his account of it as will enable me to find out what sort of an accident it was and whom it happened to i had rather all his friends should die than that i should be driven to the verge of lunacy again in trying to cipher out the meaning of another such production as the above  illustration i have read this absurd item over     how i edited an agricultural paper   i did not take temporary editorship of an agricultural paper without misgivings neither would a landsman take command of a ship without misgivings but i was in circumstances that made the salary an object the regular editor of the paper was going off for a holiday and i accepted the terms he offered and took his place  the sensation of being at work again was luxurious and i wrought all the week with unflagging pleasure we went to press and i waited a day with some solicitude to see whether my effort was going to attract any notice as i left the office towards sundown a group of men and boys at the foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse and gave me passageway and i heard one or two of them say thats him i was naturally pleased by this incident the next morning i found a similar group at the foot of the stairs and scattering couples and individuals standing here and there in the street and over the way watching me with interest the group separated and fell back as i approached and i heard a man say look at his eye i pretended not to observe the notice i was attracting but secretly i was pleased with it and was purposing to write an account of it to my aunt i went up the short flight of stairs and heard cheery voices and a ringing laugh as i drew near the door which i opened and caught a glimpse of two young rurallooking men whose faces blanched and lengthened when they saw me and then they both plunged through the window with a great crash i was surprised  in about half an hour an old gentleman with a flowing beard and a fine but rather austere face entered and sat down at my invitation he seemed to have something on his mind he took off his hat and set it on the floor and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our paper  he put the paper on his lap and while he polished his spectacles with his handkerchief he said are you the new editor  i said i was  have you ever edited an agricultural paper before  no i said this is my first attempt  very likely have you had any experience in agriculture practically  no i believe i have not  some instinct told me so said the old gentleman putting on his spectacles and looking over them at me with asperity while he folded his paper into a convenient shape i wish to read you what must have made me have that instinct it was this editorial listen and see if it was you that wrote it    turnips should never be pulled it injures them it is much   better to send a boy up and let him shake the tree  now what do you think of thatfor i really suppose you wrote it  think of it why i think it is good i think it is sense i have no doubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a halfripe condition when if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree  shake your grandmother turnips dont grow on trees  oh they dont dont they well who said they did the language was intended to be figurative wholly figurative anybody that knows anything will know that i meant that the boy should shake the vine  then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds and stamped on them and broke several things with his cane and said i did not know as much as a cow and then went out and banged the door after him and in short acted in such a way that i fancied he was displeased about something but not knowing what the trouble was i could not be any help to him  pretty soon after this a long cadaverous creature with lanky locks hanging down to his shoulders and a weeks stubble bristling from the hills and valleys of his face darted within the door and halted motionless with finger on lip and head and body bent in listening attitude no sound was heard still he listened no sound then he turned the key in the door and came elaborately tiptoeing towards me till he was within long reaching distance of me when he stopped and after scanning my face with intense interest for a while drew a folded copy of our paper from his bosom and said  there you wrote that read it to mequick relieve me i suffer  illustration a long cadaverous creature  i read as follows and as the sentences fell from my lips i could see the relief come i could see the drawn muscles relax and the anxiety go out of the face and rest and peace steal over the features like the merciful moonlight over a desolate landscape    the guano is a fine bird but great care is necessary in rearing   it it should not be imported earlier than june or later than   september in the winter it should be kept in a warm place where   it can hatch out its young    it is evident that we are to have a backward season for grain   therefore it will be well for the farmer to begin setting out his   cornstalks and planting his buckwheatcakes in july instead of   august    concerning the pumpkinthis berry is a favorite with the   natives of the interior of new england who prefer it to the   gooseberry for the making of fruitcake and who likewise give it   the preference over the raspberry for feeding cows as being more   filling and fully as satisfying the pumpkin is the only esculent   of the orange family that will thrive in the north except the   gourd and one or two varieties of the squash but the custom of   planting it in the front yard with the shrubbery is fast going   out of vogue for it is now generally conceded that the pumpkin   as a shade tree is a failure    now as the warm weather approaches and the ganders begin to   spawn  the excited listener sprang towards me to shake hands and said  there therethat will do i know i am all right now because you have read it just as i did word for word but stranger when i first read it this morning i said to myself i never never believed it before notwithstanding my friends kept me under watch so strict but now i believe i am crazy and with that i fetched a howl that you might have heard two miles and started out to kill somebodybecause you know i knew it would come to that sooner or later and so i might as well begin i read one of them paragraphs over again so as to be certain and then i burned my house down and started i have crippled several people and have got one fellow up a tree where i can get him if i want him but i thought i would call in here as i passed along and make the thing perfectly certain and now it is certain and i tell you it is lucky for the chap that is in the tree i should have killed him sure as i went back goodbye sir goodbye you have taken a great load off my mind my reason has stood the strain of one of your agricultural articles and i know that nothing can ever unseat it now goodbye sir  i felt a little uncomfortable about the cripplings and arsons this person had been entertaining himself with for i could not help feeling remotely accessory to them but these thoughts were quickly banished for the regular editor walked in i thought to myself now if you had gone to egypt as i recommended you to i might have had a chance to get my hand in but you wouldnt do it and here you are i sort of expected you  the editor was looking sad and perplexed and dejected  he surveyed the wreck which that old rioter and these two young farmers had made and then said this is a sad businessa very sad business there is the mucilagebottle broken and six panes of glass and a spittoon and two candlesticks but that is not the worst the reputation of the paper is injuredand permanently i fear true there never was such a call for the paper before and it never sold such a large edition or soared to such celebrity but does one want to be famous for lunacy and prosper upon the infirmities of his mind my friend as i am an honest man the street out here is full of people and others are roosting on the fences waiting to get a glimpse of you because they think you are crazy and well they might after reading your editorials they are a disgrace to journalism why what put it into your head that you could edit a paper of this nature you do not seem to know the first rudiments of agriculture you speak of a furrow and a harrow as being the same thing you talk of the moulting season for cows and you recommend the domestication of the polecat on account of its playfulness and its excellence as a ratter your remark that clams will lie quiet if music be played to them was superfluousentirely superfluous nothing disturbs clams clams always lie quiet clams care nothing whatever about music ah heavens and earth friend if you had made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life you could not have graduated with higher honor than you could today i never saw anything like it your observation that the horsechestnut as an article of commerce is steadily gaining in favor is simply calculated to destroy this journal i want you to throw up your situation and go i want no more holidayi could not enjoy it if i had it certainly not with you in my chair i would always stand in dread of what you might be going to recommend next it makes me lose all patience every time i think of your discussing oysterbeds under the head of landscape gardening i want you to go nothing on earth could persuade me to take another holiday oh why didnt you tell me you didnt know anything about agriculture  tell you you cornstalk you cabbage you son of a cauliflower its the first time i ever heard such an unfeeling remark i tell you i have been in the editorial business going on fourteen years and it is the first time i ever heard of a mans having to know anything in order to edit a newspaper you turnip who write the dramatic critiques for the secondrate papers why a parcel of promoted shoemakers and apprentice apothecaries who know just as much about good acting as i do about good farming and no more who review the books people who never wrote one who do up the heavy leaders on finance parties who have had the largest opportunities for knowing nothing about it who criticise the indian campaigns gentlemen who do not know a warwhoop from a wigwam and who never have had to run a footrace with a tomahawk or pluck arrows out of the several members of their families to build the evening campfire with who write the temperance appeals and clamor about the flowing bowl folks who will never draw another sober breath till they do it in the grave who edit the agricultural papers youyam men as a general thing who fail in the poetry line yellowcolored novel line sensationdrama line cityeditor line and finally fall back on agriculture as a temporary reprieve from the poorhouse you try to tell me anything about the newspaper business sir i have been through it from alpha to omaha and i tell you that the less a man knows the bigger the noise he makes and the higher the salary he commands heaven knows if i had but been ignorant instead of cultivated and impudent instead of diffident i could have made a name for myself in this cold selfish world i take my leave sir since i have been treated as you have treated me i am perfectly willing to go but i have done my duty i have fulfilled my contract as far as i was permitted to do it i said i could make your paper of interest to all classesand i have i said i could run your circulation up to twenty thousand copies and if i had had two more weeks id have done it and id have given you the best class of readers that ever an agricultural paper hadnot a farmer in it nor a solitary individual who could tell a watermelontree from a peachvine to save his life you are the loser by this rupture not me pieplant adios  i then left     the killing of julius c√¶sar localized      being the only true and reliable account ever published taken from     the roman daily evening fasces of the date of that tremendous     occurrence   nothing in the world affords a newspaper reporter so much satisfaction as gathering up the details of a bloody and mysterious murder and writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality he takes a living delight in this labor of lovefor such it is to him especially if he knows that all the other papers have gone to press and his will be the only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence a feeling of regret has often come over me that i was not reporting in rome when c√¶sar was killedreporting on an evening paper and the only one in the city and getting at least twelve hours ahead of the morningpaper boys with this most magnificent item that ever fell to the lot of the craft other events have happened as startling as this but none that possessed so peculiarly all the characteristics of the favorite item of the present day magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high rank fame and social and political standing of the actors in it  however as i was not permitted to report c√¶sars assassination in the regular way it has at least afforded me rare satisfaction to translate the following able account of it from the original latin of the roman daily evening fasces of that datesecond edition    our usually quiet city of rome was thrown into a state of wild   excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody   affrays which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear while   they inspire all thinking men with forebodings for the future of   a city where human life is held so cheaply and the gravest laws   are so openly set at defiance as the result of that affray it   is our painful duty as public journalists to record the death   of one of our most esteemed citizensa man whose name is known   wherever this paper circulates and whose fame it has been our   pleasure and our privilege to extend and also to protect from   the tongue of slander and falsehood to the best of our poor   ability we refer to mr j c√¶sar the emperorelect    the facts of the case as nearly as our reporter could   determine them from the conflicting statements of eyewitnesses   were about as followsthe affair was an election row of   course ninetenths of the ghastly butcheries that disgrace the   city nowadays grow out of the bickerings and jealousies and   animosities engendered by these accursed elections rome would be   the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to serve a   century for in our experience we have never even been able to   choose a dogpelter without celebrating the event with a dozen   knockdowns and a general cramming of the stationhouse with   drunken vagabonds overnight it is said that when the immense   majority for c√¶sar at the polls in the market was declared the   other day and the crown was offered to that gentleman even his   amazing unselfishness in refusing it three times was not   sufficient to save him from the whispered insults of such men as   casca of the tenth ward and other hirelings of the disappointed   candidate hailing mostly from the eleventh and thirteenth and   other outside districts who were overheard speaking ironically   and contemptuously of mr c√¶sars conduct upon that occasion    we are further informed that there are many among us who think   they are justified in believing that the assassination of julius   c√¶sar was a putup thinga cutanddried arrangement hatched by   marcus brutus and a lot of his hired roughs and carried out only   too faithfully according to the programme whether there be good   grounds for this suspicion or not we leave to the people to   judge for themselves only asking that they will read the   following account of the sad occurrence carefully and   dispassionately before they render that judgment    the senate was already in session and c√¶sar was coming down   the street towards the capitol conversing with some personal   friends and followed as usual by a large number of citizens   just as he was passing in front of demosthenes  thucydides   drugstore he was observing casually to a gentleman who our   informant thinks is a fortuneteller that the ides of march   were come the reply was yes they are come but not gone yet   at this moment artemidorus stepped up and passed the time of day   and asked c√¶sar to read a schedule or a tract or something of the   kind which he had brought for his perusal mr decius brutus   also said something about an humble suit which he wanted   read artemidorus begged that attention might be paid to his   first because it was of personal consequence to c√¶sar the   latter replied that what concerned himself should be read last   or words to that effect artemidorus begged and beseeched him to   read the paper instantly1 however c√¶sar shook him off and   refused to read any petition in the street he then entered the   capitol and the crowd followed him    about this time the following conversation was overheard and we   consider that taken in connection with the events which   succeeded it it bears an appalling significance mr papilius   lena remarked to george w cassius commonly known as the nobby   boy of the third ward a bruiser in the pay of the opposition   that he hoped his enterprise today might thrive and when   cassius asked what enterprise he only closed his left eye   temporarily and said with simulated indifference fare you   well and sauntered towards c√¶sar marcus brutus who is   suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed c√¶sar   asked what it was that lena had said cassius told him and   added in a low tone i fear our purpose is discovered    brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on lena   and a moment after cassius urged that lean and hungry vagrant   casca whose reputation here is none of the best to be sudden   for he feared prevention he then turned to brutus apparently   much excited and asked what should be done and swore that   either he or c√¶sar should never turn backhe would kill   himself first at this time c√¶sar was talking to some of the   backcountry members about the approaching fall elections and   paying little attention to what was going on around him billy   trebonius got into conversation with the peoples friend and   c√¶sarsmark antonyand under some pretence or other got him   away and brutus decius casca cinna metellus cimber and   others of the gang of infamous desperadoes that infest rome at   present closed around the doomed c√¶sar then metellus cimber   knelt down and begged that his brother might be recalled from   banishment but c√¶sar rebuked him for his fawning conduct and   refused to grant his petition immediately at cimbers request   first brutus and then cassius begged for the return of the   banished publius but c√¶sar still refused he said he could not   be moved that he was as fixed as the north star and proceeded   to speak in the most complimentary terms of the firmness of that   star and its steady character then he said he was like it and   he believed he was the only man in the country that was   therefore since he was constant that cimber should be   banished he was also constant that he should stay banished   and hed be hanged if he didnt keep him so    instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight   casca sprang at c√¶sar and struck him with a dirk c√¶sar grabbing   him by the arm with his right hand and launching a blow straight   from the shoulder with his left that sent the reptile bleeding to   the earth he then backed up against pompeys statue and squared   himself to receive his assailants cassius and cimber and cinna   rushed upon him with their daggers drawn and the former   succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his body but before he   could strike again and before either of the others could strike   at all c√¶sar stretched the three miscreants at his feet with as   many blows of his powerful fist by this time the senate was in   an indescribable uproar the throng of citizens in the lobbies   had blockaded the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from   the building the sergeantatarms and his assistants were   struggling with the assassins venerable senators had cast aside   their encumbering robes and were leaping over benches and flying   down the aisles in wild confusion towards the shelter of the   committeerooms and a thousand voices were shouting police   police in discordant tones that rose above the frightful din   like shrieking winds above the roaring of a tempest and amid it   all great c√¶sar stood with his back against the statue like a   lion at bay and fought his assailants weaponless and hand to   hand with the defiant bearing and the unwavering courage which   he had shown before on many a bloody field billy trebonius and   caius legarius struck him with their daggers and fell as their   brotherconspirators before them had fallen but at last when   c√¶sar saw his old friend brutus step forward armed with a   murderous knife it is said he seemed utterly overpowered with   grief and amazement and dropping his invincible left arm by his   side he hid his face in the folds of his mantle and received the   treacherous blow without an effort to stay the hand that gave it   he only said et tu brute and fell lifeless on the marble   pavement    we learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was   the same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he   overcame the nervii and that when it was removed from the corpse   it was found to be cut and gashed in no less than seven different   places there was nothing in the pockets it will be exhibited at   the coroners inquest and will be damning proof of the fact of   the killing these latter facts may be relied on as we get them   from mark antony whose position enables him to learn every item   of news connected with the one subject of absorbing interest of   today    illustration there was nothing in the pockets    laterwhile the coroner was summoning a jury mark antony and   other friends of the late c√¶sar got hold of the body and lugged   it off to the forum and at last accounts antony and brutus were   making speeches over it and raising such a row among the people   that as we go to press the chief of police is satisfied there   is going to be a riot and is taking measures accordingly   footnote 1 mark that it is hinted by william shakespeare who saw the beginning and the end of the unfortunate affray that this schedule was simply a note discovering to c√¶sar that a plot was brewing to take his life     the end
