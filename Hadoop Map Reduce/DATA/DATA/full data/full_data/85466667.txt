85466667	women and politics   by the rev canon kingsley  reprinted from macmillans magazine  published by the london national society for womens suffrage  london printed by spottiswoode  co newstreet square farringdon street and 80 parliament street westminster 1869     women and politics 3   somewhat more than 300 years ago john knox who did more than any man to mould the thoughts of his nationand indeed of our english puritans likewisewas writing a little book on the regiment of women in which he proved woman on account of her natural inferiority to man unfit to rule  and but the other day mr john stuart mill who has done more than any man to mould the thought of the rising generation of englishmen has written a little book in the exactly opposite sense on the subjection of women in which he proves woman on account of her natural equality with man to be fit to rule  truly the whirligig of time brings round its revenges  to this point the reason of civilised nations has come or at least is coming fast after some fifteen hundred years of unreason and of a literature of unreason which discoursed gravely and learnedly of nuns and witches hysteria and madness persecution and torture and like a madman in his dreams built up by irrefragable logic a whole inverted pyramid of seeming truth upon a single false premiss  to this it has come after long centuries in which woman was regarded by celibate theologians as the noxious animal the temptress the source of earthly misery which derivedat least in one casefemina from fe faith and minus less because women had less faith than men which represented them as of more violent and unbridled animal passions which explained learnedly why they were more tempted than men to heresy and witchcraft and more subject those especially who had beautiful hair to the attacks of demons and in a word regarded them as a necessary evil to be tolerated despised repressed and if possible shut up in nunneries  of this literature of celibate unreason those who have no time to read for themselves the pages of sprenger meier or delrio the jesuit may find notices enough in michelet and in both mr leckys excellent works they may find enough of it and to spare also in burtons anatomy of melancholy  he like knox and many another scholar of the 16th and of the first half of the 17th century was unable to free his brain altogether from the idola specus which haunted the cell of the bookworm  the poor student knowing nothing of women save from books or from contact with the most debased repeated with the pruriency of a boy the falsehoods about women which armed with the authority of learned doctors had grown reverend and incontestable with age and even after the reformation more than one witchmania proved that the corrupt tree had vitality enough left to bring forth evil fruit  but the axe had been laid to the root thereof  the later witch prosecutions were not to be compared for extent and atrocity to the mediaeval ones and first as it would seem in france and gradually in other european countries the old contempt of women was being replaced by admiration and trust  such examples as that of marguerite dangouleme did much especially in the south of france where science as well as the bible was opening mens eyes more and more to nature and to fact good little rondelet or any of his pupils would have as soon thought of burning a woman for a witch as they would have of immuring her in a nunnery  in scotland john knoxs book came happily for the nation too late  the woes of mary stuart called out for her a feeling of chivalry which has done much even to the present day to elevate the scotch character meanwhile the same influences which raised the position of women among the reformed in france raised it likewise in scotland and there is no country on earth in which wives and mothers have been more honoured and more justly honoured for two centuries and more  in england the passionate loyalty with which elizabeth was regarded at least during the latter part of her reign scattered to the winds all john knoxs arguments against the regiment of women and a literature sprang up in which woman was set forth no longer as the weakling and the temptress but as the guide and the inspirer of man  whatever traces of the old foul leaven may be found in beaumont and fletcher massinger or ben jonson such books as sidneys arcadia lylys euphues spensers fairy queen and last but not least shakespeares plays place the conception of woman and of the rights of woman on a vantageground from which i believe it can never permanently fall againat least until which god forbid true manhood has died out of england  to a boy whose notions of his duty to woman had been formed not on horace and juvenal but on spenser and shakespeareas i trust they will be some day in every public schoolmr john stuart mills new book would seem little more than a textbook of truths which had been familiar and natural to him ever since he first stood by his mothers knee  i say this not in depreciation of mr mills book  i mean it for the very highest praise  m agassiz says somewhere that every great scientific truth must go through three stages of public opinion  men will say of it first that it is not true next that it is contrary to religion and lastly that every one knew it already  the last assertion of the three is often more than half true  in many cases every one ought to have known the truth already if they had but used their common sense the great antiquity of the earth is a case in point  forty years ago it was still untrue fiveandtwenty years ago it was still contrary to religion  now every child who uses his common sense can see from looking at the rocks and stones about him that the earth is many thousand it may be many hundreds of thousands of years old and there is no difficulty now in making him convince himself by his own eyes and his own reason of the most prodigious facts of the glacial epoch  and so it ought to be with the truths which mr mill has set forth  if the minds of lads can but be kept clear of pagan brutalities and mediaeval superstitions and fed instead on the soundest and noblest of our english literature mr mills creed about women will i verily believe seem to them as one which they have always held by instinct as a natural deduction from their own intercourse with their mothers their aunts their sisters and thus mr mills book may achieve the highest triumph of which such a book is capable namelythat years hence young men will not care to read it because they take it all for granted  there are those who for years past have held opinions concerning women identical with those of mr mill  they thought it best however to keep them to themselves trusting to the truth of the old saying run not round after the world  if you stand still long enough the world will come round to you  and the world seems now to be coming round very fast towards their standingpoint and that not from theory but from experience  as to the intellectual capacity of girls when competing with boys and i may add as to the prudence of educating boys and girls together the experience of those who for twenty years past have kept up mixed schools in which the farmers daughter has sat on the same bench with the labourers son has been corroborated by all who have tried mixed classes or have like the cambridge local examiners applied to the powers of girls the same tests as they applied to boys and still more strikingly by the results of admitting women to the royal college of science in ireland where young ladies have repeatedly carried off prizes for scientific knowledge against young men who have proved themselves by subsequent success in life to have been formidable rivals  on every side the conviction seems growing a conviction which any man might have arrived at for himself long ago if he would have taken the trouble to compare the powers of his own daughters with those of his sons that there is no difference in kind and probably none in degree between the intellect of a woman and that of a man and those who will not as yet assent to this are growing more willing to allow fresh experiments on the question and to confess that after all as mr fitch well says in his report to the schools inquiry commission the true measure of a womans right to knowledge is her capacity for receiving it and not any theories of ours as to what she is fit for or what use she is likely to make of it  this is doubtless a most important concession  for if it be allowed to be true of womans capacity for learning it ought to beand i believe will beallowed to be true of all her other capacities whatsoever  from which fresh concession results will follow startling no doubt to those who fancy that the world always was and always will be what it was yesterday and today but results which some who have contemplated them steadily and silently for years past have learnt to look at not with fear and confusion but with earnest longing and high hope  however startling these results may be it is certain from the books the names whereof head this article that some who desire their fulfilment are no mere fanatics or dreamers  they evince without exception that moderation which is a proof of true earnestness  mr mills book it is almost an impertinence in me to praise  i shall not review it in detail it is known i presume to every reader of this magazine either by itself or reviews but let me remind those who only know the book through reviews that those reviews however able or fair are most probably written by men of inferior intellect to mr mill and by men who have not thought over the subject as long and as deeply as he has done and that therefore if they wish to know what mr mill thinks it would be wisest for them to read mr mill himselfa truism which in these days of secondhand knowledge will apply to a good many books beside  but if they still fancy that the advocates of womans rights in england are of the same temper as certain female clubbists in america with whose sayings and doings the public has been amused or shocked then i beg them to peruse the article on the social position of women by mr boyd kinnear to find any fault with it they can and after that to show cause why it should not be reprinted as it ought to be in the form of a pamphlet and circulated among the working men of britain to remind them that their duty toward woman coincides as to all human duties with their own palpable interest  i beg also attention to dr hodgsons little book lectures on the education of girls and employment of women and not only to the text but to the valuable notes and references which accompany them  or if any one wish to ascertain the temper as well as the intellectual calibre of the ladies who are foremost in this movement let them read as specimens of two different styles the introduction to womans work and womans culture by mrs butler and the article on female suffrage by miss wedgewood at p 247  i only ask that these two articles should be judged on their own meritsthe fact that they are written by women being ignored meanwhile after that has been done it may be but just and right for the man who has read them to ask himself especially if he has had a mother whether women who can so think and write have not a right to speak and a right to be heard when they speak of a subject with which they must be better acquainted than menwomans capacities and womans needs  if any one who has not as yet looked into this womans question wishes to know how it has risen to the surface just now let them consider these words of mrs butler  they will prove at least that the movement has not had its origin in the study but in the market not from sentimental dreams or abstract theories but from the necessities of physical fact     the census taken eight years ago gave three and a half millions of    women in england working for a subsistence and of these two and a    half millions were unmarried  in the interval between the census of    1851 and that of 1861 the number of selfsupporting women had    increased by more than half a million  this is significant and still    more striking i believe on this point will be the returns of the    nest census two years hence  thus a demand for employment has led naturally to a demand for improved education fitting woman for employment and that again has led naturally also to a demand on the part of many thoughtful women for a share in making those laws and those social regulations which have while made exclusively by men resulted in leaving women at a disadvantage at every turn  they askand they have surely some cause to askwhat greater right have men to dictate to women the rules by which they shall live than women have to dictate to men  all they demandall at least that is demanded in the volumes noticed in this reviewis fair play for women a clear stage and no favour  let natural selection as miss wedgwood well says decide which is the superior and in what  let it by the laws of supply and demand draught women as well as men into the employments and positions for which they are most fitted by nature  to those who believe that the laws of nature are the laws of god the vox dei in rebus revelata that to obey them is to prove our real faith in god to interfere with them as we did in social relations throughout the middle ages and as we did till lately in commercial relations likewise by arbitrary restrictions is to show that we have no faith in god and consider ourselves wise enough to set right an illmade universeto them at least this demand must seem both just and modest  meanwhile many women and some men also think the social status of women is just now in special peril  the late extension of the franchise has admitted to a share in framing our laws many thousands of men of that class whichwhatever be their other virtues and they are manyis most given to spending their wives earnings in drink and personally maltreating them and least likelyto judge from the actions of certain tradesto admit women to free competition for employment  further extension of the suffrage will perhaps in a very few years admit many thousands more  and it is no wonder if refined and educated women in an age which is disposed to see in the possession of a vote the best means of selfdefence should ask for votes for the defence not merely of themselves but of their lowlier sisters from the tyranny of men who are as yetto the shame of the statemost of them altogether uneducated  as for the reasonableness of such a demand i can only saywhat has been said elsewherethat the present state of things in which the franchise is considered as something so important and so sacred that the most virtuous the most pious the most learned the most wealthy the most benevolent the most justly powerful woman is refused it as something too precious for her and yet it is entrusted freely and hopefully to any illiterate drunken wifebeating ruffian who can contrive to keep a home over his head is equally unjust and absurd  there may be some sufficient answer to the conclusion which conscience and common sense left to themselves would draw from this statement of the case as it now stands but none has occurred to me which is not contrary to the first principle of a free government  this i presume to be that every citizen has a right to share in choosing those who make the laws in order to prevent as far as he can laws being made which are unjust and injurious to him to his family or to his class and that all are to be considered as active citizens save the criminal the insane or those unable to support themselves  the best rough test of a mans being able to support himself is i doubt not his being able to keep a house over his head or at least a permanent lodging and that i presume will be in a few years the one and universal test of active citizenship unless we should meanwhile obtain the boon of a compulsory government education and an educational franchise founded thereon  but it must be askedand answered alsowhat is there in such a test even as it stands now only partially applied which is not as fair for women as it is for men  is it just that an educated man who is able independently to earn his own livelihood should have a vote but that an equally educated woman equally able independently to earn her own livelihood should not  is it just that a man owning a certain quantity of property should have a vote in respect of that property but that a woman owning the same quantity of property and perhaps a hundred or a thousand times more should have no vote what difference founded on nature and fact exists between the two cases  if it be said that nature and fact arguments grounded on aught else are to be left to monks and mediaeval jurists prove that women are less able than men to keep a house over their head or to manage their property the answer is that fact is the other way  women are just as capable as men of managing a large estate a vast wealth  mr mill gives a fact which surprised even himthat the best administered indian states were those governed by women who could neither read nor write and were confined all their lives to the privacy of the harem  and any one who knows the english upper classes must know more than one illustrious instancebesides that of miss burdett coutts or the late dowager lady londonderryin which a woman has proved herself able to use wealth and power as well or better than most men  the woman at least is not likely by gambling horseracing and profligacy to bring herself and her class to shame  women too in every town keep shops  is there the slightest evidence that these shops are not as well managed and as remunerative as those kept by menunless indeed as too often happens poor madame has her mantalini and his vices to support as well as herself and her children  as for the womans power of supporting herself and keeping up at least a lodging respectably can any one have lived past middle age without meeting dozens of single women or widows of all ranks who do that and do it better and more easily than men because they do not like men require wine beer tobacco and sundry other luxuries  so wise and thrifty are such women that very many of them are able out of their own pittance to support beside themselves others who have no legal claim upon them  who does not know if he knows anything of society the truth of mr butlers wordsit is a very generally accepted axiom and one which it seems has been endorsed by thoughtful men without a sufficiently minute examination into the truth of it that a manin the matter of maintenancemeans generally a man a wife and children while a woman means herself alone free of dependence a closer inquiry into the facts of life would prove that conclusions have been too hastily adopted on the latter head  i believe it may be said with truth that there is scarcely a female teacher in england who is not working for another or others besides herselfthat a very large proportion are urged on of necessity in their work by the dependence on them of whole families in many cases of their own aged parentsthat many hundreds are keeping brokendown relatives fathers and brothers out of the workhouse and that many are widows supporting their own children  a few examples taken at random from the lists of governesses applying to the institution in sackville street london would illustrate this point  and let it be remembered that such cases are the rule and not the exception  indeed if the facts of life were better known the hollowness of this defence of the inequality of payment would become manifest for it is in theory alone that in families man is the only breadwinner and it is false to suppose that single women have no obligations to make and to save money as sacred as those which are imposed on a man by marriage while there is this difference that a man may avoid such obligation if he pleases by refraining from marriage while the poverty of parents or the dependence of brothers and sisters are circumstances over which a woman obliged to work for others has no control  true and alas too true  but what mr butler asserts of governesses may be asserted with equal truth of hundreds of maiden aunts and maiden sisters who are not engaged in teaching but who spend their money their time their love their intellect upon profligate or brokendown relations or upon their children and who exhibit through long years of toil anxiety selfsacrifice a courage a promptitude a knowledge of business and of human nature and a simple but lofty standard of duty and righteousness which if it does not fit them for the franchise what can  it may be that such women would not care to use the franchise if they had it  that is their concern not ours  voters who do not care to vote may be counted by thousands among men some of them perhaps are wiser than their fellows and not more foolish and take that method of showing their wisdom  be that as it may we are no more justified in refusing a human being a right because he may not choose to exercise it than we are in refusing to pay him his due because he may probably hoard the money  the objection that such women are better without a vote because a vote would interest them in politics and so interfere with their domestic duties seems slender enough  what domestic duties have they of which the state can take cognisance save their duty to those to whom they may owe money and their duty to keep the peace  their other and nobler duties are voluntary and selfimposed and most usually are fulfilled as secretly as possible  the state commits an injustice in debarring a woman from the rights of a citizen because she chooses over and above them to perform the good works of a saint  and after all will it be the worse for these women or for the society in which they live if they do interest themselves in politics  might not as mr boyd kinnear urges in an article as sober and rational as it is earnest and chivalrous their purity and earnestness help to make what is now called politics somewhat more pure somewhat more earnest  might not the presence of the voting power of a few virtuous experienced well educated women keep candidates for very shame from saying and doing things from which they do not shrink before a crowd of men who are on the average neither virtuous experienced or welleducated by wholesome dread of that most terrible of all earthly punishmentsat least in the eyes of a manly manthe fine scorn of a noble woman  might not the intervention of a few women who are living according to the eternal laws of god help to infuse some slightly stronger tincture of those eternal laws into our legislators and their legislation  what women have done for the social reforms of the last forty years is known or ought to be known to all  might not they have done far more and might not they do far more hereafter if they who generally know far more than men do of human suffering and of the consequences of human folly were able to ask for further social reforms not merely as a boon to be begged from the physically stronger sex but as their will which they as citizens have a right to see fulfilled if just and possible woman has played for too many centuries the part which lady godiva plays in the old legend  it is time that she should not be content with mitigating by her entreaties or her charities the cruelty and greed of men but exercise her right as a member of the state and as i believe a member of christ and a child of god to forbid them  as for any specific difference between the intellect of women and that of men which should preclude the former meddling in politics i must confess that the subtle distinctions drawn even by those who uphold the intellectual equality of women have almost if not altogether escaped me  the only important difference i think is that men are generally duller and more conceited than women  the dulness is natural enough on the broad ground that the males of all animals being more sensual and selfish are duller than the females  the conceit is easily accounted for  the english boy is told from childhood as the negro boy is that men are superior to women  the negro boy shows his assent to the proposition by beating his mother the english one by talking down his sisters  that is all  but if there be no specific intellectual difference as there is actually none is there any practical and moral difference  i use the two epithets as synonymous for practical power may exist without acuteness of intellect but it cannot exist without sobriety patience and courage and sundry other virtues which are moral in every sense of that word  i know of no such difference  there are doubtless fields of political action more fitted for men than for women but are there not again fields more fitted for women than for menfields in which certain women at least have already shown such practical capacity that they have established not only their own right but a general right for the able and educated of their sex to advise officially about that which they themselves have unofficially mastered  who will say that mrs fry or miss nightingale or miss burdett coutts is not as fit to demand pledges of a candidate at the hustings on important social questions as any male elector or to give her deliberate opinion thereon in either house of parliament as any average mp or peer of the realm  and if it be said that these are only brilliant exceptions the rejoinder is what proof have you of that  you cannot pronounce on the powers of the average till you have tried them  these exceptions rather prove the existence of unsuspected and unemployed strength below  if a few persons of genius in any class succeed in breaking through the barriers of routine and prejudice their success shows that they have left behind them many more who would follow in their steps if those barriers were but removed  this has been the case in every forward movement religious scientific or social  a daring spirit here and there has shown his fellowmen what could be known what could be done and behold when once awakened to a sense of their own powers multitudes have proved themselves as capable though not as daring as the leaders of their forlorn hope  dozens of geologists can now work out problems which would have puzzled hutton or werner dozens of surgeons can perform operations from which john hunter would have shrunk appalled and dozens of women were they allowed would i believe fulfil in political and official posts the hopes which miss wedgwood and mr boyd kinnear entertain  but after all it is hard to say anything on this matter which has not been said in other words by mr mill himself in pp 98104 of his subjection of women or give us more sound and palpable proof of womens political capacity than the paragraph with which he ends his argument     is it reasonable to think that those who are fit for the greater    functions of politics are incapable of qualifying themselves for the    less  is there any reason in the nature of things that the wives    and sisters of princes should whenever called on be found as    competent as the princes themselves to their business but that the    wives and sisters of statesmen and administrators and directors of    companies and managers of public institutions should be unable to do    what is done by their brothers and husbands  the real reason is plain    enough it is that princesses being more raised above the generality    of men by their rank than placed below them by their sex have never    been taught that it was improper for them to concern themselves with    politics but have been allowed to feel the liberal interest natural    to any cultivated human being in the great transactions which took    place around them and in which they might be called on to take a    part  the ladies of reigning families are the only women who are    allowed the same range of interests and freedom of development as men    and it is precisely in their case that there is not found to be any    inferiority  exactly where and in proportion as womens capacities    for government have been tried in that proportion have they been    found adequate  though the demands of women just now are generally urged in the order offirst employment then education and lastly the franchise i have dealt principally with the latter because i sincerely believe that it and it only will lead to their obtaining a just measure of the two former  had i been treating of an ideal or even a truly civilised polity i should have spoken of education first for education ought to be the necessary and sole qualification for the franchise  but we have not so ordered it in england in the case of men and in all fairness we ought not to do so in the case of women  we have not so ordered it and we had no right to order it otherwise than we have done  if we have neglected to give the masses due education we have no right to withhold the franchise on the strength of that neglect  like frankenstein we may have made our man ill but we cannot help his being alive and if he destroys us it is our own fault  if any reply that to add a number of uneducated womenvoters to the number of uneducated menvoters will be only to make the danger worse the answer isthat women will be always less brutal than men and will exercise on them unless they are maddened as in the first french revolution by the hunger and misery of their children the same softening influence in public life which they now exercise in private and moreover that as things stand now the average woman is more educated in every sense of the word than the average man and that to admit women would be to admit a class of voters superior not inferior to the average  startling as this may sound to some i assert that it is true  we must recollect that the just complaints of the insufficient education of girls proceed almost entirely from that lowerupper class which stocks the professions including the press that this class furnishes only a small portion of the whole number of voters that the vast majority belong and will belong still more hereafter to other classes of whom we may say that in all of them the girls are better educated than the boys  they stay longer at schoolsometimes twice as long  they are more open to the purifying and elevating influences of religion their brains are neither muddled away with drink and profligacy or narrowed by the one absorbing aim of turning a penny into five farthings they have a far larger share than their brothers of that best of all practical and moral educations that of family life  any one who has had experience of the families of farmers and small tradesmen knows how boorish the lads are beside the intelligence and often the refinement of their sisters  the same rule holds i am told in the manufacturing districts  even in the families of employers the young ladies are and have been for a generation or two far more highly cultivated than their brothers whose intellects are always early absorbed in business and too often injured by pleasure  the same i believe in spite of all that has been written about the frivolity of the girl of the period holds true of that class which is by a strange irony called the ruling class  i suspect that the average young lady already learns more worth knowing at home than her brother does at the public school  those moreover who complain that girls are trained now too often merely as articles for the socalled marriage market must remember thisthat the great majority of those who will have votes will be either widows who have long passed all that have had experience bitter and wholesome of the realities of life and have most of them given many pledges to the state in the form of children or women who by various circumstances have been early withdrawn from the competition of this same marriagemarket and have settled down into pure and honourable celibacy with full time and generally full inclination to cultivate and employ their own powers  i know not what society those men may have lived in who are in the habit of sneering at old maids  my experience has led me to regard them with deep respect from the servant retired on her little savings to the unmarried sisters of the rich and the powerful as a class pure unselfish thoughtful useful often experienced and able more fit for the franchise when they are once awakened to their duties as citizens than the average men of the corresponding class  i am aware that such a statement will be met with laughter the unripe fruit of wisdom  but that will not affect its truth  let me say a few words more on this point  there are those who while they pity the two millions and a half or more of unmarried women earning their own bread are tempted to do no more than pity them from the mistaken notion that after all it is their own fault or at least the fault of nature  they ought it is fancied to have been married or at least they ought to have been goodlooking enough and clever enough to be married  they are the exceptions and for exceptions we cannot legislate  we must take care of the average article and let the refuse take care of itself  i have put plainly it may be somewhat coarsely a belief which i believe many men hold though they are too manly to express it  but the belief itself is false  it is false even of the lower classes  among them the cleverest the most prudent the most thoughtful are those who either in domestic service or a fewvery few alasother callings attain comfortable and responsible posts which they do not care to leave for any marriage especially when that marriage puts the savings of their life at the mercy of the husbandand they see but too many miserable instances of what that implies  the very refinement which they have acquired in domestic service often keeps them from wedlock  i shall never marry said an admirable nurse the daughter of a common agricultural labourer  after being so many years among gentlefolk i could not live with a man who was not a scholar and did not bathe every day  and if this be true of the lower class it is still more true of some at least of the classes above them  many a lady who remains unmarried does so not for want of suitors but simply from nobleness of mind because others are dependent on her for support or because she will not degrade herself by marrying for marryings sake  how often does one see all that can make a woman attractivetalent wit education health beautypossessed by one who never will enter holy wedlock  what a loss one says that such a woman should not have married if it were but for the sake of the children she might have borne to the state perhaps answer wise women of the world she did not see any one whom she could condescend to many  and thus it is that a very large proportion of the spinsters of england so far from being as silly boys and wicked old men fancy the refuse of their sex are the very elite thereof those who have either sacrificed themselves for their kindred or have refused to sacrifice themselves to that longing to marry at all risks of which women are so often and so unmanly accused  be all this as it may every man is bound to bear in mind that over this increasing multitude of spinsters of women who are either selfsupporting or desirous of so being men have by mere virtue of their sex absolutely no rights at all  no human being has such a right over them as the husband has justly or unjustly over the wife or the father over the daughter living in his house  they are independent and selfsupporting units of the state owing to it exactly the same allegiance as and neither more nor less than men who have attained their majority  they are favoured by no privilege indulgence or exceptional legislation from the state and they ask none  they expect no protection from the state save that protection for life and property which every man even the most valiant expects since the carrying of sidearms has gone out of fashion  they prove themselves daily whenever they have simple fair play just as capable as men of not being a burden to the state  they are in fact in exactly the same relation to the state as men  why are similar relations similar powers and similar duties not to carry with them similar rights  to this question the common sense and justice of england will have soon to find an answer  i have sufficient faith in that common sense and justice when once awakened to face any question fairly to anticipate what that answer will be
