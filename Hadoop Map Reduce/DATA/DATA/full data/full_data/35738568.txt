joe  if you would have the little teacher at the miss heaths here for the holidays  after all the rest she has had the measles last and worst and they dont know what to do with her for she came from the asylum for officers daughters and has no home at all and they must go away to have the house purified  they cant take her with them for their sister has children and she will have to roam from room to room before the whitewashers which is not what i should wish in the critical state of chest left by measles  what is her name  allen  the cry was always for miss allen when the sick girls wanted to be amused  allen  i wonder if it can be the same child as the one robert was interested about  you dont remember my dear  it was the year you were at vienna when one of roberts brotherofficers died on the voyage out to china and he sent home urgent letters for me to canvass right and left for the orphans election  you know robert writes much better than he speaks and i copied over and over again his account of the poor young man to go with the cards  caroline otway allen aged seven years whole orphan daughter of captain allen l07th regiment yes thats the way it ran  the year i was at vienna and robert went out to china  that was eleven years ago  she must be the very child for she is only eighteen  they sent her to miss heaths to grow a little older for though she was at the head of everything at the asylum she looks so childish that they cant send her out as a governess  did you see her mother  oh no  i never had anything to do with her but if she is daughter to a friend of roberts—  mother and son looked at each other in congratulation  robert was the stepson older by several years and was viewed as the representative of sober common sense in the family  joe and his mother did like to feel a plan quite free from roberts condemnation for enthusiasm or impracticability and it was not the worse for his influence that he had been generally with his regiment and when visiting them was a good deal at the united service club  he had lately married an heiress in a small way retired from the army and settled in a house of hers in a country town and thus he could give his dicta with added weight  only a parent or elder brother would however have looked on joe as a youth for he was some years over thirty with a mingled air of keenness refinement and alacrity about his slight but active form altogether with the air of some implement not meant for ornament but for use and yet absolutely beautiful through perfection of polish finish applicability and a sharpness never meant to wound but deserving to be cherished in a velvet case  this case might be the pretty drawingroom full of the choice artistic curiosities of a man of cultivation and presided over by his mother a woman of much the same bright keen alert sweetness of air and countenance still under sixty and in perfect health and spirits—as well she might be having preserved as well as deserved the exclusive devotion of her only child during all the years in which her early widowhood had made them all in all to each other ten years ago on his election to a lectureship at one of the london hospitals the son had set up his name on the brass plate of the door of a comfortable house in a once fashionable quarter of london she had joined him there and they had been as happy as affection and fair success could make them  he became lecturer at a hospital did much for the poor both within and without its walls and had besides a fair practice both among the tradespeople and also among the literary scientific and artistic world where their society was valued as much as his skill  mrs brownlow was well used to being called on to do the many services suggested by a kind heart in the course of a medical mans practice and there was very little within or beyond reason that she would not have done at her joes bidding so she made the arrangement exciting much gratitude in the heads of the pomfret house establishment for young ladies though without seeing little miss allen till from the doctors own brougham but escorted only by an elderly maidservant there came climbing up the stairs a little heap of shawls and cloaks surmounted by a big brown mushroom hat  very proper of joe  he cant be too particular—but such a child thought mrs brownlow as the mufflings disclosed a tiny creature angular in girlish sort with an odd little narrow wedge of a face sallow and wan rather too much of teeth and mouth large greenish hazel eyes and a forehead with a look of expansion partly due to the crisp waves of dark hair being as short as a boys  the nose was well cut and each delicate nostril was quivering involuntarily with emotion—or fright or both  mrs brownlow kissed her made her rest on the sofa and talked to her the shy monosyllabic replies lengthening every time as the motherliness drew forth a response until when conducted to the cheerful little room which mrs brownlow had carefully decked with little comforts for the convalescent and with the ornaments likely to please a girls eye she suddenly broke into a little irrepressible cry of joy and delight  oh oh how lovely  am i to sleep here  oh it is just like the girls rooms i always did long to see  now i shall always be able to think about it  my poor child did you never even see such a room   no i slept in the attic with the maid at old aunt marys and always in a cubicle after i went to the asylum  some of the girls who went home in the holidays used to describe such rooms to us but they could never have been so nice as this  oh oh  mrs brownlow real lilies of the valley  put there for me  oh you dear delicious pearly things  i never saw one so close before  never before  that was the burthen of the song of the little bird with wounded wing who had been received into this nest  she had the dimmest remembrance of home or mother something a little clearer of her sojourn at her aunts though there the aunt had been an invalid who kept her in restraint in her presence and her pleasures had been in the kitchen and in a few books probably don quixote and evelina so far as could be gathered from her recollection of them the week her father had spent with her before his last voyage had been the one vivid memory of her life and had taught her at least how to love  poor child that happy week had had to serve her ever since through eleven years of unbroken school  not that she pitied herself  everybody had been kind to her—governesses masters girls and all  she had been happy and successful and had made numerous friends about whom as she grew more at home she freely chatted to mrs brownlow who was always ready to hear of mary ogilvie and clara cartwright and liked to draw out the stories of the girlworld in which it was plain that caroline allen had been a bright good clever girl getting on well trusted and liked  she had been half sorry to leave her dear old school half glad to go on to something new  she was evidently not so comfortable while miss heaths lowest teacher as she had been while she was the asylums senior pupil  yet when on sunday evening the doctor was summoned and the ladies were left teteatete she laughed rather than complained but still she owned with her black head on mrs brownlows lap that she had always craved for something—something and she had found it now  everything was a fresh joy to her every print on the walls every ornament on the brackets seemed to speak to her eye and to her soul both at once and the sense of comfort and beauty and home after the bareness of school seemed to charm her above all  i always did want to know what was inside peoples windows she said  and in the same way it was a feast to her to get hold of a real book as she called it not only the beginnings of everything and selections that always broke off just as she began to care about them  she had been thoroughly well grounded and had a thirst for knowledge too real to have been stifled by the routine she had gone through—though said she i do want time to get on further and to learn what wont be of any use  of no use said mr brownlow laughing—having just found her trying to make out the old english of king alfreds boethius—such as this  just so  they always are turning me off with this wont be of any use to you  i hate use—  like ridley who says he reads a book with double pleasure if he is not going to review it  that mr ridley who came in last evening  even so  why that opening of eyes  i thought a critic was a most formidable person  you expected to see a mess of salt and vinegar prepared for his diet  i should prepare something quite different—milk and sweetbreads i think  to soften him  do you hear mother  take advice  caroline—or carey as she had begged to be called—blushed and drew back halfalarmed as she always was when the doctor caught up any of the little bits of fun that fell so shyly and demurely from her as they were evoked by the more congenial atmosphere  it was a great pleasure to him and to his mother to show her some of the many things she had never seen watch her enjoyment and elicit whether the reality agreed with her previous imaginations  mr brownlow used to make time to take the two ladies out or to drop in on them at some exhibition checking the flow of halfdroll half intelligent remarks for a moment and then encouraging it again while both enjoyed that most amusing thing the fresh simplicity of a grownup clever child  how will you ever bear to go back again said careys school friend clara cartwright now a governess whom mrs brownlow had with some suppressed growls from her son invited to share their one days countryouting under the horsechestnut trees of richmond  oh  i shall have it all to take back with me was the answer as carey toyed with the burnished celandine stars in her lap  i should never dare to think of it  i should dread the contrast  oh no said carey  it is like a blind person who has once seen you know  it will be always warm about my heart to know there are such people  mrs brownlow happened to overhear this little colloquy while her son was gone to look for the carriage and there was something in the bright unrepining tone that filled her eyes with tears more especially as the little creature still looked very fragile—even at the end of a month  she was so tired out with her day of almost rapturous enjoyment that mrs brownlow would not let her come down stairs again but made her go at once to bed in spite of a feeble protest against losing one evening  and i am afraid that is a recall said mrs brownlow seeing a letter directed to miss allen on the sidetable  i will not give it to her tonight poor little dear i really dont know how to send her back  exactly what i was thinking said the doctor leaning over the fire which he was vigorously stirring  you dont think her strong enough  if so i am very glad said the mother in a delighted voice  eh joe as there was a pause and as he replaced the poker he looked up to her with a colour scarcely to be accounted for by the fire and she ended in an odd startled yet not displeased tone it is that—is it  yes mother it is that said joe laughing a little in his relief that the plunge was made  i dont see that we could do better for your happiness or mine  dont put mine first halfcrying  i didnt know i did  it all comes to the same thing  my dear joe i only wish you could do it tomorrow and have no fuss about it  what will robert do  accept the provision for his friends daughter said joe gravely and then they both burst out laughing  in the midst came the announcement of dinner during which meal they refrained themselves and tried to discuss other things though not so successfully but that it was reported in the kitchen that something was up  joseph was just old enough for his mother who had always dreaded his marriage to have begun to wish for it though she had never yet seen her ideal daughterinlaw and the enforced silence during the meal only made her more eager so that she began at once as soon as they were alone  when did you begin to think of this joe  not when i asked you to invite her—that would have been treacherous  no but when i began to realise what it would be to send her back to her treadmill though the beauty of it is that she never seems to realise that it is a treadmill  she might now though i tried so hard not to spoil her  it is that content with such a life which makes me think that in her you may have something more worth than the portion which—which i suppose i ought to regret and say you will miss  i shall get all that plentifully from robert mother  i am afraid it does entail harder work on you and later on in life than if you had chosen a person with something of her own  something of her own  her own indeed  mother she has that of her own which is the very thing to help and inspire me to make a name and work out an idea worth far more than any pounds shillings and pence or even houses or lands i might get with a serene and solemn dame even with clear notions as to those same l s d  for shame joe  you may be as much in love as you please but dont be wicked  for this description was applicable to the bride whom robert had presented to them about a year ago on retiring with a colonels rank  so i may be as much in love as i please  thank you  i always knew you were the very best mother in the world and he came and kissed her  i wonder what she will say the dear child  may be that she has no taste for such an old fellow  hush mother seriously my chief scruple is whether it be fair to ask a girl to marry a man twice her age when she has absolutely seen nothing of his kind but the german master  trust her said mrs brownlow  nay she never could have a freer choice than now when she is too young and simple to be weighted with a sense of being looked down on  it is possible that she may be startled at first but i think it will be only at life opening on her so dont be daunted and imagine it is your old age and infirmity said the mother smoothing back the locks which certainly were not the clustering curls of youth  how the mother watched all the next morning while the unconscious carey first marvelled at her nervousness and silence and then grew almost infected by it  it was very strange she thought that mrs brownlow always so kind should say nothing but humph on being told that miss heaths workmen had finished and that she must return next monday morning  it was the doctors day to be early at the hospital and he had had a summons to see some one on the way so that he was gone before breakfast when careys attempts to discuss her happy day in the country met with such odd fitful answers for in fact mrs brownlow could not trust herself to talk and had no sooner done breakfast than she went off to her housekeeping affairs and others which she managed unusually to prolong  carey was trying to draw some flowers in a glass before her—a little purple greenwinged orchis a cowslip and a quivering darkbrown tuft of quaking grass  he came and stood behind her saying—  youve got the character of those  they are very difficult sighed carey i never tried flowers before but i wanted to take them with me  to take them with you he repeated rather dreamily  yes back to another sort of heath she said with a little laugh dont you know i go next monday  if you go i hope it will only be to come back  oh if mrs brownlow is so good as to let me come again in the holidays and she was all one flush of joy looking round and up in his face to see whether it could be true  not only for holidays—for work days he said and his voice shook  but mrs brownlow cant want a companion  but i do  caroline will you come back to us to make home doubly sweet to a busy man who will do his best to make you happy  the little creature looked up in his face bewildered and then said shyly the colour surging into her face—  please what did you say  i asked if you would stay with us and make this place bright for us as my wife he said taking both the little brown hands into his own and looking into the widelyopened wondering eyes while she answered if i may—the very words almost the very tone in which she had replied to his invitation to come to recover at his house  ah my poor child you have no ones leave to ask he said you belong to us only to us—and he drew her into his arms and kissed her  then he felt and heard a great sob and there were two tears on her cheek when he could see her face but she smiled with happy quivering lip and said—  it was like when papa kissed me before he went away he would be so glad  in the midst of the caress that answered this a bell sounded and in the certainty that the announcement of luncheon would instantly follow they started apart  two seconds later they met mrs brownlow on the landing—  there mother said the doctor  my child and carey was in her arms  oh may i—is it real said the girl in a stifled voice  after that they took it very quietly  carey was so young and ignorant of the world that she was not nearly so much overpowered as if she had had the slightest external knowledge either of married life or of the exceptional thing the doctor was doing  her mother had died when she was three years old and she had never since that time lived with wedded folk while even her companions at school being all fatherless she had gathered nothing of even secondhand experience from them  all she knew was from books which had given glimpses into happy homes and though she had feasted on a few novels during this happy month they had been very select and chiefly historical romance  she was at the age when nothing is impossible to youthful dreams and if tancredi had come out of the gerusalemme and thrown himself at her feet she would hardly have felt it more strangely dreamlike than the transformation of her kind doctor into her own joe and on the other hand she had from the first moment nestled so entirely into the home that it would have seemed more unnatural to be torn away from it than to become a part of it  as to her being an extraordinary and very disadvantageous choice for him she simply knew nothing of the matter she was used to passiveness as to her own destiny and now that she did indeed belong to somebody she let those somebodies think and decide for her with the one certainty that what mr brownlow and his mother liked was sure to be the truly right and happy thing  so instead of being alarmed and scrupulous she was sweetly shyly and yet confidingly gay and affectionate enchanting both her companions but revealing by her naive questions and remarks such utter ignorance of all matters of common life that mrs brownlow had no scruples in not stirring the question that had never occurred to her son or his little betrothed namely her own retirement caroline needed a mother far too much for her to be spared  what was to be done about miss heath  it was due to her for miss allen to offer to return till her place could be supplied mrs brownlow said—but that was only to tease the lovers—for a quarter at which joe made a snarling howl whereat carey ventured to laugh at him and say she should come home for every sunday as miss pinniwinks the senior governess did  come home—it is enough to say that she added  mrs brownlow undertook to negotiate the matter her son saying privately—  get her off if you have to advance a quarter  id rather do anything than send her back for even a week to have all manner of nonsense put into her head  id sooner go and teach there myself  or send me asked his mother  anything short of that he said  miss heath as mrs brownlow had guessed thought an engaged girl as bad as a barrel of gunpowder and was quite as much afraid of miss allen putting nonsense into her pupils heads as the doctor could be of the reverse process so young teachers not being scarce careys brief connection with miss heath was brought to an end in a morning call whence she returned endowed with thirteen bookmarkers five mats and a sachet  carey had of her own as it appeared twentyfive pounds a year which had hitherto clothed her and of which she only knew that it was paid to her quarterly by a lawyer at bath whose address she gave  mr brownlow followed up the clue but could not learn much about her belongings  the twentyfive pounds was the interest of the small sum which had remained to poor captain allen when he wound up his affairs after paying the debts in which his early and imprudent marriage had involved him  he did not seem to have had any relations and of his wife nothing was known but that she was a miss otway and that he had met her in some colonial quarters  the old lady with whom the little girl had been left was her mothers maternal aunt and had lived on an annuity so small that on her death there had not been funds sufficient to pay expenses without a sale of all her effects so that nothing had been saved for the child except a few books with her parents names in them—john allen and caroline otway—which she still kept as her chief treasures  the lawyer who had acted as her guardian would hand over to her five hundred pounds on her coming of age  that was all that could be discovered nor was colonel robert brownlow as much flattered as had been hoped by the provision for his friends daughter  nay he was inclined to disavow the friendship he was sorry for poor allen he said but as to making a friend of such a fellow pah  no there was no harm in him he was a good officer enough but he never had a grain of common sense and whereas he never could keep out of debt he must needs go and marry a young girl just because he thought her uncle was not kind to her  it was the worst thing he could have done for it made her uncle cast her off on the spot and then she was killed with harass and poverty  he never held up his head again after losing her and just died of fever because he was too broken down to have energy to live  there was enough in this to weave out a tender little romance probably really another aspect of the truth which made carolines bright eyes overflow with tears when she heard it couched in tenderer language from joseph and the few books and treasures that had been rescued agreed with it—a bible with her fathers name a few devotional books of her mothers and mrs hemanss poems with to lina from her devoted j a  caroline would fain have been called lina but the name did not fit her and would not take  colonel brownlow was altogether very friendly if rather grave and dry towards her as soon as he was convinced that it was only joe and that pity not artfulness was to blame for the undesirable match  he was too honourable a man not to see that it could not be given up and he held that the best must now be made of it and that it would be more proper since it was to be for him to assume the part of father and let the marriage take place from his house at kenminster  this was a proposal for which it was hard to be as grateful as it deserved since it had been planned to walk quietly into the parish church be married without any fuss and then to take the fortnights holiday which was all that the doctor allowed himself  but as robert was allowed to be judge of the proprieties and as the kindness on his part was great it was accepted and caroline was carried off for three weeks to keep her residence and make the house feel what a blank her little figure had left  certainly when the pair met again on the eve of the wedding there never was a more willing bride  she said she had been very happy  the colonel and ellen as she had been told to call her future sister had been very kind indeed they had taken her for long drives shown her everything introduced her to quantities of people but oh dear was it absolutely only three weeks since she had been away  it seemed just like three years and she understood now why the girls who had homes made calendars and checked off the days  no school term had ever seemed so long but at kenminster she had had nothing to do and besides now she knew what home was  so it was the most cheerful and joyous of weddings though the bride was a far less brilliant spectacle than the bride of last year mrs robert brownlow who with her handsome oval face fine figure and her tasteful dress perfectly befitting a young matron could not help infinitely outshining the little girlish angular creature looking the browner for her bridal white so that even a deep glow and a strange misty beaminess of expression could not make her passable in kenminster eyes  how would joe brownlows fancy turn out     chapter ii  the chickens    john gilpins spouse said to her dear   though wedded we have been these twice ten tedious years yet we   no holiday have seen—cowper   no one could have much doubt how it had turned out who looked after fifteen years into that room where joe brownlow and his mother had once sat teteatete  they occupied the two ends of the table still neither looking much older in expression at least for the fifteen years that had passed over their heads though the mother had—after the wont of active old ladies—grown smaller and lighter and the son somewhat more bald and grey but not a whit more careworn and if possible even brighter  on one side of him sat a little figure not quite so thin some angles smoothed away the black hair coiled but still in resolute little mutinous tendrils on the brow not ill set off by a tuft of carnation ribbon on one side agreeing with the colour that touched up her gauzy black dress the face not beautiful indeed—but developed softened brightened with more of sweetness and tenderness—as well as more of thought—added to the fresh responsive intelligence it had always possessed  on the opposite side of the dinnertable were a girl of fourteen and a boy of twelve the former of a much larger frame than her mother and in its most awkward and uncouth stage hardly redeemed by the keen ardour and inquiry that glowed in the dark eyes set like two hot coals beneath the black overhanging brows of the massive forehead on which the dark smooth hair was parted  the features were large the complexion dark but not clear and the look of resolution in the squarecut chin and closely shutting mouth was more boylike than girllike  janet brownlow was assuredly a very plain girl but the family habit was to regard their want of beauty as rather a mark of distinction capable of being joked about if not triumphed in  nor was allen the boy wanting in good looks  he was fairer clearer better framed in every way than his sister and had a pleasant lively countenance prepossessing to all  he had a well grown upright figure his fathers ready suppleness of movement and his mothers hazel eyes and flashing smile and there was a look of success about him as well there might be since he had come out triumphantly from the examination for eton college and had been informed that morning that there were vacancies enough for his immediate admission  there was a pensiveness mixed with the satisfaction in his mothers eyes as she looked at him for it was the first break into the home she had been the only teacher of her children till two years ago when allen had begun to attend a day school a few streets off and the first boys first flight from under her wing for ever so short a space is generally a sharp wound to the mothers heart  not that allen would leave an empty house behind him  lying at full length on the carpet absorbed in a book was robert a boy on whom the same capacious brow as janets sat better than on the feminine creature  he was reading on undisturbed by the pranks of three younger children john lucas a lithe wiry restless elf of nine with a brown face and black curly head and armine and barbara young persons of seven and six on whom nature had been more beneficent in the matter of looks for though brown was their prevailing complexion both had wellmoulded childish features and really fine eyes  the hubbub of voices as they tumbled and rushed about the window and balcony was the regular accompaniment of dinner though on the first plaintive tone from the little girl the mother interrupted a well but papa from janet with babie babie  its jock mother carey  he will come into fairyland too soon  whats the last news from fairyland babie asked the father as the little one ran up to him  i want to be queen mab papa but armine wants to be perseus with the gorgons head and jock is the dragon but the dragon will come before weve put polly upon the rock  what is polly andromeda— as a grey parrots stand was being transferred from the balcony  yes papa called out armine  you see shes chained and bobus wont play and babie will be queen mab—  i suppose said the mother that it is not harder to bring queen mab in with perseus than oberon with theseus and hippolyta—  you would have us infer said the doctor with grave humour that your children are at their present growth in the elizabethan age of culture—  but again began a well but papa but he exclaimed do look at that boy— well walloped dragon as jock with preternatural contortions rolled kicked and tumbled himself with extended jaws to the rock alias stand to which polly was chained she remarking in a hoarse low whisper naughty boy—  well moaned andromeda  but papa persisted janet when oliver cromwell—  oh look at the gorgon cried the mother as the battered head of an ancient doll was displayed over his shoulder by perseus decorated with two enormous snakes one made of stamps and the other a spiral of whalebone shavings out of a box  the monster immediately tumbled over twisted kicked and wriggled so that the scandalised perseus exclaimed but jock—monster i mean—youre turned into stone—  its convulsions replied the monster gasping frightfully while redoubling his contortions though queen mab observed in the most admonitory tone touching him at the same time with her wand dont you know skipjack thats the reason you dont grow—  eh  whats the new theory  who says so babie came from the bottom of the table  nurse says so papa answered allen i heard her telling jock yesterday that he would never be any taller till he stood still and gave himself time  get out will you was then heard from the prostrate robert the monster having taken care to become petrified right across his legs  but papa janets voice was heard if oliver cromwell had not helped the waldenses—  it was lost for bobus and jock were rolling over together with too much noise to be bearable grandmamma turned round with an expostulatory my dears mamma with boys please dont when papa is tired—  jock is such a little ape said bobus picking himself up father can you tell me why the moon draws up the tides on the wrong side  you may study the subject said the doctor i shall pack you all off to the seaside in a day or two  there was one outcry from mother wife and boys not without you  i cant go till drew comes back from his outing—  but why should we  it would be so much nicer all together  it will be horribly dull without indeed i never can see the sense of going at all said janet  there was a confused outcry of indignation in which waves—crabs— boats and shrimps were all mingled together  im sure thats not half so entertaining as hearing people talk in the evening said janet  you precocious little piece of dissipation said her mother laughing  i didnt mean fine lady nonsense said janet rather hotly i meant talk like—  like big guns  oh yes we know interrupted allen janet does not think anyone worth listening to that hasnt got a whole alphabet tacked behind his name  janet had better take care and bobus too said the doctor or we shall have to send them to vegetate on some farm and see the cows milked and the pigs fed  im afraid bobus would apply himself to finding how much caseine matter was in the cows milk said janet in her womanly tone  or by what rule the pigs curled their tails said her father with a mischievous pull at the black plaited tail that hung down behind her  and then they all rose from the table little barbara starting up as soon as grace was said  father please you are the giant queen mab always rides  queen mab or queen bab always rides me which comes to the same thing  though as to the size of the giant—  there was a pause to let grandmamma go up in peace upon mother careys arm and then a general romp and scurry all the way up the stairs ending by jocks standing on one leg on the top post of the baluster like an acrobat an achievement which made even his father so giddy that he peremptorily desired it never to be attempted again to the great relief of both the ladies  then coming into the drawingroom babie perched herself on his knee and began without the slightest preparation the recitation of cowpers colubriad—             fast by the threshold of a door nailed fast            three kittens sat each kitten looked aghast   and just as she had with great excitement             taught him never to come there no more   armine broke in with nine times one are nine  it was an institution dating from the days when janet made her first acquaintance with the little busy bee that there should be something of some sort said or shown to papa whenever he was at home or free between dinner and bedtime and it was considered something between a disgrace and a misfortune to produce nothing  so when the two little ones had been kissed and sent off to bed with mamma going with them to hear their prayers jock on being called for repeated a greek declension with two mistakes in it bobus showed a long sum in decimals janet brought a neat parallelism of the present tense of the verb to be in five languages—greek latin french german and english  and allen—reposing on your honours  eh my boy  allen looked rather foolish and said i spoilt it papa and hadnt time to begin another  it—i suppose i am not to hear what till it has come to perfection is it the same that was in hand last time  no papa much better said janet emphatically  what i want to see said dr brownlow is something finished  id rather have that than ever so many magnificent beginnings  here he was seized upon by robert with his knitted brow and a book in his hands demanding aid in making out why as he said the tide swelled out on the wrong side of the earth  his father did his best to disentangle the question but bobus was not satisfied till the clock chimed his doom when he went off with jock who was walking on his hands  thats too tough a subject for such a little fellow said the grandmother so late in the day too  he would have worried his brain with it all night if he had not worked it out said his father  im afraid he will any way said the mother  fancy being troubled with dreams of surging oceans rising up the wrong way  yes he ought to be running after the tides instead of theorising about them  carry him off mother carey and the whole brood without loss of time  but joe why should we not wait for you  you never did send us away all forlorn before she said pleadingly  we are all quite well and i cant bear going without you  i had much rather all the chickens were safe away carey he said sitting down by her  theres a tendency to epidemic fever in two or three streets which i dont like in this hot weather and i had rather have my mind easy about the young ones  and what do you think of my mind leaving you in the midst of it  your mind being that of a mother bird and a doctors wife ought to have no objection  how soon does dr drew come home  in a fortnight i believe  he wanted rest terribly poor old fellow  dont grudge him every day  a fortnight as if it was a century  you cant come for a fortnight  well perhaps it will take a week to fix on a place  hardly for see here i found a letter from acton when i came in they have found an unsophisticated elysium at kyve clements and are in raptures which they want us to share—rocks and waves and all  and rooms  yes very good rooms enough for us all was the answer flinging into her lap a letter from his friend a somewhat noted artist in watercolours whom after long patience careys school friend miss cartwright had married two years ago  there was nothing to say against it only grandmamma observed i am too old to catch things joe will let me stay and keep house for him  please please let me stay with granny insisted janet then i shall finish my german classes  janet was grannys child  she had slept in her room ever since allen was born and trotted after her in her housewifeskep and the sense of being protected was passing into the sense of protection  before she could be answered however there was an announcement  friends were apt to drop in to coffee and talk in the evening on the understanding that certain days alone were free—people chiefly belonging to a literary scientific and artist set not bohemian but with a good deal of quiet ease and absence of formality  this friend had just returned from asia minor and had brought an exquisite bit of a greek frieze of which he had become the happy possessor knowing that mrs joseph brownlow would delight to see it and mayhap to copy it  for careys powers had been allowed to develop themselves mrs brownlow having been always housekeeper she had been fain to go on with the studies that even her preparation for governessship had not rendered wearisome and thus had become a very graceful modeller in clay—her favourite pursuit—when her childrens lessons and other occupations left her free to indulge in it  the history of the travels and the account of the discovery were given and heard with all zest and in the midst others came in—a barrister and his wife to say goodbye before the circuit a professor with a ticket for the gallery at a scientific dinner two medical students who had been made free of the house because they were nice lads with no available friends in town  it was all over by halfpast ten and the trio were alone together how amusing mr leslie is said the young mrs brownlow  he knows how describe as few people do  did you see janet listening to him said her grandmother with her brows pulled down and her eyes sparkling out under them wanting to devour every word  yes returned the doctor i saw it and i longed to souse that black head of hers with salt water  i dont like brains to grow to the contempt of healthful play  people never know when they are well off  i wonder what you would have said if you had had a lot of stupid dolts boys always being plucked c  dont plume yourself too soon mother carey only one chick has gone through the first ordeal  and if allen did bobus will  allen is quite as clever as bobus granny if— eagerly said the mother  if— said the father theres the point  if allen has the stimulus he will do well  i own i am particularly pleased with his success because perseverance is his weak point  carey kept him up to it said granny  i believe his success is quite as much her work as his own  and the question is how will he get on without his mother to coach him   now you know you are not one bit uneasy papa cried his wife indignantly  but dont you think we might let janet have her will for just these ten days  there cant be any real danger for her with grandmamma and i should be happier about granny  you dont trust joe to take care of me  not if joe is to be out all day  there will be nobody to trot up and down stairs for you   come it is only what she begs for herself and she really is perfectly well  as if i could have a child victimised to me said granny  the little cockney thinks the victimising would be in going to the deserts with only the boys and me laughed carey but i think a week later will be quite time enough to sweep the cobwebs out of her brain  and you can do without her inquired mrs brownlow  you dont want her to help to keep the boys in order  thank you i can do that better without her said carey  she exasperates them sometimes  i believe granny is thinking whether she is not wanted to keep mother carey in order as well as her chickens  hasnt mother been taken for your governess carey  no no joe thats too bad  they asked janet at the dancingschool whether her sister was not going to join  her younger sister  no i tell you her halfsister  but clara acton will do discretion for us granny and i promise you we wont do anything her husband says is very desperate  dont be afraid  no said grandmamma smiling as she kissed her daughterinlaw and rose to take her candle i am never afraid of anything a mother can share with her boys  even if she is nearly a tomboy herself laughed the husband with rather a teasing air towards his little wife  good night mother shall not we be snug with nobody left but janet who might be great grandmother to us both  i really am glad that janet should stay with granny said carey when he had shut the door behind the old lady she would be left alone so many hours while you are out and she does need more waiting on than she used to do  you think so  i never see her grow older  not in the least older in mind or spirits but she is not so strong nor so willing to exert herself and she falls asleep more in the afternoon  one reason for which i am less sorry to go on before is that i shall be able to judge whether the rooms are comfortable enough for her and i suppose we may change if they are not  to another place if you think best  only you will not let her stay at home altogether  thats what im afraid of  she will only do so on the penalty of keeping me and you may trust her not to do that said joe laughing with the confidence of an only son  i shall come back and fetch you if you dont appear under a fortnight  did you do any more this morning to the great experiment magnum bonum  she spoke the words in a proud shy exulting semiwhisper somewhat as gutenbergs wife might have asked after his printingpress  no  i havent had half an hour to myself today at least when i could have attended to it  dont be afraid carey im not daunted by the doubts of our good friends  i see your eyes reproaching me with that  oh no as you said sir matthew fleet mistrusts anything entirely new and the professor is never sanguine  i am almost glad they are so stupid it will make our pleasure all the sweeter  you silly little bird if you sit on that egg it will be sure to be addled  if it should come to any good probably it will take longer than our lifetime to work into peoples brains  no said carey i know the real object is the relieving pain and saving life and that is what you care for more than the honour and glory  but do you remember the fly on the coach wheel  well the coach wheel means to stand still for a little while  i dont mean to try another experiment till my brains have been turned out to grass and i can come to it fresh  ah tis you that really need the holiday said carey wistfully much more than any of us  look at this great crows foot tracing it with her finger  laughing my dear  thats the outline of the risible muscle  a mother carey and her six ridiculous chickens cant but wear out furrows with laughing at them  i only know i wish it were you that were going and i that were staying at home             you shall do my work today             and ill go follow the plough   said her husband laughing  there are the notes of my lecture if youll go and give it  ah we should not be like that celebrated couple  you would manage the boys much better than i could doctor your patients  i dont know that  the boys are never so comfortable when ive got them alone  but considering the hour i should think the best preliminary would be to put out the lamp and go to bed  i suppose it is time but i always think this last talk before going upstairs the best thing in the whole day said the happy wife as she took the candle     chapter iii  the white slate    dark house by which once more i stand here in the long unlovely street doors where my heart was wont to beat so quickly waiting for a hand— a hand that can be clasped no more behold me for i cannot sleep—tennyson   mother carey to call her by the family name that her husband had given the first day she held a baby in her arms had a capacity of enjoyment that what she called her exile could not destroy  even bobus left theory behind him and became a holiday boy and the whole six climbed rocks paddled boated hunted sea weeds and sea animals lived on the beach from morning to night and were exceedingly amused by the people who insisted on addressing the senior of the party as miss and thought them a young girl and her brothers under the charge of mrs acton  she though really not a year older than her friend looked like a worn and staid matron by her side and was by no means disposed to scramble barefoot over slippery seaweed or to take impromptu a part in the grand defence of the sand and shingle edition of raglan castle  even to mrs acton it was a continual wonder to see how entirely under control of that little merry mother were those great lively spirited boys who never seemed to think of disobeying her first word and while all made fun together and she was hardly less active and enterprising than they always considered her comfort and likings  so went things for a fortnight during which the coming of the others had been put off by dr drews absence  one morning mr acton sought mrs brownlow on the beach where she was sitting with her brood round her partly reading from a translation partly telling them the story of ulysses  he called her aside and told her that her husband had telegraphed to him to bid him to carry her the tidings that good old mrs brownlow had been taken from them suddenly in the night evidently in her sleep  carey turned very white but said only oh why did i go without them  it was such an overwhelming shock as left no room for tears  her first thought the only one she seemed to have room for was to get back to her husband by the next train  she would have taken all the children but that mrs acton insisted almost commanded that they should be left under her charge and reminded her that their father wished them to be out of london nor did allen and robert show any wish to return to a house of mourning being just of the age to be so much scared at sorrow as to ignore it  and indeed their mother was equally new to any real grief her parents had been little more than a name to her and the only loss she had actually felt was that of a favourite schoolfellow  she had no time to think or feel till she had reached the train and taken her seat and even then the first thing she was conscious of was a sense of numbness within and frivolous observation without as she found herself trying to read upside down the direction of her opposite neighbours parcels counting the flounces on her dress and speculating on the meetings and partings at the stations yet with a terrible weight and soreness on her all the time though she could not think of the dear grannie of whom it was no figure of speech to say that she had been indeed a mother  the idea of her absence from home for ever was too strange too heartrending to be at once embraced and as she neared the end of her journey on that long day careys mind was chiefly fixed on the yearning to be with her husband and janet who had suffered such a shock without her  she seemed more able to feel through her husband—who was so devoted to his mother than for herself and she was every moment more uneasy about her little daughter who must have been in the room with her grandmother  comfort them  how she did not know  the others had always petted and comforted her and now— no one to go to when the children were ailing or naughty—no one to share little anxieties when joe was out late—no one to be the backbone she leant on—no dear welcome from the easy chair  that thought nearly set her crying the tears burnt in her strained eyes but the sight of the people opposite braced her and she tried to fix her thoughts on the unseen world but they only wandered wide as if beyond her own control and her head was aching enough to confuse her  at last late on the long summer day she was at the terminus and with a heart beating so fast that she could hardly breathe found herself in a cab driving up to her own door just as the twilight was darkening  how dark it looked within with all the blinds down  the servant who opened the door thought miss janet was in the drawingroom but the master was out  it sounded desolate and carey ran up stairs craving and eager for the kiss of her child—the child who must have borne the brunt of the shock  the room was silent all dusky and shadowed the windowframes were traced on the blinds by the gas freshly lighted outside and moving in the breeze with a monotonous dreariness  carey stood a moment and then her eyes getting accustomed to the darkness she discerned a little heap lying curled up before the ottoman her head on a great open book asleep—poor child quite worn out  carey moved quietly across and sat down by her longing but not daring to touch her  the lamp was brought up in a minute or two and that roused janet who sprang up with a sudden start and dazzled eyes exclaiming father oh its mother carey  oh mother mother please dont let him go  and you have been all alone in the house my poor child said carey as she felt the girl shuddering in her close embrace  mrs lucas came to stay with me but i didnt want her said janet so i told her she might go home to dinner  its father—  where is father  those horrid people in tottenham court road sent for him just as he had come home said janet  he went out as usual  yes though he had such a bad cold  he said he could not be spared and he was out all yesterday till bedtime or i should have told him grandmamma was not well  you thought so  yes she panted and breathed so oddly but she would not let me say a word to him  she made me promise not but being anxious about him helped to do it  dr lucas said so  there was a strange hardness and yet a trembling in janets voice nor did she look as if she had shed tears though her face was pale and her eyes blackringed and when old nurse now very old indeed tottered in sobbing she flung herself to the other end of the room it was more from nurse than from janet that carey learnt the particulars such as they were namely that the girl had been half dressed when she had taken alarm from her grandmothers unresponsive stillness and had rushed down to her fathers room  he had found that all had long been over  his friend old dr lucas had come immediately and had pronounced the cause to have been heart complaint  nurse said her master had been very still and had merely given the needful orders and written a few letters before going to his patients for the illness was at its height and there were cases for which he was very anxious  the good old woman who had lived nearly all her life with her mistress was brokenhearted but she did not forget to persuade caroline to take food telling her she must be ready to cheer up the master when he should come in and assuring her that the throbbing headache which disgusted her with all thoughts of eating would be better for the effort  perhaps it was but it would not allow her to bring her thoughts into any connection or to fix them on what she deemed befitting and when she saw that the book over which janet had been asleep in the twilight was the last of the mohicans she was more scandalised than surprised  it was past janets bedtime but though too proud to say so she manifestly shrank from her first night of loneliness and her mother herself unwilling to be alone came with her to her room undressed her and sat with her in the darkness hoping for some break in the dull reticence but disappointed for janet hid her head in the clothes and slept or seemed to sleep  perhaps carey herself had been half dozing when she heard the well known sounds of arrival and darted down stairs meeting indeed the welcoming eye and smile but ah here she is was said so hoarsely and feebly that she exclaimed oh joe you have knocked yourself up  yes said dr lucas whom she only then perceived  he must go to bed directly and then we will see to him  not another word brownlow till you are there nor then if you are wise  he strove to disobey but cough and choking forbade and as he began to ascend the stairs caroline turned in dismay to the kind fatherly old man who had always been one of the chief intimates of the house and was now retired from practice except for very old friends  he told her that her husband was suffering from a kind of sore throat that sometimes attacked those attending on this fever though generally not unless there was some predisposition or unless the system had been unduly lowered  joe had indeed been overworked in the absence of several of the regular practitioners and of all those who could give extra help but this would probably have done little harm but for a cold caught in a draughty room and the sudden stroke with which the day had begun  dr lucas had urged him to remain at home and had undertaken his regular work for the day but summonses from his patients had been irresistible he had attended to everyone except himself and finally after hours spent over the critical case of the wife of a small tradesman he had found himself so ill that he had gone to his friend for treatment and dr lucas had brought him home intending to stay all night with him  since the wife had arrived the good old man knowing how much rather they would be alone consented to sleep in another room after having done all that was possible for the night and cautioned against talking  indeed joe heavy stupefied and struggling for breath knew too well what it all meant not to give himself all possible chance by silent endurance lying with his wifes hand in his or sometimes smoothing her cheek but not speaking without necessity  once he told her that her head was aching and made her lie down on the bed but he was too ill for this rest to last long and the fits of struggling with suffocation prevented all respite save for a few minutes  with the early light of the long summer morning dr lucas looked in and would have sent her to bed but she begged off and a sign from her husband seemed to settle the matter for the old physician went away again perhaps because his eyes were full of tears  the first words joe said when they were again alone was my tablets she went in search of them to his dressingroom and not finding them there was about to run down to the consultingroom when janet came out already dressed and fetched them for her as well as a white slate on which he was accustomed to write memorandums of engagements  her father thanked her by a sign but there was possibility enough of infection to make him wave her back from kissing him and she took refuge at the foot of the bed on a sofa shut off by the curtains which had been drawn to exclude the light  joe meantime wrote on the slate the words magnum bonum  magnum bonum read his wife in amazement  papers in bureau he wrote lock all in my desk  mention to no one  am i to put them in your desk asked caroline bewildered as to his intentions and finding it hard to read the writing as he went on—  no word to anyone scoring it under not till one of the boys is ready  one of the boys in utter amazement  not as a chance for himself he wrote but as a great trust  i know she said it is a great trust to make a discovery which will save life  it is my pride to know you are doing it my own dear joe  it seems i am not worthy to do it was traced by his fingers  it is not developed enough to be listened to by anyone  keep it for the fit one of the boys  religion morals brains balance  she read each word aloud bending her head in assent and after a pause he wrote not till his degree  he could not work it out sooner  these is peril to self and others in experimenting— temptation to rashness  it were better unknown than trifled with be an honest judge—promise  say what i want  spellbound almost mesmerised by his will caroline pronounced—i promise to keep the magnum bonum a secret till the boys are grown up and then only to confide it to the one that seems fittest when he has taken his degree and is a good religious wise able man with brains and balance fit to be trusted to work out and apply such an invention and not make it serve his own advancement but be a real good and blessing to all  he gave her one of his bright sweet smiles and as she sealed her promise by a kiss he took up the slate again and wrote my dear comfort you have always understood  you are to be trusted  it must be done worthily or not at all  that was the burthen of everything and his approval and affection gave a certain sustaining glow to the wife who was besides so absorbed in attending to him as not to look beyond the moment  he wrote presently after a little more you know all my mind for the children  with gods help you can fill both places to them i should like you to live at kenminster under roberts wing  after that he only used the tablets for temporary needs and to show what he wanted dr lucas to undertake for his patients  the husband and wife had little more time for intimate communings for the strangulation grew worse more remedies were tried and one of the greatest physicians of the day was called in but only to make unavailing efforts  colonel brownlow arrived in the middle of the day and was thunderstruck at the new and terrible disaster  he was a large tall man with a goodhumoured weatherbeaten face and an unwieldy gouty figure and he stood with his eyes brimming over with tears looking at his brother and at first unable to read the one word joe traced for him—for writing had become a great effort—carey  we will do our best for her ellen and i my dear fellow  but youll soon be better  horrid things these quinsies but they pass off  poor joe halfsmiled at this confident opinion but he merely wrung his brothers hand and only twice more took up the pencil—once to write the name of the clergyman he wished to see and lastly to put down the initials of all his children love to you all  let god and your mother be first with you—j b  the daylight of the second morning had come in before that deadly suffocation had finished its work and the strong mans struggles were ended  when colonel brownlow tried to raise his sisterinlaw he found her fainting and with dr lucass help carried her to another room where she lay utterly exhausted in a kind of faint stupor apparently unconscious of anything but violent headache which made her moan from time to time if anything stirred her  dr lucas thought this the effect of exhaustion for she had not slept and hardly taken any food since her breakfast at kyve three days ago and finding poor old nurse too entirely broken down to be of any use he put his own kind wife in charge of her and was unwilling to admit anyone else—even mrs robert brownlow who arrived in the course of the day  she was a tall finelooking person with an oval face— soft pleasant brown skin mild brown eyes and much tenderness of heart and manner but not very well known to caroline for her periodical visits had been wholly devoted to shopping and sight seeing  she was exceedingly shocked at the tidings that met her and gathered janet into her arms with many tears over the poor orphan girl  it was an effusiveness that overwhelmed janet who had a miserable hard driedup feeling of wretchedness and injury too for the more other people cried the less she could cry and she heard them saying to one another that she was unfeeling  still aunt ellens presence was a sort of relief for it made the house less empty and dreary and she took upon her the cares that were greatly needed in the bereaved household where old nurse had lost her head and could do nothing and the most effective maid was away with the children  so janet wandered about after her aunt with an adverse feeling at having her home meddled with but answering questions and giving opinions called or uncalled for  her longing was for her brothers and it was a great blow to find that her uncle had written to both allen and mr acton that they had better not come home at present  she thought it cruel and unjust both towards them and herself and in her sickening sense of solitude and injury she had a vague expectation that they were all going to be left wholly orphans like the children of fiction dependent on their uncle and aunt who would be unjust and prefer their own children and she had a prevision of the battles she was to fight and the defensive influence she was to exert  that brought to her mind the white slate on which her father had been writing and she hurried to secure it though she hardly knew where to go or to look but straying into her fathers dressingroom she found both it and the tablets among a heap of other small matters that had been cleared away when the other chamber had been arranged into the solemnity of the deathroom  hastily securing them she carried them to her own desk in the deserted schoolroom feeling as if they were her charge and thus having no scruple in reading them  she had heard what passed aloud and as the eldest girl had been so constantly among the seniors and so often supposed to be intent on her own occupations when they were conversing that she had already the knowledge that magnum bonum was the pet home term for some great discovery in medical science that her father had been pursuing with many disappointments and much incredulity from the few friends to whom it had been mentioned but with absolute confidence on his own part  what it was she did not know but she had fully taken in the injunction of secrecy and the charge to hand on the task to one of her brothers only while her father had spoken of it as a grave trust she viewed it as an inheritance of glory and felt a strange longing and repining that it could not be given to her to win and wear the crown of success  janet did not however keep the treasure long for that very evening mrs lucas sought her out to tell her that her mother had been saying something about a slate and dr lucas thought it was one on which her father had been writing  if she could find it they hoped her mother would rest better  janet produced it and being evidently most unwilling to let it go out of her hands was allowed to carry it in and to tell her mother that she had it  there was no need for injunctions to do so softly and cautiously for she was frightened by her mothers dull half closed eye and pale leaden look but there was a little air of relief as she faltered heres the slate dear mother and the answer so faint that she could hardly hear it was lock it up my dear till i can look  mrs lucas told janet she might kiss her and then sent the girl away  there was need of anxious watch lest fever should set in and therefore all that was exciting was kept at a distance as the poor young widow verged towards recovery  once when she heard voices on the stairs she started nervously and asked mrs lucas is ellen there  yes my dear she shall not come to you unless you wish it seeing her alarm and she laid her head down again  the double funeral was accomplished while she was still too ill to hear anything about it though mrs lucas had no doubt that she knew and when he came home colonel brownlow called for janet and asked her whether she could find her grandmothers keys and her fathers for him  mother would not like anyone to rummage their things said janet like a watchdog  my dear said her uncle in a surprised but kind tone as one who respected yet resented her feeling you may trust me not to rummage as you call it unnecessarily but i know that i am executor if you understand what that means my dear  of course said janet affronted as she always was by being treated as a child  to both wills continued her uncle and it will save your mother much trouble and distress if i can take steps towards acting on them at once and if you cannot tell where the keys are i shall have to look for them  janet ought to obey at once said her aunt not adding to the serenity of janets mind but she turned on her heel ungraciously saying ill get them and presently returned with her grandmothers keybox full of the housekeeping keys and a little key which she gave to her uncle with great dignity adding the key of her desk is the bramah one ill see for the others  a strange girl that said her uncle as she marched out of the room  i am glad our jessie has not her temper responded his wife and then they both repaired to old mrs brownlows special apartment the back drawingroom while janet quietly dropped downstairs with the key she had taken from her fathers table on her way to the consultingroom  she intended to prevent any search by herself producing the will from among his papers for she was in an agony lest her uncle should discover the clue to the magnum bonum of which she regarded herself the guardian  till she had actually unlocked the sloping lid of the oldfashioned bureau it did not occur to her that she did not know either what the will was like nor yet the magnum bonum which was scarcely likely to be so ticketed  she only saw piles of letters and papers marked some with peoples names some with a greek or latin word or one of the curious old arabic signs for which her father had always a turn having as his mother used to tell him something of the alchemist in his composition  one of these parcels fastened with elastic rings must be magnum bonum and janet though without much chance of distinguishing it was reading the labels with a strange sad fascination when long before she had expected him her uncle stood before her with greatly astonished and displeased looks and the word janet  she coloured scarlet but answered boldly there was something that i know father did not want anyone but mother to see  of course there is much said her uncle gravelymuch that i am fitter to judge of than any little girl  words cannot express the offence thus given to janet  something swelled in her throat as if to suffocate her but there could be no reply and to burst out crying would only make him think her younger still so as he turned to his mournful task she ensconced herself in a highbacked chair and watched him from under her dark brows  she might comfort herself by the perception that he was less likely than even herself to recognise the magnum bonum  he would scarcely have thought it honourable to cast a glance upon the medical papers and pushing them aside from where she had pulled them forward searched till he had found a long cartridgepaper envelope which he laid on the table behind him while he shut up the bureau and janet by cautiously craning up her neck managed to read that on it was written will of joseph brownlow executors mrs caroline otway brownlow lieutenantcolonel robert brownlow  her uncle then put both that and the keys in his pocket either not seeing her or not choosing to notice her     chapter iv  the stray chickens    but when our father came not here   i thought if we could find the sea we should be sure to meet him there   and once again might happy be—ballad    what was dr lucas saying to you asked carey sitting up in bed after her breakfast  he said my dear that you were really well now said mrs lucas tenderly and that you only wanted rousing  she clasped her hands together  yes i know it  i have been knowing it all yesterday and last night  it hasnt been right of me keeping you all this time and not facing it  i dont think you could my dear  not at first  it seems to me like having been in a whirlpool and those two went down in it  she put her hands to her temples  but i must do it all now and i will  ill get up now  oh dear if they only would let me come down and go about quietly  then smiling a piteous smile  it is very naughty but of all things i dread the being cried over and fondled by ellen  mrs lucas shook her head though the tears were in her eyes and bethought her whether she could caution mrs robert brownlow not to be too demonstrative but it was a delicate matter in which to interfere and after all whatever she might think beforehand caroline might miss these tokens of feeling  she had sat up for some hours the evening before so that there was no fear of her not being strong enough to get up as she proposed but how would it be when she left her room and beheld all that she could not have realised  however matters turned out contrary to all expectation  mrs lucas was in the drawingroom talking to the colonels wife and janet up stairs helping her mother to dress when there was a sound of feet on the stairs the door hastily opened for a moment and two rough headed dusty little figures were seen for one moment startling mrs brownlow with the notion of little beggars but they vanished in a moment and were heard chattering up stairs with calls of mother mother carey  and looking out they beheld at the top of the stairs the two little fellows hanging one on each side of carey who was just outside her door with her hair down in her white dressing gown kneeling between them all the three almost devouring one another  jockie armie my dears  how did you come  where are the rest  still at kyve said jock  mother we have done such a thing—we came to tell you of it  weve lost the mans boat added armine and we must give him the money for another  what is it  what is it caroline began her sisterinlaw but mrs lucas touched her arm and as a mother herself she saw that mother and sons had best be left to one another and let them retreat into the bedroom carey eagerly scanning her two little boys who had a battered worn unwashed look that puzzled her as much as their sudden appearance which indeed chimed in with the strange dreamy state in which she had lived ever since that telegram  but their voices did more to restore her to ordinary life than anything else could have done and their hearts were so full of their own adventure that they poured it out before remarking anything—  how did you come my dear boys  we walked after the omnibus set us down at charing cross because we hadnt any more money said armine  im so tired  and he nestled into her lap seeming to quell the beating of her aching heart by his pressure  this is it mother said jock pulling her other arm round him we two went down to the beach yesterday and we saw a little boat— peter larys pretty little boat you know that is so light—and we got in to rock in her and then i thought i would pull about in her a little  oh jock jock how could you  id often done it with allen and young pete said jock defensively  but by yourselves she said in horror  nobody told us not said jock rather defiantly and armine who with his little sister barbara always seemed to live where dreamland and reality bordered on each other looked up in her face and innocently said—  mrs acton read us about the rocky island and she said father and granny had brought their boats to the beautiful country and that we ought to go after them and there was the bright path along the sea and i thought we would go too and that it would be nicer if jock went with me  i knew it did not mean that said jock hanging his mischievous black head a little as he felt her shudder but i thought it would be such fun to be columbus  and then  oh my boys what a fearful thing  thank god i have you here  i wasnt frightened said jock with uplifted head we could both row couldnt we armie and the tide was going out and it was so jolly it seemed to take us just where we wanted to go out to that great rock you know mother that bobus called the asses bridge  carey knew that the current at the mouth of the river did at high tide carry much drift to the base of this island and she could understand how her two boys had been floated thither  jock went on—  we had a boathook and i pulled up to the island i did mother and i made fast the boat to a little stick and we went out to explore the island  it has a crater in the top mother and we think it must be an instinct volcano said armine looking up sleepily  and there were such lots of jolly little birds went on jock  never mind that now  what happened  why the brute of a boat got away said jock much injured when id made her ever so fast  she pulled up the stick im sure she did for i can tie a knot as well as pete  so you could not get away  no and wed got nothing to eat but chocolate creams and periwinkles and armie wouldnt look at them and i dont think i could while they were alive  so i hoisted a signal of distress made of my tie for wed lost our pockethandkerchiefs  i was afraid they would think we were pirates and not venture to come near us for wed only got black flags and it was a very very long time but at last just as it got a little darkish and armie was crying—poor little chap—that steamer came by that always goes between porthole and kyvemouth on tuesdays and thursdays  i hailed and i hailed and they saw or heard and sent a boat and took us on board  the people all came and looked at us and one of them said i was a plucky little chap he did mother and that id the making of an admiral in me and a lady gave us such a jolly paper of sandwiches  but you see the steamer was going to porthole and the captain said he could not anyhow put back to kyve but he must take us on and we must get back by train  mother carey understood this for the direct line ran to porthole and there was a small junction station whence a branch ran to kyvemouth from which kyve st clements was some three miles distant  were you carried on she asked  well yes but we meant it said jock  i remembered the boat i knew father would say we must buy another so i asked the captain what was the price of one for armine and i had each got halfa sovereign  how was that  an old gentleman the day before was talking to mr acton  i think he is some great swell for he has got a yacht and servants and a carriage and lots of things and he said what are those poor brownlows boys bless me and he tipped us each  allen and bobus were to go with mr acton and have a sail in his yacht but they said we should be too many so we thought wed get a new boat but the captain—  said your money would go but a little way put in caroline  he laughed said jock as a great offence and said that was a matter for our governor and we had better go home and tell as fast as we could  there was a train just starting when we got in to porthole and somebody got our tickets for us and armie went fast off to sleep and i when i came to think about it thought we would not get out at the junction but come on home at once mother carey and tell you all about it  when armie woke—why hes asleep now—he said he would rather come home than to kyve  then you travelled all night  yes there was a jolly old woman who made us a bed with her shawl only i tumbled off three times and bumped myself and she gave us gooseberries and cake and once when we stopped a long time a porter got us a cup of tea  then when we came to where they take the tickets i think the man was going to make a row but the guard came up and told him all about it and i gave him my two halfsovereigns and he gave me back fourteen shillings change for he said we were only halfprice and second class  then when once i was in london said jock as if his foot was on his native heath of course i knew what to be at  have you had nothing to eat  we had each a bun when we got out at charing cross but im awfully hungry mother  i should think so  janet my dear go and order some breakfast for them  and said janet must not the others be dreadfully frightened about them at kyve  that question startled her mother into instant action  of course they must  poor clara poor allen  they must be in a dreadful state  i must telegraph to them at once  she lifted armine off gently to her bed scarcely disturbing him twisted up her hair in summary fashion and the dress which her friends had dreaded her seeing was on she hardly knew how as she bade old nurse see to jocks washing dressing and making himself tidy and then amazed the other ladies by running into the drawing room crying breathlessly—  i must telegraph to the actons and plunging to the depths of a drawer in the davenport  caroline your cap  for it was on the back of the head that had never worn a cap before and not only then but for the most part whenever they met those tears and caresses that poor mother carey so much feared were checked midway by the instinct that made aunt ellen run at her with a great pin and cry—  caroline your cap  she was still after having had it fixed kneeling down searching for a form for telegraphing when the door was opened and in came colonel brownlow looking very pale and fearfully shocked  ellen he began how shall i ever tell that poor child  here is mr acton  but at that moment up sprang mother carey and as mr acton entered the room she leapt forward—  oh i was just going to telegraph  they are safe they are here jock jock  and downstairs came tumbling and rushing that same little imp while the astonishment of his uncle and aunt only allowed them to utter the one word john  mr acton drew a long breath and said you have given us a pretty fright boy  heres the paper added carey telegraph to clara at once  ring the bell jock ill send to the office  ail questions were suspended while mr acton wrote the telegram and then it appeared that the boat had been picked up empty with armines pockethandkerchief full of shells in it and the boys had been given up for lost it having been concluded that if they had been seen the boat also would have been taken in tow and not cast loose to tell the tale  the two elder boys were almost broken hearted and would have been wild to come back to their mother had it not been impossible to leave poor little barbara who clung fast to them as the only shreds left to her of home and protection  they would at least be comforted in the space of a quarter of an hour  carey was completely herself and full of vigour while mr acton was there consoling him when he lamented not having taken better care and refusing when he tried to persuade her to accompany him back to kyve  neither would janet return with him feeling it impossible to relax such watch as she could keep over the magnum bonum papers even though she much longed for her brothers  i should insist on her going said aunt ellen after all she has gone through  i dont think i can said carey  you would not send away your jessie  ellen did not quite say that her pretty sweet caressing jessie was different but she thought it all the same  carey did not fulfil her intentions of going into matters of business with her brotherinlaw that day for little armine always delicate had been so much knocked up by his course of adventures that he needed her care all the rest of the day  nor would she have been fit for anything else for when his aunt recommended a totally different treatment for his ailments she had no spirit to argue but only looked pale and determined being too weary and dejected to produce her arguments  jock was sufficiently tired to be quiescent in the nursery where she kept him with her feeling in his wistful eyes and even in poor little armines childish questions something less like blank desolation than her recent apathy had been as if she were waking to thrills of pain after the numbness of a blow  urged by a restless night and an instinctive longing for fresh air she took a long walk in the park before anyone came down the next morning with only jock for her companion and she came to the breakfast table with a freshened look though with a tremulous faintness in her voice and she let janet continue tea maker scarcely seeming to hear or understand the casual remarks around her but afterwards she said in a resolute tone robert i am ready whenever you wish to speak to me  so in the drawingroom the colonel with the two wills in his hand found himself face to face with her  he was the more nervous of the two being much afraid of upsetting that composure which scandalised his wife but which he preferred to tears and as he believed her to be a mere child in perception he explained down to her supposed level while she listened in a strange inert way feeling it hard to fix her attention yet halfamused by the simplicity of his elucidations  would ellen need to be told what an executor meant thought she  she was left sole guardian of the children the greatest proof of confidence a parent can give impressively observed the colonel wondering at the languor of her acquiescence and not detecting the thought dear joe of course as if he would have done anything else  of course continued the colonel he never expected that it would have proved more than a nominal matter a mere precaution  for my own part i can only say that i shall be always ready to assist you with advice or authority if ever you should find the charge too onerous for you  thank you was all she could bring herself to say at that moment feeling that her boys were her own though the next she was recollecting that this was no doubt the reason joe had bidden her live at kenminster and in a pang of selfreproach was hardly attending to the technicalities of the matters of property which were being explained to her  her husband had not been able to save much but his life insurance was for a considerable sum and there was also the amount inherited from his parents  a portion of the means which his mother had enjoyed passed to the elder brother and mrs brownlow had sunk most of her individual property in the purchase of the house in which they lived  by the terms of josephs will everything was left to caroline unreservedly save for a stipulation that all on her death should be divided among the children as she should appoint  the house was not even secured to allen so that she could let or sell it as she thought advisable  i could not sell it said carey quickly feeling it her first and only home  i hope to see allen practising there some day  it is not in a situation where you could sell it to so much advantage as you would have by letting it to whoever takes the practice  she winced but it was needful to listen as he told her of the offers that had been made for the house and the goodwill of the practice  what he had thought the best offer was however rejected by her with vehemence  she was sure that joe would never stand that man coming in upon his patients and when asked for her reasons would only reply that none of us could bear him  that is no reason why he should not be a good practitioner and respectable man  he may not be what you like in society and yet—  ask dr lucas hastily interrupted carey  perhaps that will be the best way said the colonel gravely  will you promise to abide by his decision  i dont know  i mean if everyone decided against me nothing should induce me to let that vaughan into joes house to meddle with his patients  colonel brownlow made a sign of displeased acquiescence so like his brother when carey was a little impetuous or naughty that she instantly felt shocked at herself and faltered i beg your pardon  he seemed not to notice this but went on as you say it may be wise to consult dr lucas  perhaps putting it up to competition would be the best way  oh no said caroline  have you a letter from dr drake  no  then depend upon it he must have too much delicacy to begin about it so soon  i had rather he had it than anyone else  can he make a fair offer for it  you cannot afford to throw away a substantial benefit for preferences said the colonel  at the outside you will not have more than five hundred pounds a year and i fear you will feel much straitened after what you are used to with four boys and such ideas as to their education he added smiling  i dont know but i am sure it is what joe would wish  he had rather trust his patients to harry—to dr drake—than to anyone and he is just going to be married and wants a practice i shall write to him  it is so nice of him not to have pressed forward  you will not commit yourself said colonel brownlow  remember that your childrens interests are at stake and must not be sacrificed to a predilection  again caroline felt fiery and furious and less inclined than ever to submit her judgment as she said you can inquire but i know what joe thought of him  his worthiness is not the point but whether he can indemnify you  his worthiness not the point cried caroline indignantly  i think it all the point  you misunderstand me you totally misunderstand me exclaimed the colonel trying hard to be gentle  i never meant to recommend an unworthy man  you wanted vaughan murmured mother carey but he did not regard the words perhaps did not hear them for he went on my brother in such a case would have taken a reasonable view and placed the good of his children before any amiable desire to benefit a—a—one unconnected with him  however he added there is no reason against writing to him provided you do not commit yourself  caroline hated the word but endured it and the rest of the interview was spent upon some needful signatures and on the question of her residence at kenminster an outlook which she contemplated as part of the darkness into which her life seemed to have suddenly dashed forward  one place would be much the same as another to her and she could only hear with indifference about the three houses possible and the rent garden and number of rooms  she was very glad when it was over and the colonel saying he should go and consult dr lucas gave her back the keys he had taken from janet and said that perhaps she would prefer looking over the papers before he himself did so with a view to accounts but he should advise all professional records to be destroyed  it may be feared that the two executors did not respect or like each other much the better for the interview which had made the widow feel herself even more desolate and sorehearted  she ran downstairs locked the door of the consulting room opened the lid of the bureau and kneeling down with her head among all the papers she sobbed with longdrawn tearless sobs o father  o joe how could you bid me live there  he makes me worse  they will make me worse and worse and now you are gone and granny is gone theres nobody to make me good and what will become of the children  then she looked drearily on the papers that lay before her as if his handwriting at least gave a sort of nearness  there was a memorandum book which had been her birthday present to him and she felt drawn to open it  the first she saw after her own writing of his name was—  magnum bonum  so my sweet wife insists on calling this possibility of which i will keep the notes in her book  magnum bonum  whether it so prove and whether i may be the means of making it known must be as god may will  may he give me the power of persevering to win or to fail or to lay the foundation for other men whichever may be the best with a true heart heeding his glory and acting as his servant to reveal his mysteries of science for the good of his children  and above all may he give us all to know and feel the true and only magnum bonum the great good which alone makes success or failure loss or gain life or death alike blessed in him and through him  carey gazed on those words as she sat in the large armchair whither she had moved on opening the book  she had always known that religion was infinitely more to her husband than ever it had been to herself  she had done what he led her to do and had a good deal of intellectual and poetical perception and an uprightness affection and loyalty of nature that made her anxious to do right but devotion was duty and not pleasure to her she was always glad when it was over and she was feeling that the thoughts which were said to comfort others were quite unable to reach her grief  there was no disbelief nor rebellion about her only a dull weariness and an inclination which she could hardly restrain even while it shocked her to thrust aside those religious consolations that were powerless to soothe her  she knew it was not their fault she did not doubt of their reality it was she who was not good enough to use them  these words of joe were to her as if he were speaking to her again she laid them on her knee murmured them over fondly looked at them and finally for she was weak still and had had a bad night fell fast asleep over them and only wakened as shouts of mother were heard over the house  she locked the bureau in a hurry and opened the door calling back to the boys and then she found that aunt ellen had taken all the three out walking when jock and armine with the remains of their money burning in their pockets had insisted on buying two little ships which must necessarily be launched in the serpentine  their aunt could by no means endure this and janet did not approve so there seemed to have been a battle royal in which jock would have been the victor if his little brother had not been led off captive between his aunt and sister when jock went along on the opposite side of the road asserting his independence by every sort of monkey trick most trying to his aunts rural sense of london propriety  it was very ridiculous to see the tall grave stately mrs robert brownlow standing there describing the intolerable naughtiness of that imp who not a bit abashed sat astride on the balustrade in the comfortable conviction that he was not hers  i hope at least concluded the lady that you will make them feel how bad their behaviour has been  jock said carey mechanically i am afraid you have behaved very ill to your aunt  why mother carey said that little wretch it is just that she doesnt know anything about anything in london  yes chimed in little armine who was hanging to his mothers skirts she thought she should get to the park by duke street  that did not make it right for you not to be obedient said carey trying for severity  but we couldnt mother  couldnt both echoed  no said jock or we should be still in piccadilly  mother carey she told us not to cross till it was safe  and she stood up like the duke of bedford in the square added armine  janet caught her mothers eye and both felt a spasm of uncontrollable diversion in their throats making janet turn her back and carey gasp and turn on the boys  all that is no reason at all  go up to the nursery i wish i could trust you to behave like a gentleman when your aunt is so kind as to take you out  i did mother  i did hand her across the street and dragged her out from under all the omnibus horses said jock in an injured tone while janet could not refrain from a whispered comparison like a little steamtug and this was quite too much for all of them producing an explosion which made the tall and stately dame look from one to another in such bewildered amazement that struck the mother and daughter as so comical that the one hid her face in her hands with a sort of hysterical heaving and the other burst into that painful laughter by which strained spirits assert themselves in the young  mrs robert brownlow in utter astonishment and discomfiture turned and walked off to her own room  somehow carey and janet felt more on their ordinary terms than they had done all these sad days in their consternation and a certain sense of guilt  carey could adjudicate now though trembling still  she made jock own that his serpentine plans had been unjustifiable and then she added my poor boy i must punish you  you must remember it for if you are not good and steady what will become of us  jock leapt at her neck  mother do anything to me  i dont mind if you only wont look at me like that  she sat down on the stairs all in a heap again with him and sentenced him to the forfeit of the ship which he endured with more tolerable grace because armine observed never mind skipjack well go partners in mine  you shall have half my cargo of gold dust  carey could not find it in her heart to check the voyages of the remaining ship over the uncarpeted diningroom but as she was going armine looked at her with his great soft eyes and said mother carey have you got to be the scoldy and punishy one now  i must if you need it said she going down on her knees again to gather the little fellow to her breast  but oh dont—dont need it  id rather it was uncle robert and aunt ellen said jock for then i shouldnt care  dear jock if you only care i think we shant want many punishments  but now i must go to your aunt for we did behave horribly ill to her  aunt ellen was kind and accepted careys apology when she found that jock had really been punished  only she said you must be firm with that boy caroline or you will be sorry for it  my boys know that what i have said is to be done and they know it is of no use to disobey  i am happy to say they mind me at a word but that john of yours needs a tight hand  the colonel thinks that the sooner he is at school the better  before carey had time to get into a fresh scrape the colonel was ringing at the door  he had to confess that dr lucas had said mrs joe brownlow was right about vaughan and had made it plain that his offer ought not to be accepted either in policy or in that duty which the colonel began to perceive towards his brothers patients nor did he think ill of her plan respecting dr drake and said he would himself suggest the application which that gentleman was no doubt withholding from true feeling for he had been a favourite pupil of joe brownlow and had been devoted to him  he was sure that mrs brownlows good sense and instinct were to be trusted a dictum which not a little surprised her brotherinlaw who had never ceased to think of poor joes fancy as a mere child and who forgot that she was fifteen years older than at her marriage  he told his wife what dr lucas had said to which she replied thats just the way  men know nothing about it  however dr drakes offer was sufficiently eligible to be accepted moreover it proved that the most available house at kenminster could not be got ready for the family before the winter so that the move could not take place till the spring  in the meantime as dr drake could not marry till easter the lower part of the house was to be given up to him and carey and janet felt that they had a reprieve     chapter v  brains and no brains    i do say thou art quick in answers thou heatest my blood—loves labours lost   kemster as county tradition pronounced what was spelt kenminster a name meaning st kenelms minster had a grand collegiate church and a foundationschool which in the hands of the commissioners had of late years passed into the rule of david ogilvie esq a spare pale nervous sensitivelooking man of eight or nine and twenty who sat one april evening under his lamp with his sister at work a little way off listening with some amusement to his sighs and groans at the holiday tasks that lay before him  heres an answer mary  what was magna charta  the first map of the world  whos that ingenious person  brownlow major of course and heres french who says it was a new sort of cow invented by henry viii—a happy feminine i suppose to the papal bull  heres a third  the french fleet defeated by queen elizabeth  most have passed it over entirely  well you know this is the first time you have tried such an examination and boys never do learn history  nor anything else in this happy town was the answer accompanied by a ruffling over of the papers  for shame david the first day of the term  it is the dead weight of brownlows my dear  only think  theres another lot coming  a set of duplicates  they havent even the sense to vary the christian names  three more to be admitted to morrow  that accounts for a good deal  you are laughing at me mary but did you never know what it is to feel like sisyphus  whenever you think you have rolled it a little way down it comes a regular dead weight again down the slope of utter indifference and dulness till it seems to crush the very heart out of you   have you really nobody that is hopeful  nobody who does not regard me as his worst enemy and treat all my approaches with distrust and hostility  mary how am i to live it down  you speak as if it were a crime  i feel as if it were one  not of mine but of the pedagogic race before me who have spoilt the relations between man and boy so that i cannot even get one to act as a medium  that would be contrary to esprit de corps  exactly and the worst of it is i am not one of those genial fellows half boys themselves who can join in the sports con amore i should only make a mountebank of myself if i tried and the boys would distrust me the more  quite true  the only way is to be oneself and ones best self and the rest will come  im not so sure of that  some people mistake their vocation  well when you have given it a fair trial you can turn to something else  you are getting the school up again which is at least one testimony  david ogilvie made a sound as if this were very base kind of solace and his sister did not wonder when she remembered the bright hopes and elaborate theories with which he had undertaken the mastership only nine months ago  he was then fresh from the university and the loss of constant intercourse with congenial minds had perhaps contributed as much as the dulness of the kenminster youth to bring him into a depressed state of health and spirits which had made his elder sister contrive to spend her easter at the seaside with him and give him a few days at the beginning of the term  indeed she was anxious enough about him when he went down to the old grammar school to revolve the possibility of acceding to his earnest wish and coming to live with him instead of continuing in her situation as governess  he came back to luncheon next day with a brightened face that made his sister say well have you struck some sparks  ive got some new material and am come home saying whats in a name  eh  is it those very new brownlows that seemed yesterday to be the last straw on the camels back  i wish you could have seen the whole scene mary  there were half adozen new boys to be admitted four brownlows  think of that well there stood manifestly one of the old stock with the same oval face and sleepy brown eyes and the very same drawl i know so well in the no—a— to the vain question have you done any latin  and how shall i do justice to the long dragging drawl of his reading aye heres the sentence i set him on the—gowls—had—con—sen— ted—to—accept—a—sum—of—gold—and—retire  they were en— gagged—in—wagging out the sum—required and— i had to tell him what to call brennus and he proceeded to cast the sword into the scale exclaiming just as to a carthorse woh  to the worsted pronounced like yarn  after that you may suppose the feelings with which i called his ditto another joseph armine brownlow and forth came the smallest sprite with a white face and great black eyes all eagerness but much too wee for this place  begun latin  oh yes and he rattled off a declension and a tense with as much ease as if he had been born speaking latin  i gave him phaedrus to see whether that would stump him and i dont think it would have done so if he had not made os a mouth instead of a bone in dealing with the wolf and the lamb  he was almost crying so i put the roman history into his hand and his reading was something refreshing to hear  i asked if he knew what the sentence meant and he answered isnt it when the geese cackled trying to turn round the page what do you know about the geese said i  to which the answer was we played at it on the stairs  jock and i were the romans and mother carey and babie were the geese  poor little fellow  i hope no boys were there to listen or he will never hear the last of those geese  i hope no one was within earshot but his brothers who certainly did look daggers at him  he did very well in summing and in writing except that he went out of his way to spell fish p h y c h and shy s c h y and at last i could not resist the impulse to ask him what magna charta is  out came the answer it is yellow and all crumpled up and you cant read it but it has a bit of a great red seal hanging to it  what he had seen it  yes or a facsimile and what was more he knew who signed it whoever taught that child knew how to teach and it is a pity he should be swamped among such a set as ours  i thought you would be delighted  i should be if i had him alone but he must be put with a crew who will make it their object to bully him out of his superiority and the more i do for him the worse it will be for him poor little fellow and he looks too delicate to stand the ordeal  it is sheer cruelty to send him  hasnt he brothers  oh yes i was going to tell you two bigger boys another robert and john brownlow—about eleven and nine years old  the younger one is a sort of black spider monkey wanting the tail  we shall have some trouble with that gentleman i expect  but not the old trouble  no indeed unless the atmosphere affects him  he answered as no boy of twelve can do here and as to the elder one i must take him at once into the fifth form such as it is  where have they been at school  at a day school in london  they are colonel brownlows nephews their father was a medical man in london who died last summer leaving a young widow and these boys and they have just come down to live in kenminster  but it cant be owing to the school  no school would give all three that kind of—what shall i call it—culture and intelligence that they all have besides the little one has been entirely taught at home  i wonder whether it is their mothers doing  i am afraid it is their fathers  the colonel spoke of her as a poor helpless little thing who was thrown on his hands with all her family  after the mornings examination and placing of the boys there was a halfholiday and the brother and sister set forth to enjoy it together for kenminster was a place with special facilities for enjoyment  it was built as it were within a crescent formed by low hills sloping down to the river the church school and other remnants of the old collegiate buildings lying in the flat at the bottom and the rest of the town one of the small decayed wool staples of somerset being in terraces on the hillside with steep streets dividing the rows  these were of very mixed quality and architecture but as a general rule improved the higher they rose and were all interspersed with gardens running up or down and with a fair sprinkling of trees whose budding green looked well amid the yellow stone  on the summit were some more ornamental villalike houses and grey stone buildings with dark tiled roofs but the expansion on that side had been checked by extensive private grounds  there were very beautiful woods coming almost close to the town and in the absence of the owner a great moneyed man they were open to all those who did not make themselves obnoxious to the keepers and these under an absentee proprietor gave a free interpretation to rights of way thither were the ogilvies bound in search of primrose banks but their way led them past two or three houses on the hilltop one of which being constructed on supposed chinese principles of architecture was known to its friends as the pagoda to its foes as the folly  it had been long untenanted but this winter it had been put into complete repair and two rooms showing a sublime indifference to consistency of architecture had been lately built out with sash windows and a slated roof contrasting oddly with the frilled and fluted tiles of the tower from which it jutted  suddenly there sounded close to their ears the words—school time my dear  starting and looking round for some impertinent street boy mr ogilvie exclaimed whats that  mother carey  we are all mother careys chickens  see there exclaimed mary and a great parrot was visible on the branch of a sumach which stretched over the railings of the low wall of the pagoda garden  o you appropriate bird—you surely ought not to be here  to which the parrot replied hic haec hoc and burst out in a wild scream of laughing spreading her grey wings and showing intentions of flying away but mr ogilvie caught hold of the chain that hung from her leg  just then voices broke out—  thats polly  where is she  thats you jock you horrid boy  well i didnt see why she shouldnt enjoy herself  now youve been and lost her  poll poll  i have her called back mr ogilvie  ill bring her to the gate  thanks came through the hedge and the brother and sister walked on  its old ogre  cut growled in what was meant to be an aside a voice the master knew full well and there was a rushing off of feet like ponies in a field  when the sheep gate was reached a great furniture van was seen standing at the door of the folly and there appeared a troop of boys and girls in black eager to welcome their pet  thank you sir thank you very much  come polly said the eldest boy taking possession of the bird  i think we have met before said the schoolmaster to the younger ones glad to see that two—ie the new robert and armine brownlow— had not joined in the sauve qui peut  nay robert turned and said mother it is mr ogilvie  then that gentleman was aware that one of the black figures had a widows cap with streamers flying behind her in the breeze but while he was taking off his hat and beginning mrs brownlow she held out her hands to his sister crying mary mary ogilvie and there was an equally fervent response  is it  is it really caroline allen and the two friends linked eager hands in glad pressure turning after the first moment towards the house while mary said david it is my dear old schoolfellow carey this is my brother  you were very kind to these boys said carey warmly shaking hands with him  the name sounded friendly but i little thought you were marys brother  are you living here mary   how delightful  alas no i am only keeping holiday with david  i go back to morrow  then stay now stay and let me get all i can of you in this frightful muddle entreated caroline  chaos is come again but you wont mind  ill come and help you said mary  david you must go on alone and come back for me  cant i be of use offered david feeling rather shut out in the cold i see a bookcase  isnt that in my line   and heres the box with its books said janet  oh mother do let that be finished off at least  bobus there are the shelves and i have all their pegs in my basket  the case was happily in its place against the wall and janet had seized on her recruit to hold the shelves while she pegged them while the two friends were still exchanging their first inquiries carey exclaiming now you naughty mary where have you been and why didnt you write  i have been in russia and i didnt write because nobody answered and i didnt know where anybody was  in russia  i thought you were with a scottish family and wrote to you to the care of some laird with an unearthly name  but you knew that they took me abroad  and alice brown told me that letters sent to the place in scotland would find you  i wrote three times and when you did not answer my last— and caroline broke off with things unutterable in her face  i never had any but the first when you were going to london  i answered that  yes i did  dont look incredulous  i wrote from sorrento  that must have miscarried  where did you address it  to the old place inside a letter to mrs mercer  i see  poor mrs mercer went away ill and did not live long after and i suppose her people never troubled themselves about her letters but why did not you get ours  mrs mcian died at venice and the aunts came out and considering me too young to go on with the laird and his girls they fairly made me over to a russian family whom we had met  unluckily as i see now i wrote to mrs mercer and as i never heard more i gave up writing  then the crimean war cut me off entirely even from david i had only one letter all that time  how is it that you are a governess  i thought one was sure of a pension from a russian grandee  these were not very grand grandees only counts and though they paid liberally they could not pension one  so when i had done with the youngest daughter i came to england and found a situation in london  i tried to look up our old set but could not get on the track of anyone except emily collins who told me you had married very soon but was not even sure of your name  very soon  why caroline your daughter looks as old as yourself  i sometimes think she is older  and have you seen my eton boy  was it he who received the delightful popinjay who up and spak so much to the purpose asked mr ogilvie  yes it was allen  he is the only one you did not see in the morning  did they do tolerably  i only wish i had any boys who did half as well said mr ogilvie the lads being gone for more books  i was afraid for john and armine for we have been unsettled and i could not go on so steadily with them as before she said eagerly but faltering a little  armine told me he blundered in phaedrus but i hope he did fairly on the whole  so well that if you ask my advice i should say keep him to yourself two years more  oh i am so glad with a little start of joy  youll tell his uncle  he insisted—he had some impression that they were very naughty boys whom i could not cope with poor little fellows  i can decidedly say he is learning more from you than he would in school among those with whom at his age i must place him  thank you thank you  then babie wont lose her companion  she wanted to go to school with armie having always gone on with him and the other two—what of them  bobus is sure to work for the mere pleasure of it—but jock  i dont promise that he may not let himself down to the standard of his age and develop a capacity for idleness but even he has time to spare and he is at that time of life when boys do for one another what no one else can do for them  the colonel said the boys were a good set and gentlemanly said carey wistfully  i think i may say that for them returned their master  they are not bad boys as boys go  there is as much honour and kindliness among them as you would find anywhere  besides to boys like yours this would be only a preparatory school  they are sure to fly off to scholarships  i dont know said carey  i want them to be where physical science is an object  or do you think that thorough classical training is a better preparation than taking up any individual line  i believe it is easier to learn how to learn through languages than through anything else  and to be taught how to learn is a much greater thing than to be crammed said carey  of course when one begins to teach oneself the world has become mine oyster and one has the dagger  the point becomes how to sharpen the dagger  at that moment three or four young people rushed in with arms full of books and announcing that the uncle and aunt were coming  the next moment they appeared and stood amazed at the accession of volunteer auxiliaries  mr ogilvie introduced his sister while caroline explained that she was an old friend—meanwhile putting up a hand to feel for her cap as she detected in ellens eyes those words caroline your cap  we came to see how you were getting on said the colonel kindly  thank you we are getting on capitally  and oh robert mr ogilvie will tell you he thinks armine too—too—i mean he thinks he had better not go into school yet she added thankful that she had not said too clever for the school  the colonel turned aside with the master to discuss the matter and the ladies went into the drawingroom the new room opening on the lawn under a verandah with french windows  it was full of furniture in the most dire confusion  mrs robert brownlow wanted to clear off at once the desks and other things that seemed schoolroom properties saying that a little room downstairs had always served the purpose  that must be nurses sittingroom said carey   old nurse  she can be of no use my dear  oh yes she is she has lived with us ever since dear grandmamma married and has no home and no relations  we could not get on without dear old nursey  well my dear i hope you will find it answer to keep her on  but as to this room  it is such a pity not to keep it nice when you have such handsome furniture too  i want to keep it nice with habitation said caroline  thats the only way to do it  i cant bear fusty shutup smart rooms and i think the family room ought to be the pleasantest and prettiest in the house for the childrens sake  ah well said mrs brownlow with a serene good nature contrasting with the heat with which caroline spoke it is your affair my dear but my boys would not thank me for shutting them in with my pretty things and i should be sorry to have them there healthy country boys like to have their fun and i would not coop them up  oh but theres the studio to run riot in ellen said carey didnt you see  the upper story of the tower  we have put the boys tools there and i can do my modelling there and make messes and all thats nice she said smiling to mary and to allen who had just come in  do you model carey mary asked and allen volunteered to show his mothers groups and basreliefs thereby much increasing the litter on the floor and delighting mary a good deal more than his aunt who asked what will you do for a storeroom then  put up a few cupboards and shelves anywhere  it is not easy to describe the sort of air with which mrs robert brownlow received this answer  she said nothing but oh and was perfectly unruffled in a sort of sublime contempt as to the hopelessness of doing anything with such a being on her own ground  there did not seem overt provocation but poor caroline used to petting and approval chafed and reasoned i dont think anything so important as a happy home for the boys where they can have their pursuits and enjoy themselves  mrs brownlow seemed to think this totally irrelevant and observed when i have nice things i like to keep them nice  i like nice boys better than nice things cried carey  ellen smiled as though to say she hoped she was not an unnatural mother and again said oh  mary ogilvie was very glad to see the two gentlemen come in from the hall the colonel saying mr ogilvie tells me he thinks armine too small at present for school caroline  you know i am very glad of it robert she said smiling gratefully and ellen compassionately observed poor little fellow he is very small but country air and food will soon make a man of him if he is not overdone with books  i make it a point never to force my children  no that you dont said caroline with a dangerous smile about the corners of her mouth  and my boys do quite as well as if they had their heads stuffed and their growth stunted said ellen joe is only two months older than armine and you are quite satisfied with him are you not mr ogilvie  he is more on a level with the others said mr ogilvie politely but i wish they were all as forward as this little fellow  schoolmasters and mammas dont always agree on those points said the colonel goodhumouredly  very true responded his wife  i never was one for teasing the poor boys with study and all that  i had rather see them strong and well grown  theyll have quite worry enough when they go to school  im sorry you look at me in that aspect said mr ogilvie  oh i know you cant help it said the lady  any more than trois echelles and petit andre said carey in a low voice giving the two ogilvies the strongest desire to laugh  just then out burst a cry of wrath and consternation making everyone hurry out into the hall where through a perfect cloud of white powder loomed certain figures and a scandalised voice cried aunt caroline jock and armine have been and let all the arrowroot fly about  you told me to be useful and open parcels cried jock  oh jolly jolly firstrate shouted armine in ecstasy its just like paris in the cloud  more more babie  you are venus you know  master armine miss barbara  for shame exclaimed the nurses voice  all getting into the carpet and in your clothes i do declare  a whole case of best arrowroot wasted and worse  twas jessies doing replied jock  she told me  jessie decidedly the most like venus of the party being a very pretty girl with an oval face and brown eyes had retreated and was with infinite disgust brushing the white powder out of her dress only in answer ejaculating those boys  jock had not only opened the case but had opened it upside down and the classical performances of armine and barbara had powdered themselves and everything around while the draught that was rushing through all the wide open doors and windows dispersed the mischief far and wide  can you do nothing but laugh caroline gravely said mrs brownlow janet shut that window  children out of the way  if you were mine i should send you to bed  theres no bed to be sent to muttered jock running round to give a sly puff to the white heap diffusing a sprinkling of white powder over his aunts dress  jock said his mother with real firmness and indignation in her voice that is not the way to behave  beg your aunts pardon this instant  and to everyones surprise the imp obeyed the hand she had laid on him and muttered something like beg pardon though it made his face crimson  his uncle exclaimed thats right my boy and his aunt said with dignity very well well say no more about it  mary ogilvie was in the meantime getting some of the powder back into the tin and janet running in from the kitchen with a maid a soup tureen and sundry spoons everyone became busy in rescuing the remains—in the midst of which there was a smash of glass  jock again quoth janet  oh mother called out jock its so long  i thought id get the featherbrush to sweep it up with and the other end of it has been and gone through this stupid lamp  things are not unapt to be and go through where you are concerned mr jock i suspect said mr ogilvie  suppose you were to come with me and your brothers too and be introduced to the swans on the lake at belforest  the boys brightened up the mother said thank you most heartily if they will not be a trouble and babie put her hand entreatingly into the schoolmasters and said me too  what venus herself  i thought she had disappeared in the cloud let her come pray mrs brownlow  i thought the children would have been with their cousins observed the aunt  so we were returned armine but johnnie and joe ran away when they saw mr ogilvie coming  babie having by this time had a little black hat tied on and as much arrowroot as possible brushed out of her frock carey warned the schoolmaster not to let himself be chattered to death and he walked off with the three younger ones  caroline would have kept her friend but mary seeing that little good could be gained by staying with her at present replied that she would take the walk now and return to her friend in a couple of hours time and carey was fain to consent though with a very wistful look in her eyes  at the end of that time or more janet met the party at the garden gate  you are to go down to my uncles children she said mother has one of her very bad headaches  there was an outcry that they must take her the flowers of which their hands and arms were full but janet was resolute though babie was very near tears  tomorrow—tomorrow she said  she must lie still now or she wont be able to do anything  run away babie theyll be waiting tea for you  allens there  hell take care of you  i want to give mother carey those dear white flowers still entreated babie  ill give them my dear  they want you down there—ellie and esther  i dont want to play with ellie and essie sturdily declared barbara  they say it is telling falsehoods when one wants to play at anything  they dont understand pretending said armine  do let us stay janet well not make one smallest little atom of noise if jock doesnt stay  you cant said janet for theres nothing for you to eat and nurse and susan are as savage as carribee islanders  this last argument was convincing  the children threw their flowers into janets arms gave their hands to miss ogilvie and babie between her two brothers scampered off while miss ogilvie uttered her griefs and regrets  my mother would like to see you said janet indeed i think it will do her good  she told me to bring you in  such a day of fatigue began mary  that and all the rest of it said janet moodily  is she subject to headaches  no she never had one till— janet broke off for they had reached her mothers door  bring her in said a weary voice and mary found herself beside a low iron bed where carey shaking off the handkerchief steeped in vinegar and water on her brow and showing a tearstained swollen eyed face threw herself into her friends arms  but she did not cry now her tears all came when she was alone and when mary said something of being so sorry for her headache she said oh its only with knocking ones head against a mattress like mad people in such a matteroffact voice that mary for a moment wondered whether she had really knocked her head  mary doubted what to say and wetted the kerchief afresh with the vinegar and water  oh mary i wish you were going to stay here  i wish  i wish i could my dear  i think i could be good if you were here she sighed  oh mary why do they say that troubles make one good  they ought said mary  they dont said carey  they make me wicked and she hid her face in the pillow with a great gasp  my poor carey said the gentle voice  oh i want to tell you all about it  oh mary we have been so happy and what a wail there was in the tone  but i cant talk she added faintly it makes me sick and thats all her doing too  dont try said mary tenderly  we know where to find each other now and you can write to me  i will said caroline i can write much better than tell  and you will come back mary  as soon as i can get a holiday my dear indeed i will  carey was too much worn out not to repose on the promise and though she was unwilling to let her friend go she said very little more  mary longed to give her a cup of strong coffee and suggested it to janet but headaches were so new in the family that domestic remedies had not become wellknown  janet instantly rushed down to order it but in the state of the house at that moment it was nearly as easy to get a draught of pearls  but she shall have it miss ogilvie said janet putting on her hat  wheres the nearest grocer  oh never mind my dear sighed the patient  it will go off of itself when i can get to sleep  you shall have it returned janet  and mary having taken as tender a farewell as caroline was able to bear they walked off together but the girl did not respond to the kindness of miss ogilvie  she was too miserable not to be glum too reserved to be open to a stranger  mary guessed a little of the feeling though she feared that an uncomfortable daughter might be one of poor careys troubles and she could not guess the girls sense of banishment from all that she had enjoyed society classes everything or her feeling that the magnum bonum itself was imperilled by exile into the land of dulness which of course the poor child exaggerated in her imagination  her only consolation was to feel herself the masterman ready of the shipwreck     chapter vi  enchanted ground    and sometimes a merry train comes upon us from the lane all through april may or june every gleaming afternoon all through april may and june boys and maidens birds and bees airy whisperings from all trees                   petition of the flowers—keble   the headache had been carried off by a good nights rest a droll scrambling breakfast had been eaten german fashion with its head quarters on the kitchen table and everybody running about communicating their discoveries  bobus and jock had set off to school and poor little armine who firmly believed that his rejection was in consequence of his confusion between os ossis and os oris and was very sore about it had gone with allen and barbara to see them on their way and mother carey and janet had agreed to get some real work done and were actually getting through business when in rushed rosy and eager allen armine and babie with arms stretched and in breathless haste  mother carey  oh mother mammie dear come and see  come—where  to fairyland  get her bonnet babie  out of doors you boy just look there  oh bother all that  it can wait  do pray come mother entreated armine you never saw anything like it  what is it  will it take long said she beginning to yield as babie danced about with her bonnet armine tugged at her and allen look halfcommanding halfcoaxing  she is not to know till she sees  no dont tell her said armine bandage her eyes allen  heres my silk handkerchief  and janet  she mustnt see cried babie in ecstasy  im not coming said janet rather crossly  im much too busy and it is only some nonsense of yours  thank you said allen laughing mother shall judge of that  it does seem a shame to desert you my dear said carey but you see—  what janet was to see was stifled in the flap of the handkerchief with which allen was binding her eyes while armine and babie sang rapturously—             come along mother carey            come along to land of fairy   an invocation to which sooth to say she had become so much accustomed that it prevented her from expecting a fairyland where it was not necessary to make believe very much  janet so entirely disapproved of the puerile interruption that she never looked to see how allen and babie managed the bonnet  she only indignantly picked up the cap which had fallen from the sofa to the floor and disposed of it for securitys sake on the bronze head of apollo which was waiting till his bracket could be put up  guided most carefully by her eldest son and with the two little ones dancing and singing round her and alternately stopping each others mouths when any premature disclosure was apprehended pausing in wonder when the cuckoo note never heard before came on them making them laugh with glee  thus she was conducted much further than she expected  she heard the swing of the garden gate and felt her feet on the road and remonstrated but she was coaxed on and through another gate and a path where allen had to walk in front of her and the little ones fell behind  then came an eager now  her eyes were unbound and she beheld what they might well call enchanted ground  she was in the midst of a curved bank where the copsewood had no doubt been recently cut away and which was a perfect marvel of primroses their profuse bunches standing out of their wrinkled leaves at every hazel root or hollow among the exquisite moss varied by the pearly stars of the windflower purple orchis spikes springing from blackspotted leaves and deepgrey crested dog violets  on one side was a perfect grove of the broadleaved waxen belled solomons seal sloping down to moister ground where was a golden river of kingcups and above was a long glade between young birchtrees their trunks gleaming silvery white the boughs over head breaking out into foliage that looked yellow rather than green against the blue sky and the ground below one sheet of that unspeakably intense purple blue which is only produced by masses of the wild hyacinth  there said allen  there reechoed the children  oh mammy mammy dear  is it not delicious  carey held up her hand in silence for a nightingale was pouring out his song close by she listened breathlessly and as it ceased she burst into tears  o mother cried allen it is too much for you  no dear boy it is—it is—only too beautiful  it is what papa always talked of and would have so enjoyed  do you think he has better flowers up there asked babie  i dont think they can be much better  and without waiting for more she plunged down among the primroses and spread her little self out with a scream of ecstasy  and verily the strange sense of rapture and enchantment was no less in the mother herself  there is no charm perhaps equal to that of a primrose bank on a sunny day in spring sight sound scent all alike exquisite  it comes with a new and fresh delight even to those to whom this is an annual experience and to those who never saw the like before it gives like the first sight of the sea or of a snowy mountain a sensation never to be forgotten  fret fatigue anxiety sorrow all passed away like dreams in that sweet atmosphere  carey like one of her children absolutely forgot everything in the charm and wonder of the scene in the pure delicate unimaginable odour of the primroses in debating with allen whether cockneys that they were it could be a nightingale singing by day when every goose is cackling in listening to the marvellous note only pausing to be answered from further depths in the beauty of the whole and in the individual charm of every flower each heavilyladen arch of dark bluebells with their curling tips so infinitely more graceful than their pampered sister the hyacinth of the windowglass of each pure delicate anemone she gathered with its winged stem of the smiling primrose of that inimitable tint it only wears in its own woodland nest and when allen lighted on a bed of woodsorrel with its scarlet stems lovely trefoil leaves and purple striped blossoms like insects wings she absolutely held her breath in an enthusiasm of reverent admiration  no one can tell the happiness of those four only slightly diminished by armines getting bogged on his way to the golden river of kingcups and his mother in going after him till allen from an adjacent stump pulled them out their feet deeply laden with mud  they had only just emerged when the strokes of a great bell came pealing up from the town below allen and his mother looked at each other in amused dismay then at their watches  it was twelve oclock  two hours had passed like as many minutes and the boys would be coming home to dinner  ah well we must go said carey as they gathered up their armloads of flowers  you naughty children to make me forget everything  you are not sorry you came though mother  it has done you good said allen solicitously  he was the most affectionate of them all  sorry  i feel as if i cared for nothing while i have a place like that to drink up delight in  with which they tried to make their way back to the path again but it was not immediately to be found and their progress was further impeded by a woodpigeon dwelling impressively on the notes take two cows taffy taffy take two and then dashing out flapping and grey in their faces rather to barbaras alarm and then by armines stumbling on his first birds nest a wrens in the moss of an old stump where the tiny bird unadvisedly flew out of her leafy hole full before their eyes  that was a marvel of marvels a delight equal to that felt by any explorer the world has seen  armine and barbara who lived in one perpetual fairy tale were saying to one another that  one neednt make believe here it was every bit real  and more added the other little happy voice  barbara did however begin to think of the numerous children in the wood and to take comfort that it was unprecedented that their mother and big brother should be with them but they found the park palings at last and then a little wicket gate where they were very near home  mother where have you been exclaimed janet somewhat suddenly emerging from the door  in tom tiddlers ground picking up gold and silver said carey pointing to the armsful of kingcups cuckooflowers and anemones besides bluebells orchises primroses c  my poor child it was a great shame to leave you but they got me into the enchanted land and i forgot all about everything  i think so said a gravely kind voice and caroline was aware of ellens eye looking at her as the court queen might have looked at ophelia if she had developed her taste for long purples as hamlets widow  at least so it struck mother carey who immediately became conscious that her bonnet was awry having been half pulled off by a bramble that her ankles were marked by the bog and that bits of green were sticking all over her  have you been helping janet  oh how kind she said refreshed by her delightsome morning into putting a bright face on it  we have done all we could in your absence said her sisterinlaw in a reproachful voice  thank you im sure it is very good of you  janet—janet wheres the great dutch bowl—and the little salviati  nothing else is worthy of this dear little fairy thing  what is it  just common woodsorrel said the other lady in utter amaze  ah ellen you think me demented  you little know what it is to see spring for the first time  ah thats right janet  now babie well make a little bit of fairyland—  dont put all those littering flowers on that nice clean chintz children exclaimed the aunt as though all her work were about to be undone  and then a trampling of boys boots being heard and shouts of mother carey darted out into the hall to hear fragments of school intelligence as to work and play tumbling over one another from bobus and jock both at once in the midst of which mrs robert brownlow came out with her hat on and stood with her air of patient serenity waiting for an interval  caroline looked up and said i beg your pardon ellen—what is it  if you can attend a moment said she gravely i must be going to my boys dinner  but robert wishes to know whether he shall order this paper for the drawingroom  it cannot be put up yet of course but smith has only a certain quantity of it and it is so stylish that he said the colonel had better secure it at once  she spread the roll of paper on the hall table  it was a white paper slightly tinted and seemed intended to represent coral branches with starrylooking things at the ends  the aquarium at the zoo muttered bobus and caroline herself meeting allens eye could not refrain from adding             the worms they crawled in            and the worms they crawled out   mother cried jock i thought you were going to paint it all over with jolly things  frescoes said allen shant you mother  if your uncle does not object said his mother choking down a giggle  those plaster panels are so tempting for frescoes ellen  frescoes  why those are those horrid improperlooking gods and goddesses in clouds and chariots on the ceilings at belforest observed that lady in a halfpuzzled halfoffended tone of voice that most perilously tickled the fancy of mother carey and her brood and she could hardly command her voice to make answer never fear ellen we are not going to attempt allegorical monstrosities only to make a bower of green leaves and flowers such as we see round us though after what we have seen today that seems presumptuous enough fancy janet golden green trees and porcelain blue ground all in one bath of sunshine  such things must be seen to be believed in  poor mrs robert brownlow  she went home and sighed as she said to her husband well what is to become of those poor things i do not know  one would sometimes think poor caroline was just a little touched in the head  i hope not said the colonel rather alarmed  it may be only affectation said his lady in a consolatory tone i am afraid poor joe did live with a very odd set of people— artists and all that kind of thing  i am sure i dont blame her poor thing  but she is worse to manage than any child because you cant bid her mind what she is about and not talk nonsense  when she leaves her house in such a state and no one but that poor girl to see to anything and comes home all over mud raving about fairy land and gold trees and blue ground when she has just got into a bog in belforest coppice—littering the whole place too with common wild flowers  if it had been essie and ellie i should just have put them in the corner for making such a mess  the colonel laughed a little to himself and said consolingly well well you know all these country things are new to her  you must be patient with her  patient  that had to be the burthen of the song on both sides carey was pushing back her hair with a fierce wild sense of impatience with that calm assumption that fretted her beyond all bearing and made her feel desolate beyond all else  she would have she thought done well enough alone with her children and scrambled into her new home but the directions however needful seemed to be continually insulting her understanding  when she was advised as to the best butcher and baker there was a ring in her ears as if ellen meant that these were safe men for a senseless creature like her and she could not encounter them with her orders without wondering whether they had been told to treat her well  indeed one of the chief drawbacks to careys comfort was her difficulty in attending to what her brother and sisterinlaw said to her  something in the measured tones of the colonel always made her thoughts wander as from a dull sermon and this was more unlucky in his case than in his wifes—for ellen used such reiterations that there was a fair chance of catching her drift the second or third time if not the first whereas all he said was well weighed and arranged and was only too heavy and sententious  kencroft the home of the colonel and his family mrs robert brownlows inheritance was certainly a picture of a place  it had probably been an appendage of the old minster though the house was only of the seventeenth century but that was substantial and venerable of its kind and exceedingly comfortable and roomy with everything kept in perfect order  caroline could not quite think the furniture worthy of it but that was not for want of the desire to do everything handsomely and fashionably  moreover in spite of the schoolroom and nurseryful of children marvels of needlework and knitting adorned every table chair and sofa while even in the midst of the town kencroft had its own charming garden a lawn once devoted to bowls and now to croquet an oldfashioned walled kitchen garden sloping up the hill and a paddock sufficient to make cows and pigs part of the establishment  the colonel had devoted himself to gardening and poultry with the mingled ardour and precision of a man who needed something to supply the place of his soldierly duties and though his fervour had relaxed under the influence of ease gout and substantial flesh enough remained to keep up applepie order withoutdoors and render kencroft almost a show place  the meadow lay behind the house and a gravel walk leading along its shaded border opened into the lane about ten yards from the gate of the pagoda as colonel and mrs brownlow and the post office laboured to call it the folly as came so much more naturally to everyones lips  it had been the work of the one eccentric man in mrs robert brownlows family and was thus her property  it had hung long on hand being difficult to let and after making sufficient additions it had been decided that at a nominal rent it would house the family thrown upon the hands of the good colonel     chapter vii  the colonels chickens    they censured the bantam for strutting and crowing in those vile pantaloons that he fancied looked knowing and a want of decorum caused many demurs against the game chicken for coming in spurs                                       the peacock at home   left to themselves mother carey with janet and old nurse completed their arrangements so well that when jessie looked in at five oclock with a few choice flowers covering a fine cucumber in her basket she exclaimed in surprise how nice you have made it all look i shall be so glad to tell mamma  tell her what asked janet  that you have really made the room look nice said jessie  thank you said her cousin ironically  you see we have as many hands as other people  didnt aunt ellen think we had  of course she did said jessie a pretty kindly creature but slow of apprehension only she said she was very sorry for you  and why cried janet leaping up in indignation  why interposed allen because we are raw cockneys who go into raptures over primroses and wild hyacinths eh jessie  well you have set them up very nicely said jessie but fancy taking so much trouble about common flowers  what would you think worth setting up asked janet  a big dahlia i suppose or a great red cactus  we have a beautiful garden said jessie papa is very particular about it and we always get the prize for our flowers  we had the first prizes for hyacinths and forced roses last week and we should have had the first for forced cucumbers if the gardener at belforest had not had a spite against spencer because he left him for us everybody said there was no comparison between the cucumbers and mr ellis said—  janet had found the day before how jessie could prattle on in an endless quiet stream without heeding whether any one entered into it or replied to it but she was surprised at allens toleration of it though he changed the current by saying belforest seems a jolly place  but youve only seen the wood not the gardens said jessie  i went down to the lake with mr ogilvie said allen and saw something splendiferous looking on the other side  oh they are beautiful cried janet all laid out in ribbon gardens and with the most beautiful terrace and a fountain—only that doesnt play except when you give the gardener halfacrown and mamma says that is exorbitant—and statues standing all round—real marble statues  like the groves of blarney muttered janet             heathen goddesses most rare            homer venus and nebuchadnezzar            all standing naked in the open air   allen seeing jessie scandalised diverted her attention by asking whom does it belong to   mr barnes said jessie but he is hardly ever there  he is an old miser you know—what they call a millionaire or millowner which is it  one is generally the french for the other put in janet  never mind her jessie said allen with a look of infinite displeasure at his sister  what does he do which keeps him away  i believe he is a great merchant and is always in liverpool said jessie  any way he is a very cross old man and wont let anybody go into his park and gardens when he comes down here and he is very cruel too for he disinherited his own nephew and niece for marrying only think mrs watson at the grocers told our susan that theres a little girl who is his own greatniece living down at river hollow farm with mr and mrs gould just brought up by common farmers you know and he wont take any notice of her nor give one farthing for bringing her up  isnt it shocking  and even when he is at home he only has two chops or two steaks or just a bit of kidney and that when he is literally rolling in gold  jessie opened her large brown eyes to mark her horror and allen made a gesture of exaggerated sympathy which his sister took for more earnest than it was and she said scornfully i should like to see him literally rolling in gold  it must be like midas  do you mean that he sleeps on it jessie  how hard and cold  nonsense said jessie you know what i mean  i know what literally rolling in gold means but i dont know what you mean  dont bully her janet said allen we are not so stupid are we jessie  come and show me the walnuttree you were telling me about  whats the matter janet said her mother coming in a moment or two after and finding her staring blankly out of the window where the two had made their exit  o mother jessie has been talking such gossip and allen likes it and wont have it stopped  i cant think what makes allen and bobus both so foolish whenever she is here  she is a very pretty creature said carey smiling a little  pretty repeated janet  what has that to do with it  a great deal as you will have to find out in the course of your life my dear  i thought only foolish people cared about beauty  it is very convenient for us to think so said carey smiling  but mother—surely everybody cares for you just as much or more than if you were a great handsome stupid creature  how i hate that word handsome  except for a cab said carey  ah when shall i see a hansom again said janet in a slightly sentimental tone  but she returned to the charge dont go mother i want you to answer  beauty versus brains  my dear you had better open your eyes to the truth  you must make up your mind to it  it is only very exceptional people who even in the long run care most for feminine brains  but mother every one did  every one in our world janet but your father made our home set of those exceptional people and we are cast out of it now she added with a gasp and a gesture of irrepressible desolateness  yes that comes of this horrid move said the girl in quite another tone  well some day— and she stopped  some day said her mother  some day well go back again and show what we are she said proudly  ah janet and thats nothing now without him  mother how can you say so when—  jane just checked herself as she was coming to the great secret  when we have his four boys said her mother  ah yes janet—if— and when—but thats a long way off and to come back to our former subject she added recalling herself with a sigh it will be wise in us owlets to make up our minds that owlets we are and to give the place to the eaglets  but eaglets are very ugly and owlets very pretty quoth janet  carey laughed  that does not seem to have been the opinion of the beast epic said she and the entrance of babie prevented them from going further  janet turned away with one of her grim sighs at the unappreciative world to which she was banished  she had once or twice been on the point of mentioning the magnum bonum to her mother but the reserve at first made it seem as if an avowal would be a confession and to this she could not bend her pride while the secrecy made a strange barrier between her and her mother  in truth janet had never been so devoted to mother carey as to either granny or her father and now she missed them sorely and felt it almost an injury to have no one but her mother to turn to  her character was not set in the same mould and though both could meet on the common ground of intellect she could neither enter into the recesses of her mothers grief nor understand those flashes of brightness and playfulness which nothing could destroy  if carey had chosen to unveil the truth to herself she would have owned that allen who was always ready tender and sympathetic to her was a much greater comfort than his sister nay that even little babie gave her more rest and peace than did janet who always rubbed against her whenever they found themselves teteatete or in consultation  meantime babie had been out with her two little cousins and came home immensely impressed with the belforest gardens  the house was shut up but the gardens were really kept up to perfection and the little one could not declare her full delight in the wonderful blaze she had seen of banks of red and flame coloured and white flowering trees  they said they would show me the americans she said  why was it mother  i thought americans were like the gentleman who dined with you one day and told me about the snow birds  but there were only these flowertrees and a pond and statues standing round it and i dont think they were americans for i know one was diana because she had a bow and quiver  i wanted to look at the rest but miss james said they were horrid heathen gods not fit for little girls to look at and mother ellie is so silly she thought the people at belforest worshipped them  do come and see them  mother  it is like the crystal palace outofdoors  omitting the crystal laughed some one but babie had more to say exclaiming o mother essie says aunt ellen says janet and i are to do lessons with miss james but you wont let us will you  miss james broke out janet indignantly we might as well learn of old nurse  why mother she cant pronounce french and she never heard of terminology and she thinks edward i killed the bards for the girls had spent a day or two with their cousins in the course of the move  yes broke in barbara and she wont let essie and ellie teach their dolls their lessons  she was quite cross when i was showing them how and said it was all nonsense when i told her i heard you say that i half taught myself by teaching juliet  and so the poor dolls have no advantages mother and are quite stupid for want of education pursued the little girl indignantly  they arent people but only dolls and essie and ellie cant do anything with them but just dress them and take them out walking  thats what they would wish to make babie like said her elder sister  but youll not let anybody teach me but you dear dear mother carey entreated the child  no indeed my little one  and just then the boys came rushing in to their evening meal full of the birds nest that they had been visiting in their uncles field and quite of opinion that kenminster was a jolly place  and then added jock we got the garden engine and had such fun you dont know  yes said bobus till you sent a whole cataract against the house and that brought out her serene highness  the applicability of the epithet set the whole family off into a laugh and jock further made up a solemn face and repeated—             buff says buff to all his men            and i say buff to you again            buff neither laughs nor smiles            but carries his face            with a very good grace   it convulsed them all and the mother recovering a little said i wonder whether she ever can laugh  poor aunt ellen said babie in all her gravity she is like king henry i and never smiled again  and with more wit than prudence mrs buff her serene highness sua serenita as janet made it became the sobriquets for aunt ellen and were in continual danger of oozing out publicly  indeed the younger population at kencroft probably soon became aware of them for on the next halfholiday jock crept in with unmistakable tokens of combat about him and on interrogation confessed it was johnnie mother because we wanted you to come out walking with us and he said twas no good walking with ones mother and i told him he didnt know what a really jolly mother was and that his mother couldnt laugh and that you said so and he said my mother was no better than a tomboy and that she said so and so—  and so the effects were apparent on jocks torn and stained collar and swelled nose  but the namesake champions remained unconvinced except that johnnie may have come over to the opinion that a mother no better than a tomboy was not a bad possession for the three haunted the folly a good deal and made no objection to their aunts company after the first experiment  unfortunately however their assurances that their mother could laugh as well as other people were not so conclusive but that jock made it his business to do his utmost to produce a laugh in which he was apt to be signally unsuccessful to his own great surprise though to that of no one else  for instance two or three days later when his mother and allen were eating solemnly a dinner at kencroft by way of farewell ere allens return to eton an extraordinarily frightful noise was heard in the poultry yard where dwelt various breeds of uncle roberts prize fowls  thieves—foxes—dogs—what could it be  even the cheese and celery were deserted and out rushed servants master mistress and guests being joined by the two girls from the schoolroom but even then carey was struck by the ominous absence of boys  the poultry house door was shut—locked—but the noises within were more and more frightful—of convulsive cocks and hysterical hens mingled with human scufflings and hushes and snortings and snigglings that made the elders call out in various tones of remonstrance and reprobation boys have done  come out  open the door  a small hatch door was opened a flourish on a tin trumpet was heard and out darted in an elizabethan ruff and cap a respectable dorking mother of the yard cackling her displeasure and instantly dashing to the top of the wall followed at once by a stately black spaniard decorated with a lace mantilla of cut paper off a french plum box squawking and curtseying  then came a dapper pullet with a dolls hat on her unwilling head c c  the outsiders were choking with breathless surprise at first then the one lady began indignantly to exclaim now boys  have done— let the poor things alone  come out this minute  the other fairly reeled against the wall with laughter and janet and jessie screamed at each fresh appearance till they made as much noise as the outraged chickens though one shrieked with dismay the other with diversion  at last the colonel slower of foot than the rest arrived on the scene just as the pride of his heart the old king chanticleer of the yard made his exit draped in a royal red paper robe and a species of tinsel crown out of which his red face looked most ludicrous as he came halting and stupefied haying evidently been driven up in a corner and pinched rather hard but close behind him chuckling forth his terror and flapping his wings came the pert little white bantam belted and accoutred as a page  colonel brownlows severe command to open the door was not resisted for one moment and forth rushed a cloud of dust and feathers a quacking waggling substratum of ducks and a screaming flapping rabble of chickens behind whom when the mist cleared were seen looking as if they had been tarred and feathered various black and grey figures which developed into jock armine robin johnny and joe  jock the foremost stared straight up in his aunts face armine ran to his mother with—did you see the old king mother and his little page  wasnt it funny—  but he was stopped by the sight of his uncle who laid hold of his eldest son with a fierce how dare you sir and gave him a shake and blow  robin stood with a sullen look on his face and hands in his pockets and his brothers followed suit  armine hid his face in his mothers dress and burst out crying but jock stepped forth and with that impish look of fearlessness said i did it uncle robert i wanted to make aunt ellen laugh  did she laugh mother he asked in so comical and innocent a manner that in spite of her full consciousness of the heinousness of the offence and its general unluckiness mother carey was almost choked  this probably added to the gravity with which the other lady decreed with junolike severity robin and john must be flogged  joe is too young  certainly responded the colonel but caroline instead of as they evidently expected of her at once offering up her victim sprang forward with eager tearful pleadings declaring it was all jocks fault and he did not know how naughty it was—but all in vain robert knew  he ought to have stopped it said the colonel  go to the study you two  jock did not act as the generous hero of romance would have done and volunteer to share the flogging  he cowered back on his mother and put his arm round her waist while she said jock told the truth so i shall not ask you to flog him uncle robert  he shall not do such mischief again  if he does said his uncle with a look as if her consent would not be asked to what would follow     chapter viii  the folly    there will we sit upon the rocks and see the shepherds feed their flocks by summer rivers by whose falls melodious birds sing madrigals—marlowe    how does my little schoolfellow get on asked mary ogilvie when she had sat down for her first meal with her brother in her summer holidays  much as ariel did in the split pine i fancy  for shame david  im afraid you are teaching her to see sycorax and caliban in her neighbours  not i  how should i ever see her  do you hear from her  sometimes and i heard of her from the actons who had an immense regard for her husband who they say was a very superior man  it is hardly necessary to be told so  they mean to take lodgings somewhere near here this next month and see what they can do to cheer her in her present life which must be the greatest possible contrast to her former one  do you wish to set out on our expedition before august davie  i should like you to see them  by all means let us wait for them  indeed i should not be at liberty till the last week in july  and how go the brains of kenminster  you look enlivened since last time i saw you  it is the infusion the brains have received  that one woman has made more difference to the school than i could have done in ten years  you find her boys at any rate pupils worth teaching  more than that  of course it is something to have a fellow capable of ideas before one but besides that lads who had gone on contentedly at their own level have had to bestir themselves not to be taken down by him  when he refused to have it forced upon him that study was not the thing at kenminster they found the only way to make him know his place was to keep theirs and some of them have really found the use of their wits and rejoice in them  even in the lower form the colonels second boy has developed an intellect then the way those boys bring their work prepared has raised the standard  i heard something of that on my way  you did  yes two ladies were in full career of talk when the train stopped at the junction and i heard—i am always obliged to spend one hour every evening seeing that arthur knows his lessons  so troublesome you know but since that mrs joseph brownlow has come she helps her boys so with their homework that the others have not a chance if one does not look to it oneself  then it appeared that she told mr ogilvie it wasnt fair and that he would give her no redress  absurd woman  it is not a matter of unfairness as i told her they dont get help in sums or exercises they only have grammar to learn and construing to prepare and all my concern is that it should be got up thoroughly  if their mothers help them so much the better  the mothers dont seem to think so  however she branched off into incredulity that mrs joe brownlow could ever really teach her children anything for she was always tramping all over the country with them at all hours of the day and night  she has met her herself with all those boys after her three miles from home in a great straw hat when her husband hadnt been dead a year  im sure she is always in regulation veils and all the rest of it at church if thats what you ladies want  but the crown of the misdoings seemed to be that she had been met at some old castle sacred to picnics alone with her children—no party nor anything  i could not make out whether the offence consisted in making the ruin too cheap or in caring for it for its own sake and not as a lion for guests  the latter probably  she has the reputation of being very affected  poor dear  i heard that she was a great trial to dear mrs brownlow said mary in an imitative voice  why do you know she sometimes is up and out with her children before six oclock in the morning and then colonel brownlow went in one day at twelve oclock and found the whole family fast asleep on different sofas  the sensible way too to spend such days as these  to go out in the cool of the morning and take a siesta is the only rational plan  im afraid one must conform to ones neighbours ways  trust a woman for being conventional  i confess i did not like the tone in which my poor carey was spoken of  i am afraid she can hardly have taken care enough not to be thought flighty  mary you are as absurd as the rest of them  why what have you seen of her  nothing i tell you except once meeting her in the street and once calling on her to ask whether her boy should learn german  and david ogilvie spoke with a vehemence that somewhat startled his sister  it was a july evening and though the walls of the schoolmasters house were thick it was sultry enough within to lead the brother and sister out immediately after dinner looking first into the play fields where cricket was of course going on among the bigger boys but where mary looked in vain for her friends sons  no they are not much of cricketers said her brother they are small for it yet and only take their turn in watchingout by compulsion  i wish the senior had more play in him  shall we walk on by the river  so they did along a paved causeway which presently got clear of the cottages and gables of old factories and led along with the brightly glassy sheet of water on one side and the steep wooded slope on the other loosestrife and meadowsweet growing thickly on the bank amid long weeds with feathery tops rich brown fingers of sedge and burreeds like german morgensterns while above the long wreaths of dogroses projected the sweet honeysuckle twined about and the white blossoms of travellers joy hung in festoons from the hedge of the bordering plantation  after a time they came on a kind of glade opening upwards though the wood with one large oaktree standing alone in the centre and behold on the grass below sat or lay a company—mrs joseph brownlow in the midst under the obnoxious mushroomhat reading aloud  radiating from her were five boys the biggest of all on his back with his hat over his eyes fast asleep another crosslegged with a basket between his knees dividing his attention between it and the book two more lying froglike with elbows on the ground feet erected behind them chin in hand devouring the narrative with their eyes the fifth wriggling restlessly about evidently in search of opportunities of mischief or of tormenting tricks  just within earshot but sketching the picturesque wooden bridge below sat one girl  the little one with her youngest brother was close at their mothers feet threading flowers to make a garland  it was a pretty sight and so intent were most of the party on their occupations that they never saw the pair on the bank till joe the idler started and rolled round with hollo when all turned it may be feared with muttered growls from some of the boys but carey herself gave a cry of joy ran down the bank like a girl and greeted mary ogilvie with an eager embrace  you are holding a court here said the schoolmaster  we have had tea out here  it is too hot for indoors and i am reading them the water babies  to a large audience i see  yes and some of which are not quite sure whether it is fact or fiction  come and sit down  the boys will hate us for breaking up their reading said mary  why should not we listen said her brother  dont disturb yourselves boys weve met before today  bobus and jock were however on their feet and johnny had half risen robin lay still snoring and joe had retreated into the wood from the alarming spectacle of the schoolmaster abroad  after a greeting to the two girls who comported themselves according to their ages as young ladies might be expected to do the ogilvies found accommodation on the roots of the tree and listened the water babies were then new and mr ogilvie had never heard them  luckily the reading had just come to the history of the do as you likes and the interview between the last of the race and m du chaillu diverted him beyond measure  he laughed so much over the poor fellows abortive attempt to say am i not a man and a brother that his three scholars burst out into a second edition of shouts of laughter at the sight of him and thus succeeded in waking robin who after a great contortion sat up on the grass and rubbing his eyes demanded in an injured tone what was the row  the last of the do as you likes said armine  oh i sayisnt it jolly cried jock beating his breast gorilla fashion and uttering a wild murmur of am i not a man and a brother then tumbling head over heels half in ecstasy half in imitation of the fate of the do as you like setting everybody off into fits again  its just what robin is coming to observed bobus as his namesake stretched his arms and delivered himself of a waking howl then suddenly becoming conscious of mr ogilvie he remained petrified with one arm fully outstretched the other still lifted to his head  never mind brownlow maximus said his master it was hardly fair to surprise you in private life was it  the boy made no answer but scrambled up sheepish and disconcerted and indeed the sun was entirely down and the dew almost falling so that the mother called to the young ones to gather up their things and come home  such a collection  bobus picked up a tincase and basket full of flowers interspersed with bottles of swimming insects  the trio and armine shouldered their butterflynets and had a distribution of pillboxes and bottles in some of which were caterpillars intended to live in others butterflies dead or dying it may be feared of laurel leaves  babie had a mighty nosegay janet put up the sketch which showed a good deal of power and the whole troop moved up the slope to go home by the lanes  what collectors you are said mr ogilvie  for the museum answered armine eagerly  havent you seen our museum cried barbara who had taken his hand oh it is such a beauty  we have got an orobanche major only it is not dry yet  im afraid babie likes fine words said her mother but our museum is a great amusement to us londoners  they all walked home together talking merrily and mr and miss ogilvie came in with them on special entreaty to share the supper— milk fruit bread and butter and cheese and sandwiches which was laid out on the round table in the octagon vestibule which formed the lowest story of the tower  it was partaken of standing or sitting at case on the windowseats a form or two an old carved chair or on the stairs the children ascending them after their meal and after securing in their own fashion their treasures for the morrow  the two cousins had already bidden goodnight at the gate and gone home and the ogilvies followed their example in ten minutes caroline begging mary to come up to her as soon as mr ogilvie was disposed of by school hours  but you will be busy said mary  never mind i am afraid we are not very regular said carey  it was by this time ten oclock and the two younger children were still to be heard shouting to one another up stairs about the leaves for their chrysalids  so when mary came up the hill at halfpast ten the next morning she was the less surprised to find these two only just beginning breakfast while their mother was sitting at the end of the table knitting and hearing janet repeat german poetry  the boys had long been in school  caroline jumped up and threw her arms round marys neck declaring that now they would enjoy themselves  we are very late she added but these late walks make the little people sleep and i think it is better for them than tossing about hot and cross  mary was rather entertained at this new code but said nothing as carey pointed out to the children how they were to occupy themselves under janets charge and the work they had to do showed that for their age they had lost no time  the drawingroom showed indeed a contrast to the chaotic state in which it had been left  it was wonderfully pleasantlooking  the windows of the deep bay were all open to the lawn shaded with blinds projecting out into the garden where the parrot sat perched on her pole pleasant nooks were arranged in the two sides of the bay window with light chairs and small writingtables each with its glass of flowers the piano stood across the arc shutting off these windows into almost a separate room low bookcases with chiffonier cupboards and marble tops ran round the walls surmounted with many artistic ornaments  the central table was crowned with a tall glass of exquisitelyarranged grasses and wild flowers and the choice and graceful nicknacks round it were such as might be traced to a london life in the artist world and among grateful patients  brackets with vases and casts here and there projected from the walls and some charming crayons and watercolours hung round them the plastered walls had already been marked out in panels and a growth of frescoes of bulrushes ivy and leaves of all kinds was beginning to overspread them while on a nearer inspection the leaves proved to be fast becoming peopled with living portraits of butterflies and other insects indeed mary started at finding herself in as she thought unpleasant proximity to a pair of cockchafers  ah i tell the children that we shall be suspected of putting those creatures there as a trial to the old ladies nerves said caroline laughing  i confess they are startling to those who dont like creeping things  have you many old ladies carey  not very many  i fancy they dont take to me more than i take to them so we are mutually satisfied  but is that a good thing said mary anxiously  i dont know said carey indifferently  at least i do know she added that i always used to be told i didnt try to make small talk and i can do it less than ever now that it is the smallest of small and my heart faints from it  oh mary  my poor dear caroline  but you say that you were told you ought to do it  well yes  dear granny wished it but i think that was rather with a view to joes popularity and we havent any patients to think of now  i should think the less arrant gossip the children heard the better  but is it well to let them despise everybody  then the less they see of them the better  for shame carey  well mary i dare say i am naughty  i do feel naughtier now than ever i did in my life but i cant help it  it just makes me mad to be worried or tied down and she pushed back her hair so that her unfortunate cap was only withheld from tumbling entirely off by the pin that held it  oh that wretched cap she cried jumping up petulantly and going to the glass to set it to rights but with so hasty a hand that the pin became entangled in her hair and it needed marys quiet hand to set it to rights its just an emblem of all the rest of it i wouldnt wear it another day but that im afraid of ellen and robert and it perfectly drives me wild  and i know joe couldnt have borne to see me in it  at the irishism of which she burst out laughing and laughed herself into the tears that had never come when they were expected of her  mary caressed and soothed her and told her she could well guess it was sadder to her now than even at first  well it is said carey looking up  if one was sent out to sea in a boat it wouldnt be near so bad as long as one could see the dear old shore still as when one had got out—out into the wide open—with nothing at all  and she stretched out her hands with a dreary yearning gesture into the vacant space such as it went to her friends heart to see  ah but theres a haven at the end  i suppose there is said carey but its a long way off and theres dying first and when people want to begin about it they get so conventional and if theres one thing above another that i cant stand it is being bored  my poor child  there dont be angry with me because im telling you just what i am  before any more could be said janet opened the door saying mother emma wants to see you  oh i forgot cried carey hurrying off while janet came forward to the guest in her grownup way and asked—  have you been to the watercolour exhibition miss ogilvie  yes mr acton took me one saturday afternoon  oh then he would be sure to show you nita rays picture  i want so much to know how it strikes people  and janet had plunged into a regular conversation about exhibitions pictures artists concerts lectures c before her mother came back talking with all the eagerness of an exile about her native country  as a governess in her schoolroom miss ogilvie had had little more than a keyhole view of all these things but then what she had seen and heard had been chiefly through the actons and thus coincided with janets own side of the world and they were in full discussion when caroline came back  there ive disposed of the butcher and baker she said  now we can be comfortable again  mary expected janet to repair to her own lessons or to listen to those scales which babie might be heard from a distance playing but she only appealed to her mother about some picture of last year and sat down to her drawing while the conversation on pictures and books continued in animated style  so far from sending her away mary fancied that carey was rather glad to keep to surface matters and to be prevented from another outbreak of feeling  the next interruption was from the children each armed with a pile of open books on the top of a slate  carey begged mary to wait and went outside the window with them sitting down under a tree whence the murmured sounds of repetition could be heard lasting about twenty minutes between the two and then she returned the little ones jumping on each side of her armine begging that miss ogilvie would come and see the museum and barbara saying that jock wanted to help to show it off  well run now and put your own corners tidy suggested their mother  if jock does not stay in the playground he will come back in a quarter of an hour  and mr ogilvie will come then  i invited him said babie  at which carey laughed incredulously but janet observing that she must go and see that the children did not do more harm than good walked off and mary said—  i should not wonder if he did act on the invitation  i hope he will  it would have only been civil in me to have asked him considering that i have taken possession of you said caroline  i fully expect to see him on miss barbaras invitation  do you know carey he says you have transformed his school  translated it like bottom the weaver  in the reverse direction  he says you have made the mothers see to their boys preparation and wakened up the intellects  have i  i thought i had only kept my own boys up to the mark  yes and theres johnny  do you know mary it is very funny but that boy johnny has adopted me  he comes after me everywhere like a shadow and theres nothing he wont do for me even learning his lessons  you see the poor boy has a good deal of native sense brownlow sense and mind had been more stifled than wanting in him nobody had ever put things to him by the right end and when he once let me do it for him it was quite a revelation and he has been so happy and prosperous that he hardly knows himself  poor boy there is something very honest and true about him and so affectionate  he is a little like his uncle and i cant help being fond of him  then robin is just as devoted to jock though i cant say the results are so very desirable for jock is a monkey i must confess and it is irresistible to a monkey to have a bear that he can lead to do anything  i hear that robin used to be the good boy of the establishment and i am afraid he is not that now  but cant you stop that  my dear nobody could think of jocks devices so as to stop them who had not his own monkey brain  who would have thought of his getting the whole set to dress up as nigger singers with black faces and banjoes and coming to dance and sing in front of the windows  there wasnt much harm in that  there wouldnt have been if it had been only here  and oh dear the irresistible fun of jocks capering antics and rob moving by mechanism as stiff and obedient as the giant porter to flibberti gibbet  carey stopped to laugh  but then i never thought of their going on to present themselves to ellen in the middle of a mighty and solemn dinner party  all the grandees the county people this in a deep and awful voice sitting up in their chignons of state in the awful pause during the dishingup when these five little wretches in finery filched from the rag bag appear on the smooth lawn mown and trimmed to the last extent for the occasion and begin to strike up at their shrillest close to the open window  ellen rises with great dignity  i fancy i can see her sending out to order them off and then oh dear jock only hopping more frantically than ever round the poor man the hired waiter who you must know is the undertakers chief mute and singing—             leedle leedle leedle            our cats dead            what did she die wi            wi a sair head            a you that kenned her            while she was alive            come to her burying            at halfpast five   and then the colonel bestirring himself to the rescue with go away boys or ill send for the police  and then the discovery when in the height of his wrath jock perked up and said i thought you would like to have the ladies amused uncle robert  he did box his ears then—small blame to him i must say  i could stand that better than the jaw ellen gave us afterwards  i beg your pardon mary but it really was one  she thinks us far gone in the ways of depravity and doesnt willingly let her little girls come near us  isnt that a pity  i dont know essie and ellie have feelings in their clothes and dont like our scrambling walks and if ellie does get allured by our wicked ways she is sure to be torn or splashed or something and we have shrieks and lamentations and accusations of jock and joe amid floods of tears and jessie comes to the rescue primly shaking her head and coaxing her little sister while she brings out a needle and thread  i cant help it mary  it does aggravate me to look at her  mary could only shake her head with a mixture of pity reproof and amusement and as a safer subject could not help asking—  by the bye why do you confuse your friends by having all the two families named in pairs  we didnt know we were going to live close together said carey but the fact is that the janets were named after their fathers only sister who seems to have been an equal darling to both  we would have avoided robert but we found that it would have been thought disrespectful not to call the boy after his grandfather and uncle  and bobus is a thoroughly individual name  then jocks name is john lucas and we did mean to call him by the second but it wouldnt stick  names wont sometimes and theres a formality in lucas that would never fit that skipjack of a boy  he got called jock as a nickname and now he will abide by it  but joseph armines second name does fit him and so we have kept to it and barbara was dear grandmammas own name and quite our own  therewith babie rushed downstairs with hes coming mother carey and darted out at the house door to welcome mr ogilvie at the gate and lead him in in triumph attended by her two brothers  the two ladies laughed and carey said with a species of proud apology—  poor children you see they have been used to be noticed by clever men  mr ogilvie is come to see our museum cried babie in her patronising tone jumping and dancing round during his greetings and remarks that he hoped he might take advantage of her invitation he had been thinking whether to begin a school museum would not be a very good thing for the boys and serve to open their minds to common things  on which before any one else could answer the parrot in a low and sententious tone observed excellent  there you have the consent of your first acquaintance said carey while the bird excited by one of those mysterious likings that her kind are apt to take held her grey head to mr ogilvie to be scratched chuckling out all mother careys chickens and janet exclaimed—  thats an adoption  the troop were climbing the stairs to the third story where armine and bobus were already within an octagon room corresponding to the little hall below and fitted with presses and shelves belonging to the storeroom of the former thrifty inhabitant but now divided between the six children mother carey as babie explained being mine own and helping me more specially  the table was likewise common to all but one of the laws of the place was that everything left there after twelve oclock on saturday was as babies little mouth rolled out the long words confiscated by the inexorable eumenides  and who are they asked mr ogilvie who was always much entertained by the simplicity with which the little maid uttered the syllables as if they were her native speech  janet and nurse and emma she said and they really are inexo rable  they threw away my snail shell that a thrush had been eating though i begged and prayed them  yes and my femur of a rabbit said armine and said it was a nasty old bone and the bakers pincher ate it up but i did find my turtledoves egg in the ashheap and discovered it over again and you dont see it is broken now it is stuck down on a card  yes said his mother it is wonderful how valuable things become precisely at twelve on saturday  each had some department janets which was geology was the fullest as she had inherited some youthful hoards of her fathers bobuss which was botany was the neatest and most systematic  mary thought at first that it did not suit him but she soon saw that with him it was not love of flowers but the study of botany  he pronounced jocks butterflies to be perfectly disgraceful  you said youd see to them returned jock  yes i shall take up insects when i have done with plants said bobus coolly  and say solomon i have surpassed thee asked mr ogilvie  bobus looked as if he did not like it but his mother shook her head at him as one who well deserved the little rebuke for self sufficiency  there was certainly a wonderful winning way about her— there was a simplicity of manner almost like that of babie herself and yet the cleverness of a highlyeducated woman  mary ogilvie did not wonder at what mr and mrs acton had said of the charm of that unpretending household now broken up  there was too the perception that beneath the surface on which like the children she played so lightly there were depths of sorrow that might not be stirred which added a sweetness and pathos to all she said and did  of many a choice curiosity the children said in lowered tones of reverence that he found it and these she would not allow to be passed over but showed fondly off in all their best points telling their story as if she loved to dwell upon it  barbara who had specially fastened herself on mr ogilvie according to the modern privileges of small girls after having much amused him by doing the honours of her own miscellaneous treasury insisted on exhibiting mother careys studio  caroline tried to declare that this meant nothing deserving of so grand a name it was only the family resort for making messes in she never touched clay now and there was nothing worth seeing but it was in vain babie had her way and they mounted to the highest stage of the pagoda where the eaves and the twisted monsters that supported them were in close juxtaposition with the four windows  the view was a grand one  belforest park on the one side the town almost as if in a pit below with a birdseye prospect of the roofs the gardens and the schoolyard the leadencovered church lying like a great grey beetle with outspread wings  beyond were the ups anddowns of a wooded hilly country with glimpses of blue river here and there and village and town gleaming out white a large house bosomed high in tufted trees a churchtower and spire nestled on the hillside up to the steep grey hill with the tall landmark tower closing in the horizon—altogether as carey said a thorough allegro landscape even to the tanned haycock in the mead  but the summer sun made the place dazzling and almost uninhabitable and the visitors turning from the glare could hardly see the casts and models that filled the shelves nor was there anything in hand so that they let themselves be hurried away to share the midday meal after which mr ogilvie and the boys betook themselves to the school and carey and her little ones to the shade of the gardenwall to finish their french reading while mary wondered the less at the kenminster ladies     chapter ix  flights    have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night  is there no respect of place persons nor time in you—twelfthnight   the summer holidays not only brought home allen brownlow from eton but renewed his mothers intercourse with several of her friends who so contrived their summer outing as to see how poor little mrs brownlow was getting on and she hailed them as fragments of her dear old former life  mr and mrs acton came to a farmhouse at redford about a mile and a half off where mr acton was to lay up a store of woodland and home sketches and there were daily meetings for walks and often outof door meals  mr ogilvie declared that he was thus much more rested than by a long expedition in foreign scenery and he and his sister stayed on and usually joined in the excursion whether it were premeditated or improvised on foot into copse or glade or by train or waggonette to ruined abbey or cathedral town  then came two sisters whom old mrs brownlow had befriended when the elder was struggling as a daily governess to provide home and education for the younger  now the one was a worthy hardworking lawcopier the other an artist in a small way who had transmogrified her name of jane into juanita or nita wore a crop short petticoats and was odd  she treated janet on terms of equal friendship and was thus a much more charming companion than jessie they always came into cheap seaside lodgings in the vacation but this year had settled themselves within ten minutes walk of the folly a title which became more and more applicable in kenminster eyes to the pagoda and above all in those of its proper owner mrs robert brownlow in the calm dignity of the heiress in a small way of a good family had a bare toleration for professional people had regretted the vocation of her brotherinlaw and classed governesses and artists as that kind of people so that carolines association with them seemed to her absolute love of low company she would have stirred up her husband to remonstrate but he had seen more of the world than she had and declared that there was no harm in carolines friends  he had met mr acton in the readingroom smoked pipes with him in the garden and thought him a very nice fellow his wife was the daughter of poor cartwright of the artillery and a sensible ladylike woman as ever he saw  with a resigned sigh at the folly of mankind his wife asked how about the others  that woman with the hair and that man with the velvet coat  jessie says jock told her that he was a mere play actor  jock told jessie  nonsense my dear  the man is going out to china in the tea trade and is come to take leave  i believe he did sing in public at one time but joe attended him in an illness which damaged his voice and then he put him in the way of other work  you need not be afraid  joe was one of the most particular men in the world in his own way  mrs brownlow could do no more  she had found that her little sisterinlaw could be saucy and personal squabbles as she justly thought had better be avoided  she could only keep jessie from the contamination by taking her out in the carriage and to garden parties which the young lady infinitely preferred to long walks that tired her and spoilt her dress to talk and laughter that she could not understand and games that seemed to her stupid though everybody else seemed to find them full of fun  true allen and bobus were always ready to push and pull her through and to snub janet for quizzing her but jessie was pretty enough to have plenty of such homage at her command and not specially to prefer that of her cousins so that it cost her little to turn a deaf ear to all their invitations  her brothers were not of the same mind for rob was never happy out of sight of jock  johnny worshipped his aunt and joe was gregarious so there was generally an accompanying rabble of six or seven boys undistinguishable by outsiders though very individual indeed in themselves and adding a considerable element of noise high spirits and mischievous enterprise  the man in the velvet coat whose proper name was orlando hughes was as much of a boy as any of them and so could mr acton be on occasion thus giving a certain bohemian air to their doings  things came to a crisis on one of the dogdays  young dr drake had brought his bride to show to his old friend and they were staying at the folly while a college friend of mr ogilvies a london curate had come to see him in the course of a cathedral tour and had stayed on under the attraction of the place taking the duty for a few sundays  the weather was very sultry forbidding exertion on the part of all save cricketers but there was a match at redford and kenminster was eager about it so that all the boys grown up or otherwise walked over to see it accompanied by nita ray with her inseparable janet meaning to study village groups and rustic sports  the other ladies walked in the cool to meet them at the actons farmhouse chiefly it was alleged in deference to the feelings of the bride who could not brave the heat but had never yet been so long separated from her bridegroom  the little boys however were alone to be found at the farm reporting that their elders had joined the cricket supper  so mrs acton made them welcome and spread her cloth in the greensward whence could be seen the evening glow on the harvest fields  then there was a feast of cherries and delicious farmhouse bread and butter and inexhaustible tea which was renewed when the cricketers joined them and called for their share  thus they did not set out on their homeward walk over fragrant heath and dewy lanes till just as the stars were coming out and a magnificent red moon scarcely past the full was rising in the east and the long rest and fresh dewiness after the days heat gave a delightful feeling of exhilaration  babie went skipping about in the silvery flood of light quite wild with delight as they came out on the heath and darting up to mr ogilvie asked if now he did not think they might really see a fairy  perhaps i do he said  oh where where show me  ah youre the one that cant see her  what not if i did my eyes with that euphrasia and verbena officinalis catching tight hold of his hand as a bright red light went rapidly moving in a straight line in the valley beneath their feet  robin goodfellow said mr hughes overhearing her and immediately began to sing—             i know a bank—   then the curate as he finished began to sing some other appropriate song and nita ray and others joined in  it was very pretty very charming in the moonlight very like midsummer nights dream but mary ogilvie who was a good way behind felt a start of dismay as the clear notes pealed back to her  she longed to suggest a little expediency but she was impeded for poor miss ray entirely unused to long country walks and nocturnal expeditions and further tormented by tight boots was panting up the hill far in the rear halffrightened and a good deal distressed and could not for very humanitys sake be left behind  and after all thought mary as peals of the boys merry laughter came to her and then again echoes of spotted snakes with double tongue awoke the night echoes this is such a solitary place that it cannot signify if they will only have the sense to stop when we get into the roads  but they hadnt  mary heard a chorus from der freischutz beginning just as she was dragging her companion over a stile which had been formidable enough by day but was ten times worse in the confusing shadows  that brought them into a lane darkened by its high hedges where there was nothing for it but to let miss ray tightly grapple her arm while the songs came further and further on the wind and mary felt the conviction that middleaged spinsters must reckon on being forgotten and left behind alike by brothers sisters and friends  nor did they come up with the party till they found them waiting in the road close to the rays lodgings having evidently just missed them for mr ogilvie and the clergyman were turning back to look for them when they were gladly hailed half apologised to half laughed at by a babel of voices among which nitas was the loudest informing her sister that she had lost the best bit of all for just at the turn of the lane there had come on them babies fieryeyed monster which had burst on the path when they were in mid song flashing over them and revealing first a horse and then a brougham wherein there sat the august forms of colonel and mrs brownlow going home from a state dinner the ladys very marabouts quivering with horror  mary stepped up to nita and gave her a sharp severe grasp  hush remember their boys are here she whispered and with an exaggerated gesture nita looked about her in affected alarm and seeing that none were near added—  thank you i was just going to say it would be a study for punch  o do send it up theyll never know it cried janet but there caroline interfered—  hush janet we ought to be at home  dont stand here armine is tired to death  115 at the station tomorrow  goodnight  they parted and mary and her brother turned away to their own home if it had not been for the presence of the curate mary would have said a good deal on the way home  as it was she was so silent as to inspire her brother with enough compunction for having deserted her to make him follow her when she went to her own room  mary i am sorry we missed you he said i ought to have looked about for you more but i thought—  nonsense david of course i do not mind that if only i could have stopped all that singing  that singing why it was very pretty wasnt it  pretty indeed  did it never occur to you what a scrape you may be getting that poor little thing into with her relations and yourself too  david looked more than halfamused and she proceeded more resolutely—  well what do you think must be mrs brownlows opinion of what she saw and heard tonight  i blame myself exceedingly for not having urged the setting off sooner but you must remember that what is all very well for holiday people only here for a time may do infinite mischief to residents  david only observed i didnt want all those men if thats what you mean  they made the noise not i  no nor i but we swelled the party and i am much disposed to believe that the best thing we can do is to take ourselves off or do anything to break up this set  he looked for a moment much disconcerted but then with a little masculine superiority answered—  well well well think over it mary  see how it appears to you tomorrow when you arent tired and then with a smile and a kiss bade her goodnight  so thats what we get said mary to herself half amused half annoyed those men think it is all because one is left behind in the dark  david is the best boy in the world but theres not a man of them all who has a notion of what gets a woman into trouble  i believe he was rather gratified than otherwise to be found out on a lark  well ill talk to clara she will have some sense  they were all to meet at the station the next morning to go to an old castle about an hour from kenminster by railway and they filled the platform armed with sketching tools sandwich baskets botanical tins and all other appliances but when mr ogilvie accosted mrs joseph brownlow saying you have only half your boys she looked up with a drolly guilty air saying no theres an embargo on the other poor fellows  they had just taken their seats and the train was in motion when a heated headlong boy came dashing over the platform and clung to the door of the carriage standing on the step  it was johnny  orlando hughes who was next the window grasped his hands and in answer to the cries of dismay and blame that greeted him he called out yes here i am rob and joe couldnt run so fast  then youve got leave asked his aunt  johnnys grin said no  she looked up at mr ogilvie in much vexation and anxiety  dont say any more to him now  it might put him in great danger wait till the next station he said  it was a stopping train and ten minutes brought a halt when the guard came up in a fury and johnny found no sympathy for his bold attempt  carey had no notion of fostering flat disobedience and she told johnny that unless he would promise to go home by himself and beg his fathers pardon she should stay behind and go back with him for she could have no pleasure in an expedition with him when he was behaving so outrageously  the boy looked both surprised and abashed  his affection for his aunt was very great as for one who had opened to him the gates of a new world both within himself and beyond himself  he would not hear of her giving up the expedition and promised her with all his heart to walk home and confess though twasnt papa but mamma were his last words as they left him on the platform crestfallen but with a twinkle in his eye and with the stationmaster keeping watch over him as a dangerous subject  mr ogilvie said it would do the boy good for life caroline mourned over him a little and wondered how his mother would treat him and mary sat and thought till the arrival at their destination when they had to walk to the castle dragging their appurtenances and then to rouse their energies to spread out the luncheon  then when there had been the usual amount of mirth mischief and mishap and the party had dispersed some to sketch some to scramble some to botanize the duck and drake to spoon—as said the boys mary ogilvie found a turfy nook where she could hold council with mrs acton about their poor little friend for whose welfare she was seriously uneasy  but clara did not sympathise as much as she expected having been much galled by mrs robert brownlows supercilious manner and thinking the attempt to conciliate her both unworthy and useless  of course i do not mean that poor carey should truckle to her said mary rather nettled at the implication but i dont think these irregular hours and all this roaming about the country at all times can be well in themselves for her or the children  my dear mary did you never take a party of children into the country in the spring for the first time  if not you never saw the prettiest and most innocent of intoxications  i had once to take the little pyrtons to their place in the country one april and may months that they had always spent in london and i assure you they were perfectly mad only with the air the sight of the hawthorns and all the smells  i was obliged to be content with what they could do not what ought to be done of lessons  there was no sitting still on a fine morning  i was as bad myself the blood seemed to dance in ones veins and a room to be a prison  this is not spring said mary  no but she began in spring and habits were formed  no doubt but they cannot be good  they keep up flightiness and excitability  oh thats grief poor dear  we baint carousing we be dissembling grief as the farmer told the clergyman who objected to merrymaking after a funeral said mary rather severely  then she added seeing clara looked annoyed you think me hard on poor dear carey but indeed i am not doubting her affection or her grief  remember a woman with children cannot give herself entirely up to sorrow without doing them harm  poor carey i am sure i do not want to see her given up to sorrow only to have her a little more moderate and perhaps select—so as not to do herself harm with her relations—who after all must be more important to her than any outsiders  the artists wife could not but see things a little differently from the schoolmasters sister who moreover knew nothing of careys former life and clara made answer—  sending her down to these people was the greatest error of dear good dr brownlows life  i am not sure of that  blood is thicker than water  but between sistersinlaw it is apt to be only illblood and very turbid  for shame clara  well mary you must allow something for human natures reluctance to be treated as something not quite worthy of a handshake from a little country town serene highness  i may be allowed to doubt whether dr brownlow would not have done better to leave her unbound to those who can never be congenial  granting that not that i do grant it for the colonel is worthy should not she be persuaded to conform herself  to purr and lay eggs  my dear that did not succeed with the ugly duckling even in early life  not after it had been among the swans  you vain clara  i only lay claim to having seen the swans—not to having brought many specimens down here  such as that nita or mr hughes  more like the other bird certainly said clara smiling but mary if you had but seen what that house was  joe brownlow was one of those men who make themselves esteemed and noted above their actual position  he was much thought of as a lecturer and would have had a much larger practice but for his appointment at the hospital  it was in the course of the work he had taken for a friend gone out of town that he caught the illness that killed him  his lectures brought men of science about him and his practice had made him acquainted with us poor bohemians as you seem to think us  old mrs brownlow had means of her own and theirs was quite a wealthy house among our set  any of us were welcome to drop into five oclock tea or at nine at night and the pleasantness and good influence were wonderful  the motherliness and yet the enthusiasm of mrs brownlow made her the most delightful old lady i ever saw  i cant describe how good she was about my marriage and many more would say they owed all that was brightest and best in them to that house  and there was carey like a little sunshiny fairy the darling of everyone  no not spoilt—i see what you are going to say  only as we all spoilt her at school  nobody but her serene highness ever could help making a pet of her  thats more reasonable mary said mrs acton in a more placable voice she did plenty of hard work and did not spare herself or have what would seem indulgences to most women but nobody could see the light of her eyes and smile without trying to make it sparkle up and she was just the first thought in life to her husband and his mother  i am sure in my governess days i used to think that house paradise and her the undoubted queen of it  and now that you should turn against her mary when she is uncrowned and unappreciated and browbeaten  she had worked herself up and had tears in her eyes  mary laughed a little  it is hard when i only want to keep her from making herself be unappreciated  and i say it is in vain cried clara for it is not in the nature of the people to appreciate her and nothing will make them get on together  poor mary she had expected her friend to be more reasonable and less defensive but she remembered that even at school clara had always protected caroline whenever she had attempted to lecture her  all she further tried to say was—  then you wont help me to advise her to be more guarded and not shock them  i will not tease the poor little thing when she has enough to torment her already  if you had known her husband and watched her last winter you would be only too thankful to see her a little more like herself  mary was silent finding that she should only argue round and round if they went on and feeling that clara thought her oldmaidish and could not enter into her sense that the balanceweight being gone gusts of wind ought to be avoided  she sat wondering whether she herself was prim and oldmaidish or whether she was right in feeling it a duty to expostulate and deliver her testimony  there was no doing it on this day  carey was always surrounded by children and guests and in an eager state of activity but though again they all went home in the cool of the evening an attempt to sing in the secondclass carriage which they filled entirely was quashed immediately—no one knew how and nothing worse happened than that a very dusty set carrying odd botanical entomological and artistic wares trailed through the streets of kenminster just as mrs coffinkey escorted by her maid was walking primly home from drinking tea at the vicarage  still marys reflections only strengthened her resolution  on the next day which was sunday she ascended to the folly at about four oclock in the afternoon and found the family including the parrot spread out upon the lawn under the shade of the acacia the mother reading to them  oh please dont stop mother cried babie while the more courteous armine exclaimed—  miss ogilvie dont you like to hear about bevis and jocelin joliffe  you dont mind waiting while we finish the chapter added their mother then we break up our sitting  pray go on with the chapter said mary rather coolly for she was a good deal taken aback at finding them reading woodstock on a sunday but afterwards i do want to speak to you  oh dont want to speak to me  the colonel has been speaking to me she said with a cowering shuddering sort of action irresistibly comic  and he ate up half our day bemoaned more than one of the boys  miss ogilvie sat down a little way off not wishing to listen to woodstock on a sunday and trying to work out the difficult sabbatarian question in her mind  there said caroline closing the book amid exclamations of i know who lewis kerneguy was  wasnt roger wildrake jolly  o mother didnt he cut off trusty tomkins head  do let us have a wee bit more mother miss ogilvie wont mind  but carey saw that she did mind and answered—  not now there wont be time to feed all the creatures or to get nurses sunday nosegays if you dont begin  then coming up to her guest she said now is your time mary we shall have the rays and mr hughes in presently but you see we are too worldly and profane for the kencroft boys on sunday and so they make experiments in smoking with company less desirable i must say than sir harry lees  am i very bad to read what keeps mine round me  is it an old fashion with you  well no but then we had what was better than a thousand stories and this is only a feeble attempt to keep up a little watery reflection of the old sunshine  it was a watery reflection indeed  and could it not be with something that would be—  dull and goody put in carey  no no my dear that would be utterly futile  you cant catch my birds without salt  can we polly  to which the popinjay responded we are all mother careys chickens  i did mean salt—very real salt said mary rather sadly  i have not got the recipe said carey  indeed i do try to do what must be done  my boys can hold their own in bible and catechism questions  ask your brother if they cant  and army is a dear little fellow with a bit of the angel or of his father in him but when weve done our church i see no good in decorous boredom and if i did what would become of the boys  i dont agree to the necessity of boredom said mary but let that pass  there are things i wanted to say  i knew it was coming  the colonel has been at me already levelling his thunders at my devoted head  wont that do  not if you heed him so little  my dear if i heeded i should be annihilated  when he says my good little sister i know he means you little idiot so if i did not think of something else what might not be the consequence  why he said i was not behaving decently  no more you are  and that i had no proper feeling continued she laughing almost hysterically  no one can wonder at his being pained  it ought never to have happened  are you gone over to mrs grundy  however theres this comfort youll not mention mrs coffinkeys sisterinlaw  im sure the colonel didnt  ellen does though with tragic effect  you are not like yourself carey  no indeed im not  i was a happy creature a little while ago or was it a very long long time ago  then i had everybody to help me and make much of me  and now ive got into a great dull mist and am always knocking my head against something or somebody and when i try to keep up the old friendships and kindnesses—poor little fragments as they are—everybody falls upon me even you mary  pardon me dearest  some friendships and kindnesses that were once admirable may be less suitable to your present circumstances  as if i didnt know that said carey with an angry hurt little laugh and so i waited to be chaperoned up to the eyes between clara acton and the duck in the very house with me  now mary i put it to you  has one word passed that could do harm  isnt it much more innocent than all the coffinkey gossip  i have no doubt mrs coffinkeys sisterinlaw looks up from her blackbordered pocket handkerchief to hear how mrs brownlows sisterinlaw went to the cricketmatch  do you know robert really thought i had been there i only wonder how many i scored  i dare say mrs coffinkeys sister inlaw knows  it just shows how careful you should be  and i wonder what would become of the children if i shut myself up with a pile of pockethandkerchiefs bordered an inch deep  what right have they to meddle with my ways and my friends and my boys  not the coffinkeys certainly said mary but indeed carey i myself was uncomfortable at that singing in the lanes at eleven at night  it wasnt eleven said carey perversely  only 1050—eh  but what was the possible harm in it  none at all in itself only remember the harm it may do to the children for you to be heedless of peoples opinion and to get a reputation for flightiness and doing odd things  i couldnt be like the coffinkey pattern any more than i could be tied down to a rope walk  but you need not do things that your better sense must tell you may be misconstrued  surely there was a wish that you should live near the colonel and be guided by him  little knowing that his guidance would consist in being set at me by ellen and the coffinkeys  nonsense said mary vexed enough to resume their old schoolgirl manners  you know i am not set on by anybody and i tell you that if you do not pull up in time and give no foundation for illnatured comments your children will never get over it in peoples estimation  and as for themselves a little steadiness and regularity would be much better for their whole dispositions  it is holiday time said carey in a tone of apology  if it is only in holiday time—  the country has always seemed like holiday  you see we used to go— all of us—to some seaside place and be quite free there keeping no particular hours and being so intensely happy  i havent yet got over the feeling that it is only for a time and we shall go back into the dear old home and its regular ways  then clasping her hands over her side as though to squeeze something back she broke out o mary mary you mustnt scold me  you mustnt bid me tie myself to regular hours till this summer is over  if you knew the intolerable stab when i recollect that he is gone—gone—gone for ever you would understand that theres nothing for it but jumping up and doing the first thing that comes to hand  walking it down is best  oh what will become of me when the mornings get dark and i cant get up and rush into those woods  yes—as mary made some affectionate gesture—i know i have gone on in a wild way but who would not be wild who had lost him  and then they goad me and think me incapable of proper feeling and she laughed that horrid little laugh  so i am i suppose but feeling wont go as other people think proper  let me alone mary i wont damage the children  they are joes children and i know what he wanted and wished for them better than robert or anybody else  but i must go my own way and do what i can bear and as i can or—or i think my heart would break quite and that would be worse for them than anything  mary had tears in her eyes drawn forth by the vehement passion of grief apparent in the whole tone of her poor little friend  she had no doubts of careys love sorrow or ability but she did seriously doubt of her wisdom and judgment and thought her undisciplined however she could say no more for nita ray and janet were advancing on them  the next day caroline was in bed with one of her worst headaches mary felt that she had been a cruel and prim old duenna and meekly bore claras reproachful glances     chapter x  ellens magnum bonums    he put in his thumb and he pulled out a plum and cried what a good boy am i                             jack horner   whether it were from the effects of the warnings or from that of native good sense from that time forward mrs joseph brownlow sobered down and became less distressing to her sisterinlaw mary carried off her brother to wales and the acton and ray party dispersed while dr and mrs lucas came for a week giving much relief to mrs brownlow who could discuss the family affairs with them in a manner she deemed unbecoming with mrs acton or miss ogilvie  had caroline heard the consultation she would have acquitted ellen of malice and indeed her serene highness was much too good to gossip about so near a connection and had only confided her wonder and perplexity at the strange phenomenon to her favourite first cousin who unfortunately was not equally discreet  with the end of the holidays finished also the trying series of first anniversaries and their first excitements of sorrow so that it became possible to be more calm and quiet  moreover two correctives came of themselves to caroline  the first was janets inordinate correspondence with nita ray and the discovery that the girl held herself engaged to stay with the sisters in november  without asking me she exclaimed aghast  i thought you heard us talking said janet so carelessly that her mother put on her dignity  i certainly had no conception of an invitation being given and accepted without reference to me  come now mother carey said this modern daughter dont be cross  we really didnt know you werent attending  if i had i should have said it was impossible as i say now  you can never have thought over the matter  havent i  when i am doing no good here only wasting time  that is my fault  we will set to work at once steadily  but my classes and my lectures  you are not so far on but that our reading together will teach you quite as much as lectures  janet looked both sulky and scornful and her mother continued—  it is not as if we had not modern books and i think i know how to read them so as to be useful to you  i dont like getting behindhand with the world  you cant keep up even with the world without a sound foundation besides even if it were more desirable the rays cannot afford to keep you nor i to board you there  i am to pay them by helping miss ray in her copying  poor miss ray exclaimed carey laughing  does she know your handwriting  you do not know what i can do said janet with dignity  yes i hope to see it for myself for you must put this notion of going to london out of your head  i am sure miss ray did not give the invitation—no nor second it  did she janet  janet blushed a little and muttered something about miss ray being afraid of stuckup people  i thought so  she is a good sensible person whom grandmamma esteemed very much but she has never been able to keep her sister in order and as to trusting you to their care or letting you live in their set neither papa nor grandmamma would ever have thought of it  you only say so because her serene highness turns up her nose at everything artistic and original  janet you forget yourself caroline exclaimed in a tone which quelled the girl who went muttering away and no more was ever heard of the ray proposal which no doubt the elder sister at least had never regarded as anything but an airy castle  however caroline was convinced that the warnings against the intimacy had not been so uncalled for as she had believed for she found when she tried to tighten the reins that her daughter was restive and had come to think herself a free agent as good as grown up  spirit was not however lacking to caroline and when she had roused herself she made janet understand that she was not to be disregarded or disobeyed  regular hours were instituted and the difficulty of getting broken into them again was sufficient proof to her that she had done wrong in neglecting them  armine yawned portentously and declared that he could not learn except at his own times and babie was absolutely naughty more than once when her mother suffered doubly in punishing her from the knowledge of whose fault it was  however they were good little things and it was not hard to reestablish discipline with them  after a little breaking in babie gave it to her dolls as her deliberate opinion that wegulawity settles ones mind  one knows when to do what  janet could not well complain of the regularity in itself though she did cavil at the actual arrangements and they were altered all round to please her and she showed a certain contempt for her teacher in the studies she resumed with her mother but after the dictionary encyclopaedia and other authorities including mr ogilvie proved almost uniformly to be against her whenever there was a difference of opinion she had sense enough to perceive that she could still learn something at home  moreover after one or two of these references mr ogilvie offered to look over her latin and greek exercises and hear her construe on his saturday halfholidays declaring that it would be quite a refreshment  caroline was shocked at the sacrifice but she could not bear to affront her daughter so she consented but as she thought janet was not old enough to need a chaperon and as her boys did want her she was hardly ever present at the lessons  moreover mr ogilvie had a lecturer from london to give weekly lectures on physical science to his boys and opened the doors to ladies  this was a great satisfaction chiefly for the sake of bobus and jock but also for janets and her mothers  the difficulty was to beat up for ladies enough to keep one another in countenance but happily two families in the country and one bright little bride in the town were found glad to open their ears so that ellen had no just cause of disapproval of the attendance of her sister and niece  ellen had more cause to sigh when michaelmas came and for the first time taught poor carey what money matters really meant  throughout her married life her only stewardship had concerned her own dress and the childrens mrs brownlows occasional plans of teaching her housekeeping had always fallen through janet being always her grandmammas deputy  thus janet and nurse had succeeded to the management when poor carey was too ill and wretched to attend to it and it had gone on in their hands at the pagoda  janet was pleased to be respected accordingly by her aunt who always liked her the best in spite of her much worse behaviour for were not her virtues her own and her vices her mothers  caroline had paid the weekly books and asked no questions until the winding up of the executors business and the quarterly settlement of accounts made startling revelations that the balance at her bankers was just eleven shillings and fourpence halfpenny and what was nearly as bad the discovery was made in the presence of her fellow executor who could not help giving a low whistle  she turned pale and gasped for breath in absolute amazement for she was quite sure they were living at much less expense than in london and there had been no outgoings worth mentioning for dress or journeys  what were they to do  surely they could not live upon less  was it her fault  she was so much distressed that the goodnatured colonel pitied her and answered kindly—  my good little sister you were inexperienced  you will do better another year  but theres nothing to go on upon  he reminded her of the rent for the london house and the dividends that must soon come in  then it will be as bad as ever  how can we live more cheaply than we do  ellen is an excellent manager and you had better consult her on the scale of your expenditure  carolines spirit writhed but before she had time to say anything or talk to janet the colonel had heard his excellent housewifes voice and called her into the council  she was as good as possible too serenely kind to manifest surprise or elation at the fulfilment of her forebodings  to be convicted of want of economy would have been so dreadful and disgraceful that she deeply felt for poor caroline and dealt with her tenderly and delicately even when the weekly household books were opened and disclosed how much had been spent every week in items the head and front of which were oft repeated in old nurses selftaught writing—            man             glas of beare   1d            creme                       3d  for had not the colonels wife warned against the endless hospitality of glasses of beer to all messengers and had not unlimited cream with strawberries and appletarts been treated as a kind of spontaneous luxury produced at the belforest farm agents  to these and many other small matters caroline was quite relieved to plead guilty and to promise to do her best by personal supervision and ellen set herself to devise further ways of reduction not realising how hopeless it is to prescribe for another persons household difficulties  it is not in the nature of things that such advice should be palatable and the proverb about the pinching of the shoe is sure to be realised  too many servants said prudence  if old nurse must be provided for—and she ought to have saved enough to do without—it would be much better to pension her off or get her into an almshouse  caroline tried to endure as she made known that she viewed nurse as a sacred charge about whom there must be no question  ellen quietly said—  then it is no use to argue but she must be allowed no more discretion in the housekeeping  no i shall do that myself said caroline  an extravagant cook  that may be my fault  i will try to judge of that  irregular hours  they shall end with the holidays  there was still another maid whom ellen said was only kept to wait on nurse but who caroline said did all their needlework both making and mending  that said ellen i should have thought you and janet could do i do nearly all our work with the girls help i am happy to say that jessie is an excellent needlewoman and essie and ellie can do something  i only direct the nursery maid i never trust anything to servants  i could never bear not to trust people said caroline  ellen sighed believing that she would soon be cured of that and carey added—  on true principles of economy surely it is better that emma who knows how should mend the clothes than that i should botch them up in any way when i can earn more than she costs me  earn  yes i can model and i can teach  was i not brought up to it  yes but now it is impossible  it is not a larger income that you want but proper attention to details in the spending of it as i will show you  whereupon mrs brownlow in her neat figures built up a pretty little economical scheme based on a thorough knowledge of the subject  caroline tried to follow her calculations but a dreaminess came over her she found herself saying yes without knowing what she was assenting to and while ellen was discoursing on coals and coke she was trying to decide which of her casts she could bear to offer for sale and going off into the dear old associations connected with each so that she was obliged at the end instead of giving an unqualified assent to say she would think it over and ellen who had marked her wandering eye left off with a conviction that she had wasted her breath  certainly she was not prepared for the proposal with which mother carey almost rushed into the room the next day just as she was locking up her wine and the colonel lingering over his first glance at the days times  i know what to do  miss james is not coming back  and you have not heard of any one  then if you would only let me teach your girls with mine  you know that is what i really can do  yes indeed i would be regular  i always was  you know i was robert till i came here and didnt quite know what i was about and i have been regular ever since the end of the holidays and i really can teach  my dear sister edged in the colonel as she paused for breath no one questions your ability only the fitness of—  i had thought over two things broke in caroline again  if you dont like me to have jessie and essie and ellie i would offer to prepare little boys  ive been more used to them than to girls and i know mr ogilvie would be glad  i could have the little wrights and walter leslie and three or four more directly but i thought you might like the other way better  i can see no occasion for either said ellen  you need no increase in income only to attend to details  and i had rather do what i can—than what i cant said caroline  every lady should understand how to superintend her own household said her serene highness  granted oh granted ellen  im going to superintend with all my might and main but i dont want to be my own upper servant and i know i should make no hand of it and i had much rather earn something by my wits  i can do it best in the way i was trained and you know it is what i have been used to ever since my own children were born  ellen heaved a sigh at this obtuseness towards what she viewed as the dignified and ladylike mission of the wellborn woman not to be the breadwinner but the preserver and steward of the household  here was poor little caroline so ignorant as actually to glory in having been educated for a governess  the colonel wanting to finish his times in peace looked up and said with the gracious tone he always used to his brothers wife—  my good little sister it is very praiseworthy in you to wish to exert yourself and very kind and proper to desire to begin at home but you must allow us a little time to consider  she took this as a hint to retreat and her serene highness likewise feeling it a dismissal tried at once to obviate all ungraciousness by saying we are preserving our magnum bonums caroline dear i will send you some  magnum bonum gasped caroline hearing nothing but the name do you know—  i know the recipe of course and can give you an excellent one i will come over byandby and explain it to you  caroline stood confounded  had joe revealed all to his brother was it to be treated as a domestic nostrum  then you know what the magnum bonum is she faltered  are you asking as a philosopher said the colonel amused by her tone  i dont know what you mean colonel said his wife  i offered caroline a basket of magnum bonums for preserving and one would think i had said something very extraordinary  perhaps it is my cockney ignorance said caroline beginning to breathe freely and thinking it would have been less oppressive if sua serenita would have either laughed or scolded instead of gravely leading her past the redbaize door which shut out the lower regions to the room where white armies of jampots stood marshalled and in the midst two or three baskets of big yellow plums which awoke in her a remembrance of their name and set her laughing thanking and preparing to carry home the basket  this however as she was instantly reminded was not countrytown manners  the gardener was to be sent with them and ellen herself would copy out the recipe and byandby bring it with full directions  each lady felt herself magnanimously forbearing as caroline went home to the lessons and ellen repaired to her husband on his morning inspection of his hens and chickens  poor thing she said there are great allowances to be made for her  i believe she wishes to do right  she knows how to teach rejoined the colonel  bobus is nearly at the head of the school and johnny has improved greatly since he has been so much with her  johnny was always clever said his mother  for my part i had rather see them playing at good honest games than messing about with that museum nonsense  the boys did not do half so much mischief nor destroy so many clothes before they were always running down to the pagoda  and as to this setting up a school you would never consent to have joes wife doing that  there is no real need  none at all if she only would—if she only knew how to attend to her proper duties  at the same time i should be very glad of an excuse for making her an advance enough to meet the weekly bills till her rent comes in so that she may not begin a debt  could you not send the girls to her for a few hours every day  thats not so bad as her taking pupils for nobody need know that she was paid for it said his wife considering  i dont believe it will answer or that she will ever keep to it steadily but it can hardly hurt the children to try if jessie has an eye on essie and ellie  i will not have them brought on too fast nor taught latin and all that poor little babie is learning  i am sure it is dreadful to hear that child talk  i am always expecting that she will have water on the brain  the decision which really involved a sacrifice and a certain sense of risk on the part of these good people was conveyed in a note together with a recipe for the preservation of magnum bonums and a very liberal cheque in advance for the first quarter of her three pupils stipulating that no others should be admitted that the terms should be kept secret that the hours should be regular and above all that the pupils should not be forced  caroline was touched and grateful but could hardly keep a little satire out of her promise that essie and ellie should not be too precocious  she wrote her note of thanks despatched it and then in the interest of some arithmetical problems which she was working with janet forgot everything else till a sort of gigantic buzz was heard near at hand  a sudden thought struck her and out she darted into the hall  there stood the basket in the middle of the table just where the boys were wont to look for refections of fruit or cake when they tumbled in from school  six boys and babie hovered round each in the act of devouring a goldengreen egglike plum and only two or three remained in the leaves at the bottom  oh the magnum bonums she cried and janet came rushing out in dismay at the sound standing aghast but not exclaiming  werent they for us asked bobus the first to get the stone out of his mouth  no oh no answered his mother as well as laughter would permit they are your aunts precious plums which she gave us as a great favour and i was going to be so good and learn to preserve and pickle them  oh dear  never mind mother carey mumbled her nephew johnny with his stone swelling out his cheek where it was tucked for convenience of speech ill go and get you another jolly lot more  you cant grunted robin they are all gathered  then well get them off the old tree at the bottom of the orchard where they are just as big and yellow and mamma will never know the difference  but they taste like soap  that doesnt matter  shed no more taste a magnum bonum before it is all titivated up with sugar than—than—than—  babies head with brain sauce gravely put in bobus as his cousin paused for a comparison  its a wasting of good gifts to make jam of these for jam is nothing but a vehicle for sugar  then the grocers cart is jam promptly retorted armine for i saw a sugarloaf come in one yesterday  come on then cried jock ripe for the mischief i know the tree they are just like long apricots  aunt ellen will think her plums have been all agrowing  no no boys cried his mother i cant have it done  to steal your aunts own plums to deceive her with  we always may do as we like with that tree said johnny because they are so nasty and wont keep  how nice for the preserves observed bobus  they would do just as well to hinder mother carey from catching it  no no boys i ought to catch it  it was all my fault for not putting the plums away  you wont tell of us growled robin between lips that he opened wide enough the next moment to admit one of three surviving plums  if i tell her i left them about in the boys way she will arrive at the natural conclusion  do they call those things magnum bonum asked janet as the boys drifted away  yes said her mother looking at her rather wonderingly and adding as janet coloured up to the eyes my dear have you any other association with the name  many a time janet had longed to tell all she knew now when so good an opportunity had come all was choked back by the strange leaden weight of reserve and shame in that long reserve  she opened her eyes and stared as stupidly at her mother as robin could have done feeling an utter incapacity of making any reply and caroline who had for a moment thought she understood was baffled and durst not pursue the subject for fear of betraying her own secret deciding within herself that janet might have caught up the word without understanding  they were interrupted the next minute and janet ran away feeling that she had had an escape yet wishing she had not  caroline did effectually shelter her nephews under her general term the boys and if their mother was not conciliated their fellow feeling with her was strengthened as well as their sense of honour nay johnny actually spent the next halfholiday in walking three miles and back to his old nurse whom he beguiled out of a basket of plums—hard little blue things as unlike magnum bonums as could well be but which his aunt received as they were meant as full compensation nay she took the pains to hunt up a recipe and have them well preserved in hopes of amazing his mother  it was indeed one difficulty that the two sistersinlaw had such different notions of the aim and end of economy  the income at kencroft had not increased with the family which numbered eight for there were two little boys in the nursery and it was only by diligent housewifery that mrs brownlow kept up the somewhat handsome establishment she had started with at her marriage  caroline felt that she neither could nor would have made herself such a slave to domestic details yet this was life and duty and interest to ellen where one sister would be unheeding of shabby externals so that all her children might be free and on an equality if they did not go beyond her in all enjoyments physical artistic or intellectual the other toiled to keep up appearances kept her children under restraint and in the background and made all sorts of unseen sacrifices to the supposed duty of always having a handsome dinner for whomsoever the colonel might bring in and keeping the horses carriages and servants that she thought his due  but then ellen had a husband and as caroline sighed to herself that made all the difference and she was no serene highness and had no dignity  the three girls from kencroft did actually become pupils at the folly but the beginnings were not propitious for in her new teachers eyes jessie knew nothing accurately but needed to have her foundations looked to—to practise scales draw square boxes and work the four first rules of arithmetic  simple things complained jessie to her mother that i used to do when i was no bigger than essie and yet she is always teasing one about how and why  she wanted me to tell why i carried one  have a little patience for the present my dear your papa wants to help her just at present and after this autumn we will manage for you to have some real good music lessons  but i dont like wasting time over old easy things made difficult sighed jessie  it is very tiresome my dear but your papa wishes it and you see poor thing she cant teach you more than she knows herself and while you are there i am sure it is all right with essie and ellie  she does not teach them a bit like miss james said jessie  she makes their sums into a story and their spelling lessons too  it is like a game  indeed essie and ellie were so willing to go off to their lessons every morning that their mother often thought it could not be all right and that the progress which they undoubtedly made must be by some superficial trick but as their father had so willed it she submitted to the present arrangement deciding that poor caroline was just able to teach little children  the presence of essie and ellie much assisted in bringing babie back to methodical habits nor was she in spite of her precocious intelligence too forward in the actual drill of education to be able to work with her little cousins  the incongruous elements were the two elder girls who could by no means study together since they were at the two opposite ends of the scale but as jessie was by no means aggressive being in fact as sweet and docile a shallow girl as ever lived things went on peaceably except when janet could not conceal her displeasure that bobus would not share her contempt for jessies intellect  if she told him that jessie thought that the odyssey was about a voyage to odessa and was written by alfred tennyson he only declared that anything was better than being a spiteful cat and when he came in from school and found his cousin in wild despair over the conversion of 2861 florins into halfcrowns he stood by telling her every operation and leaving her nothing to do but to write down the figures  he was reckless of janet who tried to wither them both by her scorn but jessie looked up with her honest eyes saying—  i wish you hadnt put it into my head janet for now i must rub it out and do it again and it wont be so hard now bobus has shown me how  no no jessie said bobus i wouldnt be bullied  for shame bobus said his sister how is she to learn anything in that way  and if she doesnt said bobus  thats a disgrace  a grace said provoking bobus  she is much nicer as she is than you will ever be  dont talk such nonsense said janet with an elder sisterly air it is not kind to encourage jessie to think anyone can care for an emptyheaded doll  emptyheaded dolls are all the go said bobus  never mind jessie a girls business is to be pretty and goodhumoured not to stuff herself with latin and greek  you should leave that to us poor beggars  yes i know thats all your envy and jealousy retorted janet  all the time jessie stood by plump gentle and pretty though with a certain cloud of perplexity on her white open brow and as her aunt returned into the room she said—  i think my sum is right now aunt caroline but bobus helped me must i do it over again  you shall begin with it tomorrow my dear said her aunt then i daresay it will go off easily  jessie thanked with an effusion of gratitude which made her prettier than ever and then was claimed by bobus to help him in the making of some paper bags that he needed for some of his curiosities  janet liked to fancy that it was beauty versus genius that made jessie the greater favourite  she had not taken into account that she was always too much engrossed with her own concerns to be helpful while jessies pretty dexterous hands were always at everyones service and without in the least entering into the cause of science she was invaluable in the museum whenever her ideas of neatness and symmetry were not in too absolute opposition to the requirements of system  the two little ones essie and ellie were equally graceful or indeed still more so as being still in their kittenhood and their attitudes were so charming as to revive their aunts artistic instincts  all the earlier part of the year when her time was her own it had been mere wretchedness and heartsickness to think of the art which had given her husband so much pleasure and but for allen the studio would never have been arranged  but no sooner was her time engrossed than the artist fever awoke in her and all the time she could steal by early rising or on wet afternoons and birthday holidays was devoted to her clay  before the end of the autumn she had sent up to mr acton some lovely little groups of children illustrating wordsworths poems  she had been taught anatomy enough to make her work superior to that of most women and mr acton found no difficulty in disposing of them to a porcelain manufactory to be copied in parian bringing in a sum that made her feel rich  vistas opened before her sanguine eyes of that clay educating her son for the magnum bonum her great thought  her boys must be brought up to be worthy of the quest highminded disinterested and devoted as well as intellectual and religious  so said their father and thus the magnum bonum had become very nearly a religion to her giving her a definite aim and principle  unfortunately there was not much in her present surroundings to lead her higher  the vicar mr rigby was a dull weak man of a worn out type a careful visitor of the sick and poor but taking little heed to the educated except as subscribers and sundayschool teachers  carey had done little in the first capacity janet had refused to act in the latter  his sermons were very sleepy performances except for a tendency to jumble up metaphors that kept the audience from the folly just awake enough to watch for them  the hearer was proud who could repeat by heart such phrases as let us not beloved brethren as gaudy insects flutter out lifes little day bound to the chariot wheels of vanity whirling in the vortex of dissipation until at length we lie moaning over the bitter dregs of the intoxicating draught  some of these became household proverbs at the folly under the title of rigdum funnidoses and might well be an extreme distress to the good reverent and dutiful jessie  mrs rigby was an inferior woman a sworn member of the coffinkey clique admiring and looking up to her serene highness as the great lady of the place and wearing an almost abject manner when receiving good counsels from her  neither of them commanded respect nor were they likely to change the belief which prevailed at the folly that all ability resided among the london clergy     chapter xi  undine    lithest gaudiest harlequin prettiest tumbler ever seen light of heart and light of limb                            wordsworth   long walks continued to be almost a necessity to mrs joseph brownlow even when comparatively sobered down and there were few days on which she was not to be met a mile or two from kenminster attended by a train of boys larger or smaller according to the demands of the school for work or play  the winter was of the description least favourable to collective boyish sports as there was no snow and very little frost  the christmas holidays led to more walking than ever  the gravelled roads of belforest were never impassable even in moist weather and even the penetralia of the place had been laid open to the brownlows in consequence of a friendship which the two johns had established with alfred richards the agents son  they had brought him in to see the museum and he had proved so nice and intelligent a lad that mother carey to the great scandal of her serene highness allowed jock to ask him to partake of a birthday feast  when allen came home at christmas he introduced stilt walking and the coffinkey world had the pleasure of communicating to one another that mrs folly brownlow had been seen with all her boys walking on stilts and of course in the next stage mrs folly brownlow herself was said to have been walking on stilts with all her boys a libel which caused mrs robert brownlow much pain and trouble in the contradiction  poor caroline walking seemed to be necessary to her health and she was out a great deal but always walking along in the lanes on foot with her little girls—yes i assure you always on foot  it was thus that caroline with babie and armine was descending a hill on the other side of belforest park fully employed in picking the way through the mud from stone to stone when a cry of dismay came to them from a distance and whilst they were still struggling towards a gate which broke the line of the high hedge the two johns came back at speed crying—mother mother carey come quick heres allen had a spill—came down on his shoulder—his stilt went into a hole and he went right over they think he must have broken something he howls so when they touch him  feeling her limbs and breath inadequate to bear her on as fast as her spirit flew forward caroline dashed through the slippery mud far too swiftly for poor little babie to keep up with her leaving one boy to take care of the little ones while the other acted as her guide down the long steep lane  she was unable to see over the hedges till she came through a gate into a meadow where jock looked about rubbed his eyes and exclaimed—hallo where are they pointing to the place where allen had fallen but whence he seemed to have been spirited away like sir piercie shafton  however rob and joe came running out of a farmyard at a little distance with tidings that allen had been taken in there and replying to her breathless question that they could not tell how much he was hurt  a fine looking whitehaired farmer met her next saying—your young gentleman is not very seriously hurt maam  i think a dislocation of the shoulder is the extent of the injury  he is feeling rather faint but you must not be alarmed  it was spoken with a kind courtesy that gave her confidence and the old man led her to the parlour where his daughterinlaw a gentle looking person was most kindly attending on allen who lay on the sofa exceedingly white and in much pain but able to smile at his mother and assure her that he should soon be all right  had they sent for a surgeon  no but they had sent for a bonesetter who would be there in a minute  the old farmer explained that it would be two hours at the least before a surgeon could be fetched from kenminster while higg the blacksmith who lived close at hand was better for man and beast than any surgeon he had known and his son had instantly set out to fetch him  as the mother doubtfully asked of his fitness instances were quoted of his success  the family had a gift inherited and kept up from time immemorial and the farmers wife declared that he was as tender as possible she had seen him operate on a neighbours child and should not be afraid to trust him with one of her own  the mans voice was heard they went out to speak to him and caroline was left with her boy  what do you think ali my dear she said kneeling by him i have often heard dear papa speak of the wonderful instinct of those bone setting families  id have nothing to do with a humbugging quack put in bobus  he may humbug as much as he likes if hell only get me out of this pain said poor allen  he will only make it ever so much worse and then youll have to have it done over again croaked bobus  that is not the way to talk of it bobus said his mother  i know a dislocated shoulder does not require any great skill and that promptness is of greater use than knowledge in such a case  well if you like to encourage abominable humbug and have allen lamed for life i dont said bobus  i shant stay in the house with the blackguard  he stalked out of the room with great loftiness of demeanour just as the operator was being introduced—a tall sinewy man with one of those strong yet meek faces often to be found among the peasantry he came in after the old farmer pulling his forelock to the lady and waiting for orders as if he had been sent for to mend the grate but caroline saw in a moment that he was a man to trust in and that his hands were not only clean but were wellformed and powerful with a great air of dexterity  i am afraid my boys arm is put out she said trembling a good deal  yes maam  and—and said she feeling sick and more desolate and left to her own judgment than ever before  can you undertake to push it in again  please god maam higg said gravely coming nearer for examination  allen shrank and shuddered  wont it hurt awfully he asked  well sir it wont just be a bed of roses but it wont last not long if you sets your will to it  he asked for various needments and while he was inspecting them allens courage began to fail and he breathed out whispers that the man was rougher and more ignorant than he expected and they had better wait and send to kenminster for a doctor but those who thought caroline helpless and childish would have been amazed at the gentle resolution with which she refused to listen to his falterings and braced him to endure knowing well that her husband had said that skill was hardly needed in such a case only resolution  she would not let herself be taken out of the room and indeed never thought of herself only of allen whose other hand she held and to whom she seemed to give patience and courage  when all was well over there was a hospitable invitation to the patient to remain till he was fit to return and an extension of the invitation to his mother but with promises of every care if she must leave him and this she was forced to decide on doing as such a household as hers could not well spare her especially on a saturday evening and she also saw that the inconvenience to her hosts would have been great  allen was so much relieved that she had no fear of leaving him to these kind people to whom she had taken a great fancy  i shall learn the habits of the genuine species british farmer said he as his mother kissed him and declared him the best and most conformable of boys  old mr gould would not be denied driving her home in his gig and when she thought about it she found she had a strange relaxed aching of the knees which made her glad of kindness for herself and the little ones  in the fine old kitchen she found that armine had had an overpowering fit of crying which had been kindly soothed by motherly mrs gould and the whole party were partaking of a luxurious tea enlivened by mince pies and rosycheeked apples which had diverted his attention to the problem why the next years prosperity should depend on the number of mince pies consumed before christmas  bobus was not among them having marched off in his contempt of the bonesetter and his mother was not without fears that he might bring a real surgeon down on her at any moment so she quickly drank off her cup of tea and took her seat in farmer goulds gig with babie as bodkin in front and joe and armine in the little seat behind  robin and the two johns were to stilt themselves home while she was taken so long and rugged a way that at every jolt she was ready to renew her thanks for sparing it to her sons shoulder and they were at home before her  the whole family came pouring out to meet her and the colonel made warm acknowledgments of the farmers kindness speaking of him when he was gone as one of the most estimable men in the neighbourhood staunch in his politics and very illused by old barnes of belforest  caroline looked anxiously for bobus and janet who had stayed at home to finish some papers for her essay society said that he had only hurried in to tell her and take off his stilts and had then gone down to dr leslies  then has dr leslie gone  we did not meet him but he may have gone through belforest exclaimed caroline  o no he has not gone he would not when he heard about that higg said janet with uneasy and much disgusted face  he couldnt do any good after his meddling  do you mean that he said so asked carey much alarmed  never mind said the colonel you did quite right caroline whatever the doctor says  any man of sense with good strong hands can manage a shoulder like that and i should have thought leslie had sense to see it but those professional men cant stand outsiders  where is bobus asked caroline i should like to distinguish between what dr leslie said to him and what he told janet  he might be more zealous for dr leslie than dr leslie for himself  bobus was unearthed and by much pumping was made to allow that dr leslie had told him that there was nothing more to be done and that his brother was quite safe in higgs hands but bobus evidently did not believe it  he kept silence while his uncle remained but he had hunted up his fathers surgical books and went on about humeral clavicles and ligatures all the evening till his mother felt sick in the nervous contemplation of possibilities though her better sense was secure that she had done right while janet was moodily silent and angered with her in the belief that she had weakly let allen be injured for life and bobus seemed as if he had rather it should be so than that he should be wrong and higgs native endowments turn out a reality  caroline abstained from looking at the book herself partly because she thought she might only alarm herself the more without confuting bobus and partly because she knew that the old law which forbade janet to meddle with the medical books would be considered as abrogated if she touched them herself  both she and janet were much more anxious than they confessed except by the looks which betrayed their broken rest the next morning  each was bent on walking to river hollow and they would fain have done so immediately after breakfast but to take the whole tribe was impossible and to let them go to church without her would infallibly lead to jocks getting into a scrape with his relatives if not with the whole congregation  was it not all her eyes could do to hinder palpable smiles in the sermon and her monkey from playing tricks on his bear who by some fatality always sat in front with his irresistible broad back down which in spite of all her vigilance jock had once thrust a large bluebottle fly  she also knew that both her husband and his mother would have thought she ought to go to church and that if matters went amiss with her boy she should reproach herself with the omission  her children too influenced her though very oppositely for janet was found preparing to start for river hollow and on being told that she must wait to go with her mother till after church declared defiantly that she saw no sense in staying at home to hear rigdum when she did not know how ill allen might be  you would not have said that to grandmamma said carey  well if you like to go to church you can  i can go alone  no i will not have you take that long walk alone  then i will take one of the boys  no janet i mean to be obeyed  go and put on your other hat and do not make us late for church  janet was forced to submit for she never came to the point of actual disobedience to her mother  carolines ruffled feelings were soothed by little armine who ran in from feeding his rabbits to ask to have the place in his prayerbook shown to him where he should pray for poor allen  she marked the litany sentence for him and meant to have thrown her own heart into it but when the moment came her mind was far astray building vague castles about her boys  still she felt as if her church going had its reward for dr leslie met her a little way outside the porch and after asking after her boy said—  i hope his brother explained to you that higg is quite to be trusted  he always knows what he can do and when a case is beyond him  if i had come there would have been nothing for me to do  there said jock triumphantly to his brother and sister  much you know about it grunted bobus  mother carey was right  she always is persisted jock  it would have been just the same if the man had known nothing about it said janet  i hate your irregular practitioners and it was very weak in mother to encourage them  then as bobus snarled at the censure of his mother—you said so yourself yesterday  i didnt say any such beastly thing of mother  she could tell whether it was just a simple dislocation and she was right having ever so much more sense than you janet  you didnt say so yesterday repeated janet  i dont like irregular practitioners a bit better than you do janet said bobus with dignity and i thought it right to call in a qualified surgeon but i never said mother couldnt judge  however bobus would not countenance the irregular practitioner by escorting his mother to river hollow and as he was in one of the surly moods in which he was dangerous to any one who meddled with him especially janet his mother was glad not to have to keep the peace between them  janet though not in the most amiable mood chose to go with her and they set forth by the shorter way across belforest park skirting the gardens where the statues stood up looking shivery and forlorn as if they were not suited to english winters and the huge house looked down on them like a london terrace that had lost its way with a dreary uninhabited air about it  even by this private way they had two miles and a half of park to traverse before they reached a heavy miry lane where the beds of mud alternated with rugged masses of stone intended to choke them  it led up between high hedges to the brow of one of the many hills of the county whence they could look down into the hollow a perfect cup scooped out as it were between the hills that closed it in except at the outlet of the river that intersected it making the meadow on either side emerald green even in the winter  corn lands of rich red soil pasture fields dotted with cattle and broad belts of copse wood between clothed the slopes and a picturesque wooden bridge with a double handrail crossed the river  the farmhouse built of creamy stone stood on the opposite side of the river some way above the bank and the mother and daughter agreed that it deserved to be sketched next summer  they had to pick their way down a lane that was almost a torrent and emerging at the foot of the bridge they stood still in amazement for in the very centre was something vibrating rapidly surrounded by a perfect halo of gold and scarlet  it was like a gigantic humming bird moth at first but it presently resolved itself into a little girl clad in something dark purple below and above with a bright scarlet cloaklet which flew out and streamed back beneath the floating locks of glistening gold that glinted in the sun as with a hand on each rail of the bridge she swung herself backwards and forwards with the most bewildering rapidity  suddenly becoming aware of the approach of strangers she stood for one moment gazing in astonishment then fled so swiftly that she almost seemed to fly and vanished in the farm buildings  they stood laughing and declaring that babie would be convinced that fairies came out on sunday then crossed the river and were beginning to ascend the path when a volley of sounds broke on them a shrill yap giving the alarm louder notes joining in and the bass being supplied by a formidable deepmouthed bark as out of the farmyard gate dashed little terrier curly spaniel slim greyhounds surly sheepdog of the old tailless sort and big and mighty newfoundland and there they stood in a row shouting forth defiance in all gradations of note so that though frightened carey and janet could not help laughing as the former said—  this comes of gadding about on sunday  if we went on boldly they would see we are not tramps said janet  depend on it they will let no one pass in church time  so it proved for janets attempt to move forward elicited a growl from the sheepdog and a leap forward of the little dogs and all which daunted even her stout heart  however calls were heard and the bright vision of the bridge came darting among the dogs scolding and driving them in and allen himself came out to the gate all bandaged up on one side but waving his arm as a signal to his mother and sister to advance  they did so nervously but safely while the growls of the sheepdog sounded like distant thunder and the terrier uttered his protest from the door allen declared himself much better and said he should be quite able to go home tomorrow only this was such a jolly place and then he brought them into the beautiful old kitchen with a magnificent open hearth inclosed by two fine dark walnutwood settles making a little carpeted chamber between them  here allen had the farmers armchair and a footstool and with foxes martyrs open at a flaming illustration on the little round table before him appeared to be spending his sunday as luxuriously as the big tabby cat who shared the hearth with him  they have only one service at woodbridge morning and afternoon by turns he explained and so they are all gone to it  who is that girl asked janet  undine he coolly replied  she certainly appeared on the bridge said his mother but i should think undines colouring had been less radiant—more of the blue and white  she had not a whiter skin nor bluer eyes said allen nor made herself more ridiculous either  did you ever see such hair mother hullo elfie  there she is peeping in at the window just as undine did come in he cried at the door  no not she as he returned baffled she is off again  but allen who is she  not farmer goulds daughter  of course not  dont you know she was fished up in a net and belonged to a palace under the ocean full of pearls and diamonds she took such a fancy to me that no power on earth would make her go to church with the rest  she ran away and hid and when they were all gone she came out and curled herself up at my feet and chattered till i happened to offend her majesty and off she went like a shot im only thankful that she did not make her pearly teeth meet in my finger in true undine fashion  but who is she really  i cant quite make out  they call her elfie and she calls them grandpapa and uncle and aunt but she has been sitting here complaining of everything being cold and dull and talking about seas and islands palmtrees and coral caves and humming birds yes and black slaves and strings of pearls so that if she is romancing like armine and babie she does it uncommonly naturally  they saw no more of this mysterious little being and the family soon returned from church  the father was a fine oldfashioned yeoman the son had the style of a modern farmer and the wife was so quiet sensible and matronly as to be almost ladylike  her two little girls were dressed as well as essie and ellie but all were essentially commonplace  they were very kind and friendly anxious that allen should stay as long as was good for him as well as pressing in their hospitality to the two ladies  mr gould was very anxious to drive them home in his gig though he allowed that the road was very rough unless you went through belforest park and that he never did  this was surprising for belforest had always seemed as free as the turnpikeroad and river hollow was apparently part of the estate but there was an air of discouraging questions so carey suspected quarrels and asked none  she was enlightened the next day when colonel brownlow brought his phaeton to fetch allen home over the smooth park road  he told her that the goulds were freeholders who had owned river hollow from time immemorial though each successive lord of belforest tried to buy them out  the alienation between them and mr barnes the present master had however much stronger grounds than these  his nephew and intended heir has stolen a match with the old mans pretty daughter and this had never been forgiven  the young couple had gone out to the west indian isles where the early home of her husband had been and where he held some government office and there fell a victim to the climate  old mr gould had gone home to fetch his daughter and her child but the former had died before he reached her and he had only brought back the little girl about two years ago  mr barnes ignored her entirely and the goulds who had a good deal of pride did not choose to apply to him  it was very unfortunate for unless he had any other relations the child must be heiress to his immense wealth though it was as likely as not that he would leave it all to hospitals out of pure vindictiveness  they found allen out of doors attended by the three little girls all eagerly watching the removal of a sheepfold  he was a pleasant mannered boy ready to adapt himself to all circumstances and to throw ready intelligent interest into everything and he had won the hearts of the whole river hollow establishment from old mr gould down to the smallest puppy  elfie as he called her stood her ground and as she looked up under her brown mushroom hat caroline was struck with her beauty fair but with a southern richness of bloom and glow—the carnation cheek of a depth of tint more often found in brunette complexions  the eyes were not merely blue by courtesy but of a wonderful deep azure shaded by very long lashes dark except when the sun glinted them with gold and round her shoulders hung masses of hair of that exquisite light auburn which cannot be accused of being red  she let herself be greeted by the strangers with much more ease and grace than the other two children but the slow walk of her grandfather and colonel brownlow seemed more than she could brook and she went off flying and spinning round like a little dog  while all the acknowledgments and farewells were being made and colonel brownlow was taking directions for finding higgs house and forge so as to remunerate him for his services elfie came hurrying up to allen holding out a great gorgeous pinklined shell and laid within it two heads of scarlet geranium on a green leaf  o elfie elfie how could you exclaimed he knowing them to be the only flowers in bloom  you must have them  theres nothing else pretty to give you and i love you said the child holding up her face to kiss him  elvira said her aunt in warning how can you  what will this lady think of you  elviras gesture would in any other child have seemed a sulky thrust of the elbow but in her it was more like the flutter of the wing of a brilliant bird  you must she repeated and when he hesitated with if mrs gould she broke away dashed the flowers shell and all into the middle of a clump of rosemary and rushed out of sight like a little fury  you will excuse her mrs brownlow said mrs gould much annoyed she has been sadly spoilt living among negro servants and having her own way so that she is sometimes quite ungovernable  nay nay she is a warmhearted little thing if you dont cross her said the old farmer and the young gentleman has been very kind to her  mrs gould looked as if she thought she knew her niece better than grandpapa did but she was too wise to speak and the little girls having assisted allen in the recovery of the shell and the flowers he tendered them again to her  you had better keep them mr brownlow she said  the shell is her own and if you did not take it she is so tenacious that she would be sure to smash it to atoms  allen accepted perforce and proceeded with his farewells but as he was stooping down to kiss little fiveyearold kate gould something wet cold and sloppy came with great force on them both almost knocking them down and bespattering them both with black drops  the missile proved to be a dripping sod pulled up from the duckpond in the next field and a glimpse might be caught of elviras scarlet legs disappearing over the low wall between  over poor mrs goulds apologies a veil had best be drawn  mother carey pitied her heartily but it was impossible not to make fun at home over the black tokens on allens shirtcollar  his brothers and sisters laughed excessively and janet twitted him with his undine till he contrary to his wont grew so cross as to make his mother recollect that he was still a suffering patient and insist on his lying quiet on the sofa while she banished every one and read tennyson to him  poetry read aloud by her was allens greatest delight but not often enjoyed as bobus and jock scouted it and janet was getting too strongminded and used to break in with inopportune criticisms  so to have mother carey to read elaine undisturbed was as great an indulgence as allen could well have but she had not gone far before he broke out—  mother please i wish you could do something for that girl  she really is a lady  so it appears said carey much disposed to laugh  now mother dont be tiresome  you have more sense than janet her father was viceconsul at sant ildefonso one of the antilles  but my dear i am afraid that is not quite so grand as it sounds—  hush mother  he was nephew to mr barnes and they lived out of the town in a perfect paradise of a place looking out into the bay mr gould says he can hardly believe he ever saw anything so gorgeously beautiful and there this poor little elvira de menella lived like a princess with a court of black slaves  just fancy what it must be to her to come to that farm an orphan too with an aunt who cant understand a creature like that  poor child  then she cant get any education  old gould is a sensible man who says any school he could afford would only turn her out a sham and he means when mary and kate are a little older to get some sort of governess for the three  but mother couldnt you just let him bring her in on market days and teach her a little  my dear boy what would your aunt do  we cant have sods of mud flying about the house  now mother you know better  you could make anything of her you know you could  and what a model she would make  think what a poor little desolate thing she is  you always have a fellow feeling for orphans and we do owe those people a great deal of gratitude  allen you special pleader it really will not do  if i had not undertaken essie and ellie i might think about it but i promised your aunt not to have any other pupils  allen bothered essie and ellie but was forced to acquiesce which was fortunate for when on the last day of the holidays it was found that he had walked to river hollow to take leave of the goulds his aunt administered to his mother a serious warning on the dangers of allowing him to become intimate there  caroline tingled all over during the discourse and at last jumped up exclaiming—  my dear ellen half the harm in the world is done by making a fuss things dont die half so hard when they die a natural death  ellen knew carey thought she had said something very clever but was all the more unconvinced     chapter xii  king midas    when i did him at this advantage take an asss nowl i fixed upon his head                      midsummer nights dream   in the early spring an unlookedfor obstacle arose to all wanderings in the belforest woods  the owner returned and closed the gates from time that seemed immemorial the inhabitants of kenminster had disported themselves there as if the grounds had been kept up for their sole behoof and their indignation at the monopoly knew no bounds  nobody saw mr barnes save his doctor whose carriage was the only one admitted within the lodge gates intending visitors being there informed that mr barnes was too unwell to be disturbed  mrs folly brownlows aberrations lost their interest in the coffinkey world beside the mystery of belforest  opinions varied as to his being a miser or a lunatic a prey to conscience disease or deformity and reports were so diverse that at the folly a journal was kept of them with their dates as a matter of curiosity—their authorities marked—  march 4th—mr barnes eats nothing but fresh turtle  brings them down in tubs alive and flapping  mrs coffinkeys jane heard them cooing at the station  gives his cook three hundred pounds per annum  5th—mr barnes so miserly that he turned away the housemaid for burning candles eight to the pound h s h  6th—mr b keeps a

emma  18th—mr barnes was crossed in love when he was a young man by one miss anne thorpe and has never been the same man since but has hated all society query is this a version of being a misanthrope  19th—he is a most unhappy man who has sacrificed all family affections and all humanity to gold and whose conscience will not let him rest  he is worn to a shadow and is at war with mankind in fine he is a lesson to weak human nature mrs rigby  22nd—all his toilet apparatus is of virgin gold he lets nothing else touch him jessie  exactly like king midas babie  the exclusion from the grounds was a serious grievance entailing much loss of time and hindrance to the many who had profited by the private roads  the sunday promenade was a great deprivation nurses and children were cut off from grass and shade and mother carey and her brood from all the delights of the enchanted ground  she could bear the loss better than in that first wild restlessness which only free nature could allay  she had made her occupations and knew of other haunts though many a longing eye was cast at the sweet green wilderness and many regrets spent on the rambles the sketches the plants and the creatures that had seemed the certain entertainment of the summer  to one class of the population the prohibition only gave greater zest—namely the boys  should there be birds nests in belforest unscathed by the youth of st kenelms  what were noticeboards palings or walls to boys with arms and legs ready to defy even the celebrated mantraps of ellangowan which if a man goes in they will break a horses leg  the terrific bloodhound alarmed a few till his existence was denied by alfred richards the agents son and dodging the keepers was a new and exciting sport  at first these men were not solicitous for captures but their negligence was so often detected that they began to believe that their master kept telescopes that could penetrate through trees and their vigilance increased  bobus in quest of green hellebore got off with a warning but a week later robin and jock were inspecting the heronry when they caught sight of a keeper and dashed off to find themselves running into the jaws of another  swift as lightning jock sprung up into an ivied ash but the less ready bob was caught by the leg as he mounted and pulled down again while his captor shouted if theres any more of you young varmint up yonder youd best come down before i fires up into the hoivy  he made a click and pointed his gun and robin shrieked oh dont we are colonel brownlows sons at least i mean nephews  dont i say  skipjack come down  you ass muttered jack as he crackled down and was collared by the keeper  hollo whats that for  now young gents why will you come larking here to get a poor chap out of his situation  its as much as my place is worth not to summons you and yet i dont half like to do it to young gents like you  what could they do to us asked jock  well sir may be theyd keep you in the lockup all night and what would your papa and mamma say to that  my father is colonel brownlow growled robin  more shame for you sir to want to get a poor man out of his place  look here my man said jock with london sharpness and impudence if you want to bully us into tipping you its no go  weve only got one copper between us and nothing else but our knives and if we had we wouldnt do such a sneaking thing  i never meant no such thing sir said the keeper only in case mr barnes should hear of our good nature  come along robin said jock if we are had up well let em know how leggings wanted us to buy off  wherewith jock made a rush rob plunged after him into the brambles and they never halted till they had tumbled over the park wall and lay in a breathless heap on the other side  the adventure was the fruitful cause of mirth at the folly but not a word was breathed of it at kencroft  a few other lads did actually pay toll to the keepers and some penniless ones were brought before the magistrates and fined for trespass because they could not afford it as caroline said and to the colonels great disgust she sent two sovereigns by allen to pay their fines and set them free  it was my own money she said in selfdefence earned by my models of fungi  the colonel thought it an unsatisfactory justification and told her that she would lay up trouble for herself by thus encouraging insubordination  he little thought that the laugh in her eyes was at his complacent ignorance of his own sons narrow escape  allen was at home for easter when eton gave longer holidays than did st kenelm so that his brothers were at work again long before he was  one afternoon which had ended in a soaking mist the two pairs of roberts and johns encountered him at the folly gate so disguised in mud that they hardly recognised the dainty etonian  that brute barnes he ejaculated i had to come miles round through a disgusting lane  i wish i had gone on  id have proved the right of way if he chose to prosecute me  father says thats no go said robin  i say allen what a guy you are added johnny  and hes got his swell trousers on cried jock capering with glee  i see gravely observed bobus he had got himself up regardless of expense for his undine and she has treated him to another dose of her native element  she had nothing to do with it asseverated allen she was as good as gold—  ah i knew he wasnt figged out for nothing put in jock  dont be ashamed ali my boy added bobus  we all understand her little tokens  stop that cried allen catching hold of jocks ear so as to end his wardance in a howl bringing the ponderous rob to the rescue and there was a general melee ending by all the five rolling promiscuously on the gravel drive  they scrambled up with recovered tempers and at the sight of an indignant housemaid rushed in a general stampede to the two large attics opening into one another which served as the lair of the folly lads  there while struggling with jocks assistance to pull off his boots allen explained how he had been waylaid by a beast in velveteens and walked off to the nearest gate  will he summons you ali  well all go and see the grand turk in the dock cried jock  dont flatter yourself he wouldnt think of it  how much did you fork out asked bobus  allen declaimed in the last refinement of eton slang carefully treasured up by the others for reproduction against the spite of the keeper who he declared had grinned with malice as he turned him out at a little back gate into a lane with a high stone wall on each side and two ruts running like torrents with water leading in the opposite direction to kenminster and ending in a bottom where he was up to the ankles in red clay  the eton boots oh my cried jock falling backwards with one of them which he had just pulled off  and then added allen as i tried to get along under the wall by the bank what should a miserable stone do but turn round with me and send me squash into the mud and mire floundering like a hippopotamus  i should like to get damages from that villain i should  allen was much more angry than was usual with him and the others though laughing at his etonian airs fully sympathised with his wrath  he ought to be served out  we will serve him out  how  get all our fellows and make a jolly good row under his windows said robin  decidedly low said allen  and impracticable besides said bobus  theyd kick you out before you could say jack robinson  there was an old book of fathers suggested jock with an old scamp who starved and licked his apprentices till one of them dressed himself up in a bullocks hide horns and hoofs and tail and all and stood over his bed at night and shouted—        old man old man for thy cruelty        body and soul thou art given to me        let me but hear those apprentices cries        and ill toss thee and gore thee and bore out thine eyes   and he was quite mild to the apprentices ever after  jock acted and roared with such effect as to be encored but rob objected  he aint got any apprentices  it might be altered said allen          old man old man thy gates thou must ope   bobus chimed in          nor force eton swells in quagmire to grope   bother you dont humbug and put me out          old man old man if for aught thou wouldst hope         thy heart purse and gates thou must instantly ope         let me but—   get mother carey to write it suggested his cousin john  no she must know nothing about it said bobus  shed think it a jolly lark said jock  when its over said allen  but its one of the things that the old ones are sure to stick at beforehand if they are ever so rational and jolly  tis a horrid pity she is not a fellow sighed johnny  and wholl do the verses said rob  oh any fool can do them returned bobus  the point is to bell the cat  thered be no getting in to act the midnight ghost said allen  no said jock but one could hide in the big rhododendron in the wolfskin rug and jump out on him in his chair  in allens railway rug jock rehearsed the scene and was imitated if not surpassed by both cousins but allen and bobus declared that it could not be carried out in the daylight  i could do it still better said jock if i blacked myself all over not only my face but all the rest and put on nothing but my red flannel drawers and a turban  theyd take me for the ghost of the little nigger he flogged to death and allen could write something pathetic and stunning  you might cut human ears out of rabbitskins and hang them round your neck added bobus  youd be awfully cold said allen  you could mix in a little iodine suggested bobus  that stings like fun and a coppery tinge would be more natural  there was great acclamation but the difficulty was that the only time for effecting an entrance into the garden was between four and five in the morning and it would be needful to lurk there in this light costume till mr barnes went out  no one would be at liberty from school but allen and he declined the oil and lampblack even though warmed up with iodine  could it not be done by deputy said bobus we might blacken the little fat boy riding on a swan the statue i mean  what and gild the swan to show how far his golden goose can carry him said jock  or said allen theres the statue they say is himself though thats all nonsense  we could make a pair of donkeys ears in mother careys clay and clap them on him and gild the thing in his hand  what would be the good of that asked robert  however the fun was irresistible and the only wonder was that the secret was kept for the whole day while allen moulded in the studio two things that might pass for asss ears and secreted cement enough to fasten them on  the performance elicited such a rapture of applause that the door had to be fast locked against the incursion of the little ones to learn the cause of the mirth  when mother carey asked at tea what they were having so much fun about they only blushed sniggled and wriggled in their chairs in a way that would have alarmed a more suspicious mother but only made her conclude that some delightful surprise was preparing for which she must keep her curiosity in abeyance  nor was she dismayed by the creaking of boots on the attic stairs before dawn and when the boys appeared at breakfast with hellebore blue periwinkle and daffodils clear indications of where they had been she only exclaimed—  forbidden sweets  o you naughty boys when ecstatic laughter alone replied  she heard no more till the afternoon when the return from school was notified by shouts from allen and the boys rushed up to the verandah where he was reading  i say heres a go  he thinks richards has done it and has written to ogilvie to have him expelled  how do you know  he told me himself  but ogilvie has too much sense to expel him  of course but theres worse for old barnes means to turn off his father  nothing will persuade the old fellow that it wasnt his work for he says that it must be a grammarschool boy  does dicky bird guess  yes but hes all right as close as wax  he says he was sure no one but ourselves could have done it for nobody else could have thought of such things or made them either  then he has seen it  yes and he was fit to kill himself with laughing though his father and old barnes were mad with rage and fury  his father believes him but old barnes believes neither of them and swears his father shall go  we shall have to split on ourselves elegantly observed johnny  we had better tell mother carey  hullo here she is inside the window  didnt you know that said allen  therefore the boys leaning and sprawling round her half in and half out of the window told the story the triumph overcoming all compunction as they described the morning raid the successful scaling of the parkwall the rush across the sward the silence of the garden the hoisting up of allen to fasten on the ears and the wonderful charms of the figure when it wore them and held a golden apple in its hand  right of way and let us in had been written in black on all the pedestals  it is a peculiar way of recommending your admission said caroline  thats robs doing said allen  i couldnt look after him while i was gilding the apple or i would have stopped him  he half blacked the little boy on the swan too  and broke the swans bill off worse luck added johnny  yes said allen that was altogether low and unlucky  i meant the old fellow simply to have thought that his statue had grown a pair of ears in the night  and what would have been the use of that said robin  what was the use of all your scrawling said allen except just to show it was not the natural development of statues  yes added bobus it all came of you that poor dickey bird is suspected and it is all blown up  as if he would have thought it was done by nobody said rob  why not said jock  im sure id never wonder to see asss ears growing on you  i think they are coming  there was a shout of laughter as rob hastily put up his hands to feel for them adding in his slow gruff voice—a statue aint alive  it made a fool of the whole matter proceeded bobus  i wish wed kept a lout like you out of it  hush hush bobus put in his mother no matter about that  the question is what is to be done about poor mr richards and alfred  write a poetical letter said allen beginning to extemporise in hiawatha measure             o thou mighty man of money            barnes of belforest esquire            innocent is alfred richards            innocent his honest father            innocent as unborn baby            of development of midas            of the smearing of the cupid            of the fracture of the goosebill            of the writing of the mottoes            all the brownlows of st kenelms            from the folly and from kencroft            robert the aspiring soldier            robert too the sucking chemist            john the skipjack full of mischief            john the great originator            allen the—   allen the uncommon gaby broke in bobus  come dont waste time something must be done  yes a rational letter must be written and signed by you all said his mother  the question is whether it would be better to do it through your uncle or mr ogilvie  i dont see why my father should hear of it or mr ogilvie either growled rob i didnt do those donkeyfied ears  you did the writing which was five hundred times more donkeyfied said jock  it is quite impossible to keep either of them in ignorance said caroline  yes repeated all her own three jock adding father would have known it as soon as you and i dont see that my uncle is much worse  he aint so soft exclaimed johnny roused to loyal defence of his parent  soft cried jock indignantly i can tell you father did pitch into me when i caught the old ladys bonnet out at the window with a fishingrod  he never flogged you said johnny contemptuously  he did cried jock triumphantly  at least he flogged bobus when—  shut up you little ape thundered bobus not choosing to be offered up to the manes of his fathers discipline  you think you must explain it to my uncle mother said allen rather ruefully  certainly  he ought to be told first and mr ogilvie next  depend upon it he will be far less angry if it is freely confessed and put into his hands and what is more important mr barnes must attend to him and acquit the richardses  the general voice agreed but rob writhed and muttered cant you be the one to tell him mother carey  thats cool said allen to ask her to do what youre afraid of  he couldnt do anything to her said rob  however public opinion went against rob and the party of boys dragged him off in their train the less reluctantly that allen would be spokesman and he always got on well with his uncle  no one could tell how it was but the boy had a frank manner with a sort of address in the manner of narration that always went far to disarm displeasure and protected his comrades as well as himself  so it was that instead of meeting with unmitigated wrath the boys found that they were allowed the honours and graces of voluntary confession  allen even thought that his uncle showed a little veiled appreciation of the joke but this was not deemed possible by the rest  to exonerate young richards was the first requisite and allen under his uncles eye drew up a brief note to this effect—   sir—we beg to apologise for the mischief done in your grounds and to assure you on our word and honour that it was suggested by no one that no one admitted us and no one had any share in it except ourselves                             allen brownlow                             robert friar brownlow                             robert otway brownlow                             john friar brownlow                             john lucas brownlow   this letter was taken up the next morning to belforest by colonel brownlow and the two eldest delinquents one curious amused and with only compunction enough to flavour an apology the other cross dogged and sheepish dragged along like a cur in a sling just as though he were going to be hanged said janet  the report of the expedition as given by allen was thus—the servant showed us into a sort of anteroom and said he would see whether his master would see us  uncle robert sent in his card and my letter and we waited with the door open and a great screen in front so that we couldnt help hearing every word  first there was a great snarl and then a deferential voice this alters the case sir  but the old man swore down in his throat that he didnt care for colonel brownlow or colonel anybody  a gentleman sir one of the most respected  then he should bring up his family better indeed sir it might be better to accept the apology  this might not be considered actionable damage  well see that  indeed dont you agree with me mr richards the magistrates would hardly entertain the case  then ill appeal ill send a representation to the home office  is it not to be considered sir whether some of these low papers might not put it in a ludicrous light  then continued allen who had been most dramatically mimicking the two voices we heard a crackling as if he were opening my letter and after an odd noise or two he sent to call us in to where he was sitting with richards and the attorney he had got to prosecute us he is a regular old wizened stick the perfect image of an old miser almost humpbacked and as yellow as a mummy  he looked just ready to bite off our heads but he was amazingly set on finding out which was which among us and seemed uncommonly struck with my name and bobuss  my uncle told him i was called after your father and he made a snarl just like a dog over a bone  he ended with so you are allen brownlow  youll remember this days work youngster  i humbly said i should and so the matter ended  he did not mean any prosecution  o no that was all quashed even if it was begun  he must have been under an hallucination that he was a stern parent cutting me off with a shilling  the words had also struck the colonel who sought the first opportunity of asking his sisterinlaw whether she knew the names of any of her mothers relations  only that her name was otway said caroline  you know i lived with my fathers aunt who knew nothing about her and i have never been able to find anything out  do you know of any connection  not this old man  then you would have known  that does not follow for i was scarcely in jamaica at all  i had a long illness immediately after going there was sent home on leave and then to the depot and only joined again after the regiment had gone to canada when the marriage had taken place  i may have heard the name of mrs allens uncle but i never bore it in my mind  is there any way of finding out  i will write to norton  if he does not remember all about it his wife will  he is the present lieutenantcolonel i think  yes and he was your fathers chief friend  now that they are at home again we must have him here one of these days  it would be a wonderful thing if this freak were an introduction to a relation said caroline  there was no doubt of his being struck by the combination of allen and otway  he chose to understand which were my sons and which my nephews and when i said that allen bore your maiden name he assented as if he knew it before and spoke of your boy having cause to remember this i am afraid it will not be pleasantly  no said caroline it sounded much like a threat  but one would like to know only i thought farmer goulds little granddaughter was his niece  that might be without preventing your relationship i will do my best to ascertain it  colonel nortons letter gave decisive information that barnes was the name of the uncle with whom caroline otway had been living at the time of her marriage  she had been treated as a poor relation and seemed to be halfslave halfgoverness to the children of the favoured sister little semispanish tyrants  this had roused captain allens chivalry and his friend remembered his saying that though he had little or nothing of his own he could at least make her happier than she was in such a family  the uncle was reported to have grown rich in the mahogany trade and likewise by steamboat speculations coupled with judicious stockjobbing among the distressed west indians after the emancipation  he was a sinisterlooking old fellow ended colonel norton and i should think not very particular but i should be glad to hear that he had done justice to poor allens daughter  he was written to when she was left an orphan but vouchsafed no answer  still he may have kept an eye upon you added uncle robert  i do not think it was new to him that you had married into our family  if only those unfortunate boys have not ruined everything sighed ellen  little elviras father must have been one of those cousins said caroline  i wonder what became of the others  she must be—let me see—my second cousin  not very near said ellen  i never had a blood relation before since my old aunt died  i am so glad that brilliant child belongs to me  i daresay old gould could tell you more said the colonel  is it wise to revive the connection asked his wife  the goulds are not likely to presume said the colonel and i think that if caroline takes up the one connection she is bound to take up the other  how am i to make up to this cross old man said carey  i cant go and fawn on him  certainly not said her brotherinlaw but i think you ought to make some advance merely as a relation  on the family vote caroline rather unwillingly wrote a note explaining that she had only just discovered her kinship with mr barnes and offering to come and see him but not the smallest notice was taken of her letter rather to her relief though she did not like to hear ellen augur ill for the future  another letter to old mr gould begging him to call upon her next market day met with a far more ready response  when at his entrance she greeted him with outstretched hands and—i never thought you were a connection the fine old weatherbeaten face was strangely moved as the rugged hand took hers and the voice was husky that said—  i thought there was a likeness in the voice but i never imagined you were grandchild to poor carey barnes i beg your pardon to mrs otway  you knew her  you must let me see something of my little cousin i know nothing of my relations and my brotherinlaw said he thought you could tell me  i ought to be able for the family lived at woodbridge all my young days said the farmer  the history was then given  the present lord of the manor had been the son of a land surveyor  he was a stunted sickly slightly deformed lad noted chiefly for skill in cyphering and therefore had been placed in a clerkship  here a successful lottery ticket had been the foundation of his fortunes he had invested it in the mahogany trade and had been one of those men with whom everything turned up a prize  when a little over thirty he had returned to his own neighbourhood looking any imaginable age  he had then purchased belforest furnished it sumptuously and laid out magnificent gardens in preparation for his bride a charming young lady of quality  but she had had a young lochinvar and even in her wedding dress favoured by sympathising servants had escaped down the back stairs of a london hotel and been married at the nearest church leaving poor mr barnes in the case of the poor craven bridegroom into whose feelings no one ever inquired  mr barnes had gone back to the west indies at once and never appeared in england again till he came home a broken and soured old man to die  there had been two sisters and caroline fancied that the old farmer had had some tenderness for the elder one but she had married before her brothers prosperity a poor struggling builder and both had died young leaving their child dependent on her uncle his younger sister had been the favourite he had taken her back with him to america and married her to a man of spanish blood connected with him in business  the only one of her children who survived childhood was educated in england treated as his uncles heir and came to belforest for shooting  thus it was that he had fallen in love with farmer goulds pretty daughter and as it seemed by her mothers contrivance though without her fathers consent had made her his wife  the wrath of mr barnes was implacable  he cast off the favourite nephew as entirely as he had cast off the despised niece and deprived him of all the means he had been led to look on as his right  the young man had nothing of his own but an estate in the small island of san ildefonso of very little value and some of his former friends made interest to obtain a viceconsulship for him at the spanish town  then after a few years both husband and wife died leaving this little orphan to the care of her grandfather who had written to mr barnes on her fathers death but had heard nothing from him and had too much honest pride to make any further application  my little cousin said caroline the first i ever knew  pray bring her to see me and let her stay with me long enough for me to know her  the old man began to prepare her for the childs being shy and wild though perhaps her aunt was too particular with her and expected too much  perhaps she would be homesick he said so wistfully that it was plain that he did not know how to exist without his darling but he was charmed with the invitation and caroline was pleased to see that he did not regard her as his grandchilds rival but as representing the cherished playmate of his youth     chapter xiii  the rival heiresses    you smile their eager ways to see but mark their choice when they to choose their sportive garb are free the moral of their play                             keble   one curious part of the reticence of youth is that which relates to its comprehension of grownup affairs  there is a smile with which the elders greet any question on the subject half of wonder half of amusement which is perfectly intolerable to the young who remain thinking that they are regarded as presumptuous and absurd and thus will do anything rather than expose themselves to it again  thus it was that mrs brownlow flattered herself that her children never put two and two together when she let them know of the discovery of their relationship  partly she judged by herself  she was never in the habit of forecasting and for so clever and spirited a woman she thought wonderfully little  she had plenty of intuitive sense decided rapidly and clearly and could easily throw herself in other peoples thoughts but she seldom reflected analysed or moralised save on the spur of the moment  she lived chiefly in the present and the chief events of her life had all come so suddenly and unexpectedly upon her that she was all the less inclined to guess at the future having always hitherto been taken by surprise  so when jock observed in public—mother they say at kencroft that the old miser ought to leave you half his money  do you think he will it was with perfect truth that she answered i dont think at all about it  it was taken in the family as an intimation that she would not talk about it and while she supposed that the children drew no conclusions they thought the more  allen was gone to eton but janet and bobus had many discussions over their chemical experiments about possibilities and probabilities odd compounds of cleverness and ignorance  mother must be heiratlaw for her grandmother was eldest said janet  a woman cant be heiratlaw said bobus  the salique law doesnt come into england  yes it does for sir john gray got graysnest only last year instead of the old mans daughter  then how comes the queen to be queen  besides—bobus shifted his ground to another possibility—when theres nobody but a lot of women the thing goes into abeyance among them  who gets it then  chancery i suppose or some of the lawyers  they are all blood suckers  im sure said janet superior by three years of wisdom that abeyance only happens about scotch peerages and if he has not made a will mother will be heiress  only halves with that black undine of allens sturdily persisted bobus  is she coming here janet  yes tomorrow  i did not think we wanted another child about the house essie and ellie are quite enough  if mother gets rich she wont have all that teaching to bother her said bobus  and i can go on with my education said janet  girls education does not signify said bobus  now i shall be able to get the very best instruction in physical science and make some great discovery  if i could only go and study at halle instead of going on droning here  oh boys can always get educated if they choose  you are going to eton or winchester after this term  not if i can get any sense into mother  i dont want to waste my time on those stupid classics and athletics  i say janet its time to see whether the precipitation has taken place  the two used to try experiments together in bobuss end of the attic to an extent that might make the presence of a strange child in the house dangerous to herself as well as to everyone else  mrs gould herself brought the little girl trying to impress on mrs brownlow that if she was indocile it was not her fault but her grandfather could not bear to have her crossed  the elders did not wonder at his weakness for the creature was wonderfully lovely and winning with a fearless imperiousness that subdued everyone to her service  so brilliant was she that essie and ellie though very pretty little girls looked faded and effaced beside this small empress whose air seemed to give her a right to bestow her favours  i am glad to be here she observed graciously to her hostess for you are my cousin and a lady  and pray what are you asked janet  i am la senora dona elvira maria de guadalupe de menella replied the damsel with a liquid sonorousness so annihilating that janet made a mocking courtesy and her mother said it was like asking the head of the house of hapsburg if she were a lady  with some disappointment at allens absence the little donna motioned bobus to sit by her side at dinnertime and when her grandfather looked in somewhat later to wish her goodbye in mingled hope and fear of her insisting on going home with him she cared for nothing but his admiration of her playing at kings and queens with armine and barbara in the cotton velvet train of the dressing up wardrobe  no she did not want to go home  she never wanted to go back to river hollow  nor would she even kiss him till she had extorted the assurance that he had been shaved that morning  the old man went away blessing mrs brownlows kindness to his child and janet was universally scouted for muttering that it was a heartless little being  she alone remained unenthralled by elviras chains  the first time she went to kencroft she made colonel brownlow hold her up in his arms to gather a bough off his own favourite double cherry and when mother carey demurred she beguiled aunt ellen into taking her on her own responsibility to the dancing lessons at the assembly rooms  there she electrified the dancingmaster and all beholders seeming to catch inspiration from the music and floating along with a wondrous swimming grace as her dainty feet twinkled her arms wreathed themselves and her eyes shone with enjoyment  if she could only have always danced or acted in the garden armines and babies perpetual romantic dramas were all turned by her into homage to one and the same princess  she never knew or cared whether she were goddess or fairy greek or briton provided she had the crown and train but as babie much preferred action to magnificence they got on wonderfully well without disputes  there was a continual performance endless as a chinese tragedy of spensers faery queene in which elfie was always gloriana and armine and babie were everybody else in turn except the wicked characters who were represented by the cabbages and a dummy  reading was horrid elvira said and certainly hers deserved the epithet  her attainments fell far behind those of essie and ellie and she did not mean to improve them  her hostess let her alone till she had twice shaken her rich mane at her grandfather and refused to return with him and he had shown himself deeply grateful to mrs brownlow for keeping her there and had said he hoped she was good at her lessons  the first trial resulted in elviras going to sleep over her book the next in her playing all sorts of ridiculous tricks and sulking when stopped and when she was forbidden to speak or go out till she had repeated three answers in the multiplication table she was the next moment singing and dancing in defiance in the garden  caroline did not choose to endure this and went to fetch her in thus producing such a screaming kicking rolling fury that mrs coffinkey might have some colour for the statement that mrs folly brownlow was murdering all her children  the cook as the strongest person in the house was called carried her in and put her to bed where she fell sound asleep and woke hungry in high spirits and without an atom of compunction  when called to lessons she replied—no im going back to grandpapa  very well was all caroline answered thinking wholesome neglect the best treatment  in an hours time mr gould made his appearance with his grandchild she had sought him out among the pigs in the marketplace pulled him by the coat and insisted on being taken home  his politeness was great but he was plainly delighted and determined to believe that her demand sprang from affection and not naughtiness  elvira stood caressing him barely vouchsafing to look at her hostess and declaring that she never meant to come back  not a fortnight had passed however before she burst upon them again kissing them all round and reiterating that she hated her aunt and would live with mother carey  mr gould had waited to be properly ushered in  he was distressed and apologetic but he had been forced to do his tyrants behest  there had been more disturbances than ever between her and her aunt and mrs gould had declared that she would not manage the child any longer while elvira was still more vehement to return to mother carey  would mrs brownlow recommend some school or family where the child would be well cared for  mrs brownlow did more offering herself to undertake the charge  spite of all the naughtiness she loved the beautiful wild creature and could not bear to think of intrusting her to strangers she knew too that her brother and sisterinlaw had no objection and it was the obvious plan  mr gould would make some small payment and the child was to be made to understand that she must be obedient learn her lessons and cease to expect to find a refuge with her grandfather when she was offended  she drew herself up with childish pride and grace saying i will attend to mrs brownlow for she is my cousin and my equal  to a certain degree the little maiden kept her word  she was the favourite plaything of the boys and got on well with babie who was too bright and yielding to quarrel with any one  but janets eldersisterly authority was never accepted by the newcomer  i couldnt mind her she looked so ugly said she in excuse and probably the heavy brown dull complexion and large features were repulsive in themselves to the sensitive fancy of the creature of life and beauty  at any rate they were jarring elephants as said eleanor who was growing ambitious and sometimes electrified the public with curious versions of the long words more successfully used by armine and babie  caroline succeeded in modelling a very lovely profile in basrelief of the exquisite little head and then had it photographed  mary ogilvie coming to kenminster as usual when her holidays began in june found the photograph in the place of honour on her brothers chimneypiece and a little one beside it of the artist herself  so far as carey herself was concerned mary was much better satisfied  she did not look so worn or so flighty and had a quieter and more really cheerful tone and manner as of one who had settled into her home and occupations  she had made friends too—few but worth having and there were those who pronounced the folly the pleasantest house in kenminster and regarded the five oclock tea after the weekly physical science lecture at the school as a delightful institution  of course the schoolmaster was one of these and when mary found how all his paths tended to the pagoda she hated herself for being a suspicious old duenna  nevertheless she could not but be alarmed by finding that her project of a walking tour through brittany was not indeed refused but deferred with excuses about having work to finish being in no hurry and the like  i think you ought to go said mary at last  i see no ought in the case  last year the work dragged and was oppressive but you see how different it has become  that is the very reason said mary the colour flying to her checks  it will not do to stay lingering here as we did last summer and not only on your own account  you need not be afraid was the muttered answer as david bent down his head over the exercise he was correcting  she made no answer and ere long he began again i dont mean that her equal exists but i am not such a fool as to delude myself with a spark of hope  she is too nice for that said mary  just so he said glad to relieve himself when the ice had been broken  theres something about her that makes one feel her to be altogether that doctors as much as if he were present in the flesh  are you hoping to wear that out  for i dont think you will  i told you i had no hope he answered rather petulantly  even were it otherwise there is another thing that must withhold me it has got abroad that she may turn out heiress to the old man at belforest  in such a hopeless case would it not be wiser to leave this place altogether  i cannot he exclaimed then remembering that vehemence told against him he added dont be uneasy i am a reasonable man and she is a woman to keep one so but i think i am useful to her and i am sure she is useful to me  that i allow she has been said mary looking at her brothers much improved appearance but—  moths and candles to wit he returned but dont be afraid i attract no notice and i think she trusts me about her boys  but what is it to come to  i have thought of that  understand that it is enough for me to live near her and be now and then of some little service to her  they were interrupted by a note which mr ogilvie read and handed to his sister with a smile—   dear mr ogilvie—could you and mary make it convenient to look in this evening  bobus has horrified his uncle by declining to go up for a scholarship at eton or winchester and i should be very glad to talk it over with you  also i shall have to ask you to take little armine into school after the holidays                                           yours sincerely                                              c o brownlow   what does the boy mean asked mary  i thought he was the pride of your heart  so he is but he is ahead of his fellows and ought to be elsewhere all measures have been taken for sending him up to stand at one of the public schools but i thought him very passive about it  he is an odd boy—reserved and selfconcentrated—quite beyond his uncles comprehension and likely to become headstrong at a blind exercise of authority  i used to like allen best said mary  he is the pleasantest but theres more solid stuff in bobus  that boys school character is perfect except for a certain cool opinionativeness which seldom comes out with me but greatly annoys the undermasters  is he a prig  well yes im afraid he is  hes unpopular for he does not care for games but his brother is popular enough for both  jock—the monkey  his brains run to mischief  ive had to set him more impositions than any boy in the school and actually to take his form myself for simply the undermasters cant keep up discipline or their own tempers  as to poor m le blanc i find him dancing and shrieking with fury in the midst of a circle of snorting giggling boys and when he points out ce petit monstre jock coolly owns to having translated croquons les let us croquet them or je suis blesse i am blest  so the infusion of brains produces too much effervescence  yes but the whole school has profited and none more so than no 2 of the other family who has quite passed his elder brother and is above his namesake whenever it is a case of plodding ability versus idle genius  but after all how little one can know of ones boys  or ones girls said mary thinking of governess experiences  it was a showery summer evening when the brother and sister walked up to the folly in a partial clearing when the evening sun made every bush twinkle all over with diamond drops  childish voices were heard near the gate and behind a dripping laurel were seen elvira armine and barbara engaged in childhoods unceasing attempt to explore the centre of the earth  what do you expect to find there they were asked  little kobolds with pointed caps playing at ball with rubies and emeralds and digging with golden spades answered babie  and they shall give me an opal ring said elfie but armine does not want the kobolds  he says they are bad said babie  now are they mr ogilvie  i know elder women are and erl kings and mist widows but poor neck that sat on the water and played his harp wasnt bad and the dear little kobolds were so kind and funny  now are they bad elves  her voice was full of earnest pleading and mr ogilvie not being versed in the spiritual condition of elves could best reply by asking why armine thought ill of their kind  i think they are nasty little things that want to distract and bewilder one in the real great search  what search my boy  for the source of everything said armine lowering his voice and looking into his muddy hole  but that is above not below said mary  yes said armine reverently but i think god put life and the beginning of growing into the earth and i want to find it  isnt it truth said babie  mr acton said truth was at the bottom of a well  i wont look at the kobolds if they keep one from seeing truth  but i must get my ring and all my jewels from them put in elfie  should you know truth asked mr ogilvie  what do you think she is like  so beautiful said babie clasping her fingers with earnestness all white and clear like crystal with such blue sweet open eyes and she has an anchor  thats hope said armine  oh hope and truth go hand in hand said babie and hope will be all robed in green like the young cornfields in the spring  ah babie that emerald hope and crystal truth are not down in the earth earthy said mary again  nay perhaps armine has got hold of a reality said mr ogilvie they are to be found above by working below  talking paradox to armine said the cheerful voice of the young mother  my dear sprites do you know that it is past eight  how wet you are  good night and mind you dont go upstairs in those boots  it is quite comfortable to hear anything so commonplace said mary when the children had run away to the sound of its reiteration after full interchange of good nights  those imps make one feel quite eerie  has armine been talking in that curious fashion of his said carey as they began to pace the walks  i am afraid his thinker is too big—as the child says in miss tytlers book  this morning over his parsing he asked me—mother which is realest what we touch or what we feel knitting his brows fearfully when i did not catch his meaning and going on—i mean is that fly as real as king david and then as i was more puzzled he went on—you see we only need just see that fly now with our outermost senses and he will only live a little while and nobody cares or will think of him any more but everybody always does think and feel and care a great deal about king david  i told him as the best answer i could make on the spur of the moment that david was alive in heaven but he pondered in and broke out—no thats not it  david was a real man but it is just the same about perseus and siegfried and lots of people that never were men only just thoughts  aint thoughts realer than things mother  but much worse for him i should say exclaimed mary  i thought of pisistratus caxton and wrote to mr ogilvie  it is a great pity but i am afraid he ought not to dwell on such things till his body is grown up to his mind  yes school is the approved remedy for being too clever said mr ogilvie  you are wise  it is a pity but it will be all the better for him byandby  and the elder ones will take care the seasoning is not too severe said caroline with a resolution she could hardly have shown if this had been her first launch of a son  but it was about bobus that i wanted to consult you  his uncle thinks him headstrong and conceited if not lazy  lazy he is certainly not  i knew you would say so but the colonel cannot enter into his wish to have more physical science and less classics and will not hear of his going to germany which is what he wishes though i am sure he is too young  he ought not to go there till his character is much more formed  what do you think of his going on here  thats a temptation i ought to resist  he will soon have outstripped the other boys so that i could not give him the attention he needs and besides the being with other boys more his equals would be invaluable to him  well he is rather bumptious  nothing is worse for a lad of that sort than being cock of the walk it spoils him often for life  i know exactly the sort of man you mean always liking to lay down the law and talking to women instead of men because they dont argue with him  no bobus must not come to that and he is too young to begin special training  will you talk to him mr ogilvie  you know if my horse is not convinced i may bring him to the water but it will be all in vain  they had reached the outside of the window of the diningroom where the schoolboys were learning their lessons for the morrow  bobus was sitting at the table with a small lamp so shaded as to concentrate the light on him and to afford it to no one else  on the floor was a servants flat candlestick mounted on a pile of books between one john sprawling at full length preparing his virgil the other crosslegged working a sum with ink from a dolls teacup placed in the candlestick and all the time there was a wonderful mumbling accompaniment as there always was between those two  i say what does pulsum come from  what a brute this is of a fraction  skipjack what will go in 639 and 852  pulsum a pulse—volat flies  eh  threell do it  or common measure it at once  bother common measure  the threes in—  fama fame volat flies pulsum the pulse cecisse to have ceased paternis regnis in the paternal kingdom  i say wouldnt that rile perkins like fun  the threes in seven—two—in eighteen—  i say johnny is pulsum from pulco  never heard of it  bobus is it pulco pulxi pulsum  pulco—i make an ass of myself muttered bobus  o murder groaned johnny it has come out 213  not half so much murder as this pulsum  why it will go in them both  i can see with half an eye  isnt it pello—pulsum  pello to drive out  hurrah  that fits it  look out skipjack theres a moth  anything worth having demanded bobus  only a grass eggar  fama fame volat flies idomoeea ducem that idomaeeus the leader pulsum expelled  get out i say you foolish beggar to the moth  never mind catching him said bobus weve got dozens  yes but i dont want him frizzling alive in my candle  dont kick up such a shindy broke out johnny as a much stained handkerchief came flapping about  youve blotted my sum  thunder and ages as the candlestick toppled over ink and all  that is a go  i say bobus lend us your guy fawkes to pick up the pieces  not if i know it said bobus  you always smash things  theres a specimen of the way we learn our lessons said caroline in a low voice still unseen as bobus wiped sheathed and pocketed his favourite pen then proceeded to turn down the lamp but allowed the others to relight their candle at the expiring wick  the results are fair said mr ogilvie  i think of your carpet said mary quaintly  we always lay down an ancient floorcloth in the bay window before the boys come home said carey laughing  here bobus  and as he came out headforemost at the window the two ladies discreetly drew off to leave the conversation free  so brownlow said mr ogilvie i hear you dont want to try your luck elsewhere  no sir  do you object to telling me why  i see no use in it said bobus never shy and further aided by the twilight i do quite well enough here  should you not do better in a larger field among a higher stamp of boys  public school boys are such fools  and what are the kenites  well not much said bobus with a twitch in the corner of his mouth but i can keep out of their way  you mean that you have gained your footing and dont want to have to do it again  not only that sir said the boy but at a public school youre fagged and forced to go in for cricket and football  you would soon get above that  yes but even then you get no peace and are nobody unless you go in for all that stuff of athletics and sports  i hate it all and dont want to waste my time  i dont think you are quite right as to there being no distinction without athletics  allen says it is so now  allen may be a better judge of the present state of things but i should think there was always a studious set who were respectable  besides proceeded bobus warming with his subject i see no good in nothing but classics  i dont care what ridiculous lies some old man who never existed or else was a dozen people at once told about a lot of ruffians who never lived killing each other at some place that never was  i like what you can lay your finger on and say its here its true and i can prove it and explain it and improve on it  if you can said mr ogilvie struck by the contrast with the little brother  thats what i want to do said bobus to deal with real things not words and empty fancies  i know languages are necessary but if one can read a latin book and understand a greek technical term thats all that is of use  if my uncle wont let me study physical science in germany i had rather go on here where i can be let alone to study it for myself  i do not think you understand what you would throw away  what is the difference between higg the bonesetter and dr leslie  higg can do that one thing just by instinct  he is uneducated  and in a measure it is so with all who throw themselves into some special pursuit without waiting for the mind and character to have full training and expansion  if you mean to be a great surgeon—  i dont mean to be a surgeon  a physician then  no sir  please dont let my mother fancy i mean to be in practice at everyones beck and call  ive seen too much of that  i mean to get a professorship and have time and apparatus for researches so as to get to the bottom of everything said the boy with the vast purposes of his age  your chances will be much better if you go up from a public school trained in accuracy by the thorough work of language and made more powerful by the very fact of not having followed merely your own bent  your contempt for the classics shows how onesided you are growing  besides i thought you knew that the days are over of unmitigated classics  you would have many more opportunities and much better ones of studying physical science than i can provide for you here  this was a new light to bobus and when mr ogilvie proved its truth to him and described the facilities he would have for the study he allowed that it made all the difference  meantime the two ladies had gone in mary asking where janet was  gone with jessie and her mother to a birthday party at polesworth lawn  not a good day for it  it is the perplexing sort of day that no one knows whether to call it fine or wet but ellen decided on going as they were to dance in the hall if it rained  im sure her kindness is great for she takes infinite trouble to make janet producible  poor janet you know dressing her is like hanging clothes on a wooden peg and a peg that wont stand still and has curious theories of the beautiful carried out in a still more curious way  so when in terror of our aunt the whole female household have done their best to turn out miss janet respectable between this house and kencroft she contrives to give herself some twitch or else is seized with an idea of the picturesque which sets every one wondering that i let her go about such a figure  then ellen and jessie put a tie here and a pin there and reduce the chaotic mass to order  it was not long before janet appeared and jessie with her the latter having been set down to give a message  the two girls were dressed in the same light blackandwhite checked silk of early youth one with pink ribbons and the other with blue but the contrast was the more apparent for one was fresh and crisp while the other was flattened and tumbled one said everything had been delightful the other that it had all been very stupid and the expression made even more difference than the complexion in one so fair fresh and rosy in the other so sallow and muddled  jessie looked so sweet and bright that when she had gone miss ogilvie could not help exclaiming how pretty she is  yes and so goodtempered and pleasant  there is something always restful to me in having her in the room said caroline  restful said janet with one of her unamiable sneers  yes she and h s h sent me off to sleep with their gossip on the way home o mother theres another item for the belforest record  mr barnes has sent off all his servants again even the confidential man is shipped off to america  you seem to have slept with one ear open said her mother  and oh as janet took off her gloves i hope you did not show those hands  i could not eat cake without doing so and mr glover supposed i had been photographing  and what had you been doing inquired mary at sight of the brown stains  trying chemical experiments with bobus said her mother  yes cried janet and ive found out why we did not succeed  i thought it out during the dancing  instead of cultivating the light fantastic toe as the courier calls it  i danced twice and a great plague it was  only with mr glover and with a stupid little middy  i was thinking all the time how senseless it was  how agreeable you must have been  one cant be agreeable to people like that  oh bobus as he came into the room with mr ogilvie ive found out—  i thought jessie was here he interrupted  shes gone home  i know what was wrong yesterday  we ought to have isolated the hypo—  isolated the grandmother said bobus  that has nothing to do with it  im sure of it  ill show you how it acts  ill show you just the contrary  not tonight cried their mother as bobus began to relight the lamp  you two explosives are quite perilous enough by day without lamps and candles  you endure a great deal said mr ogilvie  im not afraid of either of these two doing anything dangerous singly for they are both careful but when they are of different minds i never know what the collision may produce  yes said bobus id much sooner have jessie to help me for she does what she is bid and never thinks  thats all you think women good for said janet  quite true said bobus coolly  and mr ogilvie was acknowledged by his sister to have done a good deed that night since the folly might be far more secure when janet tried her experiments alone     chapter xiv  pumping away    the rude will scuffle through with ease enough great schools best suit the sturdy and the rough soon see your wish fulfilled in either child the pert made perter and the tame made wild                                              cowper   robert otway brownlow came out fourth on the roll of newlyelected scholars of s mary winton and his master was as his sister declared unwholesomely proud of it even while he gave all credit to the folly and none to himself  still mary had her way and took him to brittany and though her present pupils were to leave the schoolroom at christmas she would bind herself to no fresh engagement thinking that she had better be free to make a home for him whether at kenminster or elsewhere  when the halfyear began again bobus was a good deal missed jock was in a severe idle fit and armine did not come up to the expectations formed of him and was found when up to mr perkins to be as bewildered and unready as other people  all the work in the school seemed flat and poor except perhaps johnnys which steadily improved  robert whose father wished him to be pushed on so as to be fit for examination for sandhurst opposed to all pressure the passive resistance of stolidity  he was nearly sixteen but seemed incapable of understanding that compulsory studies were for his good and not a cruel exercise of tyranny  he disdainfully rejected an offer from his aunt to help him in the french and arithmetic which had become imminent while of the first he knew much less than babie and of the latter only as much as would serve to prevent his being daily kept in  one chilly autumn afternoon armine was seen even by the unobservant undermaster to be shivering violently and his teeth chattering so that he could not speak plainly  you ought to be at home said mr perkins  here you brownlow maximus just see him home and tell his mother that he should be seen to  i can go alone armine tried to say but mr perkins thought the headmaster could not say he neglected one who was felt to be a favoured scholar if he sent his cousin with him  so presently armine was pushed in at the back door with these words from rob to the cook—look here hes been and got cold or something  rob then disappeared and armine struggled in to the kitchen fire white sobbing and panting and as the compassionate maids discovered drenched from head to foot his hair soaked his boots squishing with water  his mother and sisters were out and as cook administered the hottest draught she could compound and emma tugged at his jacket they indignantly demanded what he had been doing to himself  nothing he said  ill go and take my things off only please dont tell mother  yes said old nurse who had tottered in but who was past fully comprehending emergencies go and get into bed my dear and emma shall come and warm it for him  no stoutly said the little boy theres nothing the matter and mother must not know  take my word for it said cook that child have a been treated shameful by those great nasty brutes of big boys  and when armine too cold to sit anywhere but by the only fire in the house returned with a book and begged humbly for leave to warm himself he was installed on nurses footstool in front of a huge fire and hot tea and lardycake tendered for his refreshment while the maids by turns pitied and questioned him  have you had a haccident sir asked cook  no he wearily said  have any one been doing anything to you then  and as he did not answer she continued you need not think to blind me sir i sees it as if it was in print  them big boys have been amisusing of you  now cook you aint to say a word to my mother cried armine vehemently  promise me  if youll tell me all about it sir said cook coaxingly  no he answered i promised  and he buried his head in nurses lap  i calls that a shame put in emma but you could tell we master armine  it aint like telling your ma nor your master  i said no one said armine  the maids left off tormenting him after a time letting him fall asleep with his head on the lap of old nurse who went on dreamily stroking his damp hair not half understanding the matter or she would have sent him to bed  being bound by no promise of secrecy emma met her mistress with a statement of the surmises of the kitchen and caroline hurried thither to find him waking to headache fiery cheeks and aching limbs which were not simply the consequence of the position in which he had been sleeping before the fire  she saw him safe in bed before she asked any questions but then she began her interrogations as little successfully as the maids  i cant mother he said hiding his face on the pillow  my little boy used to have no secrets from me  men must have secrets sometimes though they rack their hearts and— their backs sighed poor armine rolling over  oh mother my back is so bad  please dont bother besides  my poor darling  let me rub it  there you might trust mother carey  she would not tell mr ogilvie nor get any one into trouble  i promised mother  dont  and no persuasions could draw anything from him but tears  indeed he was so feverish and in so much pain that she called in dr leslie before the evening was over and rheumatic fever was barely staved off by the most anxious vigilance for the next day or two  it was further decreed that he must be carefully tended all the winter and must not go to school again till he had quite got over the shock since he was of a delicate frame that would not bear to be trifled with  the boy gave a long sigh of content when he heard that he was not to return to school at present but it did not induce him to utter a word on the cause of the wetting either to his mother or to mr ogilvie who came up in much distress and examined him as soon as he was well enough to bear it  nor would any of his schoolfellows tell jock said he had had an imposition and was kept in school when it happened john said he had nothing to do with it and rob and joe opposed surly negatives to all questions on the subject rob adding that armine was a disgusting little idiot an expression for which his father took him severely to task  however there were those in kenminster who never failed to know all about everything and the first afternoon after armines disaster that caroline came to kencroft she was received with such sympathetic kindness that her prophetic soul misgave her and she dreaded hearing either that she was letting herself be cheated by some tradesman or that she was to lose her pupils  no  after inquiries for armine his aunt said she was very sorry but now he was better she thought his mother ought to know the truth  what— asked caroline startled and jessie the only other person in the room put down her work and listened with a strange air of determination  my dear i am afraid it is very painful  tell me at once ellen  i cant think how he learnt it  but they have been about with all sorts of odd people  who  what ellen  are you accusing my boy said caroline her limbs beginning to tremble and her eyes to flash though she spoke as quietly as she could  now do compose yourself my dear  i dare say the poor little fellow knew no better and he has had a severe lesson  if you would only tell me ellen  it seems said ellen with much regret and commiseration that all this was from poor little armine using such shocking language that rob as a senior boy you know put him under the pump at last to put a stop to it  before carolines fierce incredulous indignation had found a word jessie had exclaimed mamma in a tone of strong remonstrance then never mind aunt carey i know it is only mrs coffinkey and johnny promised he would tell the whole story if any one brought that horrid nonsense to you about poor little armine  kind gentle jessie seemed quite transported out of herself as she flew to the door and called johnny leaving the two mothers looking at each other and ellen somewhat startled saying im sure if it is not true im very sorry caroline but it came from—  she broke off for johnny was scuffling across the hall calling out holloa jessie whats up  johnny shes done it said jessie  you said if the wrong one was accused you would tell the whole story  and what do they say asked john who was by this time in the room  mamma has been telling aunt carey that rob put poor little armine under the pump for using bad language  i say exclaimed john if that is not a cram  you said you knew nothing of it said his mother  i said i didnt do it  no more i did said john  no more did rob i am sure said his mother  but johnny though using no word of denial made it evident that she was mistaken as he answered in an odd tone of excuse armie was cheeky  but he didnt use bad words said caroline and she met a look of comfortable response  let us hear john said his mother now the most agitated  i cant believe that rob would so illtreat a little fellow like armie even if he did lose his temper for a moment  was armine impertinent  well rather said john  he wouldnt do robs french exercise and then—as the ladies cried out he added—o yes he knows ever so much more french than rob and now bobus is gone rob could not get anyone else  bobus  o yes bobus would do anybodys exercises at a penny for latin two for french and three for greek said john not aware of the shock he gave  and armine would not said his mother  was that it  not only that said john but the little beggar must needs up and say he would not help to act a falsehood and you know nobody could stand that  caroline understood the gravity of such an offence better than ellen did for that good lady had never had much in common with her boys after they outgrew the nursery  she answered armine was quite right  so much the worse for him i fear said caroline  yes said john it would have been all very well to give him a cuff and tell him to mind his own business  all very well ejaculated his mother  but you know continued johnny to his aunt the seniors are always mad at a junior being like that and there was another fellow who dragged him to the great school pump and put him in the trough and they said they would duck him till he swore to do whatever rob ordered  swore exclaimed his mother  you dont mean that johnny  yes i do mamma said john  i would tell you the words only you wouldnt like them  and armine said it would be breaking the third commandment which was the very way to aggravate them most  so they pumped on his head and tried if he would say it  no he said you may kill me like the forty martyrs but i wont and of course that set them on to pump the more  but johnny did you see it all cried caroline  how could you  i couldnt help it aunt carey  yes aunt carey again broke in jessie he was held down  that horridwell i wont say whom johnnyheld him and his arm was so twisted and grazed that he was obliged to come to me to put some lilyleaves on it and if he would but show it it is all black and yellow still  carey much moved went over and kissed both her boys champions while ellen said with tears in her eyes oh johnny im glad you were at least not so bad  what ended it  the schoolbell said johnny  i say please dont let rob know i told or i shall catch it  your father—  mamma  you arent going to tell him cried jessie and johnny both in horror interrupting her  yes children i certainly shall  do you think such wickedness as that ought to be kept from him  nearly killing a fatherless child like that because he was not as bad as they were and telling falsehoods about it too  i never could have believed it of rob  oh what school does to ones boys  she was agitated and overcome to a degree that startled carey who began to try to comfort her  perhaps rob did not understand what he was about and you see he was led on  armine will soon be all right again and though he is a dear good little fellow maybe the lesson may have been good for him  how can you treat it so lightly cried poor ellen in her agitated indignation  it was a mercy that the child did not catch his death and as to rob— and when mr ogilvie always said the boys were so improved and that there was no bullying  it just shows how much he knows about it  to think what they have made of my poor rob  his father will be so grieved  i should not wonder if he had a fit of the gout  the shock was far greater to her than to one who had never kept her boys at a distance and who understood their ways characters and code of honour and besides rob was her eldest and she had credited him with every sterling virtue  jessie and johnny stood aghast they had only meant to defend their little cousin and had never expected either that she would be so much overcome or that she would insist on their father knowing all as she did with increasing anger and grief at each of their attempts at persuading her to the contrary  caroline thought he ought to know  her childrens father would have known long ago but then his wrath would have been a different thing from what seemed to be apprehended from his brother and she understood the distress of jessie and john though her pity for rob was but small  whatever she tried to say in the way of generous mediation or soothing only made it worse and poor ellen far from being her serene highness was between scolding and crying in an almost hysterical state so that caroline durst not leave her or the frightened jessie and was relieved at last to hear the colonel coming into the house when thinking her presence would do more harm than good and longing to return to her little son she slipped away and was joined at the door by her own john who asked—  whats up mother  did you know all about this dreadful business jock  afterwards of course but i was shut up in school writing three hundred disgusting lines of virgil or id have got the brutes off some way  and so little armie is the brave one of all  well so he is said jock but i say mother dont go making him cockier  you know hes only fit to be stitched up in one of jessies little red sunday books and he must learn to keep a civil tongue in his head and not be an insufferable little donkey  you would not have had him give in and do it  never jock  why no but he could have got off with a little chaff instead of coming out with his testimony like that and so ive been telling him  so dont you set him up again to think himself forty martyrs all in one or there will be no living with him  if all boys were like him  jock made a sound of horror and disgust that made her laugh  hes all very well added he in excuse but to think of all being like that  the world would be only one big muff  but jock whats this about bobus being paid for doing peoples exercises  bobus is a cute one said jock  i thought he had more uprightness she sighed  and you jock  i should think not he laughed  nobody would trust me  is that the only reason she said sadly and he looked up in her face squeezed her hand and muttered—  one maynt like dirt without making such a row  thats like fathers boy she said and he wrung her hand again  they found armine coiled up before the fire with a book and jock greeted him with—  well you little donkey theres such a shindy at the croft as you never heard  mother you know cried armine running into her outstretched arms and being covered with her kisses  but who told he asked  john and jessie said jock  they always said they would if anyone said anything against you to mother or uncle robert  against me said armine  yes said jock  didnt you know it got about through some of the juniors or their sisters that it was brownlow maximus gently chastising you for bad language and of course mrs coffinkey told aunt ellen  oh but jock cried armine turning round in consternation i hope rob does not know  and on further pressing it was extracted that rob when sent home with him had threatened him with the great black vaulted cellars of kencroft if he divulged the truth  when jock left them the relief of pouring out the whole history to the mother was evidently great  you know mother i couldnt he cried as if there had been a physical impossibility  why dear child  how did you bear their horrid cruelty  i thought it could not be so bad as it was for the forty soldiers on the lake  dear grandmamma read us the story out of a little red book one sunday evening when you were gone to church  they froze you know and it was only cold and nasty for me  so the thought of them carried you through  god carried me through said the child reverently  i asked him not to let me break his commandment  just then the colonels heavy tread was heard and with him came mr ogilvie whom he had met on the road and informed  the good man was indeed terribly grieved and his first words were caroline i cannot tell you how much shocked and concerned i am and then he laid his hand on armines shoulder saying—my little boy i am exceedingly sorry for what you have suffered  one day robert will be so too  you have been a noble little fellow and if anything could console me for the part robert has played it would be the seeing one of my dear brothers sons so like his father  he gave the downcast brow a fatherly kiss so really like those of days gone by that the boys overstrained spirits gushed forth in sobs and tears of which he was so much ashamed that he rushed out of the room leaving his mother greatly overcome his uncle distressed and annoyed and his master not much less so at the revelation of so much evil so hard either to reach or to understand  i would have brought robert to apologise said the colonel if he had been as yet in a mood to do so properly  oh that would have been dreadful for us all ejaculated caroline under her breath  but i can make nothing of him continued he he is perfectly stolid and seems incapable of feeling anything though i have talked to him as i never thought to have to speak to any son of mine but he is deaf to all  the colonel in his wrath even while addressing only caroline and mr ogilvie had raised his voice as if he were shouting words of command so that both shrank a little and carey said—  i dont think he knew it was so bad  what  cheating his masters and torturing a helpless child for not yielding to his tyranny  people dont always give things their right names even to themselves said mr ogilvie  i should try to see it from the boys point of view  i have no notion of extenuating illconduct or making excuses thats the modern way  so principles get lowered  i tell you sir there are excuses for everything  what makes the difference is only the listening to them or not  yes ventured caroline but is there not a difference between finding excuses for oneself and for other people  all alike lowering the principle said the colonel with something of the same slowness of comprehension as his son  if excuses are to be made for everything i dont wonder that there is no teaching ones boys truth or common honesty and humanity  but robert said caroline roused to defence do you really mean that in your time nobody bullied or cribbed  there was some shame about it if they did said the colonel  now i suppose i am to be told that it is an ordinary custom to be connived at  certainly not by me said mr ogilvie i had hoped that the standard of honour had been raised but it is very hard to mete the exact level of the schoolboy code from the outside  and your john and mine have never given in to it added caroline  what do you propose to do mr ogilvie said the colonel  i shall do my part with my boy as a father  what will you do with him and the other bully who i find was cripps  i shall see crippss father first  i think it might be well if we both saw him before deciding on the form of discipline  we have to think not only of justice but of the effect on their characters  thats the modern system said the colonel indignantly  fine work it would make in the army  i know when punishment is deserved  i dont set up to be providence to know exactly what work it is to do i leave that to my maker and do my duty  he was cut short by his son joe rushing in headlong exclaiming—  papa papa please come  rob has knocked johnny down and he doesnt come round  colonel brownlow hurried off caroline trying to make him hear her offer to follow if she could be useful and sending jock to see whether there was any opening for her  unless the emergency were very great indeed she knew her absence would be preferred and so she and mr ogilvie remained talking the matter over with more pity for the delinquent than his own family would have thought natural  it really is a terrible thing to be stupid she said  i dont imagine that unlucky boy ever entered into his fathers idea of truth and honour which really is fine in its way  very fine and proved to have made many fine fellows in its time i dare say the lad will grow up to it but just now he simply feels cruelly injured by interference with a seniors claim to absolute submission  which he sees as singly as his father sees the simple duty of justice  it would be comfortable if we poor moderns could deal out our measures with that straightforward military simplicity  i cannot help seeing in that unfortunate boy the victim of examinations for commissions  boys must be subjected to high pressure before they can thoroughly enter into the importance of the issues that depend upon it and when a sluggish dull intellect is forced beyond endurance there is an absolute instinct of escape impelling to shifts and underhand ways of eluding work  of course the wrong is great but the responsibility rests with the taskmaster in the same manner as the thefts of a starved slave might on his owner  the taskmaster being the country  exactly so  happy those boys who have available brains like yours  ah i am very sorry about bobus what ought i to do  hardly more than write a few words of warning since the change may probably have put an end to the practice  jock presently brought back tidings that his namesake was all right except for a black eye and was growling like ten bears at having been sent to bed  uncle robert was more angry than ever in a white heat quiet and terrible said jock in an awestruck voice  he has locked rob up in his study and heres joe for aunt ellen is quite knocked up and they want the house to be very quiet  no tragical consequences however ensued  mother and sons both appeared the next morning and were reported as all right by the first inquirer from the folly but jessie came to her lessons with swollen eyelids as if she had cried half the night and when her aunt thanked her for defending armine she began to cry again and essie imparted to barbara that rob was just like a downright savage with her  no hush essie it is not that said jessie but papa is so dreadfully angry with him and he is to be sent away and it is all my fault  but jessie dear surely it is better for rob to be stopped from those deceitful ways  o yes i know  but that i should have turned against him  and jessie was so thoroughly unhappy that none of her lessons prospered and her german exercise had three great tear blots on it  robs second misdemeanour had simplified matters by deciding his father on sending him from home at once into the hands of a professed coach who would not let him elude study and whose pupils were too big to be bullied  to the last he maintained his sullen dogged air of indifference though there might be more truth than the folly was disposed to allow in his sisters allegations that it was because he did feel it so very much especially mammas looking so ill and worried  ellen did in truth look thoroughly unhinged though no one saw her give way  she felt her boys conduct sorely and grieved at the first parting in her family  besides there was anxiety for the future  robs manner of conducting his studies was no hopeful augury of his success and the expenses of sending him to a tutor fell the more heavily because unexpectedly  a horse and man were given up and jessie had to resign the hope of her music lessons  these were the first retrenchments and the diminution of dignity was felt  the colonel showed his trouble and anxiety by speaking and tramping louder than ever ruling his gardener with severe precision and thundering at his boys whenever he saw them idle  both he and his wife were so elaborately kind and polite that caroline believed that it was an act of magnanimous forgiveness for the ill luck that she and her boys had brought them  at last the colonel had the threatened fit of the gout which restored his equilibrium and brought him back to his usual condition of kindly if somewhat ponderous good sense  he had not long recovered before number nine made his appearance at kencroft and thus his mother had unusual facilities for inquiries of dr leslie respecting the master of belforest  the old man really seemed to be in a dying state  a hospital nurse had taken charge of him but there was not a dependent about the place from mr richards downwards who was not under notice to quit and most were staying on without his knowledge on the advice of the london solicitor to whom the agent had written  there was even more excitement on the intelligence that mr barnes had sent for farmer gould  on this there was no doubt for mr gould always delicately honourable towards mrs brownlow came himself to tell her about the interview  it seemed to have been the outcome of a yearning of the dying man towards the sole survivor of the companions of his early days  he had talked in a feeble wandering way of old times but had said nothing about the child and was plainly incapable of sustained attention  he had asked mr gould to come again but on this second visit he was too far gone for recognition and had returned to his moody instinctive aversion to visitors and in three days more he was dead     chapter xv  the belforest magnum bonum    where is his golden heap                divine breathings   mrs robert brownlow was churched with all the expedition possible in order that she might not lose the sight of the funeral procession which would be fully visible from the studio in the top of the tower  the excitement was increased by invitations to attend the funeral being sent to the colonel and to his two eldest nephews who were just come home for the holidays also to their mother to be present at the subsequent reading of the will  a carriage was sent for her and she entered it not knowing or caring to find out what she wished and haunted by the line die and endow a college or a cat  allen met her at the front door whispering—did you see mother he has still got his ears  and the thought crossed her—will those ears cost us dear  she was the only woman present in the library—a large room but with an atmosphere as if the open air had not been admitted for thirty years and with an enormous fire close to which was the armchair whither she was marshalled being introduced to the two solicitors mr rowse and mr wakefield who with farmer gould the agent richards the colonel and the two boys made up the audience  the lawyers explained that the will had been sent home ten years ago from yucatan and had ever since been in their hands  search had been made for a later one but none had been found nor did they believe that one could exist  it was very short  the executors were charles rowse and peter ball and the whole property was devised to them and to lieutenantcolonel robert brownlow as trustees for the testators greatniece mrs caroline otway brownlow daughter of john and caroline allen and wife of joseph brownlow esq md frcs the income and use thereof to be enjoyed by her during her lifetime and the property after her death to be divided among her children in such proportions as she should direct  that was all there was no legacy no further directions  allow me to congratulate— began the elder lawyer  no—no—oh stay a bit cried she in breathless dismay and bewilderment  it cant be  it cant mean only me  there must be something about elvira de menella  i fear there is not said mr rowse i could wish my late client had attended more to the claims of justice and had divided the property which could well have borne it but unfortunately it is not so  it is exactly as he led us to expect said mr gould  we have no right to complain and very likely the child will be much happier without it  you have a fine family growing up to enjoy it mrs brownlow and i am sure no one congratulates you more heartily than i  dont it cant be cried the heiress nearly crying and wringing the old farmers hand  he must have meant elvira  you know he sent for you  has everything been hunted over  there must be a later will  indeed mrs brownlow said the solicitor you may rest assured that full search has been made  mr richards had the same impression and we have been searching every imaginable receptacle  besides added colonel brownlow if he had made another will there would have been witnesses  yes said mr richards but to make matters certain i wrote to several of the servants to ask whether they remembered any attestation but no one did and indeed i doubt whether after his arrival here poor mr barnes ever had sustained power enough to have drawn up and executed a will without my assistance or that of any legal gentleman  it is too hard and unjust cried caroline it cannot be  i must halve it with the child as if there had been no will at all robert you know that is what your brother would have done  that would be just as well as generous indeed if it were practicable said mr rowse but unfortunately colonel brownlow and myself for mr ball is dead are in trust to prevent any such proceeding  all that is in your power is to divide the property among your own family by will in such proportion as you may think fit  quite true my dear sister said the colonel meeting her despairing appealing look as regards the principal but the ready money at the bank and the income are entirely at your own disposal and you can without difficulty secure a very sufficient compensation to the little girl out of them  no doubt said mr rowse  youll let me—youll let me mr gould implored caroline youll let me keep her and do all i can to make up to her  you see the colonel thinks it is only justice dont you robert  mrs brownlow is quite right said the colonel seeing that her vehemence was a little distrusted it will be only an act of justice to make provision for your granddaughter  i am sure colonel brownlow nothing can be handsomer than your conduct and mrs brownlows said the old man but i should not like to take advantage of what she is good enough to say on the spur of the moment till she has had more time to think it over  therewith he took leave while caroline exclaimed—  i always say there is no truer gentleman in the county than old mr gould  i shall not be satisfied about that will till i have turned everything over and the partners have been written to  again she was assured that she might set her mind at rest and then the lawyers began to read a statement of the property which made allen utter under his breath an emphatic i say but his mother hardly took it in  the heated room had affected her from the first and the bewilderment of the tidings seemed almost to crush her her heart and temples throbbed her head ached violently and while the final words respecting arrangements were passing between the colonel and the lawyers she was conscious only of a sickening sense of oppression and a fear of committing the absurdity of fainting  however at last her brotherinlaw put her into the brougham desiring the boys to walk home which they did very willingly and with a wonderful air of lordship and possession  well caroline said the colonel i congratulate you on being the richest proprietor in the county  o robert dont  if—if said a suffocated voice so miserable that he turned and took her hand kindly saying—  my dear sister this feeling is very—it becomes you well  this is a fearful responsibility  she could not answer  she only leant back in the carriage with closed eyes and moaned—  oh joe joe  indeed said his brother greatly touched we want him more than ever  he did not try to talk any more to her and when they reached the pagoda all she could do was to hurry up stairs and throwing off her bonnet bury her face in the pillow  janet and her aunt both followed the latter with kind and tender solicitude but caroline could bear nothing and begged only to be left alone  dear ellen it is very kind but nothing does any good to these headaches  please dont—please leave me alone  they saw it was the only true kindness and left her after all attempts at bathing her forehead or giving her sal volatile proved only to molest her  she lay on her bed not able to think and feeling nothing but the pain of her headache and a general weight and loneliness  the first break was from allen who came in tenderly with a cup of coffee saying that they thought her time was come for being ready for it  his manner always did her good and she sat up pushed back her hair smiled took the cup and thanked him lovingly  uncle robert is waiting to hear if you are better he said  oh yes she said thank him i am sorry i was so silly  he wants me to dine there tonight mother to meet mr rowse and mr wakefield said allen with a certain importance suited to a lad of fifteen who had just become somebody  very well she said in weary acquiescence as she lay down again just enough refreshed by the coffee to become sleepy  and mother said allen lingering in the dark dont trouble about elfie  i shall marry her as soon as i am of age and that will make all straight  her stunned sleepiness was scarcely alive to this magnanimous announcement and she dreamily said—  time enough to think of such things  i know said allen but i thought you ought to know this  he looked wistfully for another word on this great avowal but she was really too much stupefied to enter into the purport of the boys words and soon after he left her she fell sound asleep  she had a curious dream which she remembered long after  she seemed to have identified herself with king midas and to be touching all her children who turned into hard cold solid golden statues fixed on pedestals in the belforest gardens where she wandered about vainly calling them  then her husbands voice sad and reproachful seemed to say magnum bonum  magnum bonum and she fancied it the elixir which alone could restore them and would have climbed a mountain in search of it as in the arabian tale but her feet were cold heavy and immovable and she found that they too had become gold and that the chill was creeping upwards  with a scream of save the children joe she awoke  no wonder she had dreamt of cold golden limbs for her feet were really chilly as ice and the room as dark as at midnight  however it was not yet seven oclock and presently janet brought a light and persuaded her to come downstairs and warm herself  she was not yet capable of going into the diningroom to the family tea but crept down to lie on the sofa in the drawingroom and there after taking the small refreshment which was all she could yet endure she lay with closed eyes while the children came in from the meal armine and babie were the first  she knew they were looking at her but was too weary to exert herself to speak to them  asleep they whispered  poor mother carey  armie said babie is mother unhappy because she has got rich  armine hesitated  his brief experience of school had made him less unsophisticated and he seldom talked in his own peculiar fashion even to his little sister and she added—  must people get wicked when they are rich  mother is always good said faithful little armine  the rich people in the bible were all bad pondered babie  there was dives and the man with the barns  yes said armine but there were good ones too—abraham and solomon  solomon was not always good said babie and uncle robert told allen it was a fearful responsibility  what is a responsibility armie  i am sure ali didnt like it  something to answer for said armine  to who asked the little girl  to god said the boy reverently its like the talent in the parable  one has got to do something for god with it and then it wont turn to harm  like the mans treasure that changed into slate stones when he made a bad use of it said babie  oh armie what shall we do  shall we give plumpuddings to the little thin girls down the lane  and i should like to give something good to the little grey workhouse boys said armine  i should so hate always walking out along a straight road as they do  and oh armie then dont you think we may get a nice book to write out jotapata in  yes a real jolly one  for you know babie it will take lots of room even if i write my very smallest  please let it be ruled armie  and where shall we begin  oh at the beginning i think just when sir engelbert first heard about the crusade  it will take lots of books then  never mind we can buy them all now  and do you know bab i think adelmar and ermelind might find a nice lot of natural petroleum and frighten mustafa ever so much with it  for be it known that armine and barbaras most cherished delight was in one continued running invention of a defence of jotapata by a crusading family which went on from generation to generation with unabated energy though they were very apt to be reduced to two young children who held out their fortress against frightful odds of saracens and sometimes conquered sometimes converted their enemies nobody but themselves was fully kept au courant with this wonderful siege which had hitherto been recorded in interlined copybooks or little paper books pasted together and very remarkably illustrated  the door began to creak with an elaborate noisiness intended for perfect silence and jocks voice was heard  bother the door  did it wake mother  no  thats right and he squatted down between the little ones while bobus seated himself at the table with a book  well what colour shall our ponies be began jock in an attempt at a whisper  oh shall we have ponies cried the little ones  zebras if we like said jock  well have a team  cant growled bobus  why not  they can be bought  not tamed  theyve tried it at the jardin dacclimatisation  oh that was only frenchmen  a zebra is too jolly to let himself be tamed by a frenchman  ill break one in myself and go out with the hounds upon him  jackass on stripedass—or off him muttered bobus  oh dont jock implored babie youll get thrown  no such thing  youll come to the meet yourself babie on your arab  not she said bobus in his teasing voice  shell be governessed up and kept to lessons all day  mother always teaches us said babie  shell have no time shell be a great lady and youll have three governesses—one for french and one for german and one for deportment to make you turn out your toes and hold up your head and never sit on the rug  never mind babie said jock  well bother them out of their lives if they do  youll be at school said bobus and theyll all three go out walking with babie and if she goes out of a straight line one will say fi donc mademoiselle barbe and the other will say schamen sie sich fraulein barbara and the third will call for the stocks  for shame robert cried his mother hearing something like a sob how can you tease her so  mother must i have three governesses asked poor little barbara  not one cross one my sweet if i can help it  oh mother if it might be miss ogilvie said babie  yes mother do let it be miss ogilvie chimed in armine  she tells such jolly stories  she aint a very nasty one quoted jock from newman noggs and as janet appeared he received her with—moved by barbara seconded by armine that miss ogilvie become bearleader to lick you all into shape  what do you think of it janet said her mother  it will not make much difference to me said janet  i shall depend on classes and lectures when we go back to london  i should have thought a german better for the children but i suppose the chief point is to find some one who can manage elfie if we are still to keep her  by the bye where is she poor little thing asked caroline  aunt ellen took her home said janet  she said she would send her back at bedtime but she thought we should be more comfortable alone tonight  real kindness said caroline but remember children all of you that elfie is altogether one of us on perfectly equal terms so dont let any difference be made now or ever  shall i have a great many more lessons mother asked babie  dont be as silly as essie babie said janet  she expects us all to have velvet frocks and goldfringed sashes and jessies first thought was now janet youll have a ladies maid  no wonder she rejoiced to be relieved of trying to make you presentable said bobus  shall we live at belforest asked armine  part of the year said janet who was in a wonderfully expansive and genial state but we shall get back to london for the season and know what it is to enjoy life and rationality again and then we must all go abroad  mother how soon can we go abroad  it wont make a bit of difference for a year  we shant get it for ever so long said bobus  oh  fact  i know a man whose uncle left him a hundred pounds last year and the lawyers havent let him touch a penny of it  perhaps he is not of age said janet  at any rate said jock we can have our fun at belforest  o yes jock only think cried babie all the dear tadpoles belong to mother  and all the dragonflies said armine  and all the herons said jock  we can open the gates again said armine  oh the flowers cried babie in an ecstasy  yes said janet  i suppose we shall spend the early spring in the country but we must have the best part of the season in london now that we can get out of banishment and enjoy rational conversation once more  rational fiddlestick muttered bobus  thats what any girl who wasnt such a prig as janet would look for said jock  well of course said janet  i mean to have my balls like other people i shall see life thoroughly  thats just what i value this for  bobus made a scoffing noise  whats up bobus asked jock  nothing only you keep up such a row one cant read  im sure this is better and more wonderful than any book said jock  it makes no odds to me returned bobus over his book  oh now cried janet if it were only the pleasure of being free from patronage it would be something  gratitude said bobus  ill show my gratitude said janet well give all of them at kencroft all the fine clothes and jewels and amusements that ever they care for more than ever they gave us only it is we that shall give and they that will take dont you see  sweet charity quoth bobus  those two were a great contrast janet had never been so radiant feeling her sentence of banishment revoked and realising more vividly than anyone else was doing the pleasures of wealth  the cloud under which she had been ever since the coming to the pagoda seemed to have rolled away in the sense of triumph and anticipation while bobus seemed to have fallen into a mood of sarcastic ill temper  his mother saw and it added to her sense of worry though her bright sweet nature would scarcely have fathomed the cause even had she been in a state to think actively rather than to feel passively  bobus only a year younger than allen and endowed with more force and application if not with more quickness had always been on a level with his brother and felt superior despising allens eton airs and graces and other characteristics which most people thought amiable  and now allen had become son and heir and was treated by everyone as the only person of importance  bobus did not know what his own claims might be but at any rate his brothers would transcend them and his temper was thoroughly upset  poor caroline  she did not wholly omit to pray in all time of our tribulation in all time of our wealth deliver us but if she had known all that was in her childrens hearts her own would have trembled more  and as to ellen the utmost she allowed herself to say was well i hope she will make a good use of it  while the colonel as trustee and adviser had really a very considerable amount of direct importance and enjoyment before him which might indeed be—to use his own useful phrase—a fearful responsibility but was no small boon to a man with too much time on his hands     chapter xvi  possession    vain glorious elf said he dost thou not weete that money can thy wants at will supply shields steeds and armes and all things for thee meet it can purvey in twinkling of an eye                                          spenser   bobuss opinion that it would be long before anything came of this accession of wealth was for a few days verified in the eyes of the impatient family for christmas interfered with some of the necessary formalities and their mother still thinking that another will might be discovered declared that they were not to go within the gates of belforest till they were summoned  at last after colonel brownlow had spent a day in london he made his appearance with a chequebook in his hand and the information that he and his fellowtrustee had so arranged that the heiress could open an account and begin to enter on the fruition of the property there were other arrangements to be made those about the outdoor servants and keepers could be settled with richards but she ought to remove her two sons from the foundation of the two colleges though of course they would continue there as pupils  and robert she said colouring exceedingly if you will let me there is a thing i wish very much—to send your john to eton with mine  he is my godson you know and it would be such a pleasure to me  thank you caroline said the colonel after a moments hesitation johnny is to stand at the eton election and i should prefer his owing his education to his own exertions rather than to any kindness  yes yes i understand that said caroline but i do want you to let me do anything for any of them  i should be so grateful she added imploringly with a good deal of agitation please—please think of it as if your brother were still here  you would never mind how much he did for them  yes i should said the colonel decidedly but pausing to collect his next sentence  i should not accept from him what might teach my sons dependence  you see that caroline  yes she humbly said  he would be wise about it  i dont want to be disagreeable and oppressive robert i will never try to force things on you but please let me do all that is possible to you to allow  there was something touching in her incoherent earnestness which made the colonel smile yet wink away some moisture from his eyes as he again thanked her without either acceptance or refusal  then he said he was going to belforest and asked whether she would not like to come and look over the place  he would go back and call for her with the pony carriage  but would not ellen like to go she said  i will walk with the boys  the colonel demurred a little but knowing that his wife really longed to go and could not well be squeezed into the back seat he gave a sort of half assent and as he left the house mother carey gave a summoning cry to gather her brood rushed upstairs put on what babie called her most every dayest old black hat and when colonel and mrs brownlow with jessie behind drove into the park it was to see her careering along by the short cut over the hoar frosty grass in the midst of seven boys three girls and two dogs all in a most frisky mood of exhilaration  distressed at appearing to drive up like the lady of the house her serene highness insisted on stopping at the iron gates of the stately approach  there she alighted and waited to make the best setting to rights she could of the heiresss windtossed hat and cloak and would have put her into the carriage but that no power could persuade her to mount that triumphal car and all that could be obtained was that she should walk in the forefront of the procession with the colonel  there was nobody to receive them but richards for the servants had been paid off and only a keeper and his wife were living in the kitchen in charge  there was a fire in the library where the colonel had business to transact with richards while the ladies and children proceeded with their explorations  it was rather awful at first in the twilight gloom of the great hall with a painted mythological ceiling and cold white pavement varied by long perspective lines of black lozenges on which every footfall echoed the first door that they opened led into a vast and dreary dining room with a carpet forming a crimson roll at one end and long ranks of faded leathern chairs sitting in each others laps  at one end hung a huge picture by snyders of a bear hugging one dog in his forepaws and tearing open the ribs of another with his hind ones opposite was a wild boar impaling a hound with his tusk and the other walls were occupied by herodias smiling at the contents of her charger judith dropping the gory head into her bag a brown st sebastian writhing among the arrows and juno extracting the painfully flesh and blood eyes of argus to set them in her peacocks tail  i object to eating my dinner in a butchers shop observed allen  yes we must get them out of this place said his mother  they are very valuable paintings interposed ellen  i know they are in the county history  they were collected by sir francis bradford from whom the place was bought and he was a great connoisseur  yes they are just the horrid things great connoisseurs of the last century liked by way of giving themselves an appetite said caroline  are not fine pictures always horrid asked jessie in all simplicity  the drawingrooms a whole suite—antechamber saloon musicroom and cardroom were all swathed up in brown holland hanging even from the picture rods along the wall  even in the days of the most liberal housekeeper ellen had never done more than peep beneath  so she revelled in investigations of gilding and yellow satin ormolu and marble big mirrors and sevres clocks a threepiled carpet and a dazzling prismatic chandelier though all was pervaded with such a chill of unused dampness and odour of fustiness that carolines first impression was that it was a perilous place for one so lately recovered  however ellen believed in no danger till she came on two monstrous stains of damp on the walls with a whole crop of curious fungi in one corner and discovered that all the holland was flabby and all the damask clammy  then she enforced the instant lighting of fires and shivered so decidedly that caroline and jessie begged her to return to the fire in the library while jessie went in search of rob to drive her home  all the rest of the younger population had deserted the state apartments and were to be heard in the distance clattering along the passages banging doors bawling and shouting to each other with freaks of such laughter as had never awakened those echoes during the barnes tenure but jessie returned not and her aunt going in quest of her up a broad flight of shallow stairs found herself in a grand gallery with doors leading to various corridors and stairs  she called and the tramp of the boots of youth began to descend on her with shouts of all right and downstairs flowed the troop beginning with jock and ending with armine and babie each with some breathless exclamation all jumbled together—  jock  oh mother  stunning  lots of bats fast asleep  johnny  rats rats  rob  a billiardtable  joe  mother carey may pincher kill your rats  armine  one wants a clue of thread to find ones way  janet  ive counted fiveandthirty bedrooms already and thats not all  babie  and theres a little copper teakettle in each  may my dolls have one  bobus  theres nothing else in most of them and my eyes how musty they smell  elvira  i will have the room with the big red bed with a gold crown at the top  allen  mother it will be a magnificent place but it must have a vast deal done to it  but mother carey was only looking for jessie  no one had seen her janet suggested that she had taken a rat for a ghost and they began to look and call in all quarters till at last she appeared looking rather white and scared at having lost herself being bewildered by the voices and steps echoing here there and everywhere  the barrenness and uniformity did make it very easy to get lost for even while they were talking joe was heard roaring to know where they were nor would he stand still till they came up with him but confused them and himself by running to meet them by some deluding stair  weve not got a house but a cretan labyrinth said babie  or the bewitched castle mother told us of said allen where everybody was always running round after everybody  youve only to have a grain of sense said bobus who had at last recovered joe and proceeded to give them a lecture on the two main arteries and the passages communicating with them so that they might always be able to recover their bearings  they were more sober after that  rob drove his mother home and the colonel made the round to inspect the dilapidations and estimate what was wanting  the great house had never been thoroughly furnished since the bradfords had sold it and it was besides in manifest need of repair  damp corners and piles of crumbled plaster told their own tale  a builder must be sent to survey it and on the most sanguine computation it could hardly be made habitable till the end of the autumn  meantime caroline must remain a tenant of the pagoda though as she told the eager janet this did not prevent a stay in london for the sake of the classes and the society of whom she was always talking only there must be time to see their way  the next proposition gave universal satisfaction mother carey would take her whole brood to london for a day to make purchases the three elder children each with five pounds the younger with two pounds apiece  she actually wanted to take twothirds of those from kencroft also with the same bounty in their pockets but to this their parents absolutely refused consent  to go about london with a train of seven was bad enough but that was her own affair and they could not prevent it and they absolutely would not swell the number to thirteen  it would be ridiculous she would want an omnibus to go about in  i did not mean all to go about together  the elder boys will go their own way  but as the colonel observed that was all very well for boys whose home had always been in london but she would find his country lads much in her way  she then reduced her demand by a third for she really wished for johnny but the colonels principles would not allow him to accept so great an indulgence for rob  that unlucky fellow had of course failed in his examination and this had renewed the colonels resentment at his laziness and shuffling  he was however improved by contact with strangers looked and behaved less bearishly and had acquired a will to do better  still it was not possible to regret his absence except because it involved that of his brother and with a great effort and many assurances of her being really needed jessies company was secured  never was the taste of wealth sweeter than in that overfilled railway carriage before it was light on the winter morning with a vista of endless possibilities contained in those crackling notes and round gold pieces jessie being of course as well off as the rest and feeling the novelty and wonder even more  mrs actons house was to be the place of rendezvous and she would take charge of the girls for part of the day the boys wished to shift for themselves and allen and bobus had friends of their own with whom they meant to lunch  clara met her friend with an agitated manner halflaughing half crying as she said—  well mother carey dear you havent quite soared above us yet  petrels never take high flights said carey i hope and trust that it may prove impossible to make a fine lady of me  i am caught late you see  your daughters are not  you wont like to have them making excuses for mammas friends  janets exclusiveness will not be of that sort and for warmhearted little babie trust her  do you know where the ogilvies can be written to clara  are they at rome or florence  they were to be at florence by the l4th  mary has learnt to be such a traveller that she always drags her brother abroad for however short a time st kenelm may give her  i hope i shall catch her in time  we want her for our governess  now really carey you are a woman for old friends  but do you think you will get on  you know she wont spare you  thats the very reason i want her  it is very generous of you  you always were the best little thing in the world with a strong turn for being under the lash so youre going to keep the slave in the back of your triumphal chariot like the roman general  i see youre afraid she will teach me to be too proper behaved for you  precisely so after her experience of russian countesses  i dont know whether she will let you be mistress of your own house  she will make me mistress all the more said caroline for she will make me all the more queen oer myself  then began the shopping such shopping extraordinary as none of the family had ever enjoyed except in dreams and when it was the object of everybody to conceal their purchases from everybody else caroline contrived to make time for a quiet luncheon with dr and mrs lucas to which she took her two youngest boys since jock was the godson of the house and had moreover been shaken off by his two elder brothers  happily he was too goodtempered to grumble at being thrown over and his mind was in a beatific state of contemplation of his newlypurchased treasures a small pistol a fifteenbladed knife and a box of miscellaneous sweets although his mother had so far succumbed to the weakness of her sex as to prevent the weapon from being accompanied by any ammunition  as to armine she wanted to consult dr lucas about the fragile looks and liability to cold that had alarmed her ever since robs exploit besides he was so unlike the others  had she not seen him quietly make his way into the drawingroom where mrs lucas kept a box for the childrens hospital and drop into it two bright florins one of which she had seen babie hand over to him  i do think it is not canny she said as if it had been one of his symptoms  do you want me to prescribe for it  i did try one prescription for having too big a soul i turned my poor little boy loose into school and there they half killed him for me and made the original complaint worse  happily no prescription neither life nor death nor any other creature can cure that complaint said the good old doctor though alas it is only too apt to dry up from within  still i cant help feeling it rather awful to have to do with a being so spiritual as that and it appears to me to increase on him so that he never seems quite to belong to me  and precocity is a dangerous sign is it not  i see said the doctor smiling you are going to be a treasure to the faculty and indulge in anxieties and consultations  now dr lucas you know that we were always anxious about armine you remember his father said he needed more care than the rest  dr lucas allowed that this was true but he only recommended flannel pale ale moderation in study and time to recover the effects of the pump  both the good old friends were very kind and full of tender congratulation mingled with a little anxiety though they were pleased with her good taste and simplicity and absence of all elation  but then she had hardly realised the new position and seemed to look neither behind nor before  her only scheme seemed to be to take a house in london for a few months and then perhaps to go abroad but of this she could not talk in those old scenes which vividly brought back that castle in the air never fulfilled of a holiday in switzerland with joe  on leaving the lucases she sent her boys on before her to the nearest bazaar and was soon at her old home  kind mrs drake effaced herself as much as possible and let her roam about the house alone but furniture had altered every room so that no responsive chord was touched till she came to the study which was little changed  there she shut herself in and strove to recall the touch of the hand that was gone the sound of the voice that was still  she stood where she had been wont to stand over her husband when he had been busy at his table and she had run down with some inquiry and with a yearning ache of heart she clasped her hands and almost breathed out the words o joe joe dear father  oh for one moment of you to tell me what to do and how to keep true to the charge you gave me—your magnum bonum  so absolutely had she asked the question that she waited almost expecting a reply but there was no voice and none to answer her and she was turning away with a sickening sense of mockery at her own folly in seeking the empty shrine whence the oracle of her life had departed when her eye fell on the engraving over the mantelpiece it was the one thing for which mr drake had begged as a memorial of joe brownlow and it still hung in its old place  it was of the great physician consoling and healing all around—the sick the captive the selftormenting genius the fatherless the widow  was this the answer  something darted through her mind like a pang followed by a strange throb—give yourself up to him  seek the true good first  the other may lie on its way  but it was only a pang  the only toonatural recoil came the next minute  was not she as religious as there was any need to be or at least as she could be without alienating her children or affecting more than she felt  give herself to him  how  did that mean a great deal of churchgoing sermonreading cottage visiting prayers meditations and avoidance of pleasure  that would never do the boys would not bear it and janet would be alienated besides it would be hypocrisy in one who could not sit still and think or attend to anything lengthy and wearisome  so as a kind of compromise she looked at the photograph which hung below and to it she almost spoke out her answer  yes ill be very good and give away lots of things  mary ogilvie shall come and keep me in order and she wont let me be naughty if i ever want to be naughty when i get away from ellen  then magnum bonum shall have its turn too  dont be afraid dearest  if allen does not take to it now i am sure bobus will be a great chemical discoverer able to give all his time and spare no expense and then we will fit up this dear old house for a hospital for very poor people  thats what you would have done if you had been here  oh if this money had only come in time  but here are these horrid tears  if i once begin crying i shall be good for nothing  if i dont go at once theres no saying what jock maynt have bought  she was just in time to find jock asking the price of all the animals in the pantheon bazaar and expecting her to supply the cost of a viciouslooking monkey  the whole flock collected in due time at the station and so did their parcels  allen brought with him his chief purchase the most lovely toyterrier in the world whom he presented on the spot to elvira and who divided the journey between licking himself and devouring the fragments of biscuit with which jock supplied him  allen had also bought a beautiful statuette for himself and a set of studs  janet had set herself up with a case of mathematical instruments and various books bobuss purchases were divers chemical appliances and a pocket microscope also what he thrust into jessies lap and she presently proclaimed to be a lovely little workcase jessie herself was hugging a parcel which turned out to contain warm pelisses for the two nursery boys just above the baby  for the adaptation of their seniors last years garments had not proved so successful as not to have much grieved the good girl and her mother  elviras money had all gone into an accordion and a necklace of large blue beads  didnt you get anything for your grandfather or your cousins said caroline  i wanted it all said elfie and you only gave me two sovereigns or i would have had the bracelets too  never mind elfie cried babie ive got something for mr gould and for kate and mary  have you babie  so have i returned armine and the two who had been wedged into one seat began a whispering conversation by which the listeners might have learnt that there was a friendly rivalry as to which had made the two pounds provide the largest possible number of presents  neither had bought anything for self for the chest of drawers bath and broom were for babies precious dolls not for herself  mother carey uncle and aunt brothers sisters cousins servants mr gould the gardeners grandson the old applewoman the little thin girls had all been provided for at that wonderful german bazaar and the only regret was that gifts for mr ogilvie and alfred richards could not be brought within the powers of even two pounds  what had mother carey bought  ah  nobody was to know till twelfthday and then the first tree cut at belforest would be a christmastree  then came a few regrets that everybody had proclaimed their purchases and therewith people began to grow weary and drop asleep  it was by gaslight that they arrived at home and bundled into the flys that awaited them and then in the hall at home came elviras cry—  wheres my doggie my chico  here i took him out said jock  thats not chico thats a nasty horrid yellow cur  chico was black  you naughty boy jock youve been and changed my dog  has midas changed him to gold cried babie  ah said bobus meaningly  youve done it then bobus  youve put something to him  i havent said bobus but hes been licking himself all the way home  well we all know green is the sacred colour of the grand turk  no  you dont mean it said allen catching up the dog and holding him to the lamp while janet observed that he was a sort of chameleon for his body which had been black was now yellow and his chops which had been tan had become black  elvira began to cry angrily still uncomprehending and fancying bobus and jock had played her a trick and changed her dog allen abused the horrid little brute and the more horrid man who had deceived him and armine began pitying and caressing him seriously distressed lest the poor little beast should have poisoned himself caroline herself expected to have heard that he was dead the next morning and would have felt more compassion than regret but to her surprise and allens chagrin chico made his appearance very rhubarbcoloured and perfectly well  i think said elvira i will give chico to grandpapa for a nice london present  everybody burst out laughing at this piece of generosity and though the young lady never quite understood what amused them and allen heartily wished chico among the army of dogs at river hollow he did somehow or other remain at the folly and after the fashion of dogs adopted jock as the special object of his devotion  ellen came in expecting to regale her eyes with the newest fashions or were they all coming down from the dressmaker  i had no time to be worried with dressmakers said caroline  i thought you went there while the girls were going about with mrs acton  indeed no  i had just got my new bonnet for the winter  but  and indeed i have not inherited any more heads  ellen sighed at the impracticability of her sisterinlaw and the blindness of fortune  but nobody could sigh long in the face of that twelfthday christmastree  what need be said of it but that each member of the house of brownlow and each of its dependents obtained the very thing that the brighteyed fairy of the family had guessed would be most acceptable     chapter xvii  popinjay parlour    happiest of all in that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed                             merchant of venice   it is our melancholy duty to record the demise of james barnes esq which took place at his residence at belforest park near kenminster on the 20th of december  the lamented gentleman had long been in failing health and an attack of paralysis which took place on the 19th terminated fatally  the vast property which the deceased had accumulated chiefly by steamboat and railway speculations in the west indies rendered him one of the richest proprietors in the county  we understand that the entire fortune is bequeathed solely to his grandniece mrs caroline otway brownlow widow of the late joseph brownlow esq and at present resident in the pagoda kenminster hill  her eldest son allen brownlow esq is being educated at eton  that was the paragraph which david ogilvie placed before the eyes of his sister in a newspaper lent to him in the train by a courteous fellowtraveller  poor caroline said mary  they said no more till the next day when after the english service at florence they were strolling together towards san miniato and feeling themselves entirely alone  i wonder whether this is true began mary at last  why not true  i thought mr barnes had threatened the boys that they should remember the midas escapade  it must have been only a threat  it could only lie between her and the spanish child and if report be true even the half would be an enormous fortune  will it be fortune or misfortune i wonder  at any rate it puts an end to my chances of being of any service to her  be it the half or the whole she is equally beyond my reach  as she was before  dont misinterpret me mary  i mean out of reach of helping her in any way  i was of little use to her before  i could not save little armine from those brutal bullies and never suspected the abuse that engulphed bobus  i am not fit for a schoolmaster  to tell the truth i doubt whether you have enough high spirits or geniality  thats the very thing  i cant get into the boys or prevent their thinking me a don  i had hoped there was improvement but the revelations of the halfyear have convinced me that i knew just nothing at all about it  have you thought what you will do  as soon as i get home i shall send in my notice of resignation at midsummer  that will see out her last boy if he stays even so long  and then  i shall go for a year to a theological college and test my fitness to offer myself for holy orders  a look of satisfaction on his sisters part made him add perhaps you were disappointed that i was not ordained on my fellowship seven years ago  certainly i was but i was in russia and i thought you knew best so i said nothing  you were right  you would only have heard what would have made you anxious  not that there was much to alarm you but it is not good for any one to be left so entirely without home influences as i was all the time you spent abroad  i fell among a set of daring talkers who thought themselves daring thinkers and though the foundations were never disturbed with me i was not disposed to bind myself more closely to what might not bear investigation and i did not like the aspect of clerical squabbles on minutiae  there was a tide against the life that carried me along with it half from sound half from unsound motives and i shrank from the restraint outward and inward  very likely it was wise and the best thing in the end  but what has brought you to it  i hope not as the resource of a shelved schoolmaster  oh no you are not shelved  see how you have improved the school look at the numbers  that is no test of my real influence over the boys  i teach them i keep them in external order but i do not get into them  the religious life is at a low ebb  no wonder with that vicar but you have done your best  even if my attempts are a laymans best they always get quenched by the cold water of the rigby element  it is hard for boys to feel the reality of what is treated with such businesslike indifference and set forth so feebly not to say absurdly  i know  it is a terrible disadvantage  listening to rigby has i must say done a good deal to bring about my present intention  by force of contradiction  if that means of longing to be in his place and put the thing as it ought to be put  it is a contradiction in which i most sincerely rejoice david she said one of the wishes of my heart fulfilled when i had given it up  you do not know that it will be fulfilled  i think it will though you are right to take time in case the decision should be partly due to disappointment  if there can be disappointment where hope has never existed  but if a man finds he cant have his great good it may make him look for the greater  mary sighed a mute and thankful acquiescence  the worst of it is about you mary  it is throwing you over just as you were coming to make me a home  never mind davie  it is only deferred and at any rate we can keep together till midsummer  then i can go out again for a year or two and perhaps you will settle somewhere where the curates sister could get a daily engagement  the next day they found the following letter at the post office—                                            the folly jan 3rd  my dear mary—i suppose you may have attained the blessed realms that lie beyond the borders of gossip and may not have heard the nine days wonder that belforest had descended on the folly and that poor old mr barnes has left his whole property to me  my dear it would be something awful even if he had done his duty and halved it between elvira and me and he has ingeniously tied it up with trustees so as to make restitution impossible  as it is my income will be not less than forty thousand pounds a year and when divided among the children they will all be richer than perhaps is good for them  and now my dear old dragon will you come and keep me in order under the title of governess to barbara and elvira  for of course the child will go on living with us and will have it made up to her as far as possible  you know that i shall do all manner of foolish things but i think they will be rather fewer if you will only come and take me in hand  my trustees are the colonel and an old solicitor and will both look after the estate but as for the rest all that the colonel can say is that it is a frightful respons ibility and her serene highness is awestruck  i could not have conceived that such a thing could have made so much difference in so really good a woman  now i dont think you will be subject to gold dust in the eyes and i believe you will still see the same little wild goose or stormy petrel that you used to bully at bath and will be even more willing to perform the process  as i should have begun by saying on the very first evening babie showed her sense by proposing you as governess and you were unanimously elected in full and free parliament  it really was the childs own thought and proposal and what i want is to have those two children made wiser and better than i can make them as well as that you should be the dear comrade and friend i need more than ever  you will see more of your brother than you could otherwise for belforest will be our chief home and i need not say how welcome he will always be there it is not habitable at present so i mean to stay on in the folly till easter and then give janet the london lectures and classes she has been raving for these two years and take jessie also for music lessons if she can be spared  im afraid it is a come down for a finisher like you to condescend to my little babie but she is really worth teaching and i would say make your own terms but that i am afraid you would not ask enough please let it be one hundred and fifty pounds theres a good mary i think you would come if you knew what a relief it would be  ever since that terrible august two years and a half ago i have felt as if i were drifting in an endless mist with all the children depending on me and nobody to take my hand and lead me  you are one of the straws i grasp at  not very complimentary after all but when i thought of the strong warm guiding hands that are gone i could not put it otherwise  do mary come i do need you so                                               your affectionate                                                  c o brownlow   may i see it asked david  if you will but i dont think it will do you any good  my poor carey  few women would have written such a letter in all the first flush of wealth  no theres great sweetness and humility and generosity in it dear child  it changes the face of affairs  im engaged to you  nonsense  as if that would stand in the way  besides she will be at kenminster till easter  you are not hesitating mary  i dont think i am and yet i believe i ought to do so  you are not imagining that i—  i was not thinking of you but i am not certain that it would not be better for our old friendship if i did not accept the part poor carey proposes to me  i might make myself more disagreeable than could be endured by forty thousand a year  you do yourself and her equal injustice  i shall settle nothing till i have seen her  then you will be fixed he said in a tone of conviction  so she expected though believing that it would be the ruin of her pleasant old friendship  her nineteen years of governessship had shown her more of the shady side of high life than was known to her brother or her friend  she knew that whatever the owner may be at the outset it is the tendency of wealth and power to lead to arbitrariness and impatience of contradiction and censure and to exact approval and adulation  even if caroline brownlows own nature should at fiveandthirty be too much confirmed in sweetness and generosity to succumb to such temptation her children would only too probably resent any counterinfluence and set themselves against their mothers friend and guide under the title of governess moreover mary was too clearsighted not to feel that there was a lack in the brownlow household of what alone could give her confidence in the charming qualities of its mistress  yet she knew that her brother would never forgive her for refusing and that she should hardly forgive herself for following—not so much her better as her more prudent judgment  for she was infinitely touched and attracted by that warmhearted letter and could not bear to meet it with a refusal  she hoped for a time at least to be a comfort and to make suggestions with some chance of being attended to  such aid seemed due from the old friendship at whatever peril thereto and she would leave her final answer till she should see whether her friends letter had been written only on the impulse of the moment and half retracted immediately after  the brother and sister crossed the channel at night and arrived at kenminster at noon on a miserably wet day  at the station they were met by jock and a little yellow dog  his salutation as he capped his master was—  please mother sent me up to see if you were come by this train because if youd come to early dinner she would be glad because theres a builder or somebody coming with uncle robert about the repairs afterwards  mother sent the carriage because of the rain i say isnt it jolly cats and dogs  mary was an old traveller who could sleep anywhere and had made her toilet on landing so as to be fresh and ready but david was yellow and languid enough to add force to his virtuous resolution to take no advantage of the invitation but leave his sister to settle her affairs her own way thinking perhaps she might trust his future discretion the more for his present abstinence so he went off in the omnibus  jock with the unfailing courtesy of the brood handed miss ogilvie into a large closed waggonette explaining we have this for the present and a couple of job horses but uncle robert is looking out for some real good ones and ponies for all of us  i am going over with him to woolmarston tomorrow to try some  it was said rather magnificently and mary answered you must be glad to get back into the belforest grounds  aint we  it was just in time for the skating said jock  only the worst of it is everybody will come to the lake and so mother wont learn to skate  we thought we had found a jolly little place in the wood where we could have had some fun with her but they found it out though we halloed as loud as ever we could to keep them off  can your mother skate  no you see she never had a chance at home  father was so busy and we were so little but shed learn  mother carey can learn anything if one could hinder her serene highness from pitching into her  i say miss ogilvie youll give her leave to skate wont you he asked in an insinuating tone  i give her leave  she always says shell ask you when we want her to be jolly and not mind her serene highness  mary avoided pledging herself and jocks attention was diverted to the dog who was rising on his hind legs vainly trying to look out of the window and his history told with great gusto by jock lasted till they reached home  the drawingroom was full of girls about their lessons as usual— sums exercises music and grammar all going on at once but caroline put an end to them and sent the kencroft party home at once in the carriage  so you have not dropped the old trade said mary  i couldnt  ellen is not strong enough yet to have the children on her hands all day  i said id be responsible for them till easter and i dare say you wont mind helping me through it as the beginning of everything  will you condescend  you know i want to be your pupil too  you can be no ones pupil but your own my dear no ones on earth i mean  oh dont  i know that mary  im trying and trying to be their pupil still  indeed i am  it makes me patient of robert and his fearful responsibility and his good little sister to know that my husband always thought him right and meant him to look after me but as one lives on those dear voices seem to get farther and farther away as if one was drifting more out of reach in the fog i do hate myself for it but i cant help it  is there not a voice that can never go out of reach and that brings you nearer to them  you dear old piety prudence and charity all in one  that is if you have the charity to come and infuse a little of your piety and prudence into me  you know you could always make me mind you and youll make me—what is it that mrs coffinkey says—a credit to my position before youve done  ive had your room got ready wont you come and take off your things  i think if you dont object i had better sleep at the schoolhouse and come up here after davids breakfast  very well i wont try to rob him of you more than can be helped though you know he would be welcome here every evening if he liked  thank you very much i can help him more at home but ill come for the whole day for i am sure you must have a great deal on your hands  well  ive almost as many classes as pupils and then there are so many interruptions  the colonel is always bringing something to be signed and then people will come and offer themselves though im sure i never asked them  yesterday there was a stupendous butler and housesteward who could also act as courier and would do himself the honour of arranging my household in a truly ducal style  just as i got rid of him came a man with a future history of the landed gentry in quest of my coat of arms and genealogy also three wine merchants a landscape gardener and a woman with a pitcher of goldfish  emma is so soft she thinks everybody is a gentleman  i am trying to get the good old manservant we had in our old home to come and defend me not that he is old for he was a boy whom joe trained  oh mary the bewilderment of it and she pushed back the little stray curly rings of hair on her forehead while a peal at the bell was heard and a card was brought in  oh  emma dont bring me any more  is it a gentleman  y—es maam  leastways it is a clergyman  the clergyman turned out to be a dissenting minister seeking subscriptions and he was sent off with a sovereign  i know it was very weak she said but it was the only way to stop his mouth and i must have time to talk to you so dont begin your mission by scolding me  terms were settled mary would remain at the schoolhouse but daily come to the pagoda till the removal to london when her residence was to begin in earnest  she took up her line from the first as governess dropping her friends christian name and causing her pupils to address herself as miss ogilvie a formality which was evidently approved by mrs robert brownlow and likewise by janet  that young lady was wonderfully improved by prosperity  she had lost her caustic manner and air of defiance so that her cleverness and originality made her amusing instead of disagreeable  she piqued herself on taking her good fortune sensibly and though fully seventeen professed not to know or care whether she was out or not but threw herself into hard study with a view to her classes and gladly availed herself of miss ogilvies knowledge of foreign languages  mrs coffinkey supposed that she would be presented at court with her dear mamma but she laughed at courts and ceremonies and her mother said that the first presentation in the family would be of allens wife when he was a member of parliament  but janet was no longer at war with kenminster  she laughed goodhumouredly and was not always struggling for selfassertion since the humiliations of going about as the poor plain cousin of the pretty miss brownlow were over  now that she was the rich miss brownlow she was not likely to feel that she was the plain one  the sense of exile was over when the house in london was taken and so janet could afford to be kind to kenminster and she was like the janet of old times without her slough of captious disdain  even then there was a sense that the girl was not fathomed she never seemed to pour out her inner self but only to talk from the surface and certainly not to have any full confidence with her mother—nay rather to hold her cheap  mary ogilvie detected this disloyal spirit and was at a loss whether to ascribe it to modern hatred of control to the fact that caroline had been in her old home more like the favourite child than the mother or to her own eager naturalness of demeanour and total lack of assumption  she was anything but weak yet she could not be dignified and was quite ready to laugh at herself with her children janet could hardly be overawed by a mother who had been challenged by her own gamekeeper creeping down a ditch with the two johns to see a wild duck on her nest and with her hat half off and her hair disordered by the bushes  the folly laughed till its sides ached at the adventure and caroline asked mary if she were not longing to scold her  no i think you will soon grow more cautious about getting into ridiculous positions  isnt laughing a wholesome pastime  not when it is at those who ought to be looked up to  oh  im not made to be looked up to  im not going to be a hero to my valet de chambre or to anybody else my dear if thats what you want of me  mary secretly hoped that a little more dignity would come in the london life and was relieved when the time came for the move  the new abode was a charming house with the park behind it and the space between nearly all glass  great ferns tall citrons fragrant shrubs brilliant flowers grew there a stonelined pool with waterlilies above goldfish below and a cool sparkling babbling fountain in the middle  there was an open space round it with low chairs and tables and the parrot on her perch  indeed popinjay parlour was the family title of this delightful abode but it might almost as well have been called mother careys bower  here after an audience with the housekeeper who was even more overpowering than her serene highness would caroline retreat to write notes keep accounts and hear armines lessons secure before luncheon from all unnecessary interruption and here was her special afternoon and evening court  this first summer she was free to take her own course as to society for janet cared for the cambridge examination far more than for gaiety and thus she had no call and no heart for going out even if she had as yet been more known  some morning calls were exchanged but she sent refusals on mourning cards to invitations to evening parties though she took her young people to plays concerts and operas and all that was pleasant  her young people included jessie  colonel and mrs brownlow made her a visit as soon as she was settled and were so much edified by the absence of display and extravagance that they did not scruple to trust their daughter to her for the longdesired musiclessons  caroline had indeed made no attempt to win her way into the great world but she had brought together as much as possible of the old society of her former home  on two evenings in the week the habitues of joe brownlows house were secure of finding her either in the drawingroom or conservatory beautiful things and new books and papers on the tables good music on the piano sometimes acted charades or paper games according to the humour or taste of the party  if she had been a beautiful duchess popinjay parlour would have been a sort of salon bleu but it was really a kind of paradise to a good many clever hardworked men and women  those of the upper world such as kenminster county folks old acquaintances of her husband or natural adherents of midas who found their way to these receptions either thought them odd but charming or else regretted that mrs brownlow should get such queer people together and turn hyde corner house into another folly  mary ogilvie enjoyed but not without misgivings  it was delightful and yet what with joe brownlow and his mother had been guarded might become less safe with no leader older or of more weight than carey who could easily be carried along by what they would have checked  the older and more intimate friends always acted as a wholesome restraint but when they were not present there was sometimes a tone that jarred on the reverent ear or dealt with life and its mysteries in a sneering mocking style  this was chiefly among newcomers introduced by former acquaintances and it never went far but mary was distressed by seeing janets relish for such conversation  nita ray was the chief female offender in this way and this was the more unfortunate as sunday was her only free day  those sundays vexed marys secret soul  no one interfered with her way of spending them but that was the very cause of misgiving everybody went to church in the morning but just where and as they pleased meeting at luncheon with odd anecdotes of their adventures and criticisms of music or of sermons  it was an easygoing meal lasting long and haunted by many acquaintances for whose sake the table was always at its full length and spread with varieties of delicacies that would endure waiting  people dropped in helped themselves ate and drank and then adjourned to popinjay parlour where the afternoon was spent in an easygoing loitering way more like a foreign than an english sunday  miss ogilvie used to go to the litany at one of the churches near armine always came with her and often brought babie and jessie came too as soon as that good girl had swallowed the fact that the litany could stand alone  janet was apt to be walking with nita or else in some eager and amusing conversation in the conservatory and as to elvira she was the prettiest most amusing plaything that mrs brownlows house afforded a great favourite and a continual study to the artist friends  mary used to find her chattering coquetting and romping on coming in to the afternoon tea which she would fain have herself missed but that her absence gave pain and as much offence as one so kind as mrs brownlow could take  carey argued that most of her guests were people who seldom had leisure to enjoy rest conversation and variety of pretty things and that it would be mere puritan crabbedness to deny them the pleasures of popinjay parlour on the only day they could be happy there  it was not easy to answer the argument though the strong feeling remained that it was not keeping sunday as the true lords day  while abstinence from such enjoyments created mere negative dulness there must be something wrong  otherwise mary was on the happiest terms made her own laws and duties and was treated like a sister by caroline while the children were heartily fond of her all except elvira who made a fierce struggle against her authority and then finding that it was all in vain conformed as far as her innate idleness and excitability permitted  she behaved better to miss ogilvie than to janet with whom she kept up a perpetual petty warfare sometimes mary thought with the pertinacity of a spiteful elf making a noise when janet wanted quiet losing no opportunity of upsetting her books or papers and laughing boisterously at any little mishap that befell her  the only reason she ever gave when pushed hard was that janet was so ugly she could not help it a reason so utterly ridiculous that there was no going any further  janet on the whole behaved much better under the annoyance than could have been expected  she entered enough into the state of affairs to see that the troublesome child could hardly be expelled and she was too happy and too much amused to care much about the annoyance  there was magnanimity enough about her not to mind midge bites and certainly this summer was exceptionally delightful with all the pleasures of wealth and very few of its drawbacks  by the time the holidays were coming round belforest was not half habitable and they had to return to the pagoda  a tenant had been found for it and such of the old furniture as was too precious to be parted with was to be removed to belforest  things were sufficiently advanced there for the rooms to be chosen and orders given as to the decoration and furniture and then gathering up her sons caroline meant to start for the rhine switzerland and italy  old nurse was settled in a small pair of rooms with emma to wait on her and promises from jessie to attend to her comforts but the old woman had failed so much in their absence and had fretted so much after mrs joseph and the children that it was hard to leave her again  everything that good taste and wealth could do to make a place delightful was at work  the butchers shop was relegated to a dim corner of the gallery and its place supplied from the brushes of the artists whom caroline viewed with loving respect the drawingroom was renovated a forlorn old library resuscitated into vigorous life a museum fitted with shelves drawers and glass cases which caroline said would be as dangerous to the vigorous spirit of natural history as new clothes to a brownie and a billiard and gun room were ceded to the representations of allen who comported himself as befitted the son and heir  caroline would not part with her roommate little barbara and was to have for herself a charming bedroom and dressingroom with a balcony and parapet overlooking the garden and park and a tiny room besides for babie to call her own  janet chose the apartments which had been mr barnes and which being in the oldest part of the house and wainscoted with dark oak she could take possession of at once  there was one room down stairs with very ugly caryatides supporting the wooden mantelpiece and dividing the panels one of which had a secret door leading by an odd little stair to the bedroom above—that in which mr barnes had died  it had of course another door opening into the corridor and it was on these rooms that janet set her affections  to the general surprise elvira declared that this was the very room she had chosen with the red velvet curtains and gold crown the day they went over the house and that mother carey had promised it to her and she would have it  no one could remember any such promise and the curtains of crimson moreen did not answer elfies description but she would not be denied and actually put all her possessions into the room  janet without a word quietly turned them out into the passage and elfie flew into one of those furious kicking and screaming passions which always ended in her being sent to bed  caroline felt quite shaken by it but stood firm though as she said it went to her heart to deny the child who ought to have had equal shares with herself and she would have been thankful if janet would have given way  of this however janet had no thoughts strong in the conviction that the child could not make the same reasonable use of the fittings of the room as she could herself and by no means disposed not to seek her own  she had numerous papers notes of lectures returned essays from her society and the like to dispose of and she rejoiced in placing them in the compartments of the great bureau in the lower room  the lawyers had cleared all before her and the space was delightful all personals must have been carried off by the servants as perquisites for she found no traces of the former occupant till she came to a little bedside table  the drawer was not locked but did not open without difficulty being choked with notes and letters in envelopes directed to j barnes esquire  this perhaps accounted for the drawer not having been observed and emptied  janet shook the contents out into a basket and was going to take them to her uncle but thought it could do no harm first to see whether there were anything curious or interesting in them  several were receipted bills but then she came to her mothers handwriting and read her conciliatory note which whetted her curiosity and looking further she got some amusement out of the polite notes and offers of service claims to old family friendship and congratulations which had greeted mr barnes and he had treated with grim disregard  presently thrust into an envelope with another letter and written on a piece of notepaper was something that made her start as if at the sting of a viper  no it could not be a will  she knew what wills were like  they were sheets of foolscap written by lawyers while this was only an old mans cramped and crooked writing perhaps when he was in a rage he had so far carried out his threat that allen should remember king midas as to make a rough draft of a will leaving everything to elvira de menella for there at the top was the date plainly visible the very april when the confession had been made  but no doubt he had never carried out his purpose so far as to get it legally drawn out and attested  as mr richards had said he had never been in health to take any active measures and probably he had rested satisfied with this relief to his feelings  should she show it to her mother and uncle and let them know their narrow escape  no  mother carey and allen made quite fuss enough already about that little vixen and if they discovered how nearly she had been the sole heiress they would be far worse  besides her mother might have misgivings as to this unhappy document being morally though not legally binding  suppose she were seized with a fit of generosity and gave all up or even half  elfie the little shrew to have equal rights  the sweets of wealth only just tasted to be resigned and the child overweening enough already to be set in their newlygained place  the sagacity of seventeen decided that mother had better not be worried about it for her own sake and that of everyone else  so what was to be done  no means of burning it were at hand and to ask for them might excite suspicion  the safest way was to place it in one of the drawers of the bureau lock it up and keep the key     chapter xviii  an offer for magnum bonum    they had gold and gold and gold without end gold to lay by and gold to spend gold to give and gold to lend and reversions of gold in futuro in gold his family revelled and rolled himself and his wife and his sons so bold and his daughters who sang to their harps of gold                             o bella eta dell oro   four years of wealth had not made much external alteration in mrs joseph brownlow  as she descended the staircase of her beautiful london house one monday morning late in april between flower stands filled with lovely ferns and graceful statues she had still the same eager girlish look  it was true that her little cap was of the most costly lace her hair manipulated by skilful hands and her thin black summer dress was of material and make such as a scientific eye alone could have valued in their simplicity  but dignity still was wanting  silks and brocades that would stand alone and velvets richly piled only crushed and suffocated the little light swift figure and the crisp curly hair was so much too wilful for the maid that she had been even told that madames style would be to cut it short and wear it a lingenue which she viewed as insulting and altogether her general air was precisely what it had been when her dress cost a twentieth part of what it did at present  her face looked no older  it was thin eager bright and sunny yet with an indescribable wistfulness in the sparkling eyes and something worn in the expression and as usual she moved with a quiet nimbleness peculiar to herself  the breakfasttable sparkling with silver and glass around a magnificent orchid in the centre and a rose by every plate was spread in the diningroom sweet sounds and scents coming in through the widelyopened glass doors of the conservatory while a bright wood fire still pleasant to look at shone in the grate  as she rang the bell bobus came in from the conservatory book in hand to receive the morning kiss for which he had to bend to his little mother  he was not tall but he had attained his full height and had a wellknit sturdy figure which together with his heavy brow and deepset eyes made him appear older than his real age—nineteen his hair and upper lip were dark and his eyes keen with a sense of ready power and strong will  good morning bobus i didnt see you all day yesterday said his mother  no i couldnt find you before you went out on saturday night to tell you i was going to run down to belforest with bauerson  i wanted to enlighten his mind as to wild hyacinths  they are in splendid bloom all over the copses and i thought he would have gone down on his knees to them like linnaeus to the gorse  im afraid he didnt go on his knees to anything else  well it is not much in his line  then can he be a nice sunday companion  now mother i expected credit for not scandalising the natives we got out at woodgate and walked over quite unknownst to kenminster  i was not thinking of the natives but of yourself  as you are a sensible woman mother carey wasnt it a more goodly and edifying thing to put a man like bauerson in a trance over the bluebells than to sit cramped up in foul air listening to the glorification of a wholesale massacre  for shame bobus you know i never allow you to say such things  then you should not drag me to church  was it last sunday that i was comparing the prussians at bazeille with—  hush my dear boy you frighten me you know it is all explained fancy if we had to deal with a nation of thugs and no means of guarding them—a different dispensation and all  but here come the children so hush  bobus gave a nod and smile which his mother understood only too well as intimating acquiescence with wishes which he deemed feminine and conventional  my poor boy she said to herself with vague alarm and terror what has he not picked up  i must read up these things and be able to talk it over with him by the time he comes back from norway  there however came the morning greeting of elvira and barbara girls of fourteen and eleven with floating hair and short dresses the one growing up into all the splendid beauty of her early promise the other thin and brown but with a speaking face and lovely eyes they were followed by miss ogilvie as trim and selfpossessed as ever but with more ease and expansiveness of manner  so babie said her brother youve earned your breakfast i heard you hammering away  like a nuthatch was the merry answer  and elfie asked mrs brownlow  im not so late as janet she answered and the others laughed at the selfdefence before the attack  it is a lazy little elf in town said miss ogilvie in the country she is up and out at impossible hours  good morning janet said bobus at that moment or rather marry come up mistress mine good lack nothing is lacking to thee save a pointed hood graceless  for janet was arrayed in a closefitting pale blue dress cut in semblance of an ancient kirtle and with a huge chatelaine from which massive chains dangled not to say clattered—not merely the ordinary appendages of a young lady but a pair of compasses a safety inkstand and a microscope  her dark hair was strained back from a face not calculated to bear exposure and was wound round a silver arrow  elfie shook with laughter murmuring—  oh dear what a fright in accents which miss ogilvie tried to hush while babie observed as a sort of excuse janet always is a figure of fun when she is picturesque  my dear i hope you are not going to show yourself to any one in that dress added her mother  it is perfectly correct said janet studied from an old italian costume  the marchioness of carabbas in my old fairytale book  oh yes i see and babie went off again in an ecstatic fit of laughter  i hope youve got boots and a tail ready for george added bobus being a tiger already he may serve as cat  therewith the post came in and broke up the discourse for babie had a letter from eton from armine who was shut up with a sore throat  her mother was less happy  she had asked a holiday for the next day for her two eton boys and their cousin john and the reply had been that though for two of the party there could be no objection her elder boy was under punishment for one of the wild escapades to which he was too apt to pervert his excellent abilities  are not they coming mother asked babie  armie does not say  unfortunately jock has got kept in again  poor jock said bobus sixpence a day and no expectations would have been better pasture for his brains  yes said his mother with a sigh i doubt if we are any of us much the better or the wiser for belforest  the wiser im sure because weve got miss ogilvie cried babie  do i hear babes uttering the words of wisdom asked allen coming into the room and pretending to pull her hair as the schoolroom party rose from the breakfasttable and he met them with outstretched hands  ay to despise laglast said elvira darting out of his reach and tossing her dark locks at him as she hid behind a fern plant in the window and there was a laughing scuffle ended by miss ogilvie who swept the children away to the schoolroom while allen came to the table where his mother had poured out his coffee and still waited to preside over his breakfast though she had long finished her own  allen brownlow at twenty was emphatically the eton and christchurch production just well made and goodlooking enough to do full justice to his training and general getting up without too much individual personality of his own  he looked only so much of a man as was needful for looking a perfect gentleman and his dress and equipments were in the most perfect quietly exquisite style as costly as possible yet with no display and nothing to catch the eye  well bobus he said you made out your expedition  how did the place look  wasting its sweetness said his mother it is tantalising to think of it  it could hardly be said to be wasted said bobus the natives were disporting themselves all over it  where asked allen with displeased animation  o essie and ellie were promenading a select party about the gardens  i could almost hear mackintyre gnashing his teeth at their inroads on the forced strawberries and the park and elmwood spinney were dotted so thick with people that we had to look sharp not to fall in with any one  elmwood spinney exclaimed allen you dont mean that they were running riot over the preserves  i dont think there were more than halfadozen there  bauerson was quite edified  he said so they had on your english sunday quite falsely me informed  there were a couple of lovers spooning and some children gathering flowers and it had just the arcadian look dear to the german eye  children cried allen as if they were vipers  thats just what i told you mother  if you will persist in throwing open the park we shall not have a pheasant on the place  my dear boy i have seen them running about like chickens in a farmyard  yes but whats the use if all the little beggars in kenminster are to be let in to make them wild  and when you knew i particularly wished to have something worth asking prince siegfried down to  never mind allen put in janet you can ask him to shoot into the poultry yard  the poor things are just as thick there and rather tamer so the sport will be the more noble  you know nothing about it janet said allen in displeasure  but allen said his mother apologetically though she felt with janet the woods are locked up  locked  as if that was any use when you let a lot of boys come marauding all over the place  really allen said his mother when i remember what we used to say about old mr barnes i cannot find it in my heart to play the same game  it is quite a different thing  how  he did it out of mere surliness  i dont suppose it makes much difference to the excluded whether it is done out of mere surliness or for the sake of the preserves  mother  allen spoke as if the absurdity of the argument were quite too much for him but his brother and sister both laughed which nettled him into adding—  well  all i have to say is that if belforest is to be nothing but a peoples park for all the ragamuffins in kenminster there will soon not be a head of game in the place and i shall be obliged to shoot elsewhere  poor caroline  if there was a thing she specially hated it was a battue both for the thing itself and all the previous preparation of preserving and of prosecuting poachers and yet sons have their mothers so much in their power by that threat of staying away from home that she could not help faltering oh allen ill do my best and tell the keepers to be very careful and lock the gates of all the preserves  allen saw she was vexed and spoke more kindly there never mind mother  it is more than can be expected that ladies should see things in a reasonable light  what is the reasonable light asked bobus  allen did not choose to hear regarding bobus not indeed as a woman but as something as little capable of appreciating his reason  it was janet who took up the word  the reasonable light is that the enjoyment of the many should be sacrificed to the vanity of the few viz that all kenminster should be confined to dusty roads all the year round in order that allen may bring down the youngest son of the youngest son of a german prince for one day to fire amongst some hundreds of tame pheasants who come up expecting to be fed  oh yes said allen we all know that you are a regular outand out democrat janet  i confess without being a democrat said his mother that i do wonder that you gentlemen who wish the game laws to continue should so work them as to be more aggravating than ever  it is a simple question of the rights of property said allen  if i do a thing i like it to be well done and not halfandhalf  caroline rose from the table dreading like many a mother a regular skirmish about gamepreserving between those who cared to shoot and those who did not  like other ladies she could never understand exaggerated preserving nor why men who loved sport should care to have game multiplied and tamed so as apparently to spoil all the zest of the chase but she had let allen and his uncle do what ever they told her was right by the preserves except shutting up the park and all the footpaths  colonel brownlow whose sporting instincts were those of a former generation was quite satisfied allen never would be so and it was one of the few bones of contention in the family  for allen was walking through oxford in a quiet amiable way not troubling himself more about study than to secure himself from an ignominious pluck and doing whatever was supposed to be good form  his brother accused him of carrying his idolatry of good form to a snobbish extent but allen could carry it out so naturally that no one could have suspected that he had not been to the manner born  if he did appreciate the society of people with handles to their names he comported himself among them as their easy equal and he was so lavish as to be a very popular man  he had no vicious tastes or tendencies and was too gentlemanly and quiet ever to come into collision with the authorities  at home except when his notions of good form were at variance with strong opinions of his mothers nothing could be more chivalrously deferential than his whole demeanour to her and the worst that could be said of him was that he managed to waste a large amount of time and money with very little to show for it  his profession was to be son and heir to a large fortune and he took to the show part of the affair very kindly  but was this being the man his father had expected him to be  the thought would come across caroline at times but not very often as she floated along easily in the stream of life  most of the business troubles of her property were spared her by her trustees and her income was so large that even allens expenditure had not yet been felt as an inconvenience  as to the responsibilities she contributed largely to county subscriptions gave her clergyman whatever he asked provided christmas treats and summer teas for their schoolchildren and permitted miss ogilvie and babie to do whatever they pleased among the poor when they were at home  but she was not very much at belforest  she generally came there at midsummer and at christmas and filled the house with friends  all kinds of amusements astonished the neighbourhood and parties of the newest kinds private theatricals tableaux charades all that taste or ingenuity could devise were in vogue  but before the spring east winds the party were generally gone to some more genial climate and the early autumn was often spent in switzerland  pictures art and scenery were growing to be necessaries of life and to stay at home with no special diversion in view seemed unthought of  the season was spent in london not dropping the artist society on the one hand but adding to it the amount of intercourse into which she was drawn by the fact of her being a rich and charming woman having a delightful house and a son and daughter who might be grands partis  allen liked high life for her so she did not refuse it but probably her social success was all the greater from her entire indifference and that of her daughter to all the questions of exclusiveness and fashion  if they had been born duchesses they could not have been less concerned about obtaining invitations to what their maid called the first circles and they would sometimes reduce allen to despair by giving the preference to a lively literary soiree when he wanted them to show themselves among the aristocracy at a drum  engagements of all kinds grew on them with every season and in this one especially caroline had grown somewhat weary of the endeavour to satisfy both him and janet and was not sorry that her two eldest sons were starting on a yacht voyage to norway where allen meant to fish and bobus to study natural history  she had her interview with the housekeeper and proceeded to her own place in popinjay parlour a quiet place at this time of day save for the tinkling of the fountain and the twitterings of the many little songsters in the aviary whom the original parrot used patronisingly to address as pretty little birds  janet was wandering about among the flowers evidently waiting for her and began as she came in—  i wanted to speak to you mother  well janet said caroline reviewing in one moment every unmarried man likely or unlikely who had approached the girl and with a despairing conviction that it would be some one very unlikely indeed  you know i am of age mother  certainly  we drank your health last monday  i made up my mind that till i was of age i would go on studying and at the same time see something of the world and of society  certainly said caroline wondering what her inscrutable daughter was coming to  and having done this i wish to devote myself to the study of medicine  be a lady doctor janet  mother you are surely above all the commonplace old world nonsense  i dont think i am janet  i dont think your father would have wished it  he would have gone on with the spirit of the times mother men do while women stand still  i dont think he would in this  i think he would if he knew me and the issues and stake and how his other children are failing him  janet—and the colour flushed into her mothers face—i dont quite know what you mean but it is time we came to an understanding  i think so returned janet  then you know—  i heard what papa said to you  i kept the white slate till you thought of it said janet in a tone that sounded soft from her  and why did you never say so my dear  i can hardly tell  i was shy at first and then reserve grows on a person but i never ceased from thinking about it through all these years  mother you do not think there is any chance of the boys taking it up as my father wished  certainly not allen said caroline with a sigh  and as to bobus he would have full capacity but a great change must come over him poor fellow before he would fulfil your fathers conditions  he has no notion of the drudgery of the medical profession said janet he means to read law get up social and sanitary questions and go into parliament  i know said her mother i have always lived in hopes that sanitary theories would give him his fathers heart for the sufferers and that search into the secrets of nature would lead him higher but as long as he does not turn that way of himself it would be contrary to your fathers charge to hold this discovery out to him as an inducement  and jock said janet smiling  you dont expect it of the born soldier—nor of armine  i am not sure about armine though he may not be strong enough to bear the application  armine will walk through life like allen scornfully said janet besides he is but fourteen  now mother why should not i be worthy  my dear janet it is not a question of worthiness it is not a thing a woman could work out  i do not ask you to give it to me now nor even to promise it to me said janet with a light in those dark wells her eyes but only to let me have the hope that when in three years time i am qualified and have passed the examinations if bobus does not take it up you will let me claim that best inheritance my father left but which his sons do not heed  my child you do not know what you ask  remember i know more about it than only what you picked up on that morning  it is a matter he could not have made sure of without a succession of experiments very hard even for him and certainly quite impossible for any woman  the exceeding difficulty and danger of the proof was one reason of his guarding it so much and desiring it should only be told to one good as well as clever—clever as well as good  can you give me no hint of the kind of thing said janet wistfully  that would be a betrayal of his trust  janet looked terribly disappointed  mother said she let me put it to you  is it fair to shut up a discovery that might benefit so many people  it is not his fault janet that it is shut up  he talked of it to several of the most able men he was connected with and they thought it a chimera  he could not carry it on far enough to convince them i do not know what he would have done if his illness had been longer or he could have talked it out with any one but i know the proof could only be made out by a course of experiments which he could not commit to any one not highly qualified or whom he could not entirely trust  it is not a thing to be set forth broadcast while it might yet prove a fallacy  is it to be lost for ever then  i shall try to find light as to the right thing to be done about it  well said janet drawing a long breath three years of study must come any way and by that time i may be able to triumph over prejudice  there was no time to reply for at that moment the letters of the second delivery were brought in and the first that caroline opened told her that the cold which armine had mentioned on saturday seemed to be developing into an attack of a rather severe hybrid kind of illness between measles and scarlatina from which many persons had lately been suffering  armine was never strong and his illnesses were always a greater anxiety than those of other people so that his mother came to the immediate decision of going to eton that same afternoon and remaining there unless she found that it had been a false alarm  she did not find it so and as she remained with her boy janets conversation with her could not be resumed  there was so much chance of infection that she could not see any of the family again  both the johns sickened as soon as armine began to improve and miss ogilvie took the three girls down to belforest  after the first few days it was rather a pleasant nursing  there was never any real alarm indeed armine was the least ill of the three and johnny the most and each boy was perfectly delighted to have her to attend to him her nephew almost touchingly grateful  the only other victim was jocks most intimate friend cecil evelyn whose fag armine was he became a sharer of her attentions and the amusements she provided she received letters of grateful thanks from his mother who was like herself a widow but was prevented from coming to him by close attendance on her motherinlaw who was in a lingering state of decay when every day might be the last  the eldest son lord fordham was so delicate that he was on no account to be exposed to the infection and the boys were exceedingly anxious that cecil should join them in the expedition that their mother projected making with them to air them in switzerland before returning to the rest of the family  but mrs evelyn her husband had not lived to come to the title declined this  fordham was in the country with his tutor and she wished cecil to come and spend his quarantine with her in london before joining him  the boys grumbled very much but caroline could hardly wonder when she talked with their tutor  he like every one else liked and even loved personally that perplexing subject john lucas brownlow alias jock  the boy was too generous honourable truthful and kindly to be exposed to the stigma of removal but he was the perplexity of everybody  he could not be convinced of any necessity for application and considered a flogging as a slight risk quite worth encountering for the sake of diversion  he would execute the most audacious pranks and if he was caught would take it as a trial of skill between the masters and himself and accept punishment as amends with the most good humoured grace in the world  fun seemed to be his only moving spring and he led everybody along with him so as to be a much more mischievous person than many a worse lad  the only exceptions in the house to his influence seemed to be his brother and cousin  both were far above the average boy  armine for talent john friar brownlow at once for industry and steadiness they had stood out resolutely against more than one of his pranks and had been the only boys in the house not present on the occasion of his last freak—a champagne supper when parodies had been sung caricaturing all the authorities and when the company had become uproarious enough to rouse the whole family the boys were discovered in the midst of the most audacious but droll mimicry of the masters  as to work jock was developing the utmost faculties for leaving it undone trusting to his native facility for putting on the steam at any crisis and not believing in the warnings that he would fail in passing for the army  what was to be done with him  was he to be taken away and sent to a tutor  his mother consulted himself as he sat in his armchair  like rob he said and made up a face  rob is doing very well in the militia  no dont do that mother  never fear ill put on a spurt when the time comes  i dont believe a spurt will do  now seriously jock—  dont say seriously mother its like hsh  perhaps if i had been like her you would not be vexing me so much now  come come mother its nothing to be vexed about  my tutor neednt have bothered you ive done nothing sneaking nor ungentlemanly  there is plenty of wrong without that jock  while you never heed anything but fun and amusement i do not see how you are to come to anything worth having and you will soon get betrayed into something unworthy  dont let me have to take you away in disgrace my boy it would break my heart  you shant have to do that mother  but dont you think it would be wiser to be somewhere with fewer inducements to idleness  leave eton  o no mother  i cant do that till the last day possible  i shall be in the eight another year  you will not be here another year unless you go on very differently your tutor will not allow it if i would  has he said so  yes and the next half is to be the trial  jock applied himself to extracting a horsehair from the stuffing of the elbow of his chair and there was a look over his face as near sullenness as ever came to his gay careless nature  would he attend or even could he  when his bills came in caroline feared as before that he was the one of all her children whom belforest was most damaging  allen was expensive but in an elegant exquisite kind of way but jock was simply reckless  and his pleasures were questionable enough to be on the borders of vices which might change the frank sweet merry face that now looked up to her into a countenance stained by dissipation and licence  a flash of horror and dismay followed the thought  but what could she do for him or for any of her children  censure only alienated them and made them worse and their love for her was at least one blessing  why had this gold come to take away the wholesome necessity for industry     chapter xix  the snowy windingsheet    cold cold tis a chilly clime that the youth in his journey hath reached    and he is aweary now    and faint for lack of food cold cold there is no sun in heaven                                     southey   very merry was the party which arrived at the roughlybuilt hotel of schwarenbach which serves as a halfway house to the altels  never had expedition been more enjoyed than that of mrs brownlow and her three boys  they had taken a week by the sea to recruit their forces and then began their journey in earnest since it was too late for a return to eton although so early in the season that to the swiss they were like the first swallows of the spring and they came in for some of the wondrous glory of the spring flowers so often missed by tourists  in her mountain dress all state and ceremony cast aside caroline rode walked and climbed like the jolly mother carey she was to use her sons favourite expression and the boys full of health and recovery gambolled about her feeling her companionship the very crown of their enjoyment  johnny to whom all was more absolutely new than to the others was the quietest of the three  he was a year older than lucas as jock was now called to formal outsiders while friar john a reversal of his cousins two christian names was a school title that sometimes passed into home use  friar john then had reached an age open to the influences of beautiful and sublime scenery and when the younger ones only felt the exhilaration of mountain air and longings to get as high as possible his soul began to expand and fresh revelations of glory and majesty to take possession of him  he was a very different person from the rough awkward lad of eight years back  he still had the somewhat loutish figure which in his mothers family was the shell of finelooking men and he was shy and bashful but eton polish had taken away the rude gruffness and made his manners and bearing gentlemanly  his face was honest and intelligent and he had a thoroughly good conscientious disposition his character stood high and he was the only brownlow of them all who knew the sweets of being sent up for good  his aunt could almost watch expression deepening on his open face and he was enjoying with soul and mind even more than with body  having had the illness later and more severely than the other two his strength had not so fully returned and he was often glad to rest admire and study the subject with his aunt to whose service he was specially devoted while the other two climbed and explored  for even armine had been invigorated with a sudden overflow of animal health and energy which made him far more enterprising and less contemplative than he had ever been before  they four had walked up the mountain after breakfast from kandersteg bringing their bags for a couple of nights the boys being anxious to go up the altels the next day as their time was nearly over and they were to be in school in ten days time again  after luncheon and a good rest on the wooden bench outside the door they began to stroll towards the daubensee along a path between desolate boulders without vegetation except a small kind of monkshood  i call this dreary said the mother  we dont seem to get a bit nearer the lake  i shall go home and write to babie  ill come back with you said johnny  my mother will be looking for a letter  not giving in already johnny said armine  i can tell you i mean to get to the lake  the friar is the slave of his notebook said jock  when are we to have it—crags and cousins or from measles to mountains  i dont want to forget everything said johnny with true kencroft doggedness  do you expect ever to look at that precious diurnal again  he will leave it as an heirloom to his grandchildren  and they will say how slow people were in the nineteenth century  there will have been a reaction by that time and they will only wonder how anybody cared to go up into such dreary places  or perhaps they will have stripped them all and eaten the glaciers up as ices and icecreams  i think ill set up that as my pet anxiety said their mother laughing just as some people suffer from perplexity as to what is to become of the world when all the coal is used up  you are not turning on my account are you johnny  i am quite happy to go back alone  no indeed  i want to write my letter and i have had enough said john  tired said armine  poor old monk  swiss air always makes me feel like a balloon full of gas  i could go on up and up for ever  well keep to the path and dont do anything imprudent she said turning back the boys saying well only have a look down the pass here chico chico chick chick  chico the little dog so disdainfully rejected by elvira had attached himself from the first to jock  he had been in the london house when they spent a day there and in rapture at the meeting had smuggled himself not without his masters connivance among the rugs and wrappers and had already been the cause of numerous scrapes with officials and travellers whence sometimes money sometimes politeness sometimes audacity bought off his friends as best they could  there was a sort of grave fascination in the exceeding sternness of the scene—the grey heaps of stone the mountains raising their shining white summits against the blue the dark fathomless lifeless lake and the utter absence of all forms of life  armines spirit fell under the spell and he moved dreamily on hardly attending to jock who was running on with chico and alarming him by feints of catching him and throwing him into the water  they came to the gap where they expected to look over the pass but it was blotted out by a mist not in itself visible though hiding everything and they were turning to go home when in the ravine near at hand the white ruggedness of the wildstrube glacier gleamed on their eyes  i didnt know it was so near said jock  come and have a look at it  not on it said armine who had somewhat more swiss experience than his brother  theres no going there without a guide  theres no reason we should not get on the moraine said jock  and they presently began to scramble about among the rocks and boulders trying to mount some larger one whence they might get a more general view of the form of the glacier  chico ran on before them stimulated by some reminiscence of the rabbitholes of belforest and they were looking after him and whistling him back armine heard a sudden cry and fall—jock had disappeared  never mind he called up the next instant  im all right  only come down here  ive twisted my foot somehow  armine scrambled round the rock over which he had fallen a loose stone having turned with him  he had pulled himself up but even with an arm round armines neck he could not have walked a step on even ground far less on these rough debris which were painful walking even for the lightest most springy tread  you must get to the inn and bring help he said sinking down with a sigh  i suppose theres nothing else to be done said armine unwillingly  youll have a terrible time to wait unless i meet some one first  ill be as quick as i can  not too quick till you get off this place said jock or youll be down too and here help me off with this boot first  this was not done quickly or easily  jock was almost sick with the pain of the effort and the bruise looked serious  armine tried to make him comfortable and set out as he thought in the right direction but he had hardly gone twenty steps before he came to a sudden standstill with an emphatic i say then came back repeating i say jock we are close upon the glacier i was as near as possible going down into an awful blue crack  thats why its getting so cold said jock  here chick come and warm me  well armie why aint you off  yes said armine with a quiver in his voice if i keep down by the side of the glacier i suppose i must come to the daubensee in time  what  have we lost the way said jock beginning to look alarmed  theres no doubt of that said armine and whats worse that fog is coming up but ive got my little compass here and if i keep to the southwest and down i must strike the lake somewhere  goodbye jock  he looked white and braced up for the effort  jock caught hold of him  dont leave me armie he said you cant—youll fall into one of those crevasses  youd better let me go before the fog gets worse said armine  i say you cant its not fit for a little chap like you  if you fell it would be ever so much worse for us both  i know  but it is the less risk said armine gravely  i tell you armie i cant have you go  mother will send out for us and we can make no end of a row together  theres a much better chance that way than alone  dont go i say—  i was only looking out beyond the rock  i dont think it would be possible to get on now  i cant see even the ridge of stones we climbed over  i wish it was i said jock ill be bound i could manage it then impatiently—something must be done you know armie  we cant stay here all night  yet when armine went a step or two to see whether there was any practicability of moving he instantly called out against his attempting to go away  he was in a good deal of pain and high spirited boy as he was was thoroughly unnerved and appalled and much less able to consider than the usually quieter and more timid armine  suddenly there was a frightful thunderous roar and crash and with a cry of an avalanche the brothers clasped one another fast and shut their eyes but ere the words have mercy were uttered all was still again and they found themselves alive  i dont think it was an avalanche said armine recovering first it was most likely to be a great mass of ice tumbling off the arch at the bottom of the glacier  they do make a most awful row  ive heard one before only not so near  anyway we cant be far from the bottom of the glacier if i only could crawl there  no no cried jock holding him tight i tell you you cant do it  jock could not have defined whether he was most actuated by fears for his brothers safety or by actual terror at being left alone and helpless  at any rate armine much preferred remaining in all the certain misery and danger to losing sight of his brother with the great probability of only being further lost himself  i wonder whether chico would find mother he said  jock brightened armine found an envelope in his pocket and scribbled—  on the moraine  jocks ankle sprained—come  then jock produced a bit of string wherewith it was fastened to the dogs collar and then authoritatively bade chico go to mother  alas cleverness had never been chicos strong point and the present extremity did not inspire him with sagacity  he knew the way as little as his masters did and would only dance about in an unmeaning way and when ordered home crouch in abject entreaty  jock grew impatient and threatened him but this only made him creep behind armine put his tail between his legs hold up his little paw and look piteously imploring  theres no use in the little brute sighed jock at last but the attempt had done him good and recalled his nerve and good sense  we are in for a night of it he said unless they find us and how are they ever to do that in this beastly fog  we must halloo said armine attempting it  yes and we dont know when to begin  we cant go on all night you know said jock and if we begin too soon we may have no voice left just at the right time  it is halfpast seven now said armine looking at his watch  the food was to be at seven so they must have missed us by this time  they wont think anything of it till it gets dark  no  give them till halfpast eight  somewhere about nine or half past it may be worth while to yodel  and how awfully cold it will be by that time  and my foot is aching like fun  armine offered to rub it and there was some occupation in this and in watching the darkening of the evening which was very gradual in the dense white fog that shut them in with a damp cold moist curtain of undeveloped snow  the poor lads were thinly clad for a summer walk jock had left his plaid behind him and they were beginning to feel only too vividly that it was past suppertime when they could dimly see that it was past nine and began to shout but they soon found this severe and exhausting  armine suggested counting ten between each cry which would husband their powers and give them time to listen for an answer  yet even thus there was an empty feeble sound about their cries so that jock observed—  its very odd that when theres no good in making a row one can make it fast enough and now when it would be of some use one seems to have no more voice than a little sick mouse  not so much i think said armine  it is hunger partly  hark  that sounded like something  invigorated by hope they shouted again but though several times they did hear a distant yodel the hope that it was in answer to themselves soon faded as the sound became more distant and their own exertions ended soon in an utter breakdown—into a hoarse squeak on jocks part and a weak hungry cry on armines  jocks face was covered with tears as much from the strain as from despair  there he sighed theres our last chance gone  we are in for a night of it  it cant be a very long night armine said through chattering teeth its only a week to the longest day  much that will matter to us said jock impatiently  we shall be frozen long before morning  we must keep ourselves awake  you little ass said poor jock in the petulant inconsistency of his distress it is not come to that yet  armine did not answer at once he was kneeling against the rock and a strange thrill came over jock forbidding him again to say—it was not come to that but a shoot of aching pain in his ankle presently drew forth an exclamation  armine again offered to rub it for him and the two arranged themselves for this purpose the curtain of damp woolliness seeming to thicken on them  there was a moon somewhere and the darkness was not total but the dreariness and isolation were the more felt from the absence of all outlines being manifest  they even lost sight of their own hands if they stretched out their arms and their light summer garments were already saturated with damp and would soon freeze  no part of their bodies was free from that deadly chill save where they could press against one another  they were brave boys  jock had collected himself again and for some time they kept up a show of mirth in the shakings and buffetings they bestowed on one another but they began to grow too stiff and spent to pursue this discipline  armine thought that the night must be nearly over and jock tried to see his watch but decided that he could not because he could not bear to believe how far it was from day  armine was drowsily rubbing the ankle mechanically murmuring something to himself  jock shook him saying—  take care dont doze off  what are you mumbling about leisure  o tarry thou the lords leisure  be strong and— was i saying it aloud he broke off with a start  yes go on  armine finished the verse and jock commented—  comfort thine heart  does the little chap mean it in a fix like this  jock said armine now fully awake i do want to say something  cut on  if you get out of this and i dont—  stop that  weve got heat enough to last till morning  will they find us then  these fogs last for days and turn to snow  dont croak i say  i cant face mother without you  shell be glad enough to get you  please listen jock while im awake  i want you to give her and all of them my love and say im sorry for all the times ive vexed them  as if you had ever—  and please jock if i was nasty and conceited about the champagne—  shut up i cant stand this cried jock chiefly from force of habit for it was a tacit agreement among the elder brothers that armine must not be suffered to be cocky and humbug by which they meant no implication on his sincerity but that they did not choose to hear remonstrances or appeals to higher motives and this had made him very reticent with all except his sister barbara and miss ogilvie but he now persisted  indeed i want you to forgive me jock  you dont know how often ive thought all sorts of horridness about you  jock laughed not more than i deserved ill be bound  how can you be so absurd  if anyone wants forgiveness it is i  i say armie this is all nonsense  you dont really think you are done for or you would not take it so coolly  of course i know who can bring us through if he will said armine theres the rock  ive been asking him all this time—every moment —only i get so sleepy  if he will but if he wont  then theres paradise  and himself and father said armine still in a dreamy tone  oh yes thats for you  but how about a mad fellow like me  its so sneaking just to take to ones prayers because ones in a bad case  oh jock  he is always ready to hear  more ready than we to pray  now dont begin to improve the occasion broke out jock  by all the stories that ever were written im the one to come to a bad end not you  dont said armine with an accent of pain that made jock cry hugging him tighter  there never mind armie ill let you say all you like  i dont know what made me stop you except that im a beast and always have been one  id give anything not to have gone on playing the fool all my life so as to be able to mind this as little as you do  i dont seem awake enough to mind anything much said the little boy or i should trouble more about mother and babie but somehow i cant  oh wailed jock you must  you must get out of it armie  come closer  shove in between me and the rock  here chico lie down on the top of us  mother must have you back any way armie  the little fellow was halfdozing but words of prayer and faith kept dropping from his tongue  pain and a stronger vitality alike kept jock free from the torpor and he used his utmost efforts to rouse his brother but every now and then a horrible conviction of the hopelessness of their condition came over him  oh he groaned out how is it to be if this is the end of it what is to become of a fellow that has been like me  armine only spoke one word the name that is above every name  yes you always cared  but i never cared for anything but fun never went to communion at easter  it is too late  oh no no cried armine rousing up not too late  never  you are his  you belong to him  he cares for you  if he does it makes it all the worse  i never heeded i thought it all a bore  i never let myself think what it all meant  ive thrown it all away  oh i wish i wasnt so stupid cried armine with a violent effort against his exhaustion  mother loves us however horrid we are  he is like that only let us tell him all the bad weve done and ask him to blot it out  ive been trying—trying—only im so dull and let us give ourselves more and more out and out to him whether it is here or there  that i must said jock it would be shabby and sneaking not  oh jock cried armine joyfully then it will all be right any way and he raised his face and kissed his brother  you promise jock  please promise  promise what  that if he will save us out of this ill take a new line and be as good as i know how and—  armine took the word whether consciously or not and manfully to fight under his banner and continue christs faithful soldiers and servants unto our lives end  amen  amen jock said after him  after that jock found that the child was repeating the creed and said it after him the meanings thrilling through him as they had never done before  next followed lines of rock of ages and for some time longer there was a drowsy murmur of sacred words but there was no eliciting a direct reply any more and with dull constern ation jock knew that the fatal torpor could no longer be broken and was almost irritated that all the words he caught were such happy peaceful ones  the very last were inside angels wings all white down  the child seemed almost comfortable—certainly not suffering like himself bruised and strained with sharp twinges rending his damaged foot his limbs cramped and sensible of the acute misery of the cold and the full horror of their position but as long as he could shake even an unconscious murmur from his brother it seemed like happiness compared with the utter desolation after the last whisper had died away and he was left intolerably alone under the solid impenetrable shroud that enveloped him and the senseless form he held on his breast  and if he tried to follow on by that clue which armine had left him whirlwinds of dismay seemed to sweep away all hope and trust while he thought of wilfulness recklessness defiance irreverence and all the yet darker shades of a self indulgent and audacious schoolboy life  it was a little lighter as if dawn might be coming but the cold was bitterer and benumbing more than paining him  his clothes were stiff his eyelashes white with frost he did not feel equal to looking at his watch he would not see armines face he found the fog depositing itself in snow but he heeded it no longer  fear and hope had alike faded out of his mind his ankle seemed to belong to some one else far away he had left off wishing to see his mother he wanted nothing but to be let alone  he did not hear when chico finding no comfort no sign of life in his masters stood upon them as they lay clasped together in the drift of fine small snow and in the climax of misery he lifted up the long and wretched wailing howlings of utter dogwretchedness     chapter xx  a race    speed melise speed such cause of haste thine active sinews never braced bend gainst the steepy hill thy breast burst down like torrent from its crest                                      scott   hark  the guides and the one other traveller a mr graham who had been at the inn were gathered at the border of the daubensee entreating almost ready to use force to get the poor mother home before the snow should efface the tracks and render the return to schwarenbach dangerous  ever since the alarm had been given there had been a going about with lights a shouting and seeking all along the road where she had parted with her sons  it was impossible in the fog to leave the beaten track and the traveller told her that rewards would be but temptations to suicide  johnny had fortunately been so tired out that he had gone to bed soon after coming in and had not been wakened by the alarm till eleven oclock  then startled by the noises and lights he had risen and made his way to his aunt  substantial help he could not give—even his german was halting but he was her stay and help and she would— as she knew afterwards—have been infinitely more desolate without him  and now when all were persuading her to wait as they said till more aid could be sent for to kandersteg he knew as well as she did that it was but a kindly ruse to cover their despair and was striving to insist that another effort in daylight should be made  he it was who uttered the hark and added that is chico  at first the tired despairing guides did not hear but going along the road by the lake in the direction from which the sound came the prolonged wail became more audible  it is on the moraine the men said with awestruck looks at one another  they would fain not even have taken john with them but with a resolute look he uttered ich komm  mr graham an elderly man not equal to a moraine in the snow stayed with the mother  he wanted to take her back to prepare for them as he said—in reality to lesson any horrors there might be to see  but she stood like a statue with clasped hands and white face the small feathery snow climbing round her feet and on her shoulders  o god spare my boys  though i dont deserve it—spare them had been her one inarticulate prayer all night  and now—shouts and yodels reach her ears  they are found  but how found  the cries are soon hushed  there is long waiting—then through the snow john flashes forward and takes her hand  he does not speak—only as their eyes meet his pale lips tremble and he says dont fear they will revive in the inn  jock is safe they are sure  safe  what that stiff whitefaced form carried between two men with the arm hanging lifelessly down  one man held the smaller figure of armine and kept his face pressed inwards  kind words of liebe frau and assurances that were meant to be cheering passed around her but she heard them not  some brandy had it seemed been poured into their mouths  they thought jock had swallowed armine had not  at intervals on the way back a little more was administered and the experienced guides had no doubt that life was yet in him  when they reached the hotel the guides would not take them near the stove but carried them up at once by the rough stair to the little wood partitioned bedrooms  there were two beds in each room and their mother would have had them both together but the traveller and the kindly helpful young landlady fraulein rosalie quietly managed otherwise and when johnny tried to enforce his aunts orders mr graham by a sign made him comprehend why they had thus arranged filling him with blank dismay  a doctor  the guides shook their heads  they could hardly make their way to leukerbad while it was snowing as at present and if they had done so no doctor could come back with them  moreover the restoratives were known to the mountaineers as well as to the doctors themselves and these were vigorously applied  all the resources of the little wayside house were put in requisition  mr graham and johnny did their best for jock his mother seemed to see and think of nothing but armine who lay senseless and cold in spite of all their efforts  it was soon that jock began to moan and turn and struggle painfully back to life  when he opened his eyes with a dazed half consciousness and something like a word came from between his lips mr graham sent john to call the mother saying very low get her away  she will bear it better when she sees this one coming round  john had deep and reverent memories connected with armine  he knew— as few did know—how steadfastly that little gentle fellow could hold the right and more than once the two had been almost alone against their world  besides he was mother careys darling  johnny felt as if his heart would break as with trembling lips he tried to speak as if in glad hope as he told his aunt that jock was speaking and wanted her while he looked all the time at the still white inanimate face  she looked at him half in distrust  yes  indeed indeed he said jock wants you  she went johnny took her place  the efforts at restoration were slackening  the attendants were shaking their heads and saying der arme  mr graham came up to him saying in his ear she is engrossed with the other  he will not let her go  let them do what is to be done for this poor little fellow  so it will be best for her  there was a frantic longing to do something for armine a wild wonder that the prayers of a whole night had not been more fully answered in johns mind as he threw himself once more over the senseless form propped with pillows and kissed either cheek and the lips  then suddenly he uttered a low cry he breathed  im sure he did i felt it  the spoon  o quick  mr graham and the fraulein looked pitifully at one another at the delusion but they let the lad have the spoon with the drops of brandy  he had already gained experience in giving it and when they looked for disappointment his eyes were raised in joy  its gone down he said  mr graham put his hand on the pulse and nodded  another drop or two and renewed rubbing of hands and feet  the icy cold the deadly white were certainly giving way the lips began to quiver contract and gasp  was it for death or life  they would not call his mother for that terrible doubtful minute but she could not long stay away  when jocks fingers first relaxed on hers she crept to the door of the other room to see armine upheld on johnnys breast with heaving chest and working features but with eyes opening yes and meeting hers  johnny always held that he never had so glad a moment in all his life as that when he saw her countenance light up  the first word was jock   armines full perceptions were come back unlike those of jock who was moaning and wandering in his talk fancying himself still in the desolation of the moraine with armine dead in his arms and all the miseries bodily mental and spiritual from which he had suffered were evidently still working in his brain though the words that revealed them were weak and disjointed  besides he screamed and moaned with absolute and acute pain which alarmed them much though armine was sufficiently himself to be able to assure them that there had been no hurt beyond the strain  it was well that armine was both rational and unselfish for nothing seemed to soothe jock for a moment but his mothers hand and his mothers voice  it was plain that fever and rheumatism had a hold upon him and what or who was there to contend with them in this wayside inn  the rooms though clean were bare of all but the merest necessaries and though the young hostess was kind and anxious her maids were the roughest and most ignorant of girls and there were no appliances for comfort—nothing even to drink but milk bottled lemonade and a tisane made of yellow flowers horrible to the english taste  and jock ill as he was did not fill his mother with such dread for the future as did armine when she found him quiet indeed but unable to lie down except when supported on johns breast and in his arms—with a fearful oppression and pain in his chest and every token that the lungs were suffering  he had not let them call her jocks murmurs and cries were to be heard plainly through the wooden partition and the little fellow knew she could not be spared and only tried to prevent john and mr graham from alarming her  she— cant—do—any—good he gasped out in johns ear  no nobody could without medical skill and appliances  the utmost that the house could do was to produce enough mustard to make two plasters and to fill bottles with hot water to warm stones and to wrap them in blankets  and what was this in such cold as penetrated the wooden building too high up in the mountains for the june sun as yet to have full power  the snow kept blinding and drifting on and though everyone said it could not last long at that time in the summer it might easily last too long for armines fragile life here was evening drawing on and no change outside so that no offer of reward could make it possible for any messenger to attempt the gemmi to fetch advice from leukerbad  caroline could not think  she was in a dull dreary state of consternation and all she could dwell on was the immediate need of the moment soothing jocks terrors and what was almost worse his irritable rejection of the beverages she could offer him and trying to relieve him by rubbing and hot applications  if ever she could look into armines room she was filled with still greater dismay even though a sweet patient smile always met her and a resolute endeavour to make the best of it  it—does—not—make—much—difference gasped armine  one would not like anything  john came out in a character no one could have expected  he showed himself a much better nurse and far more full of resource than the traveller  it was he who bethought him of keeping a kettle in the room over the inevitable charcoal so as slightly to mitigate the chill of the air or the fumes of the charcoal which were equally perilous and distressing to the labouring lungs  he was tender and handy in lifting tall and strong so as to be efficient in supporting and then armine and he understood one another  they had never been special companions john had too much of the kencroft muscularity about him to accord with a delicate imaginative being like armine but they respected one another and made common cause and john had more than once been his little cousins protector  so when they were so much alone that all reserves were overcome armine had comfort in his cousin that no one else in the place could have afforded him  the little boy perfectly knew how ill he was and as he lay in johns arms breathed out his messages to babie as well as he could utter them  and please youll be always mothers other son said armine  wont i  shes been the making of me every way said john  if ever—she does want anybody— said armine feeling but not uttering a vague sense of want of trust in others around her  i will i will  why armie i shall never care for any one so much  thats right  and again after an interval armine spoke of jock saying youll help him johnny  you know sometimes he can be put in mind—  john promised again perhaps less hopefully but he saw that armine hoped  would you mind reading me a psalm came after a great struggle for breath  it was so nice to know babie was saying her psalms at night and thinking of us  so the evening wore away and night came on and john after full six andtwenty hours wakeful exertion and anxiety began to grow sleepy and dozed even as he held his cousin whenever the cough did not shake the poor little fellow  at last with armines consent or rather at his entreaty mr graham though knowing himself a bad substitute took him from the arms of the outwearied lad who in five minutes more was lying dressed as he was in the soundest of dreamless slumbers  when he awoke the sun was up an almost midsummer sun streaming on the fastmelting snow with a dazzling brilliancy  armine was panting under the same deadly oppression on his pillows and mother carey was standing by him talking to mr graham about despatching a messenger to leukerbad in search of one of the doctors who were sure to be found at the baths  how haggard her face looked and armine gasped out  mother your hair  the snow had been there the crisp black waves on her brow were quite white  jock had fallen into a sort of doze from exhaustion but moaning all the time  she could call him no better and armines sunken face told that he was worse  john went in search of more hot water and on the way heard voices which made him call mr graham who knew more of the vernacular german patois than himself to understand it  he thought he had caught something about english and a doctor at kandersteg  it was true  a guide belonging to the other side of the pass who had been weatherbound at kandersteg had just come up with tidings that an english party were there who had meant to cross the gemmi but had given it up finding it too early in the season for the kranklicher milord who was accompanied by his doctor  an english doctor  oh cried john theres some good in that some one must take a note down to him at once  but after some guttural conversation of which he understood only a word or two mr graham said—  they declare it is of no use  the carriage was ordered at nine it is past seven now  but it need not take two hours to go that distance downhill the lazy blackguards exclaimed john  in the present state of the path they say that it will said mr graham  in fact i suspect a little unwillingness to deprive their countrymen of the job  ill go said john then there will be no loss of time about writing  youll look after armine sir and tell my aunt  certainly my boy but youll find it a stiffish pull  i came in second for the mile race last summer at eton said johnny  im not in training now but if a will can do it—  i believe you are right  if you dont catch him we shall hardly have lost time for they say we must wait an hour or two for the gemmi road to get clear of snow  stay dont go without eating you wont keep it up on an empty stomach  remember the proverb  prayer had been with him all night and he listened to the remonstrance as to provender enough to devour a bit of bread put another into his pocket and swallow a long draught of new milk  mr graham further insisted on his taking a lad to show him the right path through the fir woods and though johnny looked more formed for strength than speed and was palecheeked and purpleeyed with broken rest the manner in which he set forth had a purposelike air that was satisfactory—not over swift at the outset over the difficult ground but with a steadfast resolution and with a balance and knowledge of the management of his limbs due to eton athletics  mr graham went up to encourage mrs brownlow  she clasped her hands together with joy and gratitude  that dear dear boy she said i shall owe him everything  jock had wakened rational though only to be conscious of severe suffering  he would hardly believe that armine was really alive till mr graham actually carried in the boy and let them hold each others hands for a moment before placing armine on the other bed  indeed it seemed that this might be the poor boys last meeting armine could only look at his brother since the least attempt to speak increased the agonised struggle for breath which doctor or no doctor gave mr graham small expectation that he could survive another of these cold mountain nights  their mother was so far relieved to have them together that it was easier to attend to them and armines patient eyes certainly acted as a gentle restraint upon jocks moans lamentations and requisitions for her services  it was one of those times that she only passed through by her faculty of attending only to present needs and the physical strength and activity that seemed inexhaustible as long as she had anything to do and which alone alleviated the despair within her heart  meantime john found the rock slippery the path heavy and his young guide a drag on him  the path through the fir woods which had been so delightful two days could it be only two days ago was now a baffling wearisome zigzag yet when he tried to cut across regardless of the voice of his guide he found he lost time for he had to clamber once fell and rolled some distance happily with no damage as he found when he picked himself up and plodded on again without even stopping to shake himself  at last came an opening where he could see down into the kandersteg valley  there was the hotel in clear sunshine looking only too like a house in a german box of toys and alas there was also a toy carriage coming round to the front  like the little footpage of old ballads john let down his feet and ran ran determinately on down the now less precipitous slope—ran till he was beyond the trees with the summer sun beating down on him and in sight of figures coming out from the hotel to the carriage  johnny scarce ventured to give one sigh  he waved his hat in a desperate hope of being seen  no they were in the carriage  the horses were moving  but he remembered a slight steep on the further road where they must go slower  moreover there were a few curves in the horseroad  he set his teeth with the desperate resolution of a moment clenched his hands intensified his mental cry to heaven and with the dogged determination of kencroft dashed on not daring to look at the carriage intent only on the way  he was past the inn but his breath was short and quick his knees were failing an invisible hand seemed to be on his chest making him go slower and slower yet still he struggled on till the mountain tops danced before his eyes cascades rushed into his ears the earth seemed to rise up and stop him but through it all he heard a voice say hullo its the monk  what is the matter  then he knew he was on the ground on his face with kind but tormenting hands busy about him and his heart going so like a sledge hammer that the word he would have given his life to utter would not come out of his lips and all he could do was to grasp convulsively at something that he believed to be a garment of the departing travellers  here the flask  dont speak yet said a mans voice and a choking stimulant was poured into his mouth  when the choking spasm it cost him was over his eyes cleared and he could at least gasp then he saw that it was his housemate evelyn at whom he was clutching and who asked again in amaze—  what is up old fellow  hush not yet said the other voice let him alone till he gets his breath  dont hurry my boy he added we will wait  johnny however felt altogether absorbed in getting out one panting whisper a doctor  yes yes he is cried evelyn  whats the matter  not brownlow  both—oh sobbed john in the agony of contending with the bumping fluttering heart which would not let him fetch breath enough to speak  you will tell us presently  dont be afraid  we will wait said the voice of the man who as john now felt was supporting him hush cecil another minute and he will be able to tell us  indeed the rushing of every pulse was again making it vain for johnny to try to utter anything and he shut his eyes in the realisation that he had succeeded and found help  if his heart would have not bumped and fluttered so fearfully it would have been almost rest as he was helped up by those kind strong arms  it was really for little more than five seconds before he gathered his powers to say still between gasps—  out all night—the moraine—fog—snow—jock—very bad—armine— worse—up there  at schwarenbach   yes  oh come  they are so ill  i am sure dr medlicott will do all he can for them said another voice which john saw proceeded from a very tall slight youth with a fair delicate girlish face  had he not better get into the carriage and return to the hotel  by all means  and john found himself without much volition lifted and helped into the carriage where cecil evelyn scrambled up beside him and put an arm round him  poor old monk you are dead beat he said as the carriage turned the other two walking beside it  did you come that pace all the way down  only after the wood  well twas as plucky a thing as i ever saw  but is skipjack so bad  dreadful  lightheaded all yesterday—horrid pain  but not so bad as armine  if something aint done soon—hell die  poor little brownlow  youve come to the right shop  medlicott is first rate  did you know it was we  no—only—an english doctor said john  mother sent us abroad with him because they said fordham must have swiss air and poor old granny still goes on in the same state said cecil  we got here on tuesday evening and saw your names but then the fog came and it snowed all yesterday and the doctor said it would not do for fordham to go so high  and the more i wanted them to come up with you the more they would not  were they out in that snow  here came an order from the doctor not to make his friend talk and johnny was glad to obey and reserve his breath for the explanation he did not hear what passed between the other two as they walked behind the carriage  a fine fellow that  is he cecils friend  no i wish he were  however it cant be helped now in common humanity and my mother will understand  you mean that it was her wish that we should avoid them  she thinks the influence has not been good for cecil  that was the reason you gave up the gemmi so easily  it was  but as i say it cant be helped now and no harm can be done by going to see whether they are really so ill  brownlow is the name  i wonder if they are any relation to a man i once knew—a lecturer at one of the hospitals  not likely  these are very rich people with a great house in hyde park regions and a place in the country  they are always asking cecil there only my mother does not fancy it  it is not a matter of charity after the first stress  they can easily have advice from england or anywhere they like  by this time they reached the hotel and john alighted briskly enough and explained the state of affairs in a few words  my dear boy said dr medlicott ill go up at once as soon as i can get at our travelling medicinechest  luckily we have what is most likely to be useful  thank you said johnny and therewith he turned dizzy and reeled against the wall  it is nothing—nothing he said as the doctor having helped him into a sittingroom laid his hand on his pulse  dont delay about me  i shall be all right in a minute  they are getting down the boxes  no time is lost said the doctor quietly  see whether they can let us have some soup cecil  i couldnt swallow anything said johnny imploringly  have you had any breakfast this morning  yes a bit of bread and a drink of milk  there was not time for more  and you had been searching all one night and nursing the next  most of it was the confession  but i shall be all right—if there is any pony i could ride upon  you shall byandby but first reeves as a servant with grizzled hair and moustache brought in a neatlyfitted medicinechest i give this young gentleman into your care  he is to lie down on my bed for half an hour and mr evelyn is not to go near him  then if he is awake—  if— ejaculated john  give him a basin of soup—liebig if you cant get anything here  liebig broke out john  oh please take some  theres nothing up there but old goat and nothing to drink but milk and lemonade like beastly hairoil and jock hates milk  never fear said dr medlicott liebig is going and a packet of tea  mrs evelyn does not send us out unprovided  if you eat your soup like a good boy you may then ride up—not walk—unless you wish to be on your mothers hands too  shes my aunt but it is all the same  tell her im coming  i shall go with you doctor said cecil  i must know about brownlow  much good youll do him  but id rather leave this fellow in fordhams charge than yours  so johnny had no choice but to obey growling a little that it was all nonsense and he should be all right in five minutes but that expectation continued without being realised for longer than johnny knew  he awoke with a start to find the liebig awaiting him and lord fordhams eyes fixed on him with though neither understood it the generous though melancholy envy of an invalid youth for a young athlete  have i been asleep he asked looking at his watch  only ten minutes since i looked last  well now i am all right  you will be when you have eaten this said lord fordham  johnny obeyed and ate with relish  there said he now i am ready for anything  dont get up yet  ill go and order a horse for you  when lord fordham came back from doing so he found his patient really fast asleep and with a little colour coming into the pale cheeks  he stole back bade that the pony should wait went on writing his letter and waited till one hour two three hours had passed and at last the sleeper woke greatly disgusted willing to accept the bath which lord fordham advised him to take and which made him quite himself again  youll let me go now he said  i can walk as well as ever  you will be of more use now if you ride said lord fordham there i hear our luncheon coming in  you must eat while the pony is coming round  if it wont lose time—thank you said johnny recovered enough now to know how hungry he was but i ought not to have stayed away  my aunt has no one but me  and you can really help her said lord fordham with some experience of his brothers uselessness  not well of course said johnny but it is better than nobody and armine is so patient and so good that im the more afraid  is not it a very bad sign he added confidentially for he was quite won by the youths kind considerate way and evident liking and sympathy  i dont know faltered lord fordham  my brother walter was like that  is this the little fellow who is cecils fag  yes jock asked him to take him because he was sure never to bully him or lick him when he wouldnt do things  this not very lucid description rejoiced lord fordham  i am glad of that he said  but i hope the little boy will get over this  my mother had a very excellent account of dr medlicotts skill and you know an illness from a misadventure is not like anything constitutional  no but armine is always delicate and my aunt has had to take care of him  do you live with them  o no i have lots of people at home  i only came with them because i had had these measles at eton and my aunt is—well the very jolliest woman that ever was  lord fordham smiled  yes indeed she is  i dont mean only kind and goodnatured  but if you just knew her  the whole world and everything else have just been something new and glorious ever since i knew her  i seem to myself to have lived in a dark hole till she made it all light  ah  i understand that you would do anything for her  that i would if there was anything i could do said johnny hastily finishing his meal  well youve done something today  that—oh that was nothing  i shouldnt have made such a fool of myself if i hadnt been seedy before  i hear the pony he added excuse me  and with a murmured grace he rose  then recollecting himself no end of thanks  i dont know how to thank you enough  dont ive done nothing said lord fordham wringing his hand i only hope—  the words stuck in his throat and with a sigh he watched the lad ride off     chapter xxi  an act of independence    soldier now and servant true earth behind and heaven in view                        isaac williams   marmaduke alwyn evelyn viscount fordham was the fourth bearer of that title within ten years  his father had not lived to wear it and his two elder brothers had both died in early youth  his precarious existence seemed to be only held on a tenure of constant precaution and if his mother ventured to hope that it might be otherwise with the two youngest of the family it was because they were of a shorter sturdier more compact form and less transparent complexion than their elders and altogether seemed of a different constitution  more delicate from the first than the two brothers who had gone before him lord fordham had never been at school had studied irregularly and had never been from under his mothers wing till this summer when she was detained by the slow decay of his grandmother  languor and listlessness had beset the youth and he had been ordered mountain air and thus it was that mrs evelyn had despatched both her sons to switzerland under the attendance of a highly recommended physician a young man bright and attractive who had overworked himself at an hospital and needed thorough relaxation   rightly considering lucas brownlow as the cause of most of cecils eton follies she had given her eldest son a private hint to elude joining forces with the family and he was the most docile and obedient of sons  yet was it the perversity of human nature that made him infinitely more animated and interested in john brownlows race and the distressed travellers on the schwarenbach than he had been since—no one could tell when  perhaps it was the novelty of being left alone and comparatively unwatched  certain it was that he ate enough to rejoice the heart of his devoted and tyrannical attendant reeves and that he walked about in much anxiety all the afternoon continually using his telescope to look up the mountain wherever a bit of the track was visible through the pine woods  in due time cecil rode back the pony which john had taken up  the alacrity with which the long lank bending figure stepped to meet him was something unwonted but the boy himself was downcast and depressed  im afraid youve nothing good to tell  cecil shook his head and after some more seconds broke out—  its awful  what is  brownlows pain  i never saw anything like it  rheumatism  if that is from the exposure i hope it will not last long  no  theyve sent for some opiates to leukerbad and the doctor says that is sure to put him to sleep  medlicott stays there  yes  he says if little armine is any way fit he must move him away tomorrow at all risks from the nightcold up there and he wants reeves to see about men to carry him that is if—if tonight does not—  cecil could not finish  then it is as bad as we heard  quite said cecil or worse  that dear little chap just fancy and his eyes filled with tears  he tried to thank me for having been good to him—as if i had  he was your fag  yes skipjack asked me to choose him because hes that sort of little fellow that wont give into anything that goes against his conscience and if one of those fellows had him that say lower boys have no business with consciences he might be licked within an inch of his life and hed never give in  he did let himself be put under a pump once at some beastly hole in the country for not choosing to use bad language and he has never been so strong since  mother would be glad that at least you allowed him the use of his conscience  im glad i did now said cecil with a sigh though it was a great nuisance sometimes  was the monk as you call him one of that set  bless you no hes a regular sap as steady as old time  i wonder if he is the son of the doctor whom medlicott talks of  no his father is alive  he is a colonel living near their place the other two are the doctors sons their mother came into the property after his death  their maximus was in college at first and between ourselves he was a bit of a snob who couldnt bear to recollect it  not your friend  no indeed  the eldest one who has left these two years and is at christchurch  i am sure the one who came down here was a gentleman  so they are all three of them said cecil who had never found his brother so ready to hear anything about his eton life since in general accounts of the world from which he was debarred so jarred on his feelings that he silenced it with apparent indifference contempt or petulance  now however cecil with his heart full of the brownlows could not say more of them than fordham was willing to hear nay he even found an amused listener to some of his good stories of courageous pranks  fordham was not yet up the next morning when there was a knock at his door and the doctor came in answering his eager question with—  yes he has got through this night but another up in that place would be fatal  we must get them down to leukerbad  over that long precipitous path  it is the only chance  i came down to look up bearers and rig up a couple of hammocks as well as to see how you are getting on  oh  im very well said lord fordham in a tone that meant it sitting up in bed  we might ride on to leukerbad with reeves and get rooms ready  the best thing you could do said dr medlicott joyfully  when we are there we can consider what can be done next and if you wish to go on i could look up some one there in whose charge to leave them till they could get advice from home but it is touch and go with that little fellow  im in no particular hurry said lord fordham answering the doctors tone rather than his words  i would not do anything hasty or that might add to their distress  are there likely to be good doctors at this place  it is a great wateringplace chiefly for rheumatic complaints and that is all very well for the elder boy  as to the little one he is in as critical a state as i ever saw and— his mother is an excellent linguist that is one good thing  yes it would be very trying for her to have a foreigner to attend the boy in such a state however skilled he might be said lord fordham  i think we might make up our minds to stay with them till they can get some one from england  dr medlicott caught at the words  it rests with you he said  of course i am your property and mrs evelyns but i should like to tell you why this is more to me than a matter of common humanity  i went up to study in london a simple foolish lad bred up by three good old aunts more ignorant of the world than their own tabby cat  of course i instantly fell in with the worst stamp of fellows and was in a fair way of being done for body and soul if one of the lecturers after taking us to task for some heartless disgusting piece of levity seeing perhaps that it was more than half bravado on my part and nearly made me sick managed to get me alone  he talked it out with me found out the innocenthearted fool i was cured me of my false shame at what the good old souls at home had taught me showed me what manhood was found a good friend and a better lodging for me in short was the saving of me  he died three months after i first knew him but whatever is worth having in me is owing to him  was he the father of these boys  yes i saw a likeness in the nephew who came down yesterday and i see it in both the others  of course you would wish to do all that is possible for them  i should feel it the greatest honour  still my first duty is to you and you have told me that your mother wished you to keep your brother out of the way of his schoolfellow  my mother would not wish to deprive her worst enemy of your care in such need as this said lord fordham smiling  besides if this friend of cecils were ever so bad he couldnt do him much harm while he is ill poor boy  we will at any rate stay to get them through the next few days and then we can judge  i will settle it with my mother  i knew you would say so rejoined the doctor  thank you  then it seems to me that the right course will be to write to mrs evelyn inclosing a note to dr lucas—who it seems is mrs brownlows chief reliance—asking him to find someone to send out  she can send it on to him if she disapproves of our remaining together longer than is absolutely necessary or if leukerbad disagrees with you  meantime ill go and see whether reeves has found any men to carry the poor boys  unfortunately it was too early in the season for the hotels to have marshalled their full establishment and such careful and surefooted bearers as the sufferers needed could not be had in sufficient numbers so that dr medlicott was forced to decide on leaving the elder patient for a night at schwarenbach  the move might be matter of life or death to armine but jock was better the pain could be somewhat allayed by anodynes the fever was abating and he would rather gain than lose by another day of rest provided he would only accept his fate patiently and also if he could be properly attended to  if mr graham would stay with him—  so breakfast was eaten bills were paid horses hired and the whole cavalcade started from kandersteg in time to secure the best part of a bright hot day for the transit  they met mr graham who had been glad to escape as soon as mrs brownlow had found other assistance so that the doctor was disappointed in his hope of a guardian for jock  lord fordham offered to lend reeves but that functionary absolutely refused to separate himself from his charge observing—  i am responsible for your lordship to your mamma and it does not lie within my province to leave you on any account  reeves always called mrs evelyn your mamma when he wished to be particularly authoritative with his young gentlemen  if they were especially troublesome he called her your ma  and after all said the doctor i dont know what sort of preparations the young gentlemen would make if we let them go by themselves  a bare room perhaps—with no bedclothes and nothing to eat till the table dhote  reeves smiled  he had found the doctor much less of a rival than he had expected and he was a kindhearted man so long as his young lord was made the first object so he declared his willingness to do anything that lay in his power for the assistance of the poor lady and her sons  he would gladly sit up with them if it were in the same house with his lordship  no one came out to meet the party  john was found with armine who had been taken back at night to his own room mrs brownlow as usual with jock who would endure no presence but hers and looked exceedingly injured when sending cecil in to sit with him the doctor called her out of the room  it was a sore stroke on her to hear that her charges must be separated and there was the harrowing question whether she should stay with one or go with the other  please decide she said  i think you should be with the most serious case  and that i fear means my little armine  yes i will do as you tell me  but what can be done for jock—poor jock who thinks he needs me most  and perhaps he does  you know best though dr medlicott and you shall settle it  that is a wise nurse said he kindly i wish i could take your place myself but i must be with the little fellow myself and i am afraid we can only leave his brother to your nephew for this one night  should you be afraid to be sole nurse he added as johnny came to armines door  i think i know what to do if jock can stand having me said johnny stoutly as soon as he understood the question  mother just then shouted jock and as johnny obeyed the call he began—i want my head higher—no—i say not you—mother carey  she is busy with the doctor  cant she come and do this  no i say and he threw the nearest thing at hand at him  come said cecil im glad you can do such things as that  but jock gave a cry of pain and protested that it was all johns fault for making him hurt himself instead of fetching mother  you had better let me lift you said john you know she is tired and i really am stronger  no you shant touch me—a great clumsy lout  in the midst of these amenities the doctor appeared and jock looked slightly ashamed especially when the doctor instead of doing what was wanted directed john where to put an arm and how to give support while moving the pillow adding that he was a handy fellow more so than many a pupil after half a years training at the hospital and smiling down jocks growls and groans which were as much from displeasure as from pain  they were followed by some despairing sighs at the horrors of the prospect of being moved  ah what will you give me for letting you off said the doctor  jock uttered a sound of relief then rather distrustfully asked— why  we can only get bearers enough for one and as it is most important to move your brother while you will gain by a nights rest he must have the first turn  and welcome said jock my mother will stay with me  thats the very point said dr medlicott  i want you not only to give her up but to do so cheerfully  im sure mother wants to stay with me  armine does not need her half so much  he does not require the same kind of attention but he is in so critical a state that i do not think i ought to separate her from him  why what is the matter with him asked jock startled  congestion of the right lung said the doctor seeing that he was strong enough to bear the information and feeling the need of rousing him from his monopolising selfabsorption  people get over that dont they said jock with an awestruck interrogation in his voice  they do and i hope much from getting him into a warmer atmosphere but the child is so much reduced that the risk is great and i should not dare not to have his mother with him  then as jock was silent i have told you because you can make a great difference to their comfort by not showing how much it costs you to let her go  jock drew the bed clothes over his face and an odd stifled sound was heard from under them he remained thus perdu while directions were being given to john for the night but as the doctor was leaving the room emerged and said—  bring him in before he goes  in a short time for it was most important not to lose the fine weather the doctor carried armine in swathed in rugs and blankets a pale sunken worn face and great hollow eyes looking out at the top  the mother said something cheerful about a live mummy but the two poor boys gazed at one another with sad earnest wistful eyes and wrung one anothers hands  dont forget gasped armine labouring for breath  and jock answered—  all right armie goodbye  im coming to morrow with a choking quivering attempt at bravery  yes tomorrow said poor mother carey bending over him  my boy —my poor good boy if i could but cut myself in two  i cant tell you how thankful i am to you for being so good about it  that dear good johnny will do all he can and it is only till tomorrow  youll sleep most of the time  all right mother was again all that jock could manage to utter and the kisses that followed seemed to him the most precious he had known  he hid his face again bearing his trouble the better because the lull of violent pain quelled by opiates so that his senses were all as in a dream bound up  when he looked up again at the clink of glass it was cecil whom he saw measuring off his draught  you he exclaimed  yes medlicott said i might stay till four and give the monk a chance of a sleep  that fellow can always snooze away off hand and he is as sound as a top in the next room but i was to give you this at two  youre sure its the right stuff  i should think so  weve practice enough in the family to know how to measure off a dose by this time  how is it you are out here still  this is thursday isnt it  we meant to have been half way home to be in time for the matches  im not going back this half worse luck  they were mortally afraid these measles would make me get tender in the chest like all the rest of us so ive got nothing to do but be dragged about with fordham after churches and picture galleries and mountains said cecil in a tone of infinite disgust  i declare it made me half mad to look at the lake of lucerne and recollect that we might have been in the eight  not this year  no but next  in this contemplation cecil was silent only fondling chico until jock instead of falling asleep again said evelyn what does your doctor really think of the little chap  cecil screwed up his face as if he had rather not be asked  never you think about it he said doctors always croak  hell be all right again soon  if i was sure sighed jock but you know he has always been such a religious little beggar  its a horrid bad sign  like my brother walter said cecil gravely  now duke can be ever so snappish and peevish im not half so much afraid for him  you never heard anything like the little fellow that night said jock and therewith he gave his friend by far the most connected account of the adventure that had yet been arrived at  he even spoke of the resolution to which he had been brought and in a tone of awe described how he had pledged himself for the future  so you see im in for it he concluded i must give up all our jolly larks  then i shant get into so many rows with my mother and uncle said cecil by no means with the opposition his friend had anticipated  then youll stand by me said jock  gladly  my mother was at me all last easter telling me my goings on were worse to her than losing george or walter and talking about my confirmation and all  she only let me be a communicant on easter day because i did mean to make a fresh start—and i did mean it with all my heart only when that supper was talked of i didnt like to stick out against you brownlow i never could you know and i didnt know what it was coming to  nor i said jock thats the worst of it  when a lark begins one doesnt know how far one will get carried on  but that night i thought about the confirmation and how i had made the promise without really thinking about it and never had been to holy communion  i meant it all said cecil and broke it so im worst  well said jock if i go back from the promise little armie made me make about being christs faithful soldier and servant i could never face him again—no nor death either  you cant think what it was like evelyn sitting in the dead stillness—except for an awful crack and rumbling in the ice and the solid snow fog shutting one in  how ugly and brutish and horrid all those things did look and how it made me long to have been like the little fellow in my arms or even this poor little dog who knew no better  then somehow came now and then a wonderful sense that god was all round us and that our lord had done all that for my forgiveness if i only meant to do right in earnest  oh how to go on meaning it  thats the thing said cecil  i mean it fast enough at home and when my mother talks to me and i look at my brothers graves but it all gets swept away at eton  it wont now though if you are different brownlow  i never liked any fellow like you i knew you were best even when you were worst  so if you go in for doing right i shant care for anyone else—not even cressham and bulford  if they choose to make asses of themselves they must said jock it will be a bore but one mustnt mind things  i say evelyn suppose we make that promise of armines over again together now  it is only the engagement we made when we were sworn into christs army at our baptism said the much more fully instructed cecil we always were bound by it  yes but we knew nothing about it then and we really mean it now said jock  if we do it for ourselves together it will put us on our honour to each other and to christ our captain and thats what we want  lay hold of my hand  the two boys with clasped hands and grave steadfast eyes with one voice repeated together—  we john lucas brownlow and cecil fitzroy evelyn promise with all our hearts manfully to fight under christs banner and continue his faithful soldiers and servants to our lives end  amen  then cecil touched lucass brow with his lips and said—  fellowsoldiers brownlow  brothers in arms responded jock  it was one of those accesses of deep enthusiasm and even of sentiment which modern cynicism and false shame have not entirely driven out of youth  their hearts were full and jock the stronger abler and more enterprising had always exercised a fascination over his friend who was absolutely enchanted to find him become an ally instead of a tempter and to be no longer pulled two opposite ways  ought we not to say a prayer to make it really firm  we cant stand alone you know he said diffidently  if you like if you know one said jock  cecil knelt down and said the lords prayer and the collect for the fourth epiphany sunday  thats nice was jocks comment  how did you know it  mother made us learn the collects every sunday and she wrote that in my little book  i always begin the half with it but afterwards i cant go on  then it doesnt do you much good was the not unnatural remark  i dont know said cecil hesitating may be all this—your getting right i mean is the coming round of prayers—my mothers i mean for if you take this turn it will be much easier for me  poor mother its not for want of her caring and teaching  my mother doesnt bother about it  i wish she did said cecil  if she had gone on like mine you would have been ever so much better than i  no i should have been bored and bothered into being regularly good fornothing  you dont know what shes really like  shes nicer than anyone—as jolly as any fellow and yet a lady all over  i know that said cecil she was uncommonly jolly to me at eton and i know my mother and she will get on like a house on fire  were too old to have a scrimmage about them like disgusting little lower boys he added seeing jock still bristling in defence of mother carey  this produced a smile and he went on—  look here skipjack we will be fellowsoldiers every way  my uncle james can do anything at the horse guards and he shall have us set down for the same regiment  ill tell him you are my good influence  but ive been just the other way  oh but you will be—a year or two will show it  which shall it be do you go in for cavalry or infantry  i like cavalry but hes all for the other  jock was wearied enough not to have much contribution to make to the conversation and he thus left cecil such a fair field as he seldom enjoyed for uncle jamess indian and crimean campaigns and for the comparative merits of the regiments his nephew had beheld at reviews  he was interrupted by a message from the guide that there was a cloud in the distance and the young herr had better set off quickly unless he wished to be weatherbound  johnny was on his feet as soon as there was a step on the stairs and was congratulated on his ready powers of sleeping  its in the family said jock  his brother rob went to sleep in the middle of the examination for his commission  then i should think he could sleep on the rack said cecil  im sure i wish i could rejoined jock  what a sell for the torturers to get some chloroform said john and so cecil departed amid laughter which gave john little idea how serious the talk had been in his absence  the rain came on even more rapidly than the guide had foretold and it was a drenched and dripping object that rode into the court of the tall hotel at leukerbad and immediately fell into the hands of dr medlicott and reeves who deposited him ignominiously in bed in spite of all his protestations and murmurs  however he had the comfort of hearing that his little fag was recovering from the exhaustion of the journey  he had at first been so faint that the doctor had watched fearing that he would never revive again and he had not yet attempted to speak but his breathing was certainly already less laboured and the choking struggling cough less frequent  he really seems likely to have a little natural sleep was lord fordhams report somewhat later on coming in to find cecil sitting up in bed to discuss a very substantial supper  i hope that with reeves and the doctor to look to him his mother may get a little rest tonight  have you seen her  only for a moment or two poor thing but i never did see such eyes or such a wonderful sad smile as she tried to thank us with medlicott is ready to do anything for her husbands sake i am sure anyone would do the same for hers  to get such a look is something to remember  well done duke ejaculated cecil under his breath for he had never seen his senior so animated or so enthusiastic  then you mean to stay and let medlicott look after them  of course i do said fordham in a much more decided tone than he had used in the morning  im not going to do anything so barbarous as to leave them to some german practitioner and when we are here i dont see why they should have advice out from home—not half so good probably  youre a brick duke uttered cecil and though fordham hated slang he smiled at the praise  and now duke be a good fellow and give me some clothes  that brute reeves has not brought me in one rag  really it is hardly worth while  it is nearly eight oclock and i dont know where your portmanteau was put  shall i get you a book  no but if youd get me a pen and ink i want to write to mother  such a desire was not too frequent in cecil and fordham was glad enough to promote it bringing in his own neat apparatus with only a mild entreaty that his favourite pen might be well treated and the sheets respected  he had written his own letter of explanation of his first act of independence and he looked with some wonder at his brothers rapid writing not without fear that some sudden pressure for a foolish debt might have been the result of his teteatete with his dangerous friend  cecils letters were too apt to be requests for money or confessions of debts and if this were the case what would be mrs evelyns view of the conduct of the whole party in disregarding her wishes  had he been with his mother he would have probably been called into consultation over the letter but he was forced to remain without the privilege here offered to the reader—                                   baden hotel leukerbad june 14  dearest mother—duke has written about our falling in with the brownlows and how pluckily friar caught us up  it was a regular mercy for the little one couldnt have lived without dr medlicott and most likely lucas is in for a rheumatic fever  he has been telling me all about it and how frightful it was to be all night out on the edge of the glacier in a thick fog with his ankle strained and how little armine went on with his texts and hymns and wasnt a bit afraid but quite happy  you never would believe what a fellow brownlow is  we have had a great talk and you will never have to say again that he does me harm  mammy darling i want to tell you that i was a horrible donkey last half worse than you guessed and i am sorrier than ever i was before and this is a real true resolution not to do it again brownlow and i have promised to stand by one another about right and wrong to our lives end  he means it and what brownlow means he does and so do i  we said your collect and somehow i do feel as if god would help us now  please dearest mother forgive me for all i have not told you  duke is very well and jolly  he is quite smitten with mrs brownlow and what is more so is reeves who says she is such a lady that it is a pleasure to do anything for her                                                your loving son                                                   c f e   cecils letter went off with his brothers in early morning but it was such a day as only mails and postmen encounter  mountains pine woods nay even the opposite houses were blotted out by sheets of driving rain and it was impossible to think of bringing jock down dr medlicott heard and saw with dismay  what would the mother say to him—nay what ought he to have done  he could hardly expect her not to reproach him and he fairly dreaded meeting her eyes when they turned from the streaming window  but all she said was we did not reckon on this  if i had began the doctor  please dont vex yourself said she you could not have done otherwise and perhaps the move would have hurt him more than staying there  you have been so very kind  see what you have done here  for armine after some hours that had been very distressing had sunk into a calm sleep and there was a far less oppressed look on his wan little face  the doctor would have had her take some rest but she shook her head the only means of allaying the gnawing anxiety for jock and the despairing fancies about his suffering and johnnys helplessness was the attending constantly to armine  anyway i will see him today said dr medlicott impelled far more by the patient silence with which she sat one hand against her beating heart than he would have been by any entreaty  but how she thanked him when she found him really setting forth  she insisted on his taking a guide as much for his own security as to carry some additional comforts to the prisoners and she committed to him two little notes one to each boy written through a mist of tears  yes tears unusual as they were with her were called forth as much by the kindness she met with as by her sick yearning after the two lonely boys  and when she knew the doctor was on his way she could yield to armines signs of entreaty lie back in her chair and sleep while reeves watched over him  when the doctor by a strong mans determination had made his way up the pass he found matters better than he had dared to expect  the patient was certainly not worse and the medicine had kept him in a sleepy tranquil state in which he hardly realised the situation his young attendant was just considering how to husband the last draught when the welcome dripping visitor appeared  the patient was not in bad spirits considering and could not but feel himself reprieved by the weather  he was too sleepy to feel the dulness of his present position and even allowed that his impromptu nurse had done tolerably well  johnny had been ready at every call had rubbed away an attack of pain hurt wonderfully little in lifting him and was not half a bad lot altogether—an admission of which doctor and nurse knew the full worth  johnny himself was pleased and grateful and had that sort of satisfaction which belongs to the finding out of ones own available talent  he had done what was pronounced the right thing and not only that but he had liked the doing it and he declared himself not afraid to encounter another night alone with his cousin  he had picked up enough vernacular german to make himself understood and indeed was a decided favourite with fraulein rosalie who would do anything for her dear young herr  it was possible to get a fair amount of sleep and dr medlicott felt satisfied that the charge was not too much for him and indeed there was no other alternative  the doctor stayed as long as he could and did his best to enliven the dulness by producing a pocketful of tauchnitzes and sitting talking while the patient dozed  johnny showed such intelligent curiosity as to the how and why of the symptoms and their counteraction that after some explanation the doctor said you ought to he one of us my friend  i have sometimes thought about it said john  indeed cried the doctor like an enthusiast in his profession and john though not a ready speaker was drawn on by his notes of interest to say i dont really like anything so much as making out about man and what one is made of  physiology  yes said the boy who had been shy of uttering the scientific term  theres nothing like it for interest it seems to me besides one is more sure of being of use that way than in any other  capital  then what withholds you  isnt it swell enough  johnny laughed and coloured  im not such a fool but i am not sure about my people  i thought your uncle was joseph brownlow  my aunt would be delighted but it is my own people  they would say my education—eton and all that—was not intended for it  you may tell them that whatever tends to make you more thoroughly a man and gentleman and less of a mere professional is a benefit to your work  the more you are in yourself the higher your work will be  i hope you will go to the university  i mean to go up for a scholarship next year but ive lost a great deal of time now and i dont know how far that will tell  i think you will find that what you may have lost in time you will have gained in power  i do want to go in for physical science but theres another difficulty  one of my cousins does so but the effect on him has not made my father like it the better—and—and to tell the truth— he half mumbled it makes me doubt—  the effect on his faith  yes  if faith is unsettled by looking deeper into the mysteries of gods works it cannot have been substantial faith but merely outward thoughtless reception said the doctor as he met two thoughtful dark eyes fixed on him in inquiry and consideration  thank you sir after a pause  had this troubled you  yes said john i couldnt stand doubt there  i would rather break stones on the road than set myself doubting  why should you think that there is danger  it seems to be so with others  depend upon it doubting castle never lay on the straight road  if men run into it it is not simple study of the works of creation that leads them there but either they have only acquiesced and never made their faith a living reality or else they are led away by fashion and pride of intellect  one who begins and goes on in active love of god and man will find faith and reverence not diminished but increased  but arent there speculations and difficulties  none which real active religion and love cannot regard as the mere effects of halfknowledge—the distortions of a partial view  i speak with all my heart as one who has seen how it has been with many of my own generation as well as with myself  johnny bent his head and the young physician somewhat surprised at finding himself saying so much on such points left that branch of the subject and began to talk to him about his uncle     chapter xxii  shutting the stable door    presumptuous maid with looks intent again she gazed again she bent   nor knew the gulf between                           grey   hurrah  its johnny  georgie  recollect yourself  but mamma it was johnny  johnny does not come till evening  sit still children or i shall have to send you to dine in the nursery  somebody did pass the window mamma but i thought it was rob said jessie now grown into a very finelooking tall handsome maiden with a grandlyformed head and shoulders and pleasant soft brown eyes  it was johnny reiterated little george and at that moment the diningroom door opened and the decorum of the luncheon dinner entirely giving way the three little ones all precipitated themselves towards the entering figure while jessie and her mother rose at their two ends of the table and the colonel no luncheon eater came in from the study  what johnny already  the tidal train was earlier than i expected so i have another half day  well are you all well  quite well  why—how you are grown  i thought it was rob when you passed my window said his father  so did i at first added jessie but rob is much broader  yes said his mother  i am glad you are come back johnny you look thin and pale  sit down  some mutton or some rabbitpie  no no let jessie help you you shant have all the carving im sure you are tired you dont look at all well  i was crossing all night you know said johnny laughing and am as hungry as a hunter thats all  what a blessing to see a nice clean english potato again without any flummery  ah  i thought so said his mother they didnt know how to feed you  it was an unfortunate business altogether  how did you leave those poor boys johnny asked his father  better said johnny  jock is nearly well—will be quite so after the baths and armine is getting better  he sat up for an hour the day before i came away  and your aunt said his father  wonderful said john with a quiver of feeling on his face  you never saw anything like her  she keeps up but she looks awfully thin and worn  i couldnt have left her if dr medlicott and lord fordham and his man had not all been bent on saving her whatever they could  her serene highness virtuously forbore a sigh  she never could believe those chains with which caroline bound all men to her service to be either unconscious or strictly proper however she only said—  it was high time that you came away you were quite knocked up with being left a week alone with lucas in that horrid place  i cant think how your aunt came to think of it  she didnt think said john bluntly  it was only a week and it couldnt be helped  besides it was rather jolly  but it knocked you up  oh that was only a notion of the doctor and my aunt  they said i was done up first because i caught cold and i was glad to wait a day or two longer at leukerbad in hopes allen and bobus would have come out before i went  they come out  not they said the colonel  tis not the way of young men nowadays to give up anything for their fathers and mothers no no bobus cant spare a week from his readingparty but must leave his mother to a set of chance acquaintance and allen—whom poor caroline always thinks the affectionate one if he is nothing else—cant give up going to gape at the sun at midnight and rob was wanting to make one of their freight of fools but i told him it was quite enough to have one son wandering abroad at other peoples expense when it couldnt be helped and that i wouldnt have another unless he was prepared to lay down his share in the yacht out of his pay and allowance  im glad you are come home johnny it was quite right to come as soon as your aunt could spare you poor thing  she writes warmly about you i am glad you were able to be of use to her but you ought not to waste any more time  no  i wrote to my tutor that i would be at eton tomorrow night in time to begin the weeks work  papa cried out mrs brownlow you will never let him start so soon  he is so pulled down i must have him at home to get him right again and there are all his clothes to look over  colonel brownlow gave the odd little chuckling noise that meant to all the family that he did not see the force of mammas objections and john asseverated that he was perfectly well and that his eton garments were all at hyde corner where he should take them up meantime he thought he ought to walk to belforest to report to his cousins and carry a key which his aunt had sent by him to janet  they will be coming in this evening said his mother you had better stay and rest  i must go over thank you said john  there is a book armine wants to have sent out to him  jessie will you walk with me  and me cried george  and me cried edmund  and me lina go cried the smallest voice  but the colonel disconcerted the petitioners by announcing that he had business at belforest and would drive johnny over in the dog cart  so jessie had to console herself by agreeing with her mother that johnny looked much more manly yes and had an air and style about him which both admired very much though while mrs brownlow deemed it the true outcome of the admixture of friar and brownlow jessie gave more credit to eton and belforest for jessie was really fond of her aunt to whom she had owed most of her extra gaieties moreover mrs brownlow though often chafing secretly had the power of reticence and would not set the minds of her children against one who was always doing them kindnesses  true these favours were more than she could easily brook since her pride and independence were not like her husbands tempered by warm affection  it was his doing that the expenses of johnnys education had been accepted and that esther and ellen had been sent by their aunt to a good school thus gratitude unpalatable though it were prevented unguarded censure  she abstained from much and as there was no quick intuition in the family even jessie the most in her confidence only vaguely knew that mamma thought aunt caroline too clever and flyaway but mamma was grave and wise and it was very nice to have an aunt who was young and lively and always had pleasant things going on in her house  jessie always had her full share not indeed appreciating the intellect but possessing beauty and charm enough to be always appreciated there  sweetly pretty as mrs coffinkey called her was exactly what she was for she was thoroughly good and unselfish and a happy simple nature looked out through her brown smiling eyes  she was very fond of her cousins had shared all the anxieties of the last fortnight to the utmost and was a good deal disappointed at being baulked of the walk with her brother in which she would have heard so much more about armine jock and aunt caroline than would be communicated in public  johnny however was glad of the invitation even though a little shy of it  the teteatete drive was an approach to the serious business of life since it was evidently designed to give opportunity for answering a letter which he had thought out and written while laid up at leukerbad by a bad cold and the reaction from his exertions at schwarenbach  still his father did not speak till they had driven up the hill and were near the gates of belforest  then he said—  that was not a bad letter that you wrote me johnny  johnny flushed with pleasure  the letter had cost him much thought and pains and commendation from his father was rare  but it will take a great deal of consideration  yes said johnny  you dont disapprove do you papa  well said the colonel in his ponderous way you have advantages you know and you might do better for yourself  there was a quivering impulse on johnnys lips to say that it was not to himself that he wanted to do good but when his father was speaking in that deliberate manner he was not to be interrupted and there was nothing for it but to hear him out  your aunt is providing you with the best of educations you have good abilities and industry and you will be a welllooking fellow besides added the colonel glancing over him with an approving eye of fatherly satisfaction and it seems to me that you could succeed in some superior line  your mother and i had always hoped to see you at the bar  every opportunity for distinction is given you and i do not understand this sudden desire to throw them up for a profession of much greater drudgery and fewer chances of rising unless it were from some influence of your aunt  she never spoke of it  she does not know that i have thought of it nor of my letter to you  then it is simply from enthusiasm for this young doctor  not exactly said john but i always wished i could be like my uncle  i remember hearing mamma read a bit of one of the letters of condolence which said his was one of the most beautiful lives i have ever known and i never forgot it  it stayed in my mind like a riddle till i gradually found out that the beauty was in the good he was always doing—  ah said the colonel in a tone betokening that he was touched and which encouraged john to continue—  besides i really do like and enter into scientific subjects better than any others i believe it is my turn  perhaps—you do sometimes put me in mind of your uncle  but why have you only spoken of it now  i dont think i really considered what i should be said john there was quite enough to think of with work and cricket and all the rest till this spring when i have been off it all and then when i talked it over with dr medlicott he settled my mind about various things that i wanted to know  did he persuade you  no more than saying that i managed well for jock when i was left alone with him and that he thought i had the makings of a doctor in me  he loves his profession of course and thinks it a grand one yes papa indeed i think it is  to be always learning the ways of gods working for the sake of lessening all the pain and grief in the world—  johnny  thats almost what my brother said to me thirty years ago and what did it come to  being at the beck and call night and day of every beggar in london and dying at last in his prime of disease caught in their service  yes said john with a low gruff sound in his voice but is not that like being killed in battle  the world doesnt think it so my boy said the soldier  well what is it you propose to do  i dont suppose it will make much difference yet said john except that at oxford i should go in more for physical science  you dont want to give up the university  oh no  dr medlicott said a degree there is a great help besides that all the general study one can get is the more advantage lifting one above the mere practitioner  that is well said the colonel  if you are to go to the university there is no need to dwell further on the matter at present  you will have had time to see more of the world and you will know whether this wish only comes from enthusiasm for a pleasant young man who has been kind to you or if it be your real deliberate choice and if so your mother will have had time to reconcile herself to the notion  at any rate we will say no more about it for the present  though i must say johnny he added as he turned his horses head between the ribbon borders of the approach you have thought and spoken like a sensible lad and so like my dear brother that i could not deny you  if johnny could hardly believe in the unwonted commendation which made his heart throb and sent a flood of colour into his cheeks colonel brownlow was equally amazed at the boys attainment of a manly and earnest thought and purpose so utterly unlike anything he had hitherto seen in the stolid rob or the easygoing allen or even in bobus who—whatever there might be in him—never thought it worth while to show it to his uncle  however discussion was cut short by a little flying figure which came rushing across the garden and babie with streaming hair clung to her cousin gasping—  oh johnny johnny tell me about armie and jock  they are ever so much better babie said johnny lifting the slim little thing up in his arms as he had lifted his own fiveyearold brother  ive got a thick parcel of acrostics for you armie makes them in bed and lord fordham writes them out  will you come to the rosary uncle robert said babie recovering her manners as johnny set her down  it is the coolest place and they are sitting there  why babie what a sprite you look said johnny  you look as if you were just off the sicklist too  im all right said babie shaking her hair at him and bounding on before with the tidings of their coming while her uncle observed in a low voice—  poor little thing  i believe she has been a good deal knocked up between the heat and the anxiety there was no making her eat or sleep  ah miss elfie are you acting queen of roses as babie returned together with elvira who with a rich dark red rose over one ear and a large bouquet at her bosom justified the epithet at which she bridled and half curtsied in her graceful stately archness as she gave her hand in greeting and exclaimed—  ah johnny are you come  when is mother carey going to send for us  when they leave leukerbad i fancy said john  thats a tiresome place for anyone who does not need to lead the life of a hippo potamus  it cant be more tiresome than this is said elvira with a yawn lessons all day and nobody to come near us  isnt this a dreadful place said john merrily as he looked into the rosary a charming bowery circle of fragrance inclosed by arches of trelliswork on which roses were trained their wreaths now bearing a profusion of blossoms of every exquisite tint from deep crimson or goldenyellow to purest white while their more splendid standard sisters bloomed out in fragrant and gorgeous magnificence under their protection  at the shady end there was a little grass plat round a tiny fountain whose feather of spray rose and plashed coolness  near it were seats where miss ogilvie and janet were discovered with books and work they came forward with greetings and inquiries which johnny answered in detail  yes they are both better  armine sat by the window for an hour the day before i came away  will they be able to come back to eton after the holidays asked his father  certainly not armine but jock seems to be getting all right  if he was to catch rheumatism he did it at the right place for thats what leukerbad is good for  oh babie you never saw such a lark  fancy a great room and where the floor ought to be nothing but muddy water or liquid mud with steps going down and a lot of heads looking out of it some with curly heads some in smokingcaps some in fine caps of lace and ribbons  oh johnny like women  like women  they are women  not both together  yes i tell you the whole boiling of them male and female theres a fat german countess who always calls jock her liebes kind and comes floundering after him to his very great disgust  the only things they have to show they are human still and not frogs are little boards floating before them with their pockethandkerchiefs and coffeecups and newspapers  oh like the little blacks in the dear bright bays at san ildefonso cried elvira  you dont mean that they have no clothes on said babie with shocked downrightness of speech that made everybody laugh and johnny satisfied her on that score adding that dr medlicott had made a parody of tennysons merman for jocks benefit on giving him up to a leukerbad doctor who was to conduct his months kur  it was to go into the travellers joy a manuscript magazine the first number of which was being concocted and illustrated amongst the leukerbad party for the benefit of babie and sydney evelyn  as a foretaste johnny produced from the bag he still carried strapped on his shoulder a packet of acrostics addressed to miss barbara brownlow and a smaller envelope for janet  is it the key asked colonel brownlow  yes said janet the key of her davenport and directions in which drawer to find the letters you want  do you like to have them at once uncle robert  thank you—yes for then i can go round and settle with that fellow martin which i cant do without knowing exactly what passed between him and your mother  janet went off observing—i wonder whether that is a possibility while miss ogilvie put in an anxious inquiry for mrs brownlows health and spirits and a good many more details were elicited than johnny had given at home  she had never broken down and now that she was hopeful was in spite of her fatigue as bright and merry as ever and was contributing comic pictures to the travellers joy while lord fordham did the sketches  those kind people were as careful of her as any could be  and what are her further plans asked miss ogilvie has she been able to form any  hardly said johnny  they must stay at leukerbad for a month for jock to have the course of waters rightly and indeed armine could hardly be moved sooner  i think dr medlicott wants them to keep in switzerland till the heat of the weather is over and then winter in the south  and when may i go to armine  when shall we get away from here asked babie and elfie in a breath  i dont quite know said john  there is not much room to spare in the hotel where they are at leukerbad and it is a dreadfully slow place  evelyn is growling like a dozen polar bears at it  why isnt he gone back with you to eton  i believe it was settled that he was not to go back this half for fear of his lungs and you see he is a swell who takes it easily  he would have been glad enough to return with me though and would scarcely have endured staying but that he is so fond of jock  what is there to be done there  nothing except to wade in tepid mud  fordham has routed out a german to read faust with and that puts evelyn into a sweet temper they go on expeditions and do sketching and botany which amuses armine but they get up some fun over the queer people and do them for the mag but it is all deadly lively not that i saw much of it for we only got down from schwarenbach on monday and they kept me in bed all the two next days but jock and evelyn hate it awfully indeed jock is so down in the mouth altogether i dont know what to make of him and just when the german doctors say the treatment makes people particularly brisk and lively  perhaps what makes a german lively makes an englishman grave sagely observed babie  jock grave must be a strange sight said the colonel i am afraid he cant be recovering properly  the doctor thinks he is said john but then he doesnt know the nature of the skipjack  but he added in a low voice that night was enough to make any one grave and it was much the worst to jock because he kept his senses almost all the time and was a good deal hurt besides to begin with  his sprain is still so bad that he has to be carried upstairs and to go to the baths in a chair  and do you think said the colonel that this young lord is going to stay on all this time in this dull place for the sake of an utter stranger  jock and evelyn were always great friends at eton said john then my uncle did something i dont know what that medlicott is grateful for and they have promised to see armine through this illness  the place agrees with fordham they say he has never been so well or active since he came out  what is he like inquired babie  like babie  like anything long and limp you can think of  he sits all in a coil and twist and you dont think theres much of him but when he gets up and pulls himself upright you go looking and looking till you dont know wheres the top of him till you see a thin white face in washedout hair  he is a good fellow awfully kind and i suppose he cant help being such a tremendous— john hesitated in deference to his father for a word that was not slang and finally chose don  oh sighed babie armie said in his note he was jolly beyond description  well so he is said john he plays chess with armie and brings him flowers and books and waits on him as you used to do on a sick doll  and thats just what he is he ought to have been a woman and he would have been much happier too poor fellow  id rather be dead at once than drag about such a life of coddling as he does  poor lad said his father  did janet understand that i was waiting for those letters i wonder  you had better go and see babie said miss ogilvie  perhaps she cannot find them  babie set off and john proceeded to explain that mrs evelyn was still detained in london by old lady fordham who continued to be kept between life and death by her doctors  meantime the sons could dispose of themselves as they pleased while under the care of dr medlicott and were not wanted at home so that there was little doubt but that they would remain with armine as long as he needed their physicians care  all the while elfie was flitting about pelting johnny with handfuls snatched from overblown roses and though he returned the assault at every pause his grey travelling suit was bestrewn with crimson pink cream and white petals  at last the debris of a huge eugenie grandet hit him full on the bridge of his nose and caused him to exclaim—  nay elfie you little wretch that was quite a good rosenot fair game and leaping up to give her chase in and out among the beds they nearly ran against janet returning with the letters and saying she was sorry to have been so long but mothers hoards were never easy places of research  barbara came more slowly back and looked somewhat as if she had had a sharper rebuke than she understood or relished  poor child she had suffered much in this her first real trouble and a little thing was enough to overset her  she had not readily recovered from the petulant tone of anger with which janet told her not to come peeping and worrying  janet had given a most violent start when she opened the door of her mothers bedroom where the davenport stood and janet much resented being startled no doubt that was the reason she was so cross thought barbara but still it was very disagreeable  that room was the childs also  she had been her mothers bedfellow ever since her fathers death and she felt her present solitude the nights were sultry and her sleep had been broken of late  that night she was in a slumber as cool as a widelyopened window would make it but not so sound that she was not haunted all the time by dread for armine  suddenly she was awakened to full consciousness by seeing a light in the room  no it was not the maid putting away her dresses  it was janet bending over her mothers davenport  babie started up  janet  is anything the matter  nothing  nonsense go to sleep child  what are you about  never mind  only mother keeps her things in such a mess i was setting them to rights after disturbing them to find the book  there was something in the tone like an apology  babie did not like it but she well knew that she should be contemptuously put down if she attempted an inquiry far less a remonstrance with janet  only with a puzzled sort of watchdog sense she sat up in bed and stared  why dont you lie down said janet  babie did lie down but on her back her head high up on the pillow and her eyes well open still  perhaps janet did not like it for she gave an impatient shuffle to the papers shut the drawer with a jerk locked it took up her candle and went away without vouchsafing a goodnight  babie lay wondering  she knew that the davenport contained all that was most sacred and precious to her mother as relics of her old life and that only dire necessity would have made her let anyone touch it  what could janet mean  to speak would be of no use  one andtwenty was not likely to listen to thirteen though babie in her dreamy wakefulness found herself composing conversations in which she made eloquent appeals to janet which she was never likely to utter  at last the morning twitterings began outside doves cooed peacocks miawed light dawned and babies perceptions cleared themselves  in the wainscoted room was a large closet used for hanging up cloaks and dresses and fortunately empty  no sooner did the light begin to reflect itself in its polished oakpanelled door than an idea struck babie and bounding from her bed she opened the door wheeled in the davenport shut it in turned the big rusty key with both hands and a desperate effort then repairing to her own little inner room disturbed the honourable retirement of the last and bestbeloved of her dolls in a pinklined cradle in a disused dolls house and laying the key beneath the mattress felt heroically ready for the thumbscrew rather than yield it up  she knew armine would say she was right and be indignant that janet should meddle with mothers private stores  so she turned over on the pillow cooled by the morning breeze and fell into a sound sleep whence she was only roused by the third miss barbara from her maid  she heard no more of the matter and but for the absence of the davenport could really have thought it all a dream  she was driving her two little fairy ponies to kenminster with elvira to get the afternoon post when a quiet light step came into the bedroom and janet stood within it looking for the davenport as if she did not quite believe her senses  however remembering babies eyes she had her suspicions  she looked into the little girls room and saw nothing then tried the closet door and finding it locked came to a tolerably correct guess as to what had become of it and felt hotly angry at that conceited childs meddling folly  for the awkward thing was that the clasped memorandumbook containing magnum bonum was in her hand locked out of instead of into its drawer  when searching for the accountbook for her uncle it had as it were offered itself to her and though so far from being green with garden marked on it it was russia leather and had j b upon it she had peeped in and read magnum bonum within the lid  all day the idea had haunted her that there lay the secret in the charge of her little thoughtless mother who ignorant of its true value and deterred by uncomprehended words and weak scruples was withholding it from the world and depriving her own family and what was worst of all her daughter of the chances of becoming illustrious  i am his daughter as much as hers thought she  why should she deprive me of my inheritance  certainly janet had been told that the great arcanum could not be dealt with by a woman but this she did not implicitly believe and she was in consequence the more curious to discover what it really was and whether it was reasonable to sacrifice the best years of her life to preparing for it  the supposed unfairness of her exclusion seemed to her to justify the act and thus it was that she had stolen to the davenport when she supposed that her little sister would be asleep and finding it impossible to attend or understand with babies great brown eyes lamping on her she had carried off the book  she had been reading it even till the morning light had surprised her and had been able to perceive the general drift though she had leaped over the intermediate steps  she had just sufficient comprehension of the subject for unlimited confidence that the achievement was practicable without having knowledge enough to understand a tithe of the difficulties though she did see that they could hardly be surmounted by a woman unassisted   however she might see her way by the time her studies were completed and in the meantime her mother might keep the shell while she had the essence  however to find the shell thus left on her hands was no slight perplexity  should she as eldest daughter left in charge demand the desk barbara would produce her reasons for its abstraction and for this janet was not prepared  unless something else was wanted from it so as to put babie in the wrong janet saw no alternative but to secure the book in her own bureau and watch for a chance of smuggling it back  thus babie escaped all interrogation but she did not release the captive davenport and indeed she soon forgot all about it in her absorption in swiss letters     chapter xxiii  the lost treasure    but solemn sound or sober thought   the fairies cannot bear they sing inspired with love and joy   like skylarks in the air of solid sense or thought thats grave   you find no traces there                           young tamlane   when old lady fordhams long decay ended in death mrs evelyn would not recall her sons to the funeral but meant to go out herself to join them and offered to escort mrs brownlows daughters to the meetingplace  this was to be engelberg for dr medlicott had decided that after the month at leukerbad all his patients would be much the better for a breath of the pinewoods on the alpine height and undertook to see them conveyed thither in time to meet the ladies  this proposal set miss ogilvie free to join her brother who had a curacy in a seaside place where the season began just when the london season ended  her holiday was then to begin and janet was to write to mrs evelyn and declare herself ready to meet her in london at the time appointed  the arrangement was not to janets taste  she thought herself perfectly capable of escorting the younger ones especially as they were to take their maid a capable person named delrio daughter of an englishwoman and a german waiter and widow of an italian courier who was equal to all land emergencies and could speak any language she belonged to the young ladies  their mother not liking strangers about her had on old nurses death caused emma to learn enough of the ladys maids art for her own needs at home and took care of herself abroad  babie was enraptured to be going to mother carey and armine and elvira was enchanted to leave the schoolroom behind her being fully aware that she always had more notice and indulgence from outsiders than at home or indeed from anyone who had been disappointed at her want of all real affection  you are just like a dragon fly said babie to her all brightness outside and nothing within  this unusually severe remark came from babies indignation at elviras rebellion against going to river hollow to take leave  it would be a melancholy visit for her grandfather had become nearly imbecile since he had had a paralytic stroke in the course of the winter and good sensible mrs gould had died of fever in the previous autumn  elvira who had never liked the place now loathed it and did not seem capable of understanding babies outburst  not like to go and see them when they are ill and unhappy  elfie how can you  of course i dont  grandpapa kisses me and makes me half sick  but he is so fond of you  i wish he wasnt then  why babie are you going to cry  whats the matter  it is very silly said babie winking hard to get rid of her tears but it does hurt me so to think of the good old gentleman caring more for you than anybody and you not liking to go near him  i cant see what it matters to you said elvira i wish you would go instead of me if you are so fond of him  he wouldnt care for me said babie im not his ain lassie  his lassie  im a lady exclaimed the senorita with the haughty spanish turn of the neck peculiar to herself  thats not what i mean by a lady said babie  what do you mean by it said elvira with a superior air  one who never looks down on anybody said babie thoughtfully  what nonsense rejoined the elf as if any lady could like to hear grandpapa maunder and mary scold and scream at the farm people just like the old peahen  miss ogilvie said poor mary was overstrained with having more to attend to than she could properly manage and that made her shrill  i know it makes her very disagreeable and so they all are  i hate the place and i dont see why i should go grumbled elvira  you will when you are older and know what proper feeling is said miss ogilvie who had come within earshot of the last words  go and put on your hat i have ordered the pony carriage  shall i go miss ogilvie asked babie as elfie marched off sullenly since her governess never allowed herself to be disobeyed  i think i had better go my dear elfie may be under more restraint with me  please give old mr gould and mary and kate my love and i will run and ask for some fruit for you to take to them said babie her tender heart longing to make compensation  miss ogilvie and her pouting companion were received by a fashionable—nay extra fashionablelooking person whom mary and kate gould called cousin lisette and the old farmer eliza gould while the old man in his chair in the sun in the hot little parlour caressed and asked feeble repetitions of questions of his impatient granddaughter the lady explained that she had thrown up an excellent situation as instructress in a very high family to act in the same capacity to her motherless little cousins  she professed to be enchanted to meet miss ogilvie and almost patronised  i know what the life is miss ogilvie and how one needs companionship to keep up ones spirits  whenever you are left alone and would drop me a line i should be quite delighted to come and enliven you or whenever you would like to come over here theres no interruption by uncle and he poor old gentleman is quite—quite passe  the children i can always dismiss  regularity is my motto of course but i consider that an exception in favour of my own friends does no harm and indeed it is no more than i have a right to expect considering the sacrifices that i have made for them  mary child dont cross your ankles you dont see your cousin do that kate you go and see what makes betsy so long in bringing the tea i rang long ago  i will go and fetch it said mary an honest but harassedlooking girl  always in haste said miss gould with an effort at good humour which miss ogilvie direfully mistrusted  no mary you must remain to entertain your cousin  what are servants for but to wait on us she thinks nothing can be done without her miss ogilvie and i am forced to act repression sometimes  indeed we do not wish for any tea said miss ogilvie seeing elvira look as black as thunder we have only just dined  but elfie will have some sweetcake elfie likes aunties sweet cake eh said the old man  no thank you said elfie glumly though in fact she did care considerably for sweets and was always buying bonbons  no cake  or some strawberries—strawberries and cream said her grandfather  mr allen always liked them  and where is mr allen now my dear  gone to norway  its the fifth time ive told him so muttered elvira  and where is mr robert  and mr lucas he went on  fine young gentlemen all of them but mr allen is the pleasantspoken one aint he coming down soon  he always looks in and says i dont forget your good cider mr gould and there was a feeble chuckling laugh and old mans cough  do let me go into the garden im quite faint cried elvira jumping up  it was true that the room was very close rather medicinal and not improved by miss goulds perfumes but there was an alacrity about elfies movements and a vehemence in the manner of her rejection of the said essences which made her governess not think her case alarming and she left her to the care of the young cousins while trying to make up for her incivility by courteously listening to and answering her grandfather and consuming the tea and sweetcake  when she went out to fetch her pupil to say goodbye miss gould detained her on the way to obtain condolence on the dreadful trial that old uncle was and speak of her own great devotion to him and the children and the sacrifices she had made  she said she had been at school with elviras poor mamma a sweetly pretty girl poor dear but so indulged  and then she tried to extract confidences as to mrs brownlows intentions towards the child in which of course she was baffled  elvira was found ranging among the strawberries with mary and kate looking on somewhat dissatisfied  both the poor girls looked constrained and unhappy and miss ogilvie wondered whether cousin lisettes evident intentions of becoming a fixture would be for their good or the reverse  are you better my dear asked she affectionately  yes it was only the room said elvira  you are a good deal there are not you said miss ogilvie to mary who had the white flabby look of being kept in an unwholesome atmosphere  yes said mary wistfully but grandpapa does not like having me half so much as elvira  he is always talking about her  you had better come back to him now elfie said miss ogilvie  it makes me ill said elvira with her crossest look  her governess laid her hand on her shoulder and told her in a few decided words in the lowest possible voice that she was not going away till she had taken a properly respectful and affectionate leave of her grandfather  whereupon she knew further resistance was of no use and going hastily to the door of the room called out—  goodbye then grandpapa  ah my little beauty are you there he asked in a tone of bewildered pleasure holding out the one hand he could use  elvira was forced to let herself be held by it  she hoped to kiss his brow and escape but the poor knotted fingers which had once been so strong would not let her go and she had to endure many more kisses and caresses and blessings than her proud thoughtless nature could endure before she made her escape  and then cousin lisette insisted on a kiss for the sake of her dear mamma and elfie could only exhale her exasperation by rushing to the ponycarriage avoiding all kisses to her young cousins taking the driving seat and whipping up the ponies more than their tenderhearted mistress would by any means have approved  miss ogilvie abstained from either blame or argument knowing that it would only make her worse and recollecting the old undine theory wondered whether the elf would ever find her soul and think with tender regret of the affection she was spurning  the next day the travellers started sleeping a couple of nights in hyde corner for convenience of purchases and preparations  they were to meet mrs evelyn at the station but janet who foretold that she would be another serene highness soured by having missed the family title retarded their start till so late that there could be no introduction on the platform but seats had to be rushed for while a servant took the tickets  however a tall elderly militarylooking gentleman with a great white moustache was standing by the open door of a carriage  miss brownlow said he handing them in—babie first next janet and then elvira  he then bowed to miss ogilvie took his seat handed in the appurtenances received showed and pocketed the tickets negotiated janets purchase of newspapers and constituted himself altogether cavalier to the party  sir james evelyn  janet had no turn for soldiers and was not gratified but elvira saw that her blue eyes and golden hair were producing the effect she knew how to trace so she was graciously pleased to accept punch and to smile a bewitching acceptance of the seat assigned to her opposite to the old general  barbara was opposite to mrs evelyn and next to sydney a girl a few months older than herself but considerably taller and larger mother and daughter were a good deal alike save that the girl was fresh plump and rosy and the mother worn with the red colouring burnt as it were into her thin cheeks  yet both looked as if smiles were no strangers to their lips though there were lines of anxiety and sorrow traced round mrs evelyns temples  their voices were sweet and full and the elder lady spoke with a tender intonation that inspired babie with trustful content and affection but caused janet to pass a mental verdict of sugared milk and water  she immersed herself in her pall mall and left babie to exchange scraps of intelligence from the brothers letters and compare notes on the journey  byandby mrs evelyn retired into her book and the two little girls put their heads together over a newlyarrived acrostic calling on elfie to assist them  do you like acrostics she said peeping up through her long eyelashes at the old general  oh dont tease uncle james hastily interposed sydney as yet inexperienced in the difference between the importunities of a merely nicelooking niece and the blandishments of a brilliant stranger sir james said kindly—  what my dear  and when elvira replied—  do help us to guess this  what does man love most below he put on a droll face and answered—  his pipe  o uncle james thats too bad cried sydney  if jock had made this acrostic it might be pipe said babie but this is armines  it was thereupon handed to the elders who read in a boyish hand writing—             twins parted from their rocky nest             we run our wondrous race           and now in tumult now at rest             flash back heavens radiant face         1 while both alike this name we bear             and both like life we flow        2 and near us nestle sweet and fair             what man most loves below            alike it is our boasted claim             to nurse the precious juice        3 that maddened erst the theban dame             with streaming tresses loose         4 the evening land is sought by one             one rushes towards midday           one to a vigil song has run             one heard red freedoms lay            tall castles glorious battlefields             graced this in ages past           but now its mighty power that yields        5   to work my busy last   is that your brother armines own asked sir james surprised  o yes said janet with impressive carelessness all my brothers have a facility in stringing rhymes  not bobus said elvira  he does not think it worth while said janet again absorbing herself in her paper while the public united in guessing the acrostic and the only objection was raised by the exact general who would not allow that the marseillaise was sung at the mouth of the rhone and defended inos sobriety  barbara and sydney lived upon those acrostics in their travelling bags till they reached folkestone and had grown intimate over them sir james looked after the luggage putting gently aside janets strongminded attempt to watch over it and she only retained her own leathern travelling case where she carried her personals and which heavy as it was she never let out of her immediate charge  they all sat on deck for there was a fine smooth summer sea and no one was deranged except the two maids whom every one knew to be always disabled on a voyage  janet had not long been seated and was only just getting immersed in her contemporary when she received a greeting which gratified her it was from somewhat of a lion the author of some startling poems and more startling essays much admired by bobus who had brought him to some evening parties of his mothers not much to her delectation since there were ugly stories as to his private character  these were ascribed by bobus to pious malevolence and janet had accepted the explanation and cultivated a bowing acquaintance  hyde corner was too agreeable a haunt to be despised and janet owed her social successes more to her mothers attractions than her own conversation began by an inquiry after her brothers whose adventures had figured in the papers and it went on to janets own journey and prospects  her companion was able to tell her much that she wanted to know about the university of zurich and its facilities for female study  he was a wellknown advocate of womans rights and she scrupled not to tell him that she was inquiring on her own account many men would have been bored and have only sought to free themselves from this learned lady but the present lion was of the species that prefer roaring to an intelligent female audience without the rough male argumentative interruption and janet thus made the voyage with the utmost satisfaction to herself  mrs evelyn asked babie who her sisters friend was  the answer was do you know elfie  you know so many more gentlemen than i do  no replied elvira i dont  he looks like the stupid sort of man  what is the stupid sort of man asked the general as she intended  oh that talks to janet  is everyone that talks to janet stupid  of course said elvira  they only go on about stupid things no better than lessons  sir james laughed at her arch look and shook his head at her but then made a tour among the other passengers leaving her pouting a little at his desertion  on his return he sat down by his sister inlaw and mentioned a name which made her start and glance an inquiry whether she heard aright  then as he bent his head in affirmation she asked is there anything to be done  it is only for the crossing and she is quite old enough to take care of herself  and it is evidently an established acquaintance for which i am not responsible murmured mrs evelyn to herself  she was in perplexity about these friends of her sons  ever since cecil had been at eton his beloved brownlow had seemed to be his evil genius whose influence none of his resolutions or promises could for a moment withstand  if she had acted on her own judgment cecil would never have returned to eton but his uncle disapproved of his removal especially with the disgrace of the champagne supper unretrieved and his penitent letter had moved her greatly  trusting much to her elder son and to dr medlicott she had permitted the party to continue together feeling that it might be life or death to that other fatherless boy in whom duke was so much interested and now she was going out to judge for herself and sir james had undertaken to escort her that they might together come to a decision whether the two friends were likely to be doing one another good or harm  mrs evelyn had lived chiefly in the country since her husbands death and knew nothing of mrs joseph brownlow  so she looked with anxiety for indications of the tone of the family who had captivated not only cecil but fordham and seemed in a fair way of doing the same by sydney  the two hats brown and black were almost locked together all the voyage and indeed the feather of one once became entangled with the crape of the other so that they had to be extricated from above  there was perhaps a little maternal anxiety at this absorption but as sydney was sure to pour out everything at night her mother could let things take their course and watch her delight in expanding after being long shut up in a melancholy house without young companions  elvira had a tone of arch simplicity which in such a pretty creature was most engaging and she was in high spirits with the pleasure of being with new people away from her schoolroom and from england neither of which she loved so she chattered amiably and amusingly entertained mrs evelyn and fascinated sir james  janet and her companion were less complacently regarded  certainly the girl though less ancientlooking at twentyone than at fourteen had the air of one well used to independence so that she was no great subject for responsibility but she gave no favourable impression and was at no pains to do so  when she rejoined the party mrs evelyn asked whether she had known that gentleman long  he is a friend of my brother robert she answered  shall i introduce you  mrs evelyn declined in a quiet civil tone that provoked a mental denunciation of her as straitlaced and uncharitable and as soon as the gentleman returned to the neighbourhood janet again sought his company let him escort her ashore and only came back to the others in the refreshmentroom whither she brought a copy of a german periodical which he had lent her  with much satisfaction mrs evelyn filled the railway carriage with her own party so that there was no room for any addition to their number  nor indeed did they see any more of their unwelcome fellowtraveller since he was bound for the hotel du louvre and to janets undisguised chagrin rooms were already engaged at the hotel castiglione  they came too late for the table dhote and partook of an extemporised meal in their sittingroom immediately on their arrival as the start was to be early  then it was that janet missed her bag her precious bag  delrio was sent all over the house to make inquiries whether it had been taken to any other persons room but in vain  mrs evelyn said she had last seen it when they took their seats on board the steamer  yes added elvira you left it there when you went to walk up and down with that gentleman  then why did not you take care of it  i dont mean elfie—nobody expects her to be of any use but you babie  you never told me gasped babie aghast  you ought to have seen but you never think of anything but your own chatter  it is a very inconvenient loss said mrs evelyn kindly  have you sent to the station  i shall as soon as i am satisfied that it is not here  i can send out for the things i want for use but there are books and papers of importance and my keys  the key of mothers davenport cried babie  was it there o janet janet  you should have attended to it then said janet sharply  delrio knocked at the door with an account of her unsuccessful mission and sir james little as the young lady deserved it concerned himself about sending to the station and if the bag were not forthcoming there telegraphing to boulogne the first thing in the morning  while janet was writing particulars and volubly instructing the commissionaire mrs evelyn saw babies eyes full of tears and her throat swelling with suppressed sobs  she held out an arm and drew the child to her saying kindly i am sure you would have taken care of the bag if you had been asked my dear  its not that thank you said babie laying her head on the kind shoulder for i dont think it was my fault but mother will be so sorry for her key  it is the key of her davenport and fathers picture is there and grandmammas and the card with all our hairs and she will be so sorry  and babie cried the natural tears of a tired child whom anything would overcome after her long absence from her mother  mrs evelyn saw how it was and as delrio was entirely occupied with the hue and cry she herself took the little girl away and helped her to bed tenderly soothing and comforting her and finding her various needments  among them were her little books but they could not be found and her eyes looked much too tired to use them especially as the loss again brought the ready moisture  my head feels so funny i cant think of anything she said  shall i do as i used when sydney was little and mrs evelyn knelt down with her and said one or two short prayers  babie murmured her thanks nestled up to her and kissed her but added imploringly my psalm  armie and i always say our psalm at bedtime and think of each other  he did it out on the moraine  will it do if you lie down and i say it to you  there was another fond grateful nestling kiss and some of the psalms were gone through in the soft full cadences of a voice that had gained unconscious pathos by having many times used them as a trustful lullaby to a weary sufferer  if babie heard the end it was in the sweetness of sleep and when mrs evelyn left her it was with far less judicial desire to inquire into the subject of that endless conversation which had lasted with slight intermission from london to paris  she was not long left in ignorance for no sooner had sydney been assured that nothing ailed barbara but fatigue than she burst out mamma she is the nicest girl i ever saw  do you like her better than elvira  of course i do most emphatically  mamma she loves sir kenneth of the leopard as much as i do  mrs evelyn was satisfied  while sir kenneth of the leopard remained the object of the young ladies passion there was not much fear of any nonsense that was not innocent and happy  no news of the bag  janet was disposed to go back herself or send delrio but sir james declared this impossible nor would the evelyns consent to disturb the plan of the journey and disappoint those who expected them at engelberg on saturday by waiting at paris for tidings  janet in vain told herself that she was not under their control and tried to remain behind by herself with her maid  they had a quiet highbred decisive way of taking things for granted and arranging for her and she found herself unable to resist but whenever in after times she was unpleasantly reminded of her loss she always charged it upon them  otherwise the journey was prosperous  elfie was on the terms of a saucy pet with the general and babies bright gentle courtesy and unselfishness won mrs evelyns heart while she and sydney were as inseparable as ever  in fact sydney had been made free of jotapata  that celebrated romance had been going on all these years with the elision of several generations because though few members of the family were allowed to see their twentyfifth year it was impossible to squeeze them all into the crusading times and besides the reigning favourites must be treated to an adventure with coeur de lion  even thus abridged it bade fair to last throughout the journey both the little maidens being sufficiently experienced travellers to care little for the sights from the french railway and being only stimulated to talk and listen the more eagerly when interrupted by such trifles as meals companions and calls to look at objects far less interesting  look my dears we are coming to the mountains  there is the first snowy head  yes mamma but the hats were together again in the corner  come sydney dont lose this wonderful winding valley  i see uncle james  beautiful popping back instantly with go on babie dear  how did sir gilbert get them out of that horrid defile full of turks  it is true you said  true that louis vii and queen eleanor got into that dreadful mess armine found it in sismondi but nobody knew who sir gilbert was except ourselves and we are quite sure he was sir gilbert of the ermine the son of the brother who thought it his duty to stay at home  sir philibert  oh yes  i know  there are some verses about the iconium pass written out in our spotted book but i can say some of them  oh do            the rock is steep the gorge is deep               mount joye st denys             but king louis bold his way doth hold               mount joye st denys              ho ho the ravine is narrow i ween               lah billah el billah hurrah             the hills near and far the franks way do bar               lah billah el billah hurrah   it ought to be allah el allah but you know that really does mean a holy name and armine thought we ought not to have it  it was delightful making the ballad for all the christian verses have mount joye st denys in the different lines and all the turkish ones lah billah till sir gilbert comes in and then his warcry goes instead—             on on ye franks hew down their ranks               up merry men for the ermine             for christian right gainst pagan might               up merry men for the ermine   but one day jock got hold of it and wrote a parody on it  oh what a shame  werent you very angry  it was so funny one could not help laughing             come on old turk youll find hot work—               pop goes the weasel             they cut and run my eyes what fun               pop goes the weasel   how could you bear it  i wont hear a bit more  it is dreadful  miss ogilvie says if one likes a thing very much parodies dont hurt ones love said babie  but what did sir gilbert do  he rode up to where louis was standing with his back against a rock and dismounted saying my liege—  i thought he was an englishman  oh but you always called a king my liege whoever you were  my liege he said—  look at that charming little church tower  i see thank you  i see uncle james  no thank you i dont want to look out any more  i saw it  well babie my liege—  never mind james said mrs evelyn one cant be more than in elysium  there were fewer conveniences for the siege on the last day of the journey when railroads were no more but something could be done on board the steamer in spite of importunities from those who thought it a duty to look at the shores of the lake of lucerne and when arrival became imminent happy anticipation inclined barbara to a blissful silence  mrs evelyn saw her great hazel eyes shining like stars and began to prefer the transparent mask of that ardent little soul to the external beauty which made elvira a continual study for an artist     chapter xxiv  the angel mountain    to your eager prayer the voice makes awful answer come to me once for all now seal your choice with christ to tread the boisterous sea                                     keble   the leukerbad section of the party had only three days start of the others for jock was not released till after a whole months course of the baths and armines state fluctuated so much that the journey would not have been sooner possible  it had been a trying time  while dr medlicott thought he could not rouse mrs brownlow to the sense of the little fellows precarious condition deadly alarm lay couched in the bottom of her heart only kept at bay by defiantly cheerful plans and sanguine talk  then jock was depressed and at his age and alas at many others being depressed means being cross and very cross he was to his mother and his friend and occasionally to his brother who in some moods seemed to him merely a rival invalid and candidate for attention and whom he now and then threatened with becoming as frightful a muff as fordham  he missed johnny too and perhaps longed after eton  he was more savage to cecil than to any one else treating his best attentions with growls railings and occasionally showers of slippers books and cushions but strange as it sounds the friendship only seemed cemented by this treatment and this devoted slave evidently preferred being abused by jock to being made much of by any one else  the regimen was very disagreeable to his english habits and the tedium of the place was great  his mother thought it quite enough to account for his captiousness and the doctor said it was recovery but no one guessed how much was due to the good resolutions he had made on the moraine and ratified with cecil  to no one else had he spoken but all the more for his reserve did he feel himself bound by the sense of the shame and dishonour of falling back from vows made in the time of danger  no one else was aware of it but john lucas brownlow was not of a character to treat a promise or a resolution lightly  if he could have got out of his head the continual echo of the two lines about the monastic intentions of a certain personage when sick he would have been infinitely better tempered  for to poor jock steadiness appeared renunciation of all jest and youthful jollity and religion seemed tedious endurance of what might be important but like everything important was to him very wearisome and uninteresting  to him all zest and pleasure in life seemed extinguished and he would have preferred leaving eton where he must change his habits and amaze his associates  indeed he was between hoping and fearing that all this would there seem folly  but then he would break his word the one thing that poor halfheathen jock truly cared about  meantime he was keeping it as best he knew how under the circumstances by minding his prayers more than he had ever done before trying to attend when part of the service was read on sundays and endeavouring to follow the evelyn sabbatical code but only succeeding in making himself more dreary and savage on sunday than on any other day  by easy journeys they arrived at engelberg early on a friday afternoon and found pleasant rooms in the large hotel looking out in front on the grand old monastery once the lord of half the canton and in the rear upon pinewoods leading up to a snowcrowned summit  the delicious scent seemed to bring invigoration in at the windows  however jock and armine were both tired enough to be sent to bed if not to sleep immediately after the—as yet scantily filled table dhote  the former was lying dreamily listening to the evening bells of the monastery when cecil came in looking diffident and hesitating  i say jock he began did you see that old clergyman at the table dhote  was there one  yes and there is to be a celebration on sunday  o  then armine can have his wish  fordham has been getting the old cleric to talk to your mother about it  armine was unconfirmed  the other two had been confirmed just before easter but on the great sunday jock had followed his brother roberts example and turned away  he had recollected the omission on that terrible night and when after a pause cecil said do you mean to stay he answered rather snappishly i suppose so  i fancied said cecil with wistful hesitation that if we were together it would be a kind of seal to  jock actually forced back the words dont humbug which were not his own but his illtempers and managed to reply—  well what  being brothers in arms replied cecil with shy earnestness that touched the better part of jock and he made a sound of full assent letting cecil who had a turn for sentiment squeeze his hand  he lay with a thoughtful eye trying to recall some of the good seed his tutor had tried to sow on a muchtrodden wayside very ready for the birds of the air  the outcome was—  i say evelyn have you any book of preparation  mine is—i dont know where  neither his mother nor reeves nor to do him justice cecil himself would have made such an omission in his packing and he was heartily glad to fetch his manual feeling jocks reformation his own security in the ways which he really preferred  poor jock who whatever he was was real in all his ways and could not lead a double life as his friend too often did read and tried to fulfil the injunctions of the book but only became more confused and unhappy than ever  yet still he held on in a blind sort of way to his resolution  he had undertaken to be good he meant therefore to communicate and he believed he repented and would lead a new life—if—if he could bear it  his next confidence was—  i say cecil can you get me some writing things  we—at least i— ought to write and tell my tutor that i am sorry about that supper  well he was rather a beast  i think said jock who had the most capacity for seeing things from other peoples point of view we did enough to put him in a wax  it was more through me than any one else and i shall write at once and get it off my mind before tomorrow  very well  if youll write ill sign said cecil  mother said i ought when i saw her in london but she didnt order me  she said she left it to my proper feeling  and you hadnt any  i was going to stick by you said cecil rather sulkily on which jock rewarded him with something sounding like—  what a donkey you can be  however with many writhings and gruntings the letter was indited and jock was as much wearied out as if he had taken a long walk so that his mother feared that engelberg was going to disagree with him he had not energy enough to go out in the evening of saturday to meet the new arrivals but stayed with armine who was in a state of restless joy and excitement marvelling at him and provoking him by this surprise as if it were censure  with his forehead against the window armine watched and did his utmost to repress the eagerness that seemed to irritate his brother and at last gave vent to an irrepressible hurrah  there they are  cecil has got his sister  oh and there she is babie—holding on to mother and that must be mrs evelyn with fordham—and theres elf making up already to the doctor  arent you coming down jock  not i  i dont want to see you make a fool of yourself before everybody—i say—youll have to come up stairs again you know shut the door i say—shouted jock as he found armine deaf to all his expostulations and then getting up he banged it himself and then shuffling back to the sofa put his hands over his face and exclaimed there  what an eternal brute i am  a few moments more and the door was open again and cecil with his arm round his sister thrust her forwards exclaiming—here he is syd  jock had recovered his gentlemanly manners enough to shake hands courteously as well as to receive and return babies kiss when she and armine staggered in together reeling under their weight of delight  janet kissed him too and then scanning both brothers observed to her mother—  i think lucas is the more altered of the two  in which sentiment elvira seemed to agree for she put her hands behind her and exclaimed—  o jock you do look such a fright i never knew how like janet you were  you are letting every one know what a spiteful little elf you can be returned janet indignantly  cant you give poor jock a kinder greeting  whereupon the elf put on a cunning look of innocence and said—  i didnt know it was unkind to say he was like you janet  the evelyn pair had gone—after this introduction of jock and sydney —to their own sittingroom which opened out of that of the brownlows and the door was soon unclosed for the two families meant to make up only one party  the two mothers seemed as if they had been friends of old standing and mrs evelyn was looking with delighted wonder at her eldest son who had gained much in flesh and in vigour ever since dr medlicotts last and most successful prescription of a more pressing subject of interest than his own cough  she had an influence about her that repressed all discords in her presence and the evening was a cheerful and happy one leaving a soothing sense upon all  then came the awakening to the sounds of the monastery bells and in due time the small english congregation assembled and one at least was trying to force an attention that had freely wandered ever before  the preacher was the chance visitor an elderly clergyman with silvery hair  he spoke extempore from job xxviii             where shall wisdom be found           and where is the place of understanding           man knoweth not the price thereof           neither is it found in the land of the living           the depth saith it is not in me           and the sea saith it is not with me           it cannot be gotten for gold           neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof   what he said was unlike any sermon the young people had heard before it began with a description of the alchemists labours seeking for ever for the one great arcanum falling by the way upon numerous precious discoveries yet never finding the one secret which would have rendered all common things capable of being made of priceless value  he drew this quest into a parable of mans search for the one great good the wisdom that is the one thing necessary to give weight worth and value to the life which without it is vanity of vanities  many a choice gift of thought of science of philosophy of beauty of poetry has been brought to light in its time by the seekers but in vain  all rang empty hollow and heartless like sounding brass or tinkling cymbal till the secret should be won and it is no unattainable secret  it is the love of christ that truly turneth all things into fine gold  one who has attained that love has the true transmuting and transforming power of making life golden golden in brightness in purity in value so as to be a present for a mighty king  then followed a description of the glory and worth of the true noble faithful manhood of a happy warrior ever going forward and carrying through achievements for the love of the great captain each in turn the protector of the weak the redresser of wrong the patriot the warrior the scholar the philosopher the parent the wife the sister or the child the healthful or the sick whoever has that one constraining secret the love of christ has his service even here whether active or passive veritably golden the fruit unto holiness the end everlasting life  perhaps it was the cluster of young faces that led the preacher thus to speak and as he went on he must have met the earnest and responsive eyes that are sure to animate a speaker and the power and beauty of his words struck every one  to the evelyns it was a new and beautiful allegory on a familiar idea  janet was divided between discomfort at allusions reminding her of her secret and on criticisms of the description of alchemy  her mothers heart beat as if she were hearing an echo of her husbands thoughts about his magnum bonum   little armine was thrilled as in the awe of drawing near to his first communion this golden thread of life was put into his hand  but it was jock to whom that discourse came like a beam of light into a dark place  when upon the dreary vista of dull abnegation on which he had been dwelling for a month past came this vision of the beauty activity victory and glory of true manhood as something attainable his whole soul swelled and expanded with joyful enthusiasm  the future that he had embraced as lead had become changed to gold  thus the whole ensuing service was to him a continuation of that blessed hopeful dedication of himself and all his powers  it was as if from being a monk he had become a red cross knight of the hospital  yet after his soiled spoiled reckless boyhood how could that grand manhood be attained  later in the afternoon when the denizens of the hotel had gone their several ways some to look and listen at benediction in the convent church some to climb through the pinewoods to the alp some to saunter and rest among the nearer trees the clergyman with his greek testament in his hand was sitting on a seat under one of the trees enjoying the calm of one of his few restful sundays when he heard a movement and beheld the pale thin lad who still walked so lame who had been so silent at the table dhote and whose dark eyes had looked up with such intensity of interest that he had more than once spoken to them  you are tired said the clergyman kindly making room for him  thanks said the boy mechanically moving forward but then pausing as he leant on his stick and his eyes suddenly dimmed with tears as he said oh sir if you would only tell me how to begin—  begin what said the old man holding out his hand  to turn it to gold said jock  can i after being the mad fool ive been  they talked for more than an hour even till dr medlicott coming down from the alp laid his hand on jocks shoulder and told him the evening chill was coming and he must sit still no longer  and when the boy looked up the restless weary distress of his face was gone  jock never saw that old clergyman again nor heard of him unless it were his death that he read of in the paper six months later  but he never heard the name of engelberg without an echo of the parting benediction and feeling that to him it had indeed been an angel mountain  this had been a happy day to several others  cecil after ten minutes with his mother which filled her with hope and thankfulness had gone to show his sister the charms of the place and armine and babie on a sheltered seat were free to pour out their hearts to one another ranging from the heights of pure childish wisdom to its depths of blissful ignorance and playful folly as they talked over the past and the future  armine knew there was no chance of an immediate and entire recovery for him and this was a severe stroke to babie who was quite unprepared  and as her face began to draw up with tears near the surface he hugged her close and consolingly whispered that now they would be together always he should not have to go away from his own dear babie bunting and there was a little kissing match ending by babie saying disconsolately but you did like eton so and you were going to get the newcastle and the prince consorts prize and to be in the eleven and all—and you were so sure of a high remove  oh dear and she let her head drop on his shoulder and was almost crying again  dont dont babie or youll make me as bad again said armine it does come over me now and then and i wish i had never known what it was to be strong and jolly and to expect to do all sorts of things  i shall always be wishing it said babie  no you are not to cry  you would be more sorry if i was dead and not here at all babie and you have got to thank god for that  i do—i have  ive done it ever since we got johnnys dreadful letter  oh yes armine ill try not to mind for perhaps if we arent thankful i maynt keep you at all said poor babie with her arms round her treasure  but are you quite sure armine  couldnt dr lucas get you quite well  you see this dr medlicott is very young added the small maiden sapiently  young doctors are all the go  dr lucas said so when mother wrote to ask if she had better bring me home for advice said armine he knows all about dr medlicott and said he was firstrate and theyve been writing to each other about me  the doctor stethoscoped me all over and then he did a map of my lungs cecil said to send in his letter  oh gasped babie didnt it frighten you  i wanted to know for i saw mother was in a way  she did talk and whisk about so fast and made such a fuss that i thought i must be much worse than i knew  so i told dr medlicott i wished he would tell me right out if i was going to die in time to see you and then i shouldnt mind  so he said not now and he thought i should get over it in the end but that most likely i should have a long time years perhaps of being very careful  and when i asked if i should be able to go back to eton he said he hardly expected it and that he believed it was kinder to let me know at once than let me be straining and hoping on  was it said babie  i thought not said armine when i shut my eyes and the playing fields and the trees and the river stood up before me  i thought if i could have hoped ever so little it would have been nice  and then to think of never being able to run or row or stay out late and always to be bothering about ones stockings and wraps and making a miserable muff of oneself just to keep in a bit of uncomfortable life and being a nuisance to everybody  babie fairly shrieked and sobbed her protest that he could never be a nuisance to her or mother  you are babie and mother is mother i know that but it did seem such a long burthen and bore and when—oh babie—dont you know—  how we always thought you would go on and be something great and do something great like bishop selwyn or like that mr denison that miss ogilvie has a book about said babie  but you will get well and do it when you are a man armie  didnt you think about it when you heard all about the golden life in the sermon today  i thought thats going to be armies life and i looked at you but you were looking down  were you thinking how it was all spoilt armie poor dear armie  for perhaps it isnt  no i know nobody can spoil it but myself said armine  and you know he said that one might make weakliness and sickness just as golden by that great love as being up and doing  i was going to tell you babie i was horridly wretched and dismal one day at leukerbad when i thought mother and all were out of the way—gone out driving i believe—and then fordham came in  he had stayed in i do believe on purpose  but but said babie not so much impressed as her brother wished isnt he rather a spoon  johnny said he ought to have been a girl  i didnt think johnny was such a stupid said armine i only know he has been no end of a comfort to me though he says he only wants to hinder me from getting like him  dont then said babie though i dont understand  i thought you were so fond of him  so must you be said armine i never got on with anybody so well he knows just how it is  he says if god gives one such a life he will help one to find out the way to make the best of it for oneself and other people and to bear to see other people doing what one cant and we are to help one another  oh babie you must like fordham  i must if you do said babie  but he is awfully old for a friend for you armie  he is nineteen said armine but people get more and more of the same age as they grow older  and he likes all our books and more too babie  he had such a delicious book of french letters that he lent me with things in them that were just what i wanted  if we are to be abroad all the winter he will get his mother to go wherever we do  suppose we went to the holy land babie  oh then we could find jotapata  oh no she added humbly i promised miss ogilvie not to talk of jotapata on a sunday  and going to the holy land only to look for it would be much the same thing said armine  besides i expect it is up among the druses where one cant go  armie in the tone of a great confession ive told sydney all about it  have you told lord fordham  no said armine who was less exclusively devoted to the great romance  i wonder whether he would read it  ive brought it  nineteen copybooks and a dozen blank ones though it was so hard to make delrio pack them up  hurrah for the new ones  we did so want some for the travellers joy the paper at leukerbad was so bad  you should hear the verses the doctor wrote on the mud baths  they are as stunning as fly leaves  mr editor i say as lord fordhams tall figure strode towards them she has brought out a dozen clean copybooks  isnt that a joy for the joy  had you no other intentions for them said fordham detecting something of disappointment in babies face  you surely were not going to write exercises in them  oh no said babie only—  she cant mention it on sunday said armine a little wickedly its a wonderful long story about the crusaders  and explained babie our governess said we—that is i—thought of nothing else and made the lessons at church and everything else apply to it so she made me resolve to say nothing about it on sunday  and she has brought out nineteen copybooks full of it added armine  yes said babie but the little speckled ones are very small and have half the leaves torn out and we used to write larger when we began  i think she added with the humility of an aspirant contributor towards the editor of a popular magazine if lord fordham would be so kind as to look at it armie thought it might do what people call i believe supplying the serial element of fiction and i should be happy to copy it out for each number if i write well enough  the word happy was so genuine and the speech so comical that the editor had much ado to keep his countenance as he gave considerable hopes that the serial element should be thus supplied in the ms magazine  meantime the two mothers were walking about and resting together keeping their young people in some degree in view and discussing at first the subject most on their minds their sons bodily health and the past danger for which caroline found a deeply sympathetic listener and one who took a hopeful view of armine  mrs evelyn was indeed naturally disposed to augur well whenever the complaint was not hereditary and she was besides in excellent spirits at the very visible progress of both her sons the one in physical the other in moral health and she could not but attribute both to the companionship that she had been so anxious to prevent she had never seen duke look so well nor seem so free from languor and indifference since he was a mere child and all seemed due to his devotion to armine while as to cecil he seemed to have a new spring of improvement which he ascribed altogether to his friend  it is strange to me to hear this of my poor jock said caroline always my pickle and scapegrace though he is a dear goodhearted boy  his uncle says it is that he wants a strong hand but dont you think an uncles strong hand is much worse than any mothers weakness  not than her weakness said mrs evelyn  it is her love i think that you mean  there are some boys with whom strong hands are vain but who will guide themselves for love and that we mothers are surely the ones to infuse  my boys are affectionate enough dear fellows said caroline proudly forgetting her sore disappointment that neither allen nor robert had chosen to come to her help  i did not only mean love of oneself said mrs evelyn gently i was thinking of the fine gold we heard of this morning  when our boys once have found that secret the chief of our work is done  ah and i never understood how to give them that said caroline we have been all astray ever since their father left us  do you know said mrs evelyn with a certain sweet shyness i cant help thinking that your dear lucas found that gold among the stones of the moraine and will help my poor weak cecil to keep a fast hold of it  mrs evelyns opinion was confirmed when a few days later came the answer to jocks letter to his tutor pleasing and touching both friends so much that each showed it to his mother  another important piece of intelligence came in a letter from john to his cousin namely that the present captain of the house with two or three more fellows were leaving eton at the midsummer holidays and that his tutor had been talking to him about becoming captain  jock and cecil greatly rejoiced for the departing captain had been a youth whose incapacity for government had been much better known to his subordinates than to his master and the other two had been the special tempters and evil geniuses of the house those who above all had set themselves to make obedience and religion seem contemptible and vice daring and manly  i should have hated the notion of being captain wrote john if those impracticable fellows had stayed on and if i did not feel sure of you and evelyn  you are such a fellow for getting hold of the others but with you two at my back i really think the house may get a different tone into it  and every one told us what an excellent character it had said mrs evelyn when the letter through a chain of strict confidence came round to her the boys little knowing how much it did to decide their continuance together and at eton  sir james had never been willing that cecil should be taken away and he had become as sensible as any of the rest to the brownlow charm  that was a very happy time in the pinewoods and the alp  the whole of the nineteen copy books were actually read by babie to sydney and armine and lord fordham over his sketches submitted to hear a good deal  he told his mother that the story was the most diverting thing he had ever heard with its queer mixture of childish simplicity and borrowed romance of natural poetry and of infantine absurdity of extraordinary knowledge and equally comical ignorance of originality and imitation so that his great difficulty had been not to laugh in the wrong place when babie had tears in her eyes at the heights of pathos and sublimity and sydney was shedding them for company  it was funny to come to places where armines slightly superior age and knowledge of the world began to tell and when he corrected and criticised or laughed with appeals to his elder friend  babie was so perfectly goodhumoured about the sacrifice of her pet passages and even of her dozen copybooks that the editor of the travellers joy could not help encouraging the admission of jotapata into the magazine in spite of the remonstrances of the rest of his public who declared it was merely making the numbers a great deal heavier for postage and all for nothing  the magazine was well named for it was a great resource  there were illustrations of all kinds from lord fordhams careful watercolours and mrs brownlows graceful figures or etchings to the doctors clever caricatures and grotesque outlines and the contributions were equally miscellaneous  there were descriptions of scenery fragmentary notes of history and science records more or less veracious or absurd of personal adventures and conversations and advertisements such as—        stolen or strayed—a parasol white above black      below minus a ring with an ivory loop handle      and one broken whalebone  whoever will bring      the same to the senora donna elvira de menella      will he handsomely rewarded with a smile or a      scowl according to her mood       lost—on the walk from the alp of inestimable      value to the owner and none to any one else      an idea one of the very few originated by the      honble c f evelyn   small wit went a good way and personalities were by no means prohibited since the editor could be trusted to exercise a safe discretion in the riddles acrostics and anagrams deposited in the bag at his door and immense was the excitement when the numbers were produced with a pleasing irregularity as to time depending on when they became bulky enough to look respectable and not too thick to be sewn up comfortably by the great reeves who did not mind turning his hand to anything when he saw his lordship so merry  the only person who took no interest in the travellers joy  was janet who could not think how reasonable people could endure such nonsense  her first affront had been taken at a most absurd description which jock had illustrated by a fancy caricature of the fox and the crow womans progress in which mr hermann dowsterswivel was represented as haranguing by turns with her on the steamer and during her discourse quietly secreting her bag  it was such wild fun that lord fordham never dreamt of its being an affront nor perhaps would it have been if dr medlicott would have chopped logic science and philosophy with her in the way she thought her due from the only man who could be supposed to approach her in intellect  he however took to chaff  he would defend every popular error that she attacked and with an acumen and ease that baffled her even when she knew he was not in earnest and made her feel like thor when the giant affected to take three blows with miolner for three flaps of a rats tail  the magazine contained a series of notes on the nursery rhymes where the song of sixpence was proved to be a solar myth  the pocketful of rye was the yield of the earth and the twentyfour blackbirds sang at sunrise while the king counted out the golden drops of the rain and the queen ate the produce while the maids performance in the garden was beyond all doubt symbolic of the clouds suddenly broken in upon by the lightning  moreover the man of thessaly was beautifully illustrated blinding himself by jumping into the prickly bush of science where each gooseberry was labelled with some pseudo study  when he saw his eyes were out he stood wondrously gazing after them with his sockets while they returned a ludicrous stare from the points of thorns like lobsters  in his final leap deeper into truth he scratched them in again and walked off in a crown of laurels triumphant  janet was none the less disposed to leap into her special gooseberry bush and her importunity prevailed so that before dr medlicott returned to england he escorted her and her mother to zurich  then after full inquiries it was decided that she should have her will and follow out her medical course of study provided she could find a satisfactory person to board with  she proposed and her mother consented that the two miss rays should be her chaperons of course with liberal payment  nita could carry on her studies in art and made the plan agreeable to janet while old miss rays eyes which had begun to suffer from the copying would have a rest and mrs brownlow had as much confidence in her as in any one janet would endure     chapter xxv  the land of afternoon    and all at once they sang our island home is far beyond the wave we will no longer roam                                          tennyson   we must pass over three more years and a half and take up the scene in the cloistered court of a moorish house in algeria adapted to european habits  the slender columns supporting the horseshoe arches were trained with crimson passionflower and bougainvillia while orange and gardenia blossom scented the air and in the midst of a pavement of mosaic marbles was a fountain tinkling coolness to the air which was already heated enough to make it impossible to cross the court without protection from the sunshine even at nine oclock in the morning  mrs brownlow had a black lace veil thrown over her head and both she and the clergyman with her in muslinveiled hat had large white sunshades  little did we think where we should meet again and why mr ogilvie  do you feel as if you had got into tales of the alhambra or into the tempest  i hope not to continue in the tempest at any rate after this algier wedding  though no doubt you feel as i do that the world goes very like a game at consequences  who would ever have put together the vicar of benneton and mary ogilvie in the amphitheatre at constantina eating lionsteaks  consequence was an engaged ring  what the world said who would have thought it  the world in my person should say you have been marys kindest friend mrs brownlow  little did i think when i persuaded charles morgan to give himself six months rest from his parish by reading with armine that this was to be the end of it though i am sure there is not a man in the world to whom i am so glad to give my sister  and is it not delightful to see dear old mary  she looks younger now than ever she did in her whole life and has broken out of all her primmy governessy crust  oh it has been such fun to watch it so entirely unconscious as both of them were  mrs evelyn and i gloated over it together all the more that the children had not a suspicion  i dont think babie and sydney realise any one being in love nearer our own times than waverley at the very latest  they received the intelligence quite as a shock  allen said as if they had heard that the greek lexicon was engaged to the french grammar it will be their first bridesmaid experience  did they miss the wedding at kenminster  yes jessies old general chose to marry her in the depth of winter when we could not think of going home  you know i have not been at belforest for four years  four years  i suppose i knew but i did not realise it  yes  you know there was the first summer when just as we got back to london after our italian winter poor armie had such a dreadful attack on the lungs that dr medlicott said he was in more danger than when he was at schwarenbach and as soon as he could move we had to take him to bournemouth to get strength for going to the riviera  i can say now that i never did expect to bring him back again  but i am thankful to say he has been getting stronger ever since and has scarcely had a real drawback  yes i was astonished to see him looking so well  he would scarcely give a stranger the impression of being delicate  they told me last summer in london that the damage to the lungs had been quite outgrown and that he would only need moderate care for the future  indeed we should have stayed at home this year but last summer twelvemonth there was a fever and that set on foot a perquisition into our drains at belforest and it was satisfactorily proved that we ought by good rights to have been all dead of typhoid long ago  so we turned the workmen in and they could not of course be got out again  and then allen fell in love with parquet and tiles and i was weak enough to think it a good opportunity when all the floors were up  but when a man of taste takes to originality theres no end of it  everything has had to be made on purpose and certain little tiles five times over for when they did come out the right shape they were of a colour that allen pronounced utter demoralisation  however we are quite determined to get home this summer and you and mary must meet there and show old kenminster to mr morgan  ah here she comes and i shall leave you to enjoy this lucid interval of her while mr morgan is doing his last lessons with the children  how exactly like herself exclaimed mr ogilvie as mrs brownlow vanished under one of the arches  like yes but much more much better said mary eagerly  ah do you remember when you told me coming to her was an experiment and you thought it might be better for the old friendship if you did not accept the situation  you triumph at last david but i can confess now that for the first four years i held to that opinion and felt that my poor carey and i could have loved each other better if our relative situations had been different and we had not seen so much of one another  my life used to seem to me halfunspoken remonstrance halftruckling compliance and nothing but our mutual loyalty to old times and dear little babies affection could have borne us through  and her extraordinary sweetness and humility mary  yes i allow that  very few employers would have treated me as she did knowing how i regretted much that went on in her household however when i met her at pontresina after the boys terrible adventure in switzerland there was an indefinable change  i cannot tell whether it is owing to the constant being with such a boy as armine while he was for more than a year between life and death or whether it was from the influence of living with mrs evelyn but she has certainly ever since had the one thing that was wanting to all her sweetness and charm  i never thought so  no but you were never a fair judge  i think she has owed unspeakably much to mrs evelyn who so far as i can see is the first person who at any rate since the breakup of the original home made conscientiousness or indeed religion appear winning to her neither stiff nor censorious nor goody  is not this close combination of the two families rather odd  i dont think it is  poor lord fordham is very fond of armine and he hates the being driven abroad every winter so much that the meeting armine is the only pleasant ingredient  and it has been convenient for sydney to join our schoolroom party  i was very glad also that these last two summers there have been visits at fordham staying there has given mrs brownlow and the younger ones some insight into what the life at belforest might be but never has been and they will not be kept out of it any longer  then they are going home  after the london season  why little barbara is surely not coming out yet  no but elvira is  ah by the bye was i not told that i was to have two weddings  allen wished it but the elf wont hear of it  she says she had no notion of turning into a stupid old married woman before she has had any fun  does she care for him  i dont think she is capable of caring for any one much  i dont know whether she may ever soften with age but—  say it mary—out with it  i never saw such a heartless little butterfly  she did not care a rush when her good old grandfather died and i dont believe she has one fraction more love for mrs brownlow or allen or anybody else the best thing i can see is that she is too young to perceive the prudence of securing allen but perhaps that is only frivolity and he poor fellow is so devoted to her that it is quite provoking to see how she trifles with and torments him  isnt it rather good for the great mr brownlow  not much besides has contradicted him i should imagine  his mother thinks that it is the perpetual restlessness in which elvira keeps him that renders him so unsettled and that if they were once married he would have some peace of mind and be able to begin life in earnest  but to hurry on the marriage is such a fearful risk with such a creature as that sprite that she has persuaded him to wait and let the child be satisfied by this season in london that she may not think they are cheating her of her young lady life  it is on the cards i suppose that she might see some one whom she preferred to him  which might in some aspects of the matter be the best thing possible but mrs brownlow would have many conscientious scruples about the property and allen would be in utter despair  though of course all this would be far better than exposing that tropicalnatured spanish butterfly to meeting the subject of a grand passion too late said mr ogilvie  yes of course that must be in his mothers mind though i dont suppose she expresses it even to herself  miss evelyn is coming out too and is to be presented which reconciles the younger ones to putting off all their schemes for working at belforest after the true fordham and storybook fashion  besides mrs brownlow always feels that she has a duty towards elvira even apart from allen  and what do you think of allen  he seems very pleasant and gentlemanly  thats just what he is  he has always been as agreeable and nice as possible all these eight years that i have been with them and has treated me entirely as his mothers old friend  i cant help liking allen very much and wondering what he would have been if—if he had had to work for his living—or if elvira had not been such a little tormenting goose—or if all manner of ifs—indeed but they all resolve themselves into one question if there be much stuff in him  if not he is the only one of the family without except perhaps jock  oh if you saw jock now you would not doubt that theres plenty of substance in him  he has been a very different person ever since his illness in switzerland as full of life and fun as ever but thoroughly in earnest about doing right  he had an immense number of marks for the army examination and seems by all accounts to be keeping up to regular work now that it is more voluntary  is he not rather wasted on the guards  well that was sir james evelyns doing  they are glad enough to have him there to look after his friend mr evelyn and it was one of the cases where the decision for life has to be made before the youth is old enough to understand his full capabilities  i expect lucas to give him his right name will do something distinguished yet perhaps be a great general and i hope sir james has interest enough to get him employment before he has eaten his heart out on drill and parade  now that armines health is coming round i do leave caroline very happy about the younger half of her family  and the elder half  well  i sometimes think that there must have been something defective in the management of that excellent doctor and his mother as if they had never taught the children proper loyal respect for her  the three younger ones have it all right and the two elder sons are as fond of her as possible but she never had any authority over those three from the first  only allen is too gentle and has too much good taste to show it while as to the other two bobuss contempt is of a kindly filial petting description janets a nasty defiant overt disregard  impossible  they could not dare to despise her  they do for the very things that are best in her and so far i think the evelyn intercourse has been unlucky since they ascribe her greater religiousness to what it suits their democratic notions to scorn  not that there is much to complain of in bobuss manner when we do see him  he only uses little stings of satire chiefly about lord fordham  i dont think he would knowingly pain his mother if he could help it and for that reason there is a reserve between them  he is eating his terms in the temple is he not  and janet  is she studying medicine still  does she mean to practise  i cant make out  she has only been with us twice in these four years once at sorrento and once in london but she has a very active dislike to mrs evelyn and vexes her mother by making no secret of it  i believe she is to take her degree at zurich this spring but i dont think she means to practise  she is too well off for the drudgery but she is bent on making researches of some kind and i think i heard of some plan of her going to attend lectures to which her degree may admit her but i am not sure where  the two miss rays seem to be happy to escort her anywhere and that is a sort of comfort to mrs brownlow  miss ray keeps us informed of their comings and goings for janet seldom deigns to write  it is very strange that there should be such alienation and from such a mother  the two characters are as unlike as can be but i have always thought there must be some cause that no one but janet herself could perhaps explain  i cannot help thinking that she has some definite purpose in this study of medicine for i do not think it is for the sake either of the emancipation of women or of general philanthropy they must be an odd party  miss ray attends to the household matters mends the clothes and pays the bills  nita sketches reads at the libraries and talks at the table dhote like a strongminded woman as she is and janet goes her own way  bobus looked in on them once and described them to us with great gusto  there marys face became illuminated as a step approached and a gentleman with grizzled hair and a thoughtful gentle face came out and sat down on her other side  he had been college tutor to her brother though not much older and had stayed on at oxford till two years back he had taken a much neglected living  his health had broken down under the severe work of organising and he had accepted the easy task of reading with armine brownlow for the winter in a perfect climate as a welcome mode of recruiting his strength  he had truly recruited it in an unexpected manner and was about to take home with him one who would prove such a helpmeet as would lighten all the troubles and difficulties that had weighed so heavily on him and remove some of them entirely  so he came out and testified to the remarkable ability and zeal he had found in his pupil and likewise to the spirit of industry which had prevented the desultory life of travelling and illhealth from having made him nearly so much behindhand as might have been expected  if he only had health to work steadily for the next two years he would be quite as well prepared to matriculate at the university as all but the very foremost scholars from the public schools  mr morgan thought his intellect equal to that of his brother robert who had taken a double firstclass but of a finer order being open to those poetical instincts which went for nothing with the materialistic bobus  wherewith the friends fell into conversation more immediately interesting to themselves while at the other end of the court sheltered by a great orangetree a committee of the travellers joy was held  for that serial still survived though it could never be called a periodical since it was an intermittent and sometimes came out very rapidly sometimes with intervals of many months but it was always sent to and greatly relished by the absent members of the original party at first at eton and later two in their barracks and one at his college at oxford whither to his great satisfaction he had gone by means of a wellwon scholarship not at his aunts expense  jotapatas lengthy romance had died a natural death in the winter that had been spent between egypt and palestine  so far from picking up ideas from it there babie in the actual sight of mount hermons white crown had begged not to be put in mind of such nonsense and had never recurred to it but the wells of fancy had never been dried and the young people were happily putting together their bits of journal their bits of history the description of the great amphitheatre a poem of babies on st louiss death a spirited translation in scottlike metre of armines of the opening of the aeneid also one from the french by sydney on arab customs and all lord fordham had been able to collect about hippo also the single eye by allen and marcos felucca by armine and babie in partnership and a fair proportion of drollery  there was a space left for the wedding the greatest event the travellers joy had ever had on record said sydney as she touched up the etching at the top of her paper sitting on a low stool by a low motherofpearl inlaid eastern table  the greatest and the last chimed in babie as she worked away at the lace she was finishing for the bride  i dont see why it should be the last of the poor old joy said lord fordham sorting the mss which were scattered round him on the ground  well somehow i feel as if we had come to the end of a division of our lives returned babie  having done with swaddling bands eh infanta said lord fordham while armine hastily sketched in pen and ink babie with her hair flying and swaddling bands off executing a wardance  she did not like it  for shame armine  dont you know how dreadful it is to lose dear miss ogilvie  of course babie said her brother i didnt think you were such a babie as not to know that things go by contraries  it is too tender a spot for irony armie said lord fordham  well said armine i shall be obliged to do something outrageous presently so look out  not really said sydney  yes really said babie recovering i see what he means  he would like to do anything rather than sit and think that this is the last time we shall all be together again in this way  im sure i dont see why we should not said sydney  to say nothing of meetings in england duke and armine have only to cough three times in october and we should all go off together again and be as jolly as ever  i dont mean to cough said armine gravely ive wasted enough of my life already  in our company eh said sydney or are you to be taken by contraries  no said armine  one has duties and lotuseating is uncommonly nice but it wont do to go on for ever  i wouldnt have given in to it this winter if allen hadnt floored us  and then when you thought i had got a tutor and should do some good with him chimed in babie he must needs go and fall in love and spoil our miss ogilvie  the disgust with which she uttered the words was so comic that all the others burst out laughing  and fordham said—  the land of afternoon was too strong for him  shall you really pine much for miss ogilvie infanta  i shall miss her dreadfully said babie and i think it is very stupid of her to leave mother whom she has known all her life and all of us for a strange man she never saw till four months ago  oh babie you to be the author of a chivalrous romance said fordham  i was young and silly then said the young lady who was within a month of sixteen  and all your romances are to be henceforth without love said armine  i think they would be much more sensible said babie  why do you all laugh so  dont you see how stupid poor allen always is  and it can even spoil miss ogilvie and make her inattentive  poor allen echoed one or two voices in the same low tone for as they peeped out beyond the orangetree allen might be seen extended on a manycoloured rug in an exceedingly deplorable attitude  o yes said sydney but if one has such a—such a—such an object as that one must expect to be stupid and miserable sometimes  she must have been worrying him again said babie  o yes didnt you see said armine  no i remember you didnt go out riding early today  no i was finishing miss ogilvies wedding lace  well that french captain that elfie went on with at the commandants ball came riding up in full splendour and trotted alongside of her chattering away she bowing and smiling and playing off all her airs and at last letting him give her a great white flower  didnt you see it in her breast at breakfast  poor allen was looking as if he had eaten wormwood all the time when he was forced to fall back upon me and i suppose he has been having it out with her and has got the worst of it  o it is that is it said lord fordham i thought she wanted to pique allen she was so empressee with me  if people will be so foolish as to care for a pretty face sagely said sydney  you know it is not only that said babie allen is bound in honour to marry elvira to repair the great injustice  it is a great pity she will not marry him now at once but i think she is afraid because then you know she would get to have a soul like undine and she doesnt want one yet  thats a new view of the case said lord fordham in his peculiar lazy manner and taken allegorically it may be the true one  but one would like to have a soul said sydney  im not sure said babie with a great look of awe  one would know it was best but it would be very tremendous to feel all sorts of thoughts and perceptions swelling up in one  if that is the soul said armine  which is the soul said babie our understanding or our feelings or both  both said sydney undoubtingly  i dont know said babie  poor little chico has double the heart of his mistress  it is quite true said fordham  we may share intellect with demons but we do share what is called heart with animals  i think good animals have a sort of soul observed armine  and of course elvira has a soul said sydney who was getting bewildered  theologically speaking—yes said armine making them all laugh and i suppose undine hadnt  but it was sense and heart that was wanting  the heart would bring the sense said lord fordham and so we have come round to the infantas first assertion that the young lady shrinks from the awakening  ill tell you what she really does care for said babie and what i believe would waken up her soul much better than marrying poor allen  the announcement was so extraordinary that they all turned their heads to listen  her old black nurse at san ildefonso said babie  i believe going back there would do her all the good in the world  theres something in that notion said armine  she is always bettertempered in a hot country  yes added babie and you didnt see her when somebody advised our trying the west indies for the winter  her eyes gleamed and she panted and i didnt know what she was going to do  i told mother at night but she said she was afraid of going there because of the yellow fever and that san ildefonso had been made a coalingstation by the americans so it would only disappoint her  but elfie looked— i never saw any one look as she did—fit to kill some one when she found it was given up and she did not get over it for ever so long  take care heres an apparition said armine as a brilliant figure darted out in a moorish dress rich jacket short full white tunic full trousers tied at the ankles coins pendulous on the brow bracelets anklets and rows of pearls  it was a dress on which elvira had set her heart in readiness for fancy balls it had been procured with great difficulty and expense and had just come home from the french modiste who had adapted it to european wear  allen started up in admiration and delight  even mr morgan was roused to make an admiring inspection of the curious ornaments and devices and elvira with her perfect features rich complexion dark blue eyes titian coloured hair fine figure and oriental air formed a splendid study  lord fordham begged her to stand while he sketched her and babie with sydney was summoned to try on the bridesmaids apparel  the three girls elvira sydney and barbara acted as bridesmaids the next day when in the english chapel mr ogilvie gave his sister to his old friend to begin her new life as a clergymans wife  what could be called elvira de menellas character  those who knew her best such as barbara brownlow would almost have soon have thought of ascribing a personal character to a cloud as to her  she smiled into glorious loveliness when the sun shone she was gloomy and thunderous when displeased and though she had a passionate temper and could be violent she had no fixed purpose but drifted with the external impulse of the moment  she had not much mind or power of learning and was entirely inattentive to anything intellectual so that education had not been able at the utmost to do more than fit her to pass in the crowd and could get no deeper and what principles she had it was not easy to tell  not that she did or said objectionable things since she had outgrown her childish outbreaks but she seemed to have no substance and to be kept right by force of circumstances  she had the selfishness of any little child and though she had never been known to be untruthful this might be because there was not the slightest temptation to deceive she was just as much the spoilt child to all intents and purposes as if she had been the heiress perhaps more so for mrs brownlow had always been so remorseful for the usurpation as to be extra indulgent—lenient to her foibles and lavish in gifts and pleasures even inconveniencing herself for her fancies whilst allen had from the first treated her with the devotion of a lover  no stranger had ever supposed that she was not the equal in all respects of the rest of the family nor had she realised it herself     chapter xxvi  moonshine    but still the lady shook her head   and swore by yea and nay my whole was all that he had said   and all that he could say                         w m praed   mrs brownlow had intended to go at once to london on her return to england but the joint entreaties of armine and barbara prevailed on her to give them one week at belforest now in that early spring beauty in which they had first seen it  how delightful the arrival was  easter had been very late so it was the last week of the vacation and dear old friar johns handsome face was the first thing they saw at the station and then his fathers portly form with a tall pretty creature on each side of him causing babie to fall back with a cry of glad amazement oh essie and ellie  such women  then the train stopped and there was a tumult of embracings and welcomes in the midst of which jock appeared having just come by the down train  youll all come to dinner this evening entreated caroline  my love to ellen  tell her you must all of you come  it was a most delightsome barouche full that drove from the station jock took the reins and turned over coachman and footman to the break and in defiance of dignity his mother herself sprang up beside him  the sky was blue the hedges were budding with pure lightgreen above and resplendent with rosy campion and white spangles of stitchwort below  stars of anemone smiling bunches of primrose and azure clouds of bluebell made the young hearts leap as at that first memorable sight  armine said he was ready to hurrah and throw up his hat and though elvira declared that she saw nothing to be so delighted about they only laughed at her  gorgeous rhododendrons and gay azaleas rose in brilliant masses nearer the house beds of hyacinths and jonquils perfumed the air judiciously arranged parterres of gay little van thol tulips and white daisies flashed on the eyes of the arriving party while the exquisite fresh green provoked comparisons with parched africa  bobus was standing on the steps to receive them and when they had crossed the hall with due respect to its roman mosaic pavement they found the popinjay bowing dancing and chattering for joy and tea and coffee for parched throats in the favourite dresden set in the morning room the prettiest and cosiest in the house  how nice it is  we are all together except janet exclaimed babie  and janet is coming to us in london said her mother  did you see her on her way to edinburgh boys  no said jock  she never let us know she was there  but ill tell you an odd thing i have just found out said bobus it seems she came down here on her way unknown to anyone got out at the woodside station and walked across here  she told brock that she wanted something out of the drawers of her librarytable of which the key had been lost and desired him to send for higg to break it open but brock wouldnt hear of it  he said his missus had left him in charge and he could not be answerable to her for having locks picked without her authority—or leastways the colonels  he said miss brownlow was in a way about it and said as how it was her own private drawer that no one had a right to keep her out of but he stood to his colours he said the house was mrs brownlows and under his care and he would have no tampering with locks except by her authority or the colonels  he even offered to send to kenminster if she would write a note to my uncle but she said she had not time and walked off again forbidding him to mention that she had been here  janet always was a queer fish said jock  poor janet i suppose she wanted some of her notes of lectures said her mother  brocks sound old housedog instinct must have been very inconvenient to her  i must write and ask what she wanted  but she forbade him to mention it said bobus  of course that was only to avoid the fuss there would have been if it had been known that she had been here without coming to kencroft by the bye i didnt tell brock those good people were coming to dinner  how well the dear old monk looks and how charming essie and ellie  but i shall never know them apart now they are both the same size  you wont feel that difficulty long said bobus  there really is no comparison between them  just the insipid english mees said elvira  you should hear what the french think of the ordinary english girl  so much the better said bobus  no respectable english girl would wish for a foreigners insulting admiration  well done bobus  i never heard such an oldfashioned insular sentiment from you  one would think it was your namesake  by the bye where is the great rob  at aldershot said jock  i assure you he improves as he grows older  i had him to dine the other day at our mess and he cut a capital figure by judiciously holding his tongue and looking such a fine fellow that people were struck with him  there said armine slyly he has the seal of the guards approval  jock could afford to laugh at himself for he was entirely devoid of conceit but he added good humouredly—  well youngster i can tell you it goes for something  i wasnt at all sure whether the ass mightnt get his head out of the lionskin  oh yes they are all lions and no asses in the guards said babie whereupon jock fell on her and they had a playful skirmish  nobody came to dinner but john and his two sisters  it had turned out that the horse had been too much worked to be used again and there was a fine moon so that the three had walked over together esther and eleanor brownlow had always been like twins and were more than ever so now when both were at the same height of five feet eight both had the same thick glossy darkbrown hair done in the very same rich coils the same clearlycut regular profiles oval faces and soft carnation cheeks with liquid brown eyes under pencilled arches  caroline was in confusion how to distinguish them and trusted at first solely to the little coral charms which formed esthers earrings but gradually she perceived that esther was less plump and more mobile than her sister—her colour was more variable and she seemed as timid as ever while eleanor was developing the sturdy friar texture  their aunt had been the means of sending them to a good school and they had a much more trained and less homely appearance than jessie at the same age and seemed able to take their part in conversation with their cousins though essie was manifestly afraid of her aunt  they had always been fond of barbara and took eager possession of her while johns oxford talk was welcome to all—and it was a joyous evening of interchange of travellers anecdotes and local and family news but without any remarkable feature till the time came for the cousins to return  they had absolutely implored not to be sent home in the carriage but to walk across the park in the moonlight and it was such a lovely night that when bobus and jock took up their hats to come with them babie begged to go too and the same desire strongly possessed her mother above all when john said do come mother carey and rowed her in a plaidie  that youthful inclination to frolic had come on her and she only waited to assure herself that armine did not partake of her madness but was wisely going to bed  allen was holding out a scarf to elvira but she protested that she hated moonlight and that it was a sharp frost and she went back to the fire  as they went down the steps in the dark shadow of the house john gave his aunt his arm and she felt that he liked to have her leaning on him as they walked in the strong contrasts of white light and dark shade in the moonshine and pausing to look at the wonderful snowy appearance of the white azaleas the sparkling of the fountain and the stars struggling out in the pearly sky but john soon grew silent and after they had passed the garden said—  aunt caroline if you dont mind coming on a little way i want to ask you something  the name aunt caroline alarmed her but she professed her readiness to hear  you have always been so kind to me still more alarming thought she indeed he added i may say i owe everything to you and i should like to know that you would not object to my making medicine my profession  my dear johnny in an odd muffled voice  had you rather not he began  oh no  oh no no  it is the very thing  only when you began i was so afraid you wanted to marry some dreadful person  you neednt be afraid of that  ars medico will be bride enough for me till i meet another mother carey and that i shant do in a hurry  you silly fellow you arent practising the smoothness of tongue of the popular physician  dont you think i mean it said john rather hurt  my dear boy you must excuse me  it is not often one gets so many compliments in a breath besides having one of the first wishes of ones heart granted  do you mean that you really wished this  so much that i am saying thank god in my heart all the time  well my father and mother thought you might be wishing me to be a barrister or something swell  as if i could—as if i ever could be so glad of anything said she with rejoicing that surprised him  it is the only thing that could make up for none of my own boys taking that line  i cant tell you now how much depends on it john you will know some day  tell me what put it into your head—  he told her as he had told his father nearly four years before how the dim memory of his uncle had affected him and how the bent had been decidedly given by his attendance on jock and his intercourse with dr medlicott  at oxford he had availed himself of all opportunities and had come out honourably in all examinations including physical science and he was now reading for his degree meaning to go up for honours  his father finding him steady to his purpose had consented and his mother endured but still hoped his aunt would persuade him out of it  she was so far from any such intention that a hint of the magnum bonum had very nearly been surprised out of her  for the first time since belforest had come to her did she feel in the course of carrying out her husbands injunctions and she felt strengthened against that attack from janet to which she looked forward with dread  she talked with john of his plans till they actually reached the lodge gate and there found jock babie and eleanor chattering merrily about fireflies and glowworms a little way behind and bobus and esther paired together much further back  when all had met at the gate and the parting goodnights had been spoken bobus became his mothers companion and talked all the way home of his great satisfaction at her wandering time being apparently over of his delight in her coming to settle at home at last his warm attachment to the place and his desire to cultivate the neighbouring borough with a view to representing it in parliament since allen seemed to be devoid of ambition and so much to hate the mud and dust of public life that he was not likely to plunge into it unless elvira should wish for distinction  then bobus expatiated on the awkward connection the goulds would be for allen stigmatising the amiable lisette who of course by this time had married poor george gould as an obnoxious presuming woman whom it would be very difficult to keep in her right position  it was not a bad thing that elvira should have a taste of london society to make her less likely to fall under her influence  that is not a danger i should have apprehended said caroline  the woman can fawn and that is exactly what a haughty being like elvira likes  she is always pining for a homage she does not get in the family  except from poor allen  except from allen but that is a matter of course  he is a slave to be flouted  did you ever see a greater contrast than that between her and our evening guests  esther and eleanor  they have grown up into very sweetlooking girls  not that there can be any comparison between them  essie has none of the ponderous highness in her—only the serenity  yes there is a very pleasant air of innocent candour about their faces—  just what it does a man good to look at  it is like going out into the country on a spring morning and there is very real beauty too—  yes kencroft monopolises all the good looks of the family  what a fine fellow the dear old friar has grown  if you bring out those two girls this year you will take the shine out of all the other chaperons  i wonder whether your aunt would like it  she never made any objection to jessies going out with you  no  i should like it very much i wonder i had not thought of it before but i had hardly realised that essie and ellie were older than babie but i remember now they are eighteen and seventeen  it would be so good for you to have something human and capable of a little consideration to go out with added bobus not to be tied to the tail of a willofthewisp like that elf—i should not like that for you  i am not much afraid said caroline  you know i dont stand in such awe of the little donna and i shall have my guardsman to take care of me when we are too frivolous for you  but it would be very nice to have those two girls and make it pleasanter for my infanta who will miss sydney a good deal  i thought the evelyns were to be in town  yes but their house is at the other end of the park  what are jock and the infanta looking at  jock and babie who were on a good way in advance in very happy and eager conversation had come to a sudden stop and now turned round exclaiming look mother  heres the original robin goodfellow  and on the walk there was a most ludicrous shadow in the moonlight a grotesque dancing figure with one long ear and a hand held up in warning  it was of course the shadow of the midas statue which the boys had never permitted to be restored to its pristine state  one ear had however crumbled away but in the shadow this gave the figure the air of cocking the other in the most indescribably comical manner and the whole four stood gazing and laughing at it  there was a certain threatening attitude about its hand which jock said looked as if the ghost of old barnes had come to threaten them for the wasteful expenditure of his hoards  or as babie said it was more like the ghastly notion of bertram risingham in rokeby of some phantom of a murdered slave protecting those hoards  i dont wonder he threatens said caroline  i always thought he meant that audacious trick to have forfeited the hoards  very lucky he was balked said bobus not only for us but for human nature in general  fancy how insufferable that elf would have been if she had been dancing on gold and silver  take care muttered jock under his breath  theres her swain coming i see his cigar  and we really shall have it sunday morning presently said his mother and i shall get into as great a scrape as i did in the old days of the folly  it was a happy sunday morning  the vicar of woodside had much improved the church and services with as much assistance in the way of money as he chose to ask for from the lady of belforest though hitherto he had had nothing more but he and his sister augured better things when the lady herself with her daughter and her two youngest sons came across the park in the freshness of the morning to the early celebration  the sister came out with them and asked them to breakfast  mrs brownlow would not desert allen and bobus but she wished armine to spare himself more walking  moreover babie discovered that some desertion of teachers would render their aid at the sunday school desirable on that morning  this was at present her ideal of sunday occupation and she had gained a little fragmentary experience under sydneys guidance at fordham  so she was in a most engaging glow of shy delight and the tidy little welltrained girls who were allotted to her did not diminish her satisfaction  to say that armines positive enjoyment was equal to hers would not be true but he had intended all his life to be a clergyman and he was resolved not to shrink from his first experience of the kind  the boys were too much impressed by the apparition of one of the young gentlemen from belforest to comport themselves ill but they would probably not have answered his questions even had they been in their own language and they stared at him in a stolid way while he disadvantageously contrasted them with the little readytongued peasant boys of italy  however he had just found the touch of nature which made the world kin and had made their eyes light up by telling them of a scene he had beheld in palestine illustrating the parable they had been repeating when the change in the church bells was a signal for leaving off  very happy and full of plans were the two young things much pleased with the clergyman and his sister who were no less charmed with the little bright brownfaced lustrouseyed girl with her eager yet diffident manner and winning vivacity and with the slender delicate thoughtful lad whose grave courtesy of demeanour sat so prettily upon him  though not to compare in numbers size or beauty with the kencroft flock the belforest party ranged well in their seat at church for robert never failed to accompany his mother once a day as a concession due from son to mother  it was far from satisfying her indeed there was a dull heavy ache at her heart whenever she looked at him for however he might endeavour to conform like marcus aurelius sacrificing to the gods there was always a certain half patronising halfcriticising superciliousness about his countenance yet if he came for love of her still something might yet strike him and win his heart  had her years of levity and indifference been fatal to him was ever her question to herself as she knelt and prayed for him  she felt encouraged when at luncheon she asked jock to walk with her to kenminster for the evening service after looking in at kencroft robert volunteered to be of the party  caroline however did not think that he was made quite so welcome at kencroft as his exertion deserved  colonel and mrs brownlow were sitting in the drawingroom with the blinds down presumably indulging in a sunday nap in the heat of the afternoon for the colonel shook himself in haste and his wifes cap was a little less straight than suited her serene dignity and though they kissed and welcomed the mother they were rather short and dry towards bobus they said the children had gone out walking whereupon the two lads said they would try to meet them and strolled out again  this left the field free for caroline to propose the taking the two girls to london with her  i am sure said ellen you have always been very kind to the children  but indeed caroline i did not think you would have encouraged it  it—i dont quite understand said caroline wondering whether ellen had suddenly taken an evangelically serious turn  there said the colonel i told you she was not aware of it and on her imploring cry of inquiry ellen answered of this folly of robert  bobus do you mean she cried  oh as conviction flashed on her i never thought of that  i am sure you did not said the colonel kindly  but—but she said bewildered if—if you mean esther—why did you send her over last night and let him go out to find her now  she is safe reading to mrs coffinkey said ellen  i did not know robert was at home or i should not have let her come without me  esther is a very dear sweetlooking girl said caroline  if only she were any one elses daughter  though that does not sound civil but i know my dear husband had the strongest feeling about first cousins marrying  yes i trusted to your knowing that said the colonel  and i rely on you not to be weak nor to make the task harder to us remembering too he added in a voice of sorrow and pity that made the words sound not unkind that even without the relationship we should feel that there were strong objections  i know  my poor bobus said caroline sadly  that makes it such a pity she is his cousin  otherwise she might do him so much good  i have not much faith in good done in that manner said the colonel  caroline thought him mistaken but could not argue an abstract question and came to the personal one  but how far has it gone how do you know about it  i see now that i might have detected it in his tone but one never knows when ones children grow up  the colonel was obliged to tell him in the autumn that we did not approve of flirtations between cousins said mrs brownlow  and he answered—  that flirtation was the last thing he intended said the colonel on which i told him that i would have no nonsense  was that all  except that at christmas he sent her by way of card a drawing that must have cost a large sum said the colonel  we thought it better to let the child keep it without remark for fear of putting things into her head though i wrote and told him such expensive trumpery was folly that i was much tempted to forbid  so what does he do on valentines day but send her a complete set of ornaments like little birds in genoa silver—exquisite things  well she was very good dear child  we told her it was not nice or maidenly to take such valuable presents and she was quite contented and happy when her mother gave her a ring of her own and we have written to jessie to send her some pretty things from india  she said she did not care for anything that ellie did not have too added her mother  then you returned them  yes and my young gentleman patronisingly replies that he appreciates my reluctance and reserves them for a future time  just like bobus said caroline  he never gives up his purpose but how about dear little esther  is she really untouched  i hope so replied her mother  so far it has all been put upon propriety and so on  i told her now she was grown up and come home from school she must not run after her cousins as she used to do and i have called her away sometimes when he has tried to get her alone last evening she told me in a very simple way—like the child she is—that robert would walk home with her in the moonlight and hindered her when she tried to join the others telling me she hoped i should not be angry with her  he seems to have talked to her about this london plan but i told her on the spot it was impossible  i am afraid it is sighed caroline  dear essie  i will do my best to keep her peace from being ruffled for i know you are quite right but i cant help being sorry for my boy and he is so determined that i dont think he will give up easily  you may let him understand that nothing will ever make me consent returned the colonel  i will if he enters on it with me said caroline but i think it is advisable as long as possible to prevent it from taking a definite shape  caroline was much better able now to hold her own with her brother and sisterinlaw  not only did her position and the obligations they were under give her weight but her character had consolidated itself in these years and she had much more force and appearance of good sense  besides john was a weight in the family now and his feeling for his aunt was not without effect  they talked of his prospects and of jessies marriage over their early tea  the elders of the walking party came in with hands full of flowers namely the two johns and eleanor but ominously enough bobus was not there  he had been lost sight of soon after they had met  yes and at that moment he was loitering at a safe distance from the door of the now invalid and halfblind mrs coffinkey to whom the brownlow girls read by turns  she lived conveniently up a lane not much frequented  this was the colloquy which ensued when the tall wellproportioned maiden with her fresh modest happy face tripped down the steps—  so the coffinkey is unlocked at last  stern proserpine relented  robert  you here  you never used to call me robert  mamma says it is time to leave off the other  perhaps she would like you to call me mr robert otway brownlow  dont talk of mamma in that way  i would do anything my queen tells me except command my tones when there is an attempt to stiffen her  she is not to be made into buckram  please robert as some one met and looked at them let me walk on by myself  what  shall i be the means of getting you into trouble  no but i ought not—  the road is clear now never mind  in town there are no gossips thats one comfort  mother carey is propounding the plan now  oh but we shall not go  mamma told me so last night  that was before mother carey had talked her over  do you think she will  i am certain of it  you are a sort of child of mother careys own you know and we cant do without you  mother would miss us so just as we are getting useful  yes but ellie might stay  oh we have never been parted  we couldnt be  indeed  is there no one that could make up to you for ellie  no indeed indignantly  ah essie you are too much of a child yet to understand the force of the love that—  dont broke in esther that is just like people in novels and mamma would not like it  but if i feel ten times far more for you than the people in novels attempt to express  dont again cried esther  it is sunday  and what of that my most scriptural little queen   it isnt a time to talk out of novels said esther quickening her pace to reach the frequented road and throng of churchgoers  i am not talking out of any novel that ever was written said bobus seriously but she was speeding on too fast to heed him and started as he laid a hand on her arm  stay essie you must not rush on like a frightened fawn or people will stare he said and she slackened her pace though she shook him off and went on through the numerous passengers on the footpath with her pretty head held aloft with the stately grace of the startled pheasant not choosing to seem to hear his attempts at addressing her and taking refuge at last in the innermost recesses of the family seat at church though it was full a quarter to five  there the rest of the party found her and as they did not find bobus they concluded that all was safe  however when the two johns were walking home with mother carey bobus joined them and soon made his mother fall behind with him asking her i hope your eloquence prevailed  far from it bobus she said  in fact you have alarmed them  h s h doesnt improve with age he replied carelessly  she never troubled herself about jessie  perhaps no one gave her cause  my dear boy i am very sorry for you and she laid her hand within his arm  have they been baiting you  poor little mother carey he said force of habit you know thats all  never mind them  bobus my dear i must speak and in earnest  i am afraid you may be going on so as to make yourself and—some one else unhappy and you ought to know that your father was quite as determined as your uncle against marriages between first cousins  my dear mother it will be quite time to argue that point when the matter becomes imminent  i am not asking to marry any one before i am called to the bar and it is very hard if we cannot in the meantime live as cousins  yes but there must be no attempt to be a little more than kin  less than kind comes in on the other side said bobus in his throat  i tell you the child is a child who has no soul apart from her sister and theres no use in disturbing her till she has grown up to have a heart and a will of her own  then you promise to let her alone  i pledge myself to nothing said bobus in an impracticable voice i only give warning that a commotion will do nobody any good  she knew he had not abandoned his intention and she also knew she had no power to make him abandon it so that all she could say was as long as you make no move there will be no commotion but i only repeat my assurance that neither your uncle nor i acting in the person of your dear father will ever consent  to which i might reply that most people end by doing that against which they have most protested  however i am not going to stir in the matter for some time to come and i advise no one else to do so     chapter xxvii  bluebeards closet    a moment then the volume spread and one short spell therein he read                                   scott   the reality of johns intention to devote himself to medicine made caroline anxious to look again at the terms of the trust on which she held the magnum bonum secret  moreover she wanted some papers and accounts and therefore on monday morning while getting up she glanced towards the place where her davenport usually stood and to her great surprise missed it she asked emma who was dressing her whether it had been moved and found that her maid had been as much surprised as herself at its absence and that the housekeeper had denied all knowledge of it  other things is missing maam said emma theres the key of the closet where your dresses hangs  ive hunted high and low for it and nobody hasnt seen it  keys are easily lost said caroline but my davenport is very important  perhaps in some cleaning it has been moved into one of the other rooms and forgotten there  i wish you would look  you know i had it before i came here  not only did emma look but as soon as her mistress was ready to leave the room she went herself on a voyage of discovery peeping first into the little dressingroom where seeing babie at her morning prayers she said nothing to disturb her and then going on to look into some spare rooms beyond where she thought it might have been disposed of as being not smart enough for my ladys chamber coming back to her room she found to her extreme amazement the closet open and babie pushing the davenport out of it with her cheeks crimson and a look of consternation at being detected  my dear child  the davenport there  did you know it  how did it get there  i put it said barbara evidently only forced to reply by sheer sincerity  you  and why  i thought it safer mumbled babie  and you knew where the key of the closet was  yes  where  in my dolls bed locked up in the babyhouse  this is most extraordinary  when did you do this  just before we came out to you at leukerbad said babie each reply pumped out with great difficulty  four years ago  it is a very odd thing  i suppose you had a panic for you were too old then for playing monkey tricks  to which babie made no answer and the next minute her mother who had become intent on the davenport exclaimed i suppose you havent got the key of this in your dolls bed  dont you remember mother said barbara you sent it home to janet and it was lost in her bag on the crossing  oh yes i remember  and it is a bramah lock mores the pity  we must have the locksmith over from kenminster to open it  the man was sent for the davenport was opened desk drawers and all  caroline was once more in possession of her papers  she turned them over in haste and saw no book of magnum bonum  again more carefully she looked  the white slate where those precious last words had been written was there proving to her that her memory had not deceived her but that she had really kept her treasure in that davenport  then in her distress she thought of barbaras strange behaviour went in quest of her and calling her aside asked her to tell her the real reason why she had thought fit to secure the davenport in the closet  why asked babie her eyes growing large and shining is anything missing  tell me first said caroline trembling  then babie told how she had wakened and seen janet with the desk part raised up reading something and how when she lay watching and wondering janet had shut it up and gone away  and i did not feel comfortable about it mother said babie so i thought i would lock up the davenport so that nobody could get at it  you did not see her take anything away  no i cant at all tell said babie  is anything gone  a book i valued very much  some memoranda of your father were in that desk and i cannot find them now  you cannot tell i suppose whether she was reading letters or a book  it was not letters said babie but i could not see whether it was print or manuscript  mother i think she must have taken it to read and could not put it back again because i had hidden the davenport oh i wish i hadnt but i couldnt ask any one it seemed such a wicked dreadful fancy that she could meddle with your papers  you acted to the best of your judgment my dear said caroline i ought never to have let it out of my own keeping  do you think it was lost in the bag mother  i hope not  that would be worst of all said caroline  i must ask janet  dont say anything about it my dear  let me think it over  when caroline recollected janets attempt as related by robert to break open her bureau she had very little doubt that the book was there  it could not have been lost in the bag for as she remembered reference had been made to it when janet had extorted permission to go to zurich and she had warned her that even these studies would not be a qualification for the possession of the secret  janet had then smiled triumphantly and said she would make her change her mind yet had looked in fact very much as bobus did when he put aside her remonstrances  it was not the air of a person who had lost the records of the secret and was afraid to confess though it was possible she might have them in her own keeping caroline longed to search the bureau but however dishonourably janet might have acted towards herself she could not break into her private receptacles without warning  so after some consideration she made barbara drive her to the station and send the following telegraphic message to janets address at edinburgh—  come home at once  fathers memorandum book missing  must be searched for  all that day and the next the sons wondered what was amiss with their mother she was so pensive with starts of flightiness  allen thought she was going to have an illness and bobus that it was a very strange and foolish way of taking his resistance but all the time armine was going about quite unperceiving in a blissful state the vicars sister a spirited active and very winning woman of thirtyfive had captivated him as she did all the lads of the parish  he had been walking about with her being introduced to all the needs of the parish and his enthusiastic nature throwing itself into the cause of religion and beneficence which was in truth his congenial element he was ready to undertake for himself and his mother whatever was wanted without a word of solicitation nay rather the vicar who thought it all far too good to be true held him back  and when he came in and poured out his narrative he was for the first time in his life even petulant that his mother was too much preoccupied to confirm his promises and angry when allen laughed at his vehemence and said he should beware of model parishes  by dinnertime the next day janet had actually arrived  she looked thin and sharp her keen black eyes roamed about uneasily and some indescribable change had passed over her  her brothers told her study had not agreed with her and she did not as of old answer tartly but gave a stiff mechanical smile and all the evening talked in a womanoftheworld manner cleverly agreeably not putting out her prickles but like a stranger and as if on her guard  of course there was no speaking to her till bedtime and caroline at first felt as if she ought to let one night pass in peace under the home roof but she soon felt that to sleep would be impossible to herself and she thought it would be equally so to her daughter without coming to an understanding  she yearned for some interchange of tenderness from that firstborn child from whom she had been so long separated and watched and listened for a step approaching her door till at last when the maid was gone and no one came she yielded to her impulse and in her white dressinggown with softly slippered feet she glided along the passage with a strange mixed feeling of maternal gladness that janet was at home again and of painful impatience to have the interview over  she knocked at the door  there was no answer  she opened it  there was no one there but the light on the terrace below thrown from the windows of the lower room was proof to her that janet was in her sittingroom and she began to descend the private stairs that led down to it  she was as light in figure and in step as ever and her soft slippers made no noise as she went down  the door in the wainscot was open and from the foot of the stairs she had a strange view  janets candle was on the chair behind her in front of it lay halfadozen different keys and she herself was kneeling before the bureau trying one of the keys into the lock  it would not fit and in turning to try another she first saw the white figure and started violently at the first moment then as the trembling pleading voice said janet she started to her feet and cried out angrily—  am i to be always spied and dogged  hush janet said her mother in a voice of grave reproof i simply came to speak to you about the distressing loss of what your father put in my charge  and why should i know anything about it demanded janet  you were the last person who had access to the davenport said her mother  this is that child barbaras foolish nonsense muttered janet to herself  barbara has nothing to do with the fact that i sent you the key of the davenport where the book was  it is now missing  janet it is bitterly painful to me to say so but your endeavours to open that bureau privately have brought suspicion upon you and i must have it opened in my presence  i have a full right to my own bureau  of course you have but i had these notes left in my trust  it is my duty towards your father to use every means for their recovery  you call it a duty to my father to shut up his discovery and keep it useless for the sake of a lot of boys who will never turn it to profit  of that i am judge  my present duty is to recover it  your conduct is such as to excite suspicion and i therefore cannot allow you to take anything out of that bureau except in my presence till i have satisfied myself that his memoranda are not there  i would not search your drawers in your absence and therefore telegraphed for you  thank you since you like to treat your daughter like a maidservant you may go on and search my boxes said janet sulkily  i beg your pardon my poor child if i am unjustly causing you this humiliation said caroline humbly as janet sullenly flumped down into a chair without answering  she took up the keys that janet had brought with her and tried them one by one where janet had been using them  the fourth turned in the lock and the drawer was open  i will disarrange nothing unnecessarily said caroline  look for yourself  janet would not however move hand foot or eye while her mother put in her hand and took out what lay on the top  it was the magnum bonum  she held it to the light and was sure of it but she had taken up an envelope at the same time and her eye fell on the address as she was laying it down  it was to—james barnes esq and as her eye caught the pencilled words my will a strange electric thrill went through her as she exclaimed what is this janet  how came it here  oh take it if you like said janet  i put it there to spare you worry but if you will pursue your researches you must take the consequences  caroline thus defied still instinctively holding magnum bonum close to her drew out the contents of the envelope and caught in the broken handwriting of the old man the words—will and testament— george gould—wakefield—elvira de menellawhole estate  then she saw signature seal witnesses—date april 24th 1862  what is this  where did it come from she asked  i found it—in his table drawer i saw it was not valid so i kept it out of the way from consideration for you said janet  how do you know it was not valid  oh—why—i didnt look much or know much about it either said janet in an alarmed voice  i was a mere child then you know  i saw it was only scrawled on letterpaper and i thought it was only a rough draft which would just make you uncomfortable  i hope you did janet  i hope you did not know what you were doing  you dont mean that it has been executed  here are witnesses said caroline—her eyes swam too much to see their names  it must be for better heads than ours to decide whether this is of force but oh janet if we have been robbing the orphan all these years  the orphan has been quite as well off as if it had been all hers said janet  mother just listen  give me the keeping of my fathers secret and—even if we lose this place—it shall make up for all—  you do not know what you are talking of janet said caroline pushing back those ripples of white hair that crowned her brow nor indeed i either  i only know you have spoken more kindly to me and that you are under my own roof again  kiss me my child and forgive me if i have pained you  you did not know what you did about the will and as to this book i know you meant to put it back again  i did—i did mother—if barbara had not hidden the desk cried janet  and as her mother kissed her she laid her head on her shoulder and wept and sobbed in an hysterical manner such as caroline had never seen in her before  of course she was tired out by the long journey and the subsequent agitation and caroline soothed and caressed her with the sole effect of making her cry more piteously but she would not hear of her mother staying to undress and put her to bed gathered herself up again as soon as she could and when another kiss had been exchanged at her bedroom door caroline heard it locked after her  very little did caroline sleep that night  if she lost consciousness at all it was only to know that something strange and wonderful was hanging over her  sometimes she had a sense that her trust and mission as a rich woman had been illfulfilled and therefore the opportunity was to be taken away but more often there was a strange sense of relief from what she was unfit for  she remembered that strange dream of her children turning into statues of gold and the magnum bonum disenchanting them and a fancy came over her that this might yet be realised a fancy to whose lulling effect she was indebted for the sleep she enjoyed in the morning which made her unusually late but prevented her from looking as haggard as janet did with eyelids swollen as if she had cried a good deal longer last night  the postbag was lying on the table and directly after family prayers which she had for some years begun when at home mrs brownlow beguiled her nervousness by opening it and distributing the letters  the first she opened was such a startling one that her head seemed to reel and she doubted whether the shock of last night was confusing her senses   my dear mrs brownlow—what will you think of us now that the full truth has burst on you  of me especially to whom you entrusted your dear daughter  i never could have thought that nita would have lent herself to the transaction and alas i let the two girls take care of themselves more than was right  however i can at least give you the comfort of knowing that it was a perfectly legal marriage for nita was one of the witnesses and looked to all that—   here caroline could read no more  sick and stunned she began to dispense her teacups and even helped herself to some of the food that was handed round but her hand trembled so and she looked so white and bewildered that allen exclaimed—  mother you are really ill  you should not have come down  she could not bear the crowd and buzz of voices and all the anxious eyes any longer  she pushed back her chair and as sons came hurrying round with offered arms she took the nearest which was jocks let him take her to the morningroom and there assured him she was not ill only she had had a letter  she wanted nothing only that he should go back and send her janet  she tried once more to master the contents of miss rays letter but she was too dizzy and when janet came in she could only hold it out to her  oh said janet poor old maria has forestalled me  yes mother it is what i meant to tell you only i thought you could not bear a fresh shock last night  married  oh janet why thus  because we wished to avoid the gossip and conventionality  my uncle and aunt were to be avoided  let me hear at once who it is said caroline with the sharpness of misery  it is professor demetrius hermann a most able lecturer whose course we have been following  i met him a year ago at the table dhote at zurich where he delivered a series of lectures on physiology on a new and original system  he is now going on with them in scotland where his wonderful acuteness and originality have produced an immense sensation and i have no doubt that in his hands this discovery of my fathers will receive its full development  there was no apology in her tone it was rather that of one who was defying censure and her mother could only gasp out—  how long  three weeks  when we heard you were returning we thought it would save much trouble and difficulty to secure ourselves against contingencies and profit by scottish facilities  wherewith janet handed her mother a certificate of her marriage at glasgow before jane ray and another witness and taking her weddingring from her purse put it on adding when you see him mother you will be more than satisfied  where is he interrupted caroline  at the railway hotel waiting till you are prepared to see him  he brought me down but he is to give a lecture at glasgow the day after tomorrow so we can only remain one night  oh janet—janet this is very fearful  at that moment johnny strolled up to the window from the outside and as he greeted janet with some surprise he observed—  theres a most extraordinary looking foreign fellow loitering about out here  i warned him he was on private ground and he made me a bow as if i not he were the trespasser  on this janet darted out at the window without another word and john exclaiming in dismay—  mother carey what is the matter  she gasped out oh johnny shes married to him  and the children dont know it  send them in—allen and bobus i mean—make haste i must prepare them  take that letter and let the others know  john saw the truest kindness was implicit obedience and allen and bobus instantly joined her the latter asking what new tomfoolery janet had brought home allen following with a cup of coffee  carolines lips felt too dry to speak and she held out the certificate  it was received by allen with the exclamation—  by jove  and by bobus with an odd harsh laugh—i thought she would do something monstrous one of these days  did you ever hear of him bobus she found voice to say after swallowing a mouthful of coffee  i fancy i have  yes i remember now he was lecturing and vapouring about at zurich he is half greek i believe and all charlatan well  janet has been and gone and done for herself now and no mistake  but he is a professor pleaded caroline  he must be of some university  dont make too sure said allen a professor may mean a writing master  good heavens what a connection  it cant be so bad as that said caroline  remember your sister is not foolish  flatter an ugly woman said bobus and its a regular case of fox and crow  mercy here they come cried allen  mother do you go away  this is not work for you  leave us to settle the rascal said bobus  no bobus she said this ought to be settled by me  remember that whatever the man may be he is janets husband and she is your sister  worse luck sighed allen  and she added he has to go away tomorrow at latest a sentence which she knew would serve to pacify allen  they had crossed the parterre by this time and were almost at the window  it was bobus who took the initiative bowing formally as he spoke in german—  good morning herr professor  you seem to have a turn for entering houses by irregular methods  the newcomer bowed with suavity saying in excellent english—  it is to your sister that in both senses i owe my entrance and to the lady your mother that i owe my apology  and before caroline well knew what was going on he had one knee to the ground and was kissing her hand  the tableau is incomplete janet said bobus whom caroline heartily wished away  you ought to be on your knees beside him  i have settled it with my mother already said janet  both caroline and her eldest son were relieved by the first glance at the man  he was small and had much more of the greek than of the german in his aspect with neat little features keen dark eyes and no vulgarity in tone or appearance  his hands were delicate there was nothing of the greasy foreigner about him but rather an air of finesse especially in his exquisitely trimmed little moustache and pointed beard and his voice and language were persuasive and fluent it might have been worse was the prominent feeling as she hastily said—  stand up mr hermann i am not used to be spoken to in that manner  nor is it an ordinary occasion on which i address madame said her new soninlaw rising  i am aware that i have transgressed many codes but my anxiety to secure my treasure must plead for me and she assured me that she might trust to the goodness of the best of mothers  there is such a thing as abusing such goodness said bobus  sir said hermann i understand that you have rights as eldest son but i await my sentence from the lips of madame herself  no he is not the eldest interrupted janet  this is allen— allen you were always goodnatured  cannot you say one friendly word  something in the more childish eager tone of janets address softened allen and he answered—  it is for mother to decide on what terms we are to stand janet and strange as all this has been i have no desire to be at enmity  caroline had by this time been able to recover herself and spoke  mr hermann can hardly expect a welcome in the family into which he has entered so unexpectedly and—and without any knowledge of his antecedents  but what is done cannot be undone i dont want to be harsh and unforgiving  i should like to understand all about everything and of course to be friends as to the rest it must depend on how they go on and a great deal besides  it was a lame and impotent conclusion but it seemed to satisfy the gentleman who clasped her hand and kissed it with fervour wrung that of allen which was readily yielded and would have done the same by that of bobus if that youth had done more than accord very stiff cold tips  immediately after john said at the door—  aunt caroline my father is here  will you see him  that was something to be got over at once and she went to the colonel who was very kind and pitiful to her and spared her the i told you so  he did not even reproach her with being too lenient in not having turned the pair at once out of her house indeed he was wise enough to think the extremity of a quarrel ought to be avoided but he undertook to make every inquiry into mr demetrius hermanns history and observed that she should be very cautious in pledging herself as to what she would do for him since she had as he expressed it the whiphand of him since janet was totally dependent upon her  oh but robert i forgot i dont know if there is anything for anybody she said putting her hand to her forehead theres that other will  ah  i see you think i dont know what i am saying and my head is getting past understanding much but i really did find the other will last night  what other will  the one we always knew there must be in favour of elvira  this dreadful business put it out of my head the children dont know it yet and i dont seem able to think or care  it was true severe nervous headache had brought her to the state in which she could do nothing but lie passively on her bed  the colonel saw this and bade her think of nothing for the present and sent barbara to take care of her  she spent the rest of the day in the sort of aniantissement which that sort of headache often produces and in the meantime everybody held teteatetes  the colonel held his peace about the will not half crediting such a catastrophe and thinking one matter at a time quite enough for his brain but he talked to the professor to janet to allen and to bobus and tried to come to a knowledge of the bridegrooms history and to decide what course ought to be pursued feeling as the good man always did and always would do that he was or ought to be the supreme authority for his brothers widow and children  allen was quite placable and ready to condone everything  he thought the athenian professor a very superior man with excellent classical taste by which it was plain that his mosaic pavement his old china and his pictures had met with rare appreciation moreover the professor knew how to converse and could be brill iantly entertaining there was nothing to find fault with in his appearance and if janet was satisfied allen was  he knew his uncle hated foreigners but for his own part he thought nothing so dull as english respectability  for once the colonel declared that bobus had more sense  bobus had come to a tolerably clear comprehension of the matter and his first impressions were confirmed by subsequent inquiries  demetrius hermann was the son of some lawyer of king othos court who had married a greek lady  he had studied partly at athens partly at so many other universities that bobus thought it rather suspicious while his uncle who held that a respectable degree must be either of oxford or cambridge thought this fatal to his reputation  he had studied medicine at one time but had broached some theory which the german faculty were too narrow to appreciate which means quoth bobus either that he could not get a licence to practise or else had it revoked  then he had taken to lecturing  the professorship was obscure he said it was athenian and bobus had no immediate means of finding out whether it were so or not nor of analysing the alphabet of letters that followed his name upon the advertisement of his lectures  apparently he was a clever lecturer fluent and full of illustration with an air of original theory that caught peoples attention  he knew his ground and where critically scientific men were near to bring him to book was cautious to keep within the required bounds but in the freer and less regulated places he discoursed on new theories and strange systems connected with the mysteries of magnetism and producing extraordinary and unexplained effects  robert and jock were inclined to ascribe to some of these arts the captivation of so clever a person as their sister by one whom they both viewed with repulsion as a mere adventurer  they had not the clue which their mother had to the history of the matter when the next day though still far from well she had an interview with her daughter and the athenian professor before their return to scotland  he knew of the magnum bonum matter  it seemed that janet as her knowledge increased had become more sensible of the difficulties in the pursuit and being much attracted by his graces and ability had so put questions for her own enlightenment as to reveal to him that she possessed a secret  to cajole it from her so far as she knew it had been no greater difficulty than it was to the fox to get the cheese from the crow and while to him she was the errant unprotected young lady of large and tempting fortune he could easily make himself appear to her the missing link in the pursuit  he could do what as a woman she could not accomplish and what her brothers were not attempting  in that conviction nay even expecting her mother to be satisfied with his charms and his qualifications she claimed that he might at least read the ms of the book assuring her mother that all she had intended the night before was to copy out the essentials for him  to take the spirit and leave me the letter said caroline  o janet would not that have been worse than carrying off the book  well mother i maintain that i have a right to it said janet and that there is no justice in withholding it  do you or your husband fulfil these conditions janet and caroline read from the white slate those words about the one to whom the pursuit was intrusted being a sound religious man who would not seek it for his own advancement but for the good of others  janet exultantly said that was just what demetrius would do  as to the being a sound religious man her mother might seek in vain for a man of real ability who held those oldfashioned notions  they were very well in her fathers time but what would bobus say to them  she evidently thought demetrius would triumph in his private interview with her mother but if caroline had had any doubt before that would have removed it  janet honestly had a certain enthusiasm for science beneficence and the honour of the family but the professor besieged mrs brownlow with his entreaties and promises just as if—she said to herself—she had been the widow of some quack doctor for whose secret he was bidding  if she would only grant it to him and continue her allowance to janet while he was pursuing it then there would be no limit to the share he would give her when the returns came in  it was exceedingly hard to answer without absolutely insulting him but she entrenched herself in the declaration that her husbands conditions required a full diploma and degree and that till all her sons were grown up she had been forbidden to dispose of it otherwise  very thankful she was that armine was not seventeen when a whole portfolio of testimonials in all sorts of languages were unfolded before her  whatever she had ever said of ellens insular prejudices she felt that she herself might deserve for she viewed them all as utterly worthless compared with an honest english or scottish degree  at any rate she could not judge of their value and they did not fulfil her conditions she made him understand at last that she was absolutely impractic able and that the only distant hope she would allow to be wrung from her by his coaxing wheedling tones soft as the honey of hybla was that if none of her sons or nephews were in the way of fulfilling the conditions and he could bring her satisfactory english certificates she might consider the matter but she made no promises  then he most politely represented the need of a maintenance while he was thus qualifying himself  janet had evidently not told him about the will and caroline only said that from a recent discovery she thought her own tenure of the property very insecure and she could undertake nothing for the future  she would let him know  however she gave him a cheque for 100 pounds for the present knowing that she could make it up from the money of her own which she had been accumulating for elviras portion  then janet came in to take leave  mr hermann described what the excellent and gracious lady had granted to him and he made it sound so well and his wife seemed so confident and triumphant that her mother feared she had allowed more to be inferred than she intended and tried to explain that all depended on the fulfilment of the conditions of which janet at least was perfectly aware  she was overwhelmed however with his gratitude and janets assurances and they went away leaving her with a hand much kissed by him and the fondest most lingering embrace she had ever had from janet  then she was free to lie still abandoned to fears for her daughters future and repentance for her own careless past and above all crushed by the ache that would let her really feel little but pain and oppression     chapter xxviii  the turn of the wheel    is there for honest poverty   that hangs his head and a that the coward slave we pass him by   a mans a man for a that                           burns   thinking and acting were alike impossible to caroline for the remainder of the day when her daughter left her but night brought power of reflection as she began to look forward to the new day and its burthen  her headache was better but she let barbara again go down to breakfast without her feeling that she could not face her sons at once and that she needed another study of the document before she could trust herself with the communication  she felt herself too in need of time to pray for right judgment and steadfast purpose and that the change might so work with her sons that it might be a blessing not a curse  could it be for nothing that the finding of magnum bonum had wrought the undoing of this wrong  that thought and the impulse of selfbracing made her breakfast well on the dainty little meal sent up to her by the infanta and look so much refreshed that the damsel exclaimed—  you are much better mother  you will be able to see jock before he goes—  fetch them all babie i have something to tell you—  writs issued for a domestic parliament said allen presently entering  to vote for the grant to the princess royal on her marriage  do it handsomely i say the athenian is better than might be expected and will become prosperity better than adversity  being capable of taking others in besides janet said the opposition in the person of bobus  he seemed so well satisfied with the gracious lady housemother that i am afraid she has been making him too many promises  that was impossible  it was not about janet that i sent for you boys  it was to think what we are to do ourselves  you know i always thought there must be another will  look there  she laid it on the table and the young men stood gazing as if it were a venomous reptile which each hesitated to touch  is it legal bobus she presently asked  it looks—rather so— he said in an odd stunned voice  elvira by all thats lucky exclaimed jock  well done allen you are still the lady clare  not till she is of age said allen rather gloomily  pity you didnt marry her at algiers said jock  where did this come from said bobus who had been examining it intently  out of the old bureau  mother cried out barbara in a tone of horror which perhaps was a revelation to bobus for he exclaimed—  you dont mean that janet had had it and brought it out to threaten you  oh no no it was not so dreadful  she found it long ago but did not think it valid and only kept it out of sight because she thought it would make me unhappy  it is a pity she did not go a step further observed bobus  why did she produce it now  i found it  boys you must know the whole truth and consider how best to screen your sister  remember she was very young and fancied a thing on a common sheet of paper and shut up in an unfastened table drawer could not be of force and that she was doing no harm then she told of her loss and recovery of what she called some medical memoranda of their father which she knew janet wanted concluding—it will surely be enough to say i found it in his old bureau  that will hardly go down with wakefield said bobus but as i see he stands here as trustee for that wretched child as well as being yours there is no fear but that he will be conformable  shall i take it up and show it to him at once so that if by any happy chance this should turn out waste paper no one may get on the scent  your uncle  i was so amazed and stupefied yesterday that i dont know whether i told him and if i did i dont think he believed me  here he comes said barbara as the wheels of his dogcart were heard below the window  ask him to come up  it will be a terrible blow to him  this place has been as much to him as to any of us if not more  mother how brave you are cried jock  i have known it longer than you have my dear  besides the mere loss is nothing compared with that which led to it  the worst of it is the overthrow of all your prospects my dear fellow  oh said jock brightly it only means that we have something and somebody to work for now and he threw his arms round her waist and kissed her  oh my dear dear boy dont  dont upset me or your uncle will think it is about this  and dont for heavens sake talk as if it were all up with us cried bobus  by this time the colonels ponderous tread was near and caroline met him with an apology for giving him the trouble of the ascent but said that she had wanted to see him in private  is this in private asked the colonel looking at the five young people  yes  they have a right to know all  here it is robert  he sat down deliberately put on his spectacles took the will read it once and groaned read it twice and groaned more deeply and then said—  my poor dear sister  this is a bad business a severe reverse a very severe reverse  he has hit on his catchword thought caroline and jocks arm still round her gave a little pressure as if the thought had occurred to him  the moment of amusement gave a cheerfulness to her voice as she said—  we have been doing sad injustice all this time that is the worst of it  for the rest we shall be no worse off than we were before  it will be in allens power to make up to you a good deal  that is a fortunate arrangement but i am afraid it cannot take place till the girl is of age  you are all in such haste said bobus  it would take a good deal to make me accept such an informal scrap as this  no doubt one could drive a coach and horses through it  that would not lessen the injustice said his mother  could there not be a compromise said allen  that is nonsense said his uncle  either this will stand or that and i am afraid this is the later  april 18th  was that the time of that absurd practical joke of yours  too true said allen  you recollect the old brute said i should remember it  witnesses—  theres gomez the servant who was drowned on his way out after his dismissal—elizabeth brook—is it—servant —who is to find her out  richards may know  it is not our business to hunt up the witnesses  thats the look out of the other party said bobus impatiently  you dont suppose i mean to contest it said his mother  it is bad enough to go on as we have been doing these eight years  i only want to know what is right and truth and if this be a real will  where did it come from asked the colonel coming to the critical question  did you say you found it yourself caroline  yes  where  in the old bureau  what the one that stood in his study  you dont say so  i saw wakefield turn the whole thing out and look for any secret drawer before i would take any steps i could have sworn that not the thickness of that sheet of paper escaped us  i should like if only out of curiosity to see where it was  just as i said mother said bobus theres no use in trying to blink it to any one who knows the circumstances  you do not insinuate that there was any foul play said his uncle hotly  i dont know what else it can be called said caroline faintly but please robert and all the rest dont expose her  poor janet found the thing in the back of the bedside tabledrawer fancied it a mere rough draft and childlike put it out of sight in the bureau where i lighted on it in looking for something else  surely there is no need to mention her  not if you do not contest the will replied the colonel who looked thunderstruck but if you did it must all come out to exonerate us the executors from shameful carelessness  well we shall see what wakefield says  a severe reverse a very severe reverse  when he found that bobus meant to go in search of the lawyer that afternoon he decided on accompanying him  and with a truly amazing burst of intuition he even suggested carrying off elvira to spend the day with essie and ellie and even that an invitation might arise to stay all night or as long as the first suspense lasted  then muttering to himself a severe reverse—a most severe reverse he took his leave  caroline went down stairs with him as thinking she could the most naturally administer the invitation to elvira and the two eldest sons proceeded to make arrangements for the time of meeting and the journey  a severe reverse said jock finding himself alone with the younger ones  when one has a bitter draught it is at least a consolation to have labelled it right  shall we be very poor jock asked barbara  i dont know what we were called before he said but from what i remember i fancy we had about what i have been using for my private delectation  just enough for my mother and you to be jolly upon  thats all you think of said armine  all that a man need think of said jock as long as mother and babie are comfortable we can do for ourselves very well  ourselves said armine bitterly  and how about this wretched place that we have neglected shamefully all these years  armine cried jock indignantly  why you are talking of mother  mother says so herself  you went on raging about it and just like her she did not defend herself  i am sure she has given away loads of money  but see what is wanting  the curate and the school chapel and the cottages and if the school is not enlarged they will have a school board  and what am i to say to miss parsons  i promised to bring mothers answer about the curate this afternoon at latest  if she has the sense of a wren she must know that a cataclysm like janets may account for a few trifling omissions  thats true said babie  she cant expect it  do you know i am rather sorry we are not poorer  i hoped we should have to live in a very small way and that i should have to work like you—for mother  not like us for pitys sake infanta cried jock  we have had enough of that  the great use of you is to look after mother and keep her from galloping the life out of herself and this chap from worrying it out of her  jock cried armine indignantly  yes you will if you go on moaning about these fads and making her blame herself for them  i dont say we have all done the right thing with this money im sure i have not and most likely it serves us right to lose it but to have mother teased about what after all was chiefly owing to her absence is more than i will stand  the one duty in hand is to make the best of it for her  i shall run down again as soon as i hear how this is likely to turn out—for sunday perhaps  keep up a good heart babie bunting and whatever you do dont let him worry mother  goodbye armie  whats the use of being good if you cant hold up against a thing like this  jock doesnt know said armine as the door closed  fads indeed  jock didnt mean that pleaded babie  you know he did not dear good jock he could not  jock is a good fellow but he lives a frivolous selfindulgent life and has got infected with the spirit and the language said armine or he would understand that myself or my own loss is the very last thing i am troubled about  no indeed i should never think of that  it is the ruin of these poor people and all i meant to have done for them  it is very strange that we should only be allowed to waken to a sense of our opportunities to have them taken away from us  no one would have expected armine always regarded as the most religious of the family to be the most dismayed and neither he nor barbara could detect how much of the spoilt child lay at the bottom of his regrets but his little sisters sympathy enabled him to keep from troubling his mother with his lamentations  indeed allen was usually in presence and nobody ever ventured on what might bore allen  he was in good spirits believing that the discovery would put an end to all trifling on elviras part and that he and she would thus together be able to act the beneficent genii of the whole family  even their mother had a sense of relief  she was very quiet and moved about softly like one severely shaken and bruised but there was a calm in knowing the worst instead of living in continual vague suspicion  the colonel returned with tidings that mr wakefield had no doubt of the validity of the will though it might be possible to contest it if elizabeth brook the witness could not be found but that would involve an investigation as to the manner of the loss and the discovery  it was in truth only a matter of time and on monday mr wakefield would come down and begin to take steps  that was the day on which the family were to have gone to london but carolines heart failed her and she was much relieved when a kind letter arrived from mrs evelyn who was sure she could not wish to go into society immediately after janets affair and offered to receive elvira for as long as might be convenient and herself—as indeed had been already arranged—to present her at court with sydney  it was a great comfort to place her in such hands during the present crisis all the more that ellen was not at all delighted with her company for essie and ellie  she rushed home on saturday evening to secure delrio and superintend her packing up with her head a great deal too full of court dresses and ball dresses fancy costumes and parisian hats to detect any of the tokens of a coming revolution even in her own favour  jock too came home that same evening as gay and merry apparently as ever and after dinner claimed his mother for a turn in the garden  has drake written to you mother he asked  i met him the other day at mrs lucass and it seems his soul is expanding  he wants to give up the old house—you know the lease is nearly out—and to hang out in a more fashionable quarter  dear old house  now mother heres my notion  why should not we hide our diminished heads there  you could keep house while the monk and i go through the lectures and hospitals and kings college might not be too far off for armine  you jock my dear  you see it is a raving impossibility for me to stay where i am  i am afraid so but you might exchange into the line  there would be no great good in that  i should have stuck to the guards because there i am and i have no opinion of fellows changing about for nothing—and because of evelyn and some capital fellows besides  but i found out long ago that it had been a stupid thing to go in for  when one has mastered the routine it is awfully monotonous and one has nothing to do with ones time or ones brains  i have felt many a time that i could keep straight better if i had something tougher to do  tell me just to satisfy my mind my dear you have no debts  i dont owe forty pounds in the world mother and i shall not owe that when i can get my tailor to send in his bill  you have given me as jolly an allowance as any man in the corps and ive always paid my way  ive got no end of things about my rooms and my horses and cab but they will turn into money  you see having done the thing first figure i should hate to begin in the cheap and nasty style and i had much rather come home to you mother carey  im not too old you know—not oneandtwenty till august  i shall not come primed like the monk but ill try to grind up to him if youll let me mother  oh jock dear jock she cried you little know the strength and life it gives me to have you taking it so like a young hero  i tell you im sick of drill and parade said jock and heartily glad of an excuse to turn to something where one can stretch ones wits without being thought a disgrace to humanity  now dont you think we might be very jolly together  oh to think of being there again  and we can have the dear old furniture and make it like home  it is the first definite notion any one has had  my dear you have given me something to look forward to  you cant guess what good you have done me  it is just as if you had shown me light at the end of the thicket ay and made yourself the good stout staff to lead me through  mother thats the best thing that ever was said to me yet worth ever so much more than all old barness moneybags  if the others will approve  but any way it is a nest egg for my own selfish pleasure to carry me through  why jock to have your name on the old door would be bringing back the golden age  nobody but jock knew what made this such a cheerful sunday with his mother  she was even heard making fun and declaring that no one knew what a relief it would be not to have to take drives when all the roads were beset with traction engines  she had so far helped armine out of the difficulties his lavish assurances had brought him into that she had written a note to the vicar mr parsons telling him that she should be better able to reply in a little while but armine knowing that he must not speak and afraid of betraying the cause of his unhappiness and of the delay was afraid to stir out of reach of the others lest miss parsons should begin an inquiry  the vicar of woodside was in fact as some people mischievously called her the reverend petronella parsons  whether she wrote her brothers sermons was a disputed question  she certainly did other things in his name which she had better have let alone  he was three or four years her junior and had always so entirely followed her lead that he seemed to have no personal identity but to be only her male complement  that armine should have set up a lady of this calibre for the first goddess of his fancy was one of the comical chances of life but she was a fine handsome freshlooking woman of fiveandthirty with a strong vein of sentiment—ecclesiastical and poetic—just ignorant enough to gush freely and too genuine to be always offensive  she had been infinitely struck with armine had hung a perfect romance of renovation on him sympathised with his every word and lavished on him what perhaps was not quite flattery because she was entirely in earnest but which was therefore all the worse for him  barbara had a natural repulsion from her and could not understand armines being attracted and for the first time in their lives this was creating a little difference between the brother and sister babie had said in rather an uncalledfor way that miss parsons would draw back when she knew the truth and armine had been deeply offended at such an ungenerous hint and had reduced her to a tearful declaration that she was very sorry she had said anything so uncalled for  petronella herself had been much vexed at armines three days defection which was ascribed to the worldly and antiecclesiastical influences of the rest of the family  she wanted her brother to preach a sermon about lots wife but jemmie as she called him had on certain occasions a passive force of his own and she could not prevail  she regretted it the less when armine and babie duly did the work they had undertaken in the sundayschool though they would not come in for any intermediate meals  what did mrs brownlow tell you in her note she asked of her brother while giving him his tea before the last service  that in a few days she shall be able to answer me  ah well  do you know there is a belief in the parish that something has happened—that a claim is to be set up to the whole property and that the whole family will be reduced to beggary  i never heard of an estate to which there was not some claimant in obscurity  but this comes from undoubted authority  mr parsons smiled a little  one cant help it if servants will hear things  well any way it will be overruled for good to that dear boy—though it would be a cruel stroke on the parish  it was the twilight of a late spring evening when the congregation streamed out of church and elvira who had managed hitherto to avoid all intercourse with the river hollow party found herself grappled by lisette without hope of rescue  my dear this is a pleasure at last i have so much to say to you  cant you give us a day  i am going to town tomorrow said elvira never gracious to any gould  tomorrow  i heard the family had put off their migration  i go with lucas  i am to stay with mrs evelyn lord fordhams mother you know who is to present me at the drawingroom said elvira magnificently  oh if i could only see you in your court dress it would be memorable cried mrs gould  a little longer my dear our paths lie together  i must get home  my packing—  and may i ask what you wear my dear  is your dress ordered  o yes i had it made at paris  it is white satin with lilies—a kind of lily one gets in algiers  and she expatiated on the fashion till mrs gould said—  well my love i hope you will enjoy yourself at the honourable mrs evelyns  what is the address in case i should have occasion to write  i shall have no time for doing commissions  that was not my meaning was the gentle answer only if there be anything you ought to be informed of—  they would write to me from home  why what do you mean asked the girl her attention gained at last  did it never strike you why you are sent up alone  only that mrs brownlow is so cut up about janet  ah youth is so sweetly unconscious  it is well that there are those who are bound to watch for your interests my dear  i cant think what you mean  i will not disturb your happy innocence my love  it is enough for your uncle and me to be awake to counteract any machinations  ah i see your astonishment  you are so simple my dear child and you have been studiously kept in the dark  i cant think what you are driving at said elvira impatiently mrs brownlow would never let any harm happen to me nor allen either  do let me go  one moment my darling  i must love you through all and you will know your true friends one day  are you—let me ask the question out of my deep almost maternal solicitude—are you engaged to mr brownlow  of course i am  of course as you say  most ingenuous  ah well may it not be too late  dont be so horrid lisette  allen is not half a bad fellow and frightfully in love with me  exactly my dear unsuspicious dove  there i see you are impatient you will know the truth soon enough  one kiss for your mothers sake  but elvira broke from her and rejoined allen  i have sounded the child said lisette to her husband that evening and she is quite in the dark though the very servants in the house are better informed  better informed than the fact may be said mr gould for a man always scouts a womans gossip  no indeed  poor dear child she is blinded purposely  she never guessed why she was sent to kencroft while the old colonel was called in and they all agreed that the will should be kept back till the wedding with mr allen should be over and he could make up the rest so now the child is to be sent to town and surrounded with mrs brownlows creatures to prey upon her innocence  but you have no care for your own niece—none     chapter xxix  friends and unfriends                          ay and i think one business doth command us all for mine is money                        timon of athens   before the door of one of the supremely respectable and aristocratic but somewhat gloomylooking houses in cavendish square whose mauve plateglass windows and linkextinguishers are like fossils of a past era of civilisation three riding horses were being walked up and down two with sidesaddles and one for a gentleman  they were taken aside as a fourwheel drove up while a female voice exclaimed—  ah we are just it time  cards and a note were sent in with a request to see miss menella  word came back that miss menella was just going out riding but on the return of a message that the visitors came from mrs brownlow on important business they were taken upstairs to an anteroom  they were three—mr wakefield and mr gould and to the great discontentment of the former mrs gould likewise  fain would he have shaken her off but as she truly said who could deprive her of her rights as kinswoman and wife to the young ladys guardian  after they had waited a few moments in the somewhat dingy surroundings of a house seldom used by its proper owners elvira entered in plumed hat and habit a slender and exquisite little figure but with a haughty twitch in her slim waist superb indifference in the air of her little head and a grasp of her coral handled whip as if it were a defensive weapon when lisette flew up to offer an embrace with—  joy joy my dear child  remember i was the first to give you a hint  good morning said elvira with a little bend of her head presenting to each the shapely tip of a gauntleted hand but ignoring her uncle and aunt as far as was possible  is there anything that need detain me mr wakefield  i am just going out with miss evelyn and lord fordham and i cannot keep them waiting  ah it is you that will have to be waited for now my sweet one began mrs gould  here is a note from mrs brownlow said mr wakefield holding it to elvira who looked like anything but a sweet one  i imagine it is to prepare you for the important disclosure i have to make  a hot colour mounted in the fair cheek  elvira tore open the letter and read—   my dear child—i can only ask your pardon for the unconscious wrong which i have so long been doing to you and which shall be repaired as soon as the processes of the law render it possible for us to change places                                    your ever loving                                          mother carey   what does it all mean cried the bewildered girl  it means said the lawyer that mrs brownlow has discovered a will of the late mr barnes more recent than that under which she inherited naming you miss elvira menella as the sole inheritrix  my dear child let me be the first to congratulate you on your recovery of your rights said mrs gould again proffering an embrace but again the whip was interposed while elvira with her eyes fixed on mr wakefield asked what so that he had to repeat the explanation  then does it all belong to me she asked  eventually it will miss menella  you are sole heiress to your great uncle though you cannot enter into possession till certain needful forms of law are gone through  mrs brownlow offers no obstruction but they cannot be rapid  all mine repeated elvira with childish exultation  what fun i must go and tell sydney evelyn  a few minutes more miss menella said mr wakefield  you ought to hear the terms of the will  and he read it to her  i thought you told me it was to be mine  this is all you and uncle george  as your trustees  oh to manage as the colonel does  you will give me all the money i ask you for  i want some pearls and i must have that duck of a little arab  uncle george how soon can i have it  we must go through the probate court he began but his wife interrupted—  ways and means will be forthcoming my dear though for my part i think it would be much better taste in mrs brownlow to put you in possession at once  mr wakefield explained my dear said her husband that much as mrs brownlow wishes to do so she cannot she has no power  it is her trustees  oh yes i know every excuse will be found for retaining the property as long as possible said the lady  then i shall have to wait ever so long said the young lady  and i do so want the arab  it is a real love and allen would say so  i have another letter for you said mr wakefield on hearing that name  we will leave it with you  if you wish for further information i would call immediately on receiving a line at my office  just then a message was brought from mrs evelyn inviting miss menellas friends to stay to luncheon  it incited elvira who knew neither awe nor manners to run across the great drawingroom leaving the doors open behind her to the little morningroom where sat mrs evelyn with sydney in her habit standing by the mantelpiece  oh mrs evelyn elvira began it is mr wakefield and my uncle and his wife  they have come to say it is all mine uncle barnes left it all to me  so i hear from mrs brownlow said mrs evelyn gravely  oh elfie i am so sorry for you  dont you hate it cried sydney  oh but it is such fun  i can do everything i please said the heiress  yes thats the best part said sydney  i do envy you the day when you give it all back to allen  that reminded elvira to open the note and as she read it her great eyes grew round   sweetest and dearest—how i have always loved and always shall love you you know full well  but these altered circumstances bring about what you have so often playfully wished  say the word and you are free no longer bound to me by anything that has passed between us though the very fibres of my heart and life are as much as ever entwined about you  honour bids my dissolution of our engagement and i await your answer though nothing can ever make me other than                                    your wholly devoted                                                    allen   mrs evelyn had been prepared by a letter from her friend for what was now taking place mr wakefield had likewise known the main purport of allens note and had allowed that mr brownlow could not as a gentleman do otherwise than release the young lady though he fully believed that it would be only as a matter of form and that elvira would not hear of breaking off  he had in fact spent much eloquence in persuading mrs brownlow to continue to take the charge of the heiress during the three years before her majority  begun in generous affection by allen long ago the engagement seemed to the lawyer as well as to others an almost providential means of at least partial restitution  he had meant elvira to read her letter alone but she had opened it before the two ladies and her first exclamation was a startled incredulous—  ha  whats this  he says our engagement is dissolved  he is of course bound to set you free my dear said mrs evelyn but it only depends on yourself  oh and i shall tease him well first cried elvira her face lighting up with fun and mischief  he was so tiresome and did bother so  now i shall have my swing  oh what fun  i wont let him worry me again just yet i can tell him  you dont seem to consider began sydney—but mrs gould took this moment for advancing  from the whole length of the large drawingroom the trio had been spectators not quite auditors though perhaps enough to perceive what line the evelyns were taking  so mrs gould advanced into the drawingroom mrs evelyn came forward to assume the duties of hostess and sydney turned and ran away so precipitately that she shut the door on the trailing skirt of her habit and had to open it again to release herself  mr wakefield hoped the young ladies would pardon him for having spoilt their ride and elvira was going off to change her dress when to his dismay mrs evelyn desired her to take her aunt to her room to prepare for luncheon  he had seen enough of mrs gould to know that this was a most unlucky measure of courtesy on good simple mrs evelyns part but of course he could do nothing to prevent it and had to remain with mr gould both speaking in the strongest manner of mrs brownlows uprightness and bravery in meeting this sudden change  mr wakefield said he hoped to prevail on her to retain the charge of the young lady for the present and mr gould assented that she could not be in better hands  then mrs evelyn by way of doing anything for her friend undertook to make elvira welcome as long as it might be convenient and was warmly thanked she further ascertained that the missing witness had been traced and that the most probable course of action would be that there would be an amicable suit in the probate court and then another of ejectment until these were over things would remain in their present state for how many weeks or months would depend upon the law courts since mrs brownlows trustees would be legally holders of the property until the decision was given against them and miss menella would be as entirely dependent on her bounty as she had been all these years meanwhile as mrs brownlow had no inclination to come to london and exhibit herself as a disinherited heroine mr wakefield and the colonel strongly advised her remaining on at belforest  all this mrs evelyn had been anxious to understand and thus was more glad of the delay of elvira and her aunt upstairs than she would have been if she could ever have guessed what work a designing flattering tongue could make with a vain frivolous selfish brain with the same essential strain of vulgarity and worldliness  still elvira was chiefly shallow and selfish and all her affection and confidence naturally belonged to her home of the last eight years  she was bewildered perhaps a little intoxicated at the sense of riches but was really quite ready to lean as much as ever upon her natural friends and protectors  however lisettes congratulations and exultation rang pleasantly upon her ear and she listened and talked freely asking questions and rejoicing  now mrs gould to do her justice measured others by herself and really and truly believed that only accident had disconcerted a plan for concealing the will till elvira should have been safely married to allen brownlow and that thus it was the fixed purpose of the family to keep her and her fortune in their hands a purpose which every instinct bade mrs lisette gould to traverse and overthrow if only because she hated such artfulness and meanness  unfortunately too as she had been a governess and her father had been a union doctor she could put herself forward as something above a farmers wife indeed quite as good as mrs brownlow  all mrs evelyns civility had not redeemed her from the imputation of being high and elvira was quite ready to call hers a very dull house  in truth there was only moderate gaiety and no fastness the ruling interests were religious and political questions as befitted fordhams maiden session the society was quietly highbred and intelligent and there was much attention to health for strong as sydney was her mother would have dreaded the full whirl of the season as much for her body as for her mind  at all this the frivolous idle little soul chafed and fretted aware that the circle was not a fashionable one eager for far more diversion and less restraint and longing to join the party in hyde corner where she could always make allen do what she pleased  with the obtuseness of an unobservant selfoccupied mind she was taken by surprise when mrs gould said that mrs brownlow was not coming to town adding it would be very unbecoming in her though of course she will hold on at belforest as long as there is any quibble of the law  oh i dont want to lose the season she promised me  then mrs gould made a great stroke  my dear you could not return to her  not when the young man has just broken with you  you would have more proper pride  poor allen said elvira  if he would only let me alone to have my fun like other girls  you see he could not afford to let you gratify your youthful spirits  too much was at stake and it is most providential that things had gone no further and that your own good sense has preserved you to adorn a much higher sphere  allen could be made something said elvira i know for he told me he could get himself made a baronet  he always does as i tell him will they be very poor lisette  oh no my dear generous child mrs brownlow was quite as well provided for as she had any right to expect  you need have no anxieties on that score  to elvira the change from river hollow to the pagoda had been from rustic to gentle life and thus this reply sounded plausible enough to silence a not much awakened compassion but she still said why cant i go home  ive nowhere else to go  i could not stay at the farm she added in her usual uncomplimentary style  no my dear i should not think of it  an establishment must be formed but in the meantime it would be quite beneath you to return to mrs brownlow again to become the prey of underground machinations  besides how awkward it would be while the lawsuits are going on  impossible  no my dear you must only return to belforest in a triumphal procession  surely there must be a competition for my lovely child among more congenial friends  well said elvira there were the folliots  we met them at nice and lady flora did ask me the other day but mrs brownlow does not like them and allen says they are not good form  ah  i knew you could not want for friends  you are not bound by those who want to keep you to themselves for reasons of their own  thus before elvira brought her aunt down stairs enough had been done to make her eager to be with one who would discuss her future splendour rather than deplore the change to her benefactor and thus she readily accepted a proposal she would naturally have scouted to go out driving with mrs gould  she came back in a mood of exulting folly and being far too shallow and loquacious to conceal anything she related in full all mrs goulds insinuations which to do her justice the poor child did not really understand  but sydney did and was furious at the ingratitude which could seem almost flattered mrs evelyn found the two girls in a state of hot reproach and recrimination and cut the matter short by treating them as if they were little children and ordering them both off to their rooms to dress for dinner  elvira went away sobbing and saying that nobody cared for her everybody was wrapped up in the brownlows who had been enjoying what was hers ever so long  and sydney presently burst into her mothers room to pour out her disgust and indignation against the heartless ungrateful intolerable—  only foolish my dear and left all day in the hands of a flattering designing woman  to let such things be said  mamma did you hear—  i had rather not hear sydney and i desire you will not repeat them to any one  be careful if you talk to jock tonight  to repeat words spoken in her present mood might do exceeding mischief  she speaks as if she meant to cast them all off—allen and all  very possibly she may see things differently when she wakes to morrow  but sydney while she is here the whole subject must be avoided  it would not be acting fairly to use any influence in favour of our friends  dont you mean to speak to her mamma  if she consults me of course i shall tell her what i think of the matter but i shall not force my advice on her or give these goulds occasion to say that i am playing into mrs brownlows hands  they were going to an evening party and lucas and cecil came to dinner to go with them  cecil looked grave and gloomy but jock rattled away so merrily that sydney began to wonder whether all this were a dream or whether he were still unaware of the impending misfortune  but jock only waited for the friendly cover of a grand piece of instrumental music to ask mrs evelyn if she had heard from his mother and she was very glad to go into details with him while he was infinitely relieved that the silence was over and he could discuss the matter with his friends  tell me truly jock will she be comfortably off  very fairly  yes indeed  my fathers savings were absolutely left to her and have been accumulating all this time and they will be a very fair maintenance for her and babie  there is no danger of her having to pay the mesne profits  no certainly not as it stands  mr wakefield says that cannot happen  then the old house in bloomsbury where we were all born is our own and she likes the notion of returning thither  mrs evelyn after all you and sir james have done for me what should you think of my giving it up and taking to the pestle and mortar  my dear lucas  then after a moments reflection i suppose it would be folly to think of going on as you are  raving insanity said jock and this notion really does seem to please my mother  is it not just intolerable to hear him said cecil who had made his way to them  what is bred in the bone— said jock  whats that  chopin sydney will you condescend to the apothecarys boy  as he led her to the dancingroom she asked you cant really mean this jock  cecil is breaking his heart about it  there are worse trades  but it is such a cruel pity  what  the execution i shall make he said lightly  for shame jock  but he went on teasing her because their hearts were so very full tis just the choice between various means of slaughter  dont she exclaimed  something can be done to prevent your throwing yourself away  why cant you exchange  it is too late to get into any corps where i should not be an expense to my mother said jock regretting his decision a good deal more when he found how she regarded it  well sacrifice is something sighed sydney  jock defied strange feelings by a laugh and the reply equal to the finest thing in the travellers joy and that was the knight who let the hyena eat up his hand that his lady might finish her rosary undisturbed  it is as bad—or as good—to let the hyena eat up your sword hand as to cut yourself off from all that is great and noble—all we used to think you would do  so spoke sydney evelyn in her girlish prejudice and the prospects that had recently seemed to lucas so fair and kindly suddenly clouded over and became dull gloomy and despicable  she felt as if she were saving him from becoming a deserter as she went on—  i am sure babie must be shocked  i dont know whether babie has heard  she has serious thoughts of coming out as a ladyhelp editing the travellers joy as a popular magazine giving lessons in greek or painting the crack picture in the royal academy  in fact she would rather prefer to have the whole family on her hands  it is all the spirit of selfsacrifice said sydney but oh lucas let it be any sacrifice but that of your sword  think how we should all feel if there was a great glorious war and you only a poor creature of a civilian instead of getting—as i know you would— lots of medals and victoria crosses and knighthood—real knighthood  oh jock think of that  when your mother thinks of that she cant want you to make any such mistaken sacrifice to her live on a crust if you like but dont—dont give up your sword  this is coming it strong muttered jock  i did not think anyone cared so much  of course i care  the words were swept off as they whirled together into the dance where the clasping hands and flying feet had in them a strange impulse half tenderness half exultation as each felt an importance to the other unknown before  childishness was not exactly left behind in it but a different stage was reached  sydney felt herself to have done a noble work and gloried in watching till her hero should have achieved greatness on a crust a day and jock was equally touched and elated at the intimation that his doings were so much to her  friendship sang the same note  cecil honest lad had never more than the average amount either of brains or industry and despised medicines to the full as much as did his sister  abhorring equally the toil and the degradation he deemed it a duty to prevent such a fall and put his hope in his uncle  nay if his mother had not assured him that it was too late he would have gone off at once to seek sir james at his club  lord fordham had been in bed long before the others returned but in the morning a twisted note was handed to his mother briefly saying he was running down to see how it was with them at belforest  when a station fly was seen drawing to the door allen who was drearily leaning over the stone wall of the terrace much disorganised by having received no answer to his letter instantly jumped to the conclusion that elvira had come home sprang to the door and when he only saw the tall figure emerge he concluded that something dreadful had happened grasped fordhams hand and demanded what it was  it fell flat that she had last been seen fulldressed going off to a party  then if theres nothing what brought you here  i mean said poor allen catching up his courtesy im afraid theres nothing you or any one else can do  can i see your mother  allen turned him into the library and went off to find his mother and instruct her to discover from that stupid fellow how elvira was feeling it  when after putting away the papers she was trying to arrange caroline went downstairs she had no sooner opened the door than barbara flew up to her crying out—  oh mother tell him not  tell him what my dear as the girl hung on her and dragged her into the anteroom  what is the matter  if it is nonsense he ought not to have made it so like earnest said babie all crimson but quite gravely  you dont mean—  yes mother  how could he cried caroline in her first annoyance at such things beginning with her babie  youll tell him mother  youll not let him do it again  let me go my child  i must speak to him and find out what it all means  within the library she was met by fordham  have i done very wrong mrs brownlow  i could not help it  i wish you had not  i always meant to wait till she was older and i grew stronger but when all this came i thought if we all belonged to one another it might be a help—  very very kind but—  i know i was sudden and frightened her he continued but if she could—  you forget how young she is  no i dont  i would not take her from you  we could all go on together  all one family  oh you unpractised boy  have we not done so many winters  but i would wait i meant to have waited only i am afraid of dying without being able to provide for her  if she would have me she would be left better off than my mother and then it would be all right for you and armie  what are you smiling at  at your notions of rightness my dear kind duke  i see how you mean it but it will not do  even if she had grown to care for you it would not be right for me to give her to you for years to come  may not i hope till then  she could not tell how sorry she should be to see in her little daughter any dawnings of an affection which would be a virtual condemnation to such a life as his mothers had been  you dont guess how i love her  she has been the bright light of my life ever since the engelberg—the one hope i have lived for  my poor duke  then do you quite mean to deny me all hope  hope must be according to your own impressions my dear fordham of course if you are well and still wishing it four or five years hence it would be free to you to try again  more i cannot say no dont thank me for i trust to your honour to make no demonstrations in the meantime and not to consider yourself as bound  it was a relief that armine here came in attracted by a report of his friends arrival and mrs brownlow went in search of her daughter to whom she was guided by a sonata played with very unnecessary violence  you need not murder haydn any more you little barbarian she said with a hand on the childs shoulder and looking anxiously into the gloomy face  i have settled him  babie drew a long breath and said—  im glad  it was so horrid  youll not let him do it any more  then you decidedly would not like it returned her mother  like it  poor duke  mother  as if i could ever  a man that cant sit in a draught or get wet in his feet cried babie with the utmost scorn and reading reproof as well as amused pity in her mothers eyes she added of course i am very sorry for him but fancy being very sorry for ones love  i thought you liked wounded knights  wounded  yes but theyve done something and had glorious wounds now duke—he is very good and it is not his fault but his misfortune but he is such a—such a muff  thats enough my dear i am quite content that my infanta should wait for her hero  though she added almost to herself she is too childish to know the true worth of what she condemns  she felt this the more when babie who had coaxed the housekeeper into letting her begin a private school of cookery started up crying—  i must go and see my orange biscuits taken out of the oven  i should like to send a taste to sydney  yes barbara was childish for nearly sixteen and as it struck her mother at the moment rather wonderfully so considering her cleverness and romance  it was better for her that the softening should not come yet but mother as she was carolines sympathies could not but be at the moment with the warmhearted impulsive generous young man moved out of all his habitual valetudinarian habits by his affection rather than with the lighthearted child who spurned the love she did not comprehend and despised his ill health  had the young generation no hearts  oh no—no—it could not be so with her loving barbara and she ought to be thankful for the saving of pain and perplexity  poor armine was not getting much comfort out of his friend who was too much preoccupied to attend to what he was saying and only mechanically assented at intervals to the proposition that it was an inscrutable dispensation that the will and the power should so seldom go together  he heard all armines fallen castles about chapels schools curates and sisters as in a dream really not knowing whether they were or were not to be  and with all his desire to be useful he never perceived the one offer that would have been really valuable namely to carry off the boy out of sight of the scene of his disappointment  fordham was compelled to stay for an uncomfortable luncheon when there were spasmodic jerks of talk about subjects of the day to keep up appearances before the servants who flitted about in such an exasperating way that their mistress secretly rejoiced to think how soon she should be rid of the fine courier butler  just as the ponycarriage came round for armine to drive his friend back to the station the colonel came in and was an astonished spectator of the farewells  so thats your young lord he said  poor lad if our nobility is made of no tougher stuff i would not give much for it  what brought him here  kindness—sympathy— said caroline a little awkwardly  much of that he showed said allen just knowing nothing at all about anybody  no  if it were not so utterly ridiculous i should think he had come to make an offer to babie and as his sister flew out of the room you dont mean that he has mother  pray dont speak of it to any one said caroline  i would not have it known for the world  it was a generous impulse poor dear fellow and babie has no feeling for him at all  very lucky said the uncle  he looks as if his life was not worth a years purchase  so you refused him  quite right too  you are a sensible woman caroline in the midst of this severe reverse     chapter xxx  as weel off as aye wagging    lesbia hath a beaming eye    but no one knows for whom it beameth  right and left its arrows fly    but what they aim at no one dreameth   by the advice or rather by the express desire of her trustees mrs brownlow remained at belforest while they accepted an offer of renting the london house for the season  mr wakefield declared that there was no reason that she should contract her expenditure but she felt as if everything she spent beyond her original income except of course the needful outlay on keeping up the house and gardens were robbery of elvira and she therefore did not fill up the establish ment of servants nor of horses using only for herself the little pair of ponies which had been turned out in the park  no one had perhaps realised the amount of worry that this arrangement entailed  as barbara said if they could have gone away at once and worked for their living like sensible people in a book it would have been all very well—but this halfandhalf state was dreadful personally it did not affect babie much but she was growing up to the part of general sympathiser and for the first time in their lives there was a pull in contrary directions by her mother and armine  every expenditure was weighed before it was granted  did it belong rightly to belforest estate or to caroline brownlow  and the claims of the church and parish at woodside were doubtful  armine under the influence of miss parsons took a wide view of the dues of the parish thought there was a long arrear to be paid off and that whatever could be given was so much out of the wolfs mouth  his mother with be just before you are generous ringing in her ears referred all to the colonel and he had long had a fixed scale of the duties of the property as a property and was only rendered the more resolute in it by that vehemence of armines which enhanced his dislike and distrust of the family at the vicarage  bent on getting all they could while they could he said quite unjustly as to the vicar and hardly fairly by the sister whose demands were far exceeded by those of her champion  the claims of the cottages for repair and of the school for sufficient enlargement and maintenance to obviate a school board were acknowledged but for the rest the colonel said his sister was perfectly at liberty  no one could blame her if she threw her balance at the bank into the sea  she would never be called to account but since she asked him whether the estate was bound to assist in pulling the church to pieces and setting up a fresh curate to bring in more absurdities he could only say what he thought etc  these thoughts of his were of course most offensive to armine who set all down to sordid puritan prejudice could not think how his mother could listen and when babie stood up for her mother went off to blend his lamentations with those of miss parsons whose resignation struck him as heroic  never mind armine it will all come in time  perhaps we are not fit for it yet  we cannot expect the worlds justice to understand the outpouring of the saints liberality  armine repeated this interesting aphorism to barbara and was much disappointed that the shrewd little woman did not understand it or only so far as to say but i did not know that it was saintly to be liberal with other peoples money  he said babie had a prejudice against miss parsons and he was so far right that the infanta did not like her thought her a humbug and sorely felt that for the first time something had come between herself and armine  allen was another trouble  he did not agree to the retrenchments in which he saw no sense and retained his horse and groom  luckily he had retained only one when going abroad and at this early season he needed no more  but his grievous anxiety and restlessness about elvira did not make him by any means insensible to the effects of a reduced establishment in a large house and especially to the handiwork of the good woman  who had been left in charge when compared with that of the 80l cooks who had been the plague of his mothers life  no one however could wonder at his wretchedness as day after day passed without hearing from elvira and all that was known was that she had left mrs evelyn and gone to stay with lady flora folliott a flighty young matron who had been enraptured with her beauty at a table dhote a year ago and had made advances not much relished by the rest of the party  no more was to be learnt till lucas found a saturday to come down before he could say three words he was crossexamined  had he seen elvira  several times  spoken to her  yes  what had she said  asked him to look at a horse  did she know he was coming home  yes  had she sent any message  well—yes  to desire that her algerine costume should be sent up whew as allen flung himself out of the room  how have i put my foot in it mother  you dont mean that that was all  every jot  what has she not written  the abominable little elf im coming  and he shrugged his shoulders as allen who had come round to the open window beckoned to him  he was absolutely grappled by a trembling hand and a husky voice demanded what message did she really send  i cant stand foolery  just that allen—to emma  really just that  you cant shake more out of me  you might as well expect anything from that chinese lantern  hold hard  tis not i—  dont speak  you dont know her  i was a fool to think she would confide to a mere buffoon cried poor allen in his misery  yet if they were intercepting her letters—  wherewith he buried himself in the depths of the shrubbery while jock with a long whistle came back through the library window to his mother observing—  intercepted  poor fellow  hardly necessary if possible though lady flora might wish to catch her for clanmacnalty  has the miserable imp really vouchsafed no notice of any of you  not the slightest and it is breaking allens heart  as if a painted little marmoset were worth a mans heart  but allen has always been infatuated about her and theres a good deal at stake though if he could only see it in the right fight he is well quit of such a bubble of a creature  i wouldnt be saddled with it for all belforest  dont call her any more names my dear  i only wish any one would represent to her the predicament she keeps allen in  he cant press for an answer of course but it is cruel to keep him in this suspense  i wonder mrs evelyn did not make her write  i dont suppose it entered her mind that the little wretch beg your pardon had not done it of her own accord and with those folliotts theres no chance  they live in a perpetual whirl enough to distract an archbishop  twentyfour parties a week at a moderate computation  unlucky child  wakefield is heartily vexed at her having run into such hands said jock but there is no hindering it no one has any power and even if he had george gould is a mere tool in his wifes hands  still mr wakefield might insist on her answering allen one way or the other  poor fellow  i dont think it would cost her much for she was too childish ever to be touched by that devotion of his  i always thought it a most dangerous experiment and all i wish for now is that she would send him a proper dismissal so that his mind might be settled  it would be bad enough but better than going on in this way  ill see him said jock or may be i can do the business myself for strange to say the creature doesnt avoid me but rather runs after me  you meet her in society  yes ive not come to the end of my white kids yet you see  and mother i came to tell you of something that has turned up  you know the evelyns are all dead against my selling out  i dined with sir james on tuesday and found next day it was for the sake of walking me out before sir philip cameron the cutteejung man you know  he is sure to be sent out again in the autumn and he has promised sir james that if i can get exchanged into some corps out there he will put me on his staff at once  mother  he stopped short astounded at the change of countenance that for a moment she could neither control nor conceal as she exclaimed india but rallying at once she went on sir philip cameron  my dear boy thats a great compliment  how delighted your uncle will be  but you mother  oh yes my dear i shall i will like it  of course i am glad and proud for my jock  how very kind of sir james  isnt it  he talked it over with me as if i had been cecil and said i was quite right not to stay in the guards and that in india if a man has any brains at all and reasonable luck he cant help getting on  so i shall be quite and clean off your hands and in the way of working forward and perhaps of doing something worth hearing of  mother you will be pleased then  shall i not my dear dear jockey  i dont think you could have a better chief  i have always heard that sir philip was such a good man  so mrs evelyn said  she was sure you would be satisfied  you cant think how kind they were making the affair quite their own said jock with a little colour in his face  they absolutely think it would be wrong to give up the service  yes mrs evelyn wrote to me that you ought not to be thrown away it was very kind and dear but with a little of the aristocratic notion that the army is the only profession in the world  i cant help it i cant think your fathers profession unworthy of his son  she didnt say so  no but i understood it  perhaps i am touchy i dont think i am ungrateful  they have always made you like one of themselves  yes so much that i dont like to run counter to their wishes when they have taken such pains  besides there are things that can be thought of even by a poor man as a soldier which cant in the other line  this speech made with bent head rising colour and hand playing with his mothers fan gave her all unwittingly on his part a keen sense that her jock was indeed passing from her but she said nothing to damp his spirits and threw herself heartily into his plans announcing them to his uncle with genuine exultation  to this the colonel fully responded telling jock that he would have given the world thirty years ago for such a chance and commending him for thus getting off his mothers hands  i only wish the rest of you were doing the same he said but each one seems to think himself the first person to be thought of and her the last  the colonels wish seemed in course of fulfilment for when lucas went a few days later to his brother roberts rooms he found him collecting testimonials for his fitness to act as viceprincipal to a european college at yokohama for the higher education of the japanese  mother has not heard of it said jock  she need not till it is settled answered bobus  it will save her trouble with her clerical friends if she only knows too late for a protest  jock understood when he saw the stipulations against religious teaching and recognised in the principals name an essayist whose negations of faith had made some stir  however he only said it will be rather a blow  there are limits to all things replied bobus  the truest kindness to her is to get afloat away from the family raft as speedily as possible  she has quite enough to drag her down  i should hope to act the other way said jock  get your own head above water first said bobus  heres some good advice gratis though ive no expectation of your taking it  dont go in for study in the old quarters  go to edinburgh or paris or anywhere you please but cut the connection or youll never be rid of loafers for life  wherever mother is all the rest will gravitate  mark me allen is spoilt for anything but a walking gentleman armine will never be good for work and how many years do you give janets athenian to come to grief in  then will they return to the domestic hearth with a band of small grecians while dr lucas brownlow is reduced to a rotifer or wheel animal circulating in a trap collecting supplies with sic vos non vobis for his motto  jock looked startled  how if there be no such rotifer he said you dont really think there will be nothing to depend when we are both gone  when  yes ive a chance of getting on camerons staff in india  oh thats all right old fellow  why youll be my next neighbour  but about mother  you dont seriously think ali and armie will be nothing but dead weights on her  only as long as theres anybody to hold them up said bobus perceiving that his picture had taken an effect the reverse of what he intended  they have no lack of brains and are quite able to shift for themselves and mother too if only they have to do it even if she were a pauper which she isnt  but it was with a less lightsome heart that jock went to his quarters to prepare for a fancy ball where he expected to meet elvira though whether he should approach her or not would depend on her own caprice  it was a very splendid affair  a whole back garden had been transformed into a vast pavilion containing an armidas garden whose masses of ferns and piles of gorgeous flowers made delightful nooks for strangers who left the glare of the dancingroom and the quaint dresses harmonised with the magic of the gaslight and the strange forms of the exotics  the simple scarlet of the young guardsman was undistinguished among the brilliant charactergroups which represented old fairy tales and nursery rhymes  there were the white cat and her prince pussin boots and the princess little snowflake and her bear and behold here was the loveliest fatima ever seen in the wellknown algerine dress mated with a richly robed and turbaned hero whose beard was blue though in ordinary life red inasmuch as he was lady floras impecunious and not very reputable scottish peer of a brother  that lady herself in a pronounced bloomer represented the little old woman of doubtful identity and her husband the pedlar whose name it was stout while not far off the spanish lady in garments gay as rich as may be wooed her big englishman in a dress that rivalled sir nicolas blounts  there was a pretty character quadrille and then a general melee in which jock danced successively with cinderella and the fair equestrian of banbury cross and lost sight of fatima till just as he was considering of offering himself to little bopeep he saw her looking a good deal bored by the spanish ladys englishman  tossing her head till the coins danced on her forehead she exclaimed oh theres my cousin i must speak to him and sprang to her old companion as if for protection  take me to a cool corner jock  she said i am suffocating  no wonder after waltzing with a mountain  he can no more waltz than fly  and he thinks himself irresistible he says his dress is from a portrait of his ancestor sir somebody and flora declares his only ancestor must have been the fat boy  and he thought i was a turkish sultana  wasnt it ridiculous  you know he never says anything but exactly  did he intone it so as to convey all this  he is a little inspired by his ruff and diamonds  flora says he wants to dazzle me and will have them changed into paste before he makes them over to his young woman  he has just tin enough to want more and she says i must be on my guard  you want no guard i should think but your engagement  what are you bringing that up for  i suppose you know how allen wrote to me she pouted  i know that he thought it due to you to release you from your promise and that he is waiting anxiously for your reply  have you written  dont bore so jock said elvira pettishly  it was no doing of mine and i dont see why i should be teased  then you wish me to tell him that he is to take your silence as a release from you  i authorise nothing she said  i hate it all  look here elvira said jock do you know your own mind  nobody wants you to take allen  in fact i think he is much better quit of you but it is due to him and still more to yourself to cancel the old affair before beginning a new one  who told you i was beginning a new one asked she pertly  no one can blame you provided you let him loose first  it is considered respectable you know to be off with the old love before you are on with the new  nay it may be only a superstition  superstition she repeated in an awed voice that gave him his cue and he went on—oh yes a lady has been even known to come and shake hands with the other party after he had been hanged to give back her troth lest he should haunt her  allen isnt hanged said elvira half frightened half cross  why doesnt he come himself  shall he  said jock  my dear child ive been running madly up and down for you cried lady flora suddenly descending on them and carrying off her charge with a cursory nod to the guardsman marking the difference between a detrimental and even the third son of a millionaire  he saw elvira no more that night and the next post carried a note to belforest                                                         31st may  dear allen—i dont know whether you will thank me but i tried to get a something definite out of your tricksy elf and the chief result so far as i can understand the elfish tongue is that she sought no change and the final sentence was why doesnt he come himself  i believe it is her honest wish to go on when she is left to her proper senses but that is seldom  you must take this for what it is worth from the buffoon                                                        j l b   allen came full of hope and called the next morning  miss menella was out riding  he got a card for a party where she was sure to be present and watched the door only to see her going away on the arm of lord clanmacnalty to some other entertainment  he went to mr folliotts door armed with a note and heard that lady flora and miss menella were gone out of town for a few days  so it went on and he turned upon jock with indignation at having been summoned to be thus deluded  the undignified position added venom to the smart of the disregarded affection and the suspense as to the future and jock had much to endure after every disappointment though allen clung to him rather than to any one else because of his impression that elviras real preference was unchanged such as it was and that these failures were rather due to her friend than to herself  this became more clear through mrs evelyn  her family had connections in common with the dowager lady clanmacnalty and the two ladies met at the house of their relation  listening in the way of duty to the old scottish countesss profuse communications she heard what explained a good deal  did she know the spanish girl who was with flora—a handsome creature and a great heiress  oh yes she had presented her  strange affair flora understood that there was a deep plot for appropriating the young lady and her fortune  she had been engaged to mr brownlow long before claims were known began mrs evelyn  oh yes  it was very ingeniously arranged only the discovery was made too soon  i have it on the best authority  when the girl came to stay with flora her aunt asked for an interview—such a nice sensible woman—so completely understanding her position  she said it was such a distress to her not to be qualified to take her niece into society yet she could not take her home living so near to be harassed by this young mans pursuit  i saw mrs gould myself said mrs evelyn  i cannot say i was favourably impressed  oh we all know she is not a lady never professes it poor thing she is quite aware that her niece must move in a different sphere and all she wants is to have her guarded from that young brownlow he follows them everywhere  it is quite the business of floras life to avoid him  perhaps you dont know that mrs brownlow took that girl out of a farmhouse and treated her like a daughter merely because they were second or third cousins  the engagement to allen brownlow was made when the fortune was entirely on his side  precaution or conscience eh said the old lady laughing  by the by you were intimate with mrs brownlow abroad  how fortunate for you that nothing took place while they had such expectations  of no family i hear of quite low extraction  a parish doctor he was wasnt he  a distinguished surgeon  and she came out of some asylum or foundling hospital  only the home for officers daughters said mrs evelyn not able to help laughing  her father captain allen was in the same regiment with colonel brownlow her husbands brother  i assure you the menellas and goulds have no reason to boast  a noble spanish family said the dowager  one can see it every gesture of the child  it was plain that the old lady intended mr barness hoards to repair the ravages of dissipation on the never very productive estates of clanmacnalty and that while elvira continued in lady floras custody there was little chance of a meeting between her and allen the girl seemed to be submitting passively and no doubt her new friends could employ tact and flattery enough to avoid exciting her perverseness  no doubt she had been harassed by allens exaction of response to his ardent affection and wearied of his monopoly of her maiden coyness and love of liberty might make her as willing to elude his approach as her friends could wish  once only at a garden party did he touch the tips of her fingers but no more  she never met his eye but threw herself into eager flirtation with the men he most disliked while the lovely carnation was mounting in her cheek and betraying unusual excitement  it became known that she was going early in july into the country with some gay people who were going to give a series of fetes on some public occasion and then that she was to go with lady clanmacnalty and her unmarried daughter to scotland to help them entertain the grouseshootparty  allens stay in london was clearly of no further use as jock perceived with a sensation of relief for all his pity could not hinder him from being bored with allens continual dejection and his sighs over each unsuccessful pursuit  he was heartily tired of the part of confidant which was the more severe because whenever allen had a fit of shame at his own undignified position he vented it in reproaches to jock for having called him up to london and yet as long as there was a chance of seeing elvira he could not tear himself away was wild to get invitations to meet her and lived at his club in the old style and expense  bobus was brief with allen and ironical on jocks folly in having given the summons  for his own part he was much engrossed with his appointment going backwards and forwards between oxford and london with little time for the concerns of any one else but the evening after this unfortunate garden party when jock had accompanied his eldest brother back to his rooms and was endeavouring by the help of a pipe to endure the reiteration of mournful vituperations of destiny in the shape of lady flora and mrs gould the door suddenly opened and bobus stood before them with his peculiarly brisk self satisfied air in itself an aggravation to any one out of spirits  all right he said i didnt expect to find you in but i thought i would leave a note for the chance  ive heard of the very identical thing to suit you ali my boy  indeed said allen not prepared with gratitude for his younger brothers patronage  i met bulstrode at balliol last night and he asked if i knew of any one a perfect gentleman he must be that matters more than scholarship who would take a tutorship in a hungarian counts family  two little boys who live like princes tutor the same salary anything you like to ask  it is somewhere in the mountains a feudal castle with capital sport  wolves and bears cried jock starting up with his old boyish animation  if i wasnt going pigsticking in india what wouldnt i give for such a chance  the tutor will teach the young ideas how to shoot of course  of course said bobus  the count is a diplomate and theres not a bad chance of making oneself useful and getting on in that line i should have jumped at it if i hadnt got the japs on my hands  yes you said allen languidly  well you can do quite as well for a thing like this said bobus or better as far as looking the gentleman goes  in fact i suspect as much classics as mother carey taught us at home would serve their countships turn  heres the address  you had better write by the first post tomorrow for one or two others are rising at it but bulstrode said he would wait to hear from you  heres the letter with all the details  thank you  you seem to take a good deal for granted said allen not moving a finger towards the letter  you wont have it  i have neither spirits nor inclination for turning bearleader and it is not a position i wish to undertake  what position would you like cried jock  you could take that rifle you got for algeria and make the magyars open their eyes seriously allen it is the right thing at the right time  you know miss ogilvie always said the position was quite different for an english person among these foreigners  who like natives are all the same nation quietly observed allen  for that matter said jock wasnt it in hungarie that the beggar of low degree married the kings daughter  theres precedent for you ali  allen had taken up the letter and after glancing it slightly over said—  thanks viceprincipal but i wont stand in the light of your other aspirants  what can you want better than this cried jock  by the time the law business is over one may look in vain for such a chance  it is a new country too and you always said you wanted to know how those fellows with longtailed names lived in private life  both brothers talked for an hour till they hoped they had persuaded him that even for the most miserable and disappointed being on earth the hungarian castle might prove an interesting variety and they left him at last with the letter before him undertaking to write and make further inquiries  the next day however just as jock was about to set forth intending as far as might be to keep him up to the point bobus made his appearance and scornfully held out an envelope  there was the letter and therewith these words—   on consideration i recur to my first conclusion that this situation is out of the question  to say nothing of the injury to my health and nerves from agitation and suspense rendering me totally unfit for drudgery and annoyance i cannot feel it right to place myself in a situation equivalent to the abandonment of all hope  it is absurd to act as if we were reduced to abject poverty and i will never place myself in the condition of a dependent  this season has so entirely knocked me up that i must at once have sea air and by the time you receive this i shall be on my way to ryde for a cruise in the petrel   his health cried bobus his tone implying three notes scarcely of admiration  well poor old turk he is rather seedy  said jock  cant sleep and has headaches  but tis a regular case of having put him to flight  well ive done with him said bobus since theres a popular prejudice against flogging especially ones elder brother  this is a delicate form of intimation that he intends doing the dolce at mothers expense  the poor old chap has been an ornamental appendage so long that he cant make up his mind to anything else said jock  he is no worse off than the rest of us said bobus  in age if in nothing else   the more reason against throwing away a chance  the yacht too  i thought there was a quixotic notion of not dipping into that elfs money  im sure poor mother is pinching herself enough  i dont think ali knows when he spends money more than when he spends air returned jock  the petrel can hardly cost as much in a month as i have seen him get through in a week protesting all the while that he was living on absolutely nothing   i know  you may be proud to get him down oxford street under thirty shillings and he never goes out in the evening much under half that  yes he told me selling my horses was shocking bad economy  well it was your own doing having him up here said bobus  i wonder how he will go on when the money is really not there  precisely the same said bobus theres no cure for that sort of complaint  the only satisfaction is that we shall be out of sight of it  and a very poor one sighed jock when mother is left to bear the brunt  mother can manage him much better than we can said bobus besides she is still a youngish woman neither helpless nor destitute and as i always tell you the greatest kindness we can do her is to look out for ourselves  bobus himself had done so effectually for he was secure of a handsome salary and his travelling expenses were to be paid when early in the next year he was to go out with his principal to confer on the japanese the highest possible culture in science and literature without any bias in favour of christianity buddhism or any other sublime religion  meantime he was going home to make his preparations and pack such portions of his museum as he thought would be unexampled in japan he had fulfilled his intention of only informing his mother after his application had been accepted and as it had been done by letter he had avoided the sight of the pain it gave her and the hearing of her remonstrances all of which he had referred to her maternal dislike of his absence rather than to his association with the principal a writer whose articles she kept out of reach of armine and barbara  the matter had become irrevocable and beyond discussion as he intended before his return to belforest which he only notified by the post of the morning before he walked into luncheon  by that time it was a fait accompli and there was nothing to be done but to enter on a lively discussion on the polite manners and customs of the two sworded nation and the wonderful volcanoes he hoped to explore  perhaps one reason that his notice was so short was that there might be the less time for kencroft to be put on its guard  thus when by accident of course he strolled towards the lodge he found his cousin esther in the wood with no guardians but the three youngest children who had coaxed her in spite of the heat to bring them to the slopes of wood strawberries on their weekly halfholiday  he had seen nothing but had only been guided by the sound of voices to the top of the sloping wooded bank where under the shade of the oaktrees looking over the tall spreading brackens he beheld essie in her pretty gipsy hat and holland dress with all her birdlike daintiness kneeling on the moss far below him threading the scarlet beads on bents of grass with the little ones round her  i heard a chattering he said as descending through the fern he met her dark eyes looking up like those of a startled fawn so i came to see whether the rabbits had found tongues  how many more are there  no thank you as edmund and lina answered his greeting with an offer of very moistlooking fruit and an ungrammatical only us  then us run away  they grow thick up that bank and ive got a prize here for whoever keeps away longest  no you shant see what it is  any one who comes asking questions will lose it  run away lina youll miss your chance  no no essie you are not a competitor  i must robert indeed i must  cant you spare me a moment when i am come down for my last farewell visit  but you are not going for a good while yet  so you call it but it will seem short enough  did you ever hear of minutes seeming like diamond drops meted out essie  but you know it is your own doing said essie  yes and why essie  because misfortune has made such an exile as this the readiest mode of ceasing to be a burden to my mother  papa said he was glad of it said esther and that you were quite right  but it is a terrible way off  true but there is one consideration that will make up to me for everything  that it is for aunt caroline  partly but do you not know the hope which makes all work sweet to me  and the look of his eyes and his hand seeking hers made her say  oh dont robert i mustnt  nay my queen you were too duteous to hearken to me when i was rich and prosperous  i would not torment you then i meant to be patient but now i am poor and going into banishment you will be generous and compassionate and let me hear the one word that will make my exile sweet  i dont think i ought said the poor child under her breath  0 robert dont you know i ought not  would you if that ugly cypher of an ought did not stand in the way  oh dont ask me robert i dont know  but i do know my queen said he  i know my little essie better than she knows herself  i know her true heart is mine only she dares not avow it to herself and when hearts have so met esther they owe one another a higher duty than the filial tie can impose  i never heard that before she said puzzled but not angered  no it is not a doctrine taught in schoolrooms but it is true and universal for all that and our fathers and mothers acted on it in their day and will give way to it now  esther had never been told all her fathers objections to her cousin simple prohibition had seemed to her parents sufficient for the gentle dutiful child  bobus had always been very kind to her and her heart went out enough to him in his trouble to make coldness impossible to her  tears welled into her eyes with perplexity at the new theory and she could only falter out—  that doesnt seem right for me  say one word and trust to me and it shall be right  yes esther say the word and in it i shall be strong to overcome everything and win the consent you desire  say only that with it you would love me  if said esther  it was an interrogative if and she did not mean it for the one word but bobus caught at it as all he wanted  he meant it for the fulcrum on which to rest the strong lever of his will and before esther could add any qualification he was overwhelming her with thanks and assurances so fervent that she could interpose no more doubts and yielded to the sweetness of being able to make any one so happy above all the cousin whom most people thought so formidably clever  edmund interrupted them by rushing up thus losing the prize which was won by the last comer and proved to be a splendid bonbon but there was consolation for the others since bobus had laid in a supply as a means of securing peace  he would fain have waited to rivet his chains before manifesting them but he knew essie too well to expect her to keep the interview a secret and he had no time to lose if as he intended though he had not told her so he was to take her to japan with him  so he stormed the castle without delay walked to kencroft with the strawberry gatherers found the colonel superintending the watering of his garden and with effrontery of which essie was unconscious led her up and announced their mutual love as though secure of an ardent welcome  he did mayhap expect to surprise something of the kind out of his slowlymoving uncle but the only answer was a strongly accentuated indeed  i thought i had told you both that i would have none of this foolery  esther i am ashamed of you  go in directly  the girl repaired to her own room to weep floods of tears over her fathers anger and the disobedience that made itself apparent as soon as she was beyond the spell of that specious tongue  there were a few fears too for his disappointment but when her mother came up in great displeasure the first words were—  o mamma i could not help it  you could not prevent his accosting you but you might have prevented his giving all this trouble to papa  you know we should never allow it  indeed i only said if  you had no right to say anything  when a young lady knows a man is not to be encouraged she should say nothing to give him an advantage  you could never expect us to let you go to a barbarous place at the other end of the world with a man of as good as no religion at all  he goes to church said essie too simple to look beyond  only here to please his mother  my dear you must put this out of your head  even if he were very different we should never let you marry a first cousin and he knows it  it was very wrong in him to have spoken to you  please dont let him do it again said esther faintly  thats right my dear with a kiss of forgiveness  i am sure you are too good a girl really to care for him  i wish he would not care for me sighed poor essie wearily  he always was so kind and now they are in trouble i couldnt vex him  oh my dear young men get over things of this sort half a dozen times in their lives  essie was not delighted with this mode of consolation and when her mother tenderly smoothed back her hair and bade her bathe her face and dress for dinner she clung to her and said—  dont let me see him again  it was a wholesome dread which mrs brownlow encouraged for both she and her husband were annoyed and perplexed by roberts cool reception of their refusal  he quietly declared that he could allow for their prejudices and that it was merely a matter of time and he was provokingly calm and secure showing neither anger nor disappointment  he did not argue but having once shown that his salary warranted his offer that the climate was excellent and that european civilisation prevailed he treated his uncle and aunt as unreasonably prejudiced mortals who would in time yield to his patient determination  his mother was as much annoyed as they were all the more because her sisterinlaw could hardly credit her perfect innocence of roberts intentions and was vexed at her wish to ascertain esthers feelings this was not easy the poor child was so unhappy and shamefaced so shocked at her involuntary disobedience and so grieved at the pain she had given  if robert had been set before her with full consent of friends she would have let her whole heart go out to him loved him and trusted him for ever treating whatever opinions were unlike hers as manly idiosyncrasies beyond her power to fathom  but she was no lydia languish to need opposition as a stimulus  it rather gave her tender and dutiful spirit a sense of shame terror and disobedience and she thankfully accepted the mandate that sent her on a visit to her married sister for as long as bobus should remain at belforest  he did not show himself downcast but was quietly assured that he should win her at last only smiling at the useless precaution and declaring himself willing to wait and make a home for her  but this matter had not tended to make his mother more at ease in her enforced stay at belforest which was becoming a kind of gilded prison     chapter xxxi  slack tide    if thou hide thine eyes and make thy peevish moan over some broken reed of earth beneath some darling of blind fancy dead and gone                                            keble   there is such a thing as slack tide in the affairs of men when a crisis seems as if it would never come and all things stagnate the law courts had as yet not concerned themselves about the will vacation time had come and all was at a standstill nor could any steps be taken for lucass exchange till it was certain into what part of india sir philip cameron was going  in the meantime his regiment had gone into camp and he could not get away until the middle of september and then only for a few days  arriving very late on a friday night he saw nobody but his mother over his supper and thought her looking very tired  when he met her in the morning there was the same weary harassed countenance there were worn marks round the dark wistful eyes and the hair whitened at schwarenbach did not look as incongruous with the face as hitherto  no one else except barbara had come down to prayers so jocks first inquiry was for armine  he is pretty well said his mother but he is apt to be late  he gets overtired between his beloved parish work and his reading with bobus  he is lucky to get such a coach said jock  bob taught me more mathematics in a week than i had learnt in seven years before  he is terribly accurate said babie  which armie does not appreciate said jock  im afraid not said his mother  they do worry each other a good deal and this infanta most of all im afraid  o no mother said babie  only it is hard for poor armie to have two taskmasters  what the reverend petronella continues in the ascendant  bobus here entered with a face that lightened as did everyones at sight of lucas  good morning  ah jock  i didnt sit up for i had had a long day out on the moors we kept the birds nearer home for you  there are plenty but grimes says he has heard shots towards river hollow and thinks some one must have been trespassing there  have you heard anything of elvira apropos to river hollow said his mother  yes said jock  one of our fellows has been on a moor not far from where she was astonishing the natives conjointly with lady anne macnalty  there were bets which of three men she may be engaged to  pending which said his mother i suppose poor allen will continue to hover on the wings of the petrel  and send home mournful madrigals by the ream said bobus  never was petrel so tuneful a bird  for shame bobus i never meant you to see them  twas quite involuntary  i have trouble enough with my own pupils effusions  i leave him a bit of latin composition and what do i find but an endless doggerel ballad on whats his name—who hid under his fathers staircase as a beggar eating the dogs meat while his afflicted family were searching for him in vain—his favourite example  st alexis said babie he was asked to versify it  as a wholesome incentive to filial duty and industry said bobus does the parsoness mean to have it sung in the school  it might be less dangerous than the fox went out one moonshiny night said their mother anxious to turn the conversation  mr parsons brought mr todd of wrexham in to see the school just as the children were singing the final catastrophe when the old farmer shot the old fox right through the head  he was so horrified that he declared the schools should never have a penny of his while they taught such murder and heresy  served them right said jock for spoiling that picture of domestic felicity when the little ones picked the bones oh how many guns shall we be bobus  only three  my uncle has a touch of gout the monk has got a tutorship joe has gone back to his ship but the mighty bob has a weeks leave and does not mean a bird to survive the change of owners  doesnt armine come  not he said bobus  says he doesnt want to acquire the taste and he would knock up with half a day  but youll all come and bring us luncheon entreated jock  you will mother  now wont you  well eat it on a bank like old times when we lived at the folly and all were jolly  i beg your pardon bob i didnt mean to turn into another poetical brother on your hands but enthusiasm was too strong for me  come mother carey do  where is it to be she asked smiling  out by the long hanger would be a good place said bobus where we found the epipactis grandiflora  or the heathery knoll where poor little mother got into a scrape for singing profane songs by moonlight laughed jock  ah that was when hearts were light she said but at any rate well make a holiday of it for jocks sake  ha what do i see exclaimed jock who was opposite the open window  is that armine or a jackinthegreen  oh half sighed barbara  its that harvest decoration  and armine casting down armfuls of great ferns and beautiful trailing plants made his entrance through the open window exchanging greetings and making a semiapology for his late appearance as he said—  mother please desire macrae to cut me the great white orchids  he wont do it unless you tell him and i promised them for the altar vases  you know armie he said cutting them would be the ruin of the plant and i dont feel justified in destroying it  macraes fancy muttered armine  it is only that he hates the whole thing  unhappy macrae  i go and condole with him sometimes said bobus i dont know which are most outraged—his freekirk or his horticultural feelings  babie ordered armine who was devouring his breakfast at double speed if youll put on your things ive the garden donkeycart ready to take down the flowers  you wont expect us to luncheon mother  barbara though obedient looked blank and her mother said—  my dear if i went down and helped at the church till half past twelve could not we all be set free  your brothers want us to bring their luncheon to them at the hanger  thats right mother cried jock ive half a mind to come and expedite matters  no no skipjack cried bobus i had that twenty stone of solid flesh whom i see walking up to the house to myself all yesterday and i cant stand another day of it unmitigated  entered the tall heavy figure of rob  he reported his father as much the same and not yet up delivered a note to his aunt and made no objection to devouring several slices of tongue and a cup of cocoa to recruit nature after his walk while bobus reclaimed the reluctant armine from cutting scarlet geraniums in the ribbon beds to show him the scene in the greek play which he was to prepare and babie tried to store up all the directions perceiving from the pupils roving eye that she should have to be his memory  jock saw that the note had brought an additional line of care to his mothers brow and therefore still more gaily and eagerly adjured her not to fail in the long hanger and as the shooting party started he turned back to wave his cap and shout sharp two  two oclock found three hungry youths and numerous dead birds on the pleasant thymy bank beneath the edge of the beach wood but gaze as they might through the clear september air neither mother brother nor sister was visible  presently however the ponycarriage appeared and in it a hamper but driven only by the stableboy  he said a gentleman was at the house and mrs brownlow was very sorry that she could not come but had sent him with the luncheon  i shall go and see after her said jock and in spite of all remonstrance and assurance that it was only a form of parsonic tyranny he took a draught of ale and a handful of sandwiches sprang into the carriage and drove off hardly knowing why but with a yearning towards his mother and a sense that all that was unexpected boded evil  leaving the pony at the stables and walking up to the house he heard sounds that caused him to look in at the open library window  on one side of the table stood his mother on the other dr demetrius hermann with insinuating face but arm upraised as if in threatening  scoundrel burst forth jock  both turned and his mothers look of relief and joy met him as he sprang to her side exclaiming what does this mean  how dare you  no no she cried breathlessly clinging to his arm  he did not mean—it was only a gesture  ill have no such gestures to my mother  sir the honoured lady only does me justice  i meant nothing violent  zat is for you english military whose veapon is zie horse vhip  as you will soon feel said jock if you attempt to bully my mother  what does it mean mother dear  he made a mistake she said in a quick tremulous tone showing how much she was shaken   he thinks me a quack doctors widow whose secret is matter of bargain and sale  madame  i offered most honourable terms  terms indeed  i told you the affair is no empirical secret to be bought  yet madame knows that i am in possession of a portion of zie discovery and that it is in my power to pursue it further though for family considerations i offer her to take me into confidence so that all may profit in unison said the greek in his blandest manner  the very word profit shows your utter want of appreciation said mrs brownlow with dignity  such discoveries are the property of the entire faculty to be used for the general benefit not for private selfish profit  i do not know how much information may have been obtained but if any attempt be made to use it in the charlatan fashion you propose i shall at once expose the whole transaction and send my husbands papers to the lancet  hermann shrugged his shoulders and looked at lucas as if considering whether more or less reason could be expected from a soldier than from a woman  it was to him that he spoke  madame cannot see zie matter in zie light of business  i have offered freely to share all that i shall gain if i may only obtain the data needful to perfect zie discovery of zie learned and venerated father  i am met wit anger i cannot comprehend  nor ever will said caroline  and pursued dr hermann when on zie oder hand i explain that my wife has imparted to me sufficient to enable me to perfectionate the discovery and if the reserve be continued it is just to demand compensation i am met with indignation even greater  i appeal to zie captain  is this treatment such as my proposals merit  not quite said jock  that is to be kicked out of the house as you shortly will be if you do not take yourself off  sir your amiable affection for madame leads you to forget as she does zie claim of your sister  no one has any claim on my mother said jock  zie moral claim—zie claim of affection began the greek but caroline interrupted him—  dr hermann is not the person fitly to remind me of these  they have not been much thought of in janets case  i mean to act as justly as i can by my daughter but i have absolutely nothing to give her at present  till i know what my own means may prove to be i can do nothing  but madame holds out zie hope of some endowment  i shall be in a condition to be independent of it but it would be sweet to my wife as a token of pardon  i could bear away a promise  i promise nothing was the reply  if i have anything to give— even then all would depend on your conduct and the line you may take  and above all remember it is in my power to frustrate and expose any attempt to misuse any hints that may have been stolen from my husbands memoranda  in my power and my duty  madame might have spared me this sighed the athenian  my poor janette  she will not believe how her husband has been received  he was gone  caroline dropped into a chair but the next moment she almost screamed—  oh we must not let him go thus  he may revenge it on her  go after him get his address tell him she shall have her share if he will behave well to her  jock fulfilled his mission according to his own judgment and as he returned his mother started up  you have not brought him back  i should rather think not  janets husband  oh jock it is very dreadful  my poor child  she had been a little lioness in face of the enemy but she was trembling so hopelessly that jock put her on a couch and knelt with his arm round her while she laid her head on his strong young shoulder  let me fetch you some wine mother darling he said  no no—to feel you is better than anything putting his arm closer—  what was it all about mother  ah you dont know yet you went straight to the point my dear champion  he was bullying you that was enough  i thought for a moment the brute was going to strike you  that was only gesticulation  im glad you didnt knock him down when you made in to the rescue  she could laugh a little now  i should like to have done it  what did he want  money of course  not solely  i cant tell you all about it but janet saw some memoranda of your fathers and he wants to get hold of them  to pervert them to some quackery  if not i do him great injustice  give them up to a rogue like that  i should guess not  it will be some little time before he tries again  well done little mother  if he will not turn upon her  what a speculation he must have thought her  dont talk of it jock i cant bear to think of her in such hands  janet has a spirit of her own  i should think she could get her way with her subtle athenian  where did he drop from  he overtook me on my way back from the church for indeed i did not mean to break my appointment  i dont think the servants knew who was here  and jock if you mention it to the others dont speak of this matter of the papers  call it as you may with truth an attempt to extort money  very well he gravely said  it is true she continued that i have valuable memoranda of your fathers in my charge but you must trust me when i say that i am not at liberty to tell you more  of course i do  so the mother was really coming like a good little redridinghood to bring her sons dinner into the forest when she met with the wolf  pray has he eaten up the two kids at a mouthful  no miss parsons had done that already  they are making the church so beautiful and it did not seem possible to spare them though i hope armine may get home in time to get his work done for bobus  is not he worked rather hard between the two  he does not seem to thrive on it  jock i can say it to you  i dont know what to do  the poor boys heart is in these church matters and he is so bitterly grieved at the failure of all his plans that i cannot bear to check him in doing all he can  it is just what i ought to have been doing all these years i only saw my duties as they were being taken away from me and so i deserve the way miss parsons treats me  what way  you need not bristle up  she is very civil but when i hint that armine has study and health to consider i see that in her eyes i am the worldly obstructive mother who serves as a trial to the hero  if she makes armine think so—  armie is too loyal for that  yet it may be only too true and only my worldliness that wishes for a little discretion  still i dont think a sensible woman if she were ever so good and devoted would encourage his fretting over the disappointment or lead him to waste his time when so much depends on his diligence  i am sure the focus of her mind must be distorted and she is twisting his the same way  and her brother follows suit  i think they go in parallel grooves and he lets her alone  it is very unlucky for they are a constant irritation to bobus and he fancies them average specimens of good people  he sneers and i cant say but that much of what he says is true but there is the envenomed drop in it which makes his good sense shocking to armine and i fear babie relishes it more than is good for her  so they make one another worse and so they will as long as we are here  it was a great mistake to stay on and your uncle must feel it so  could you not go to dieppe or some cheap place  i dont feel justified in any more expense  here the house costs nothing and our personal expenditure does not go beyond our proper means but to pay for lodging elsewhere would soon bring me in excess of it at least as long as allen keeps up the yacht  then poor janet must have something and i dont know what bills may be in store for me and theres your outfit and bobuss  never mind mine  my dear thats fine talking but you cant go like sir charles napier with one shirt and a bit of soap  no but i shall get something for the exchange  besides my kit was costly even for the guards and will amply cover all that  and you have sold your horses  and have been living on them ever since  come wont that encourage you to make a little jaunt just to break the spell  i wish it could my dear but it does not seem possible while those bills are such a dreadful uncertainty  i never know what allen may have been ordering  surely the evelyns would be glad to have you  no jock that cant be  promise me that you will do nothing to lead to an invitation  you are to meet some of them are you not  yes on thursday week at roland hamptons wedding  cecil and i and a whole lot of us go down in the morning to it and sydney is to be a bridesmaid  what are you going to do now mother  i dont quite know  i feel regularly foolish  i shall have a headache if i dont keep quiet but i cant persuade myself to stay in the house lest that man should come back  what not with me for garrison  o nonsense my dear  you must go and catch up the sportsmen  not when i can get my mother carey all to myself  you go and lie down in the dressingroom and ill come as soon as i have taken off my boots and ordered some coffee for you  he returned with the step of one treading on eggs expecting to find her half asleep but her eyes were glittering and there were red spots on her cheeks for her nerves were excited and when he came in she began to talk  she told him not of present troubles but of the letters between his father and grandmother which in her busy restless life she had never before looked at but which had come before her in her preparations for vacating belforest  perhaps it was only now that she had grown into appreciation of the relations between that mother and son as she read the letters preserved on each side and revealing the full beauty and greatness of her husbands nature his perfect confidence in his mother and a guiding influence from her which she herself had never thought of exerting does not many an old correspondence thus put the present generation to shame  jock was the first person with whom she had shared these letters and it was good to watch his face as he read the words of the father whom he remembered chiefly as the best of playfellows  he was of an age and in a mood to enter into them with all his heart though he uttered little more than an occasional question or some murmured remark when anything struck him  both he and his mother were so occupied that they never observed that the sky clouded over and rain began to fall nor did they think of any other object till bobus opened the door in search of them  halloo you deserter  hush  mother has a headache  not now you have cured it  well youve missed an encounter with the most impudent rascal i ever came across  you didnt meet hermann  well perhaps i have found his match but you shall hear  grimes said he heard guns and we came upon the scoundrel in lewis acre two brace on his shoulder  the vultures are gathering to the prey said his mother  im not arrived at lying still to be devoured said bobus  i gave him the benefit of a doubt and sent grimes to warn him off but the fellow sent his card—his card forsooth mr gilbert gould rn—and information that he had miss menellas permission  not credible said jock  mrs lisettes more likely said his mother  i think he is her brother  i sent grimes back to tell him that miss menella had as much power to give leave as my old pointer and if he did not retire at once we should gently remove his gun and send out a summons  why did you not do so at once cried jock  because i have brains enough not to complicate matters by a personal row with the goulds said bobus though i could wish not to have been there when the keepers would infallibly have done so  shall i write to george gould or will you mother  oh dear sighed caroline i think mr wakefield is the fittest person if it signifies enough to have it done at all  signifies cried jock  to have that rascal loafing about  i wouldnt be trampled upon while the life is in me  i dont like worrying mr gould  it is not his fault except for having married such a wife poor man  having been married by her you mean said bobus  mark me she means to get that fellow married to that poor child as sure as fate  impossible bobus  his age  he is a good deal younger than his sister and a prodigious swell  besides he is her uncle said jock  no no only her uncles wifes brother  thats just the same  i wish it were  but jock would not be satisfied without getting a prayerbook to look at the table of degrees  he is really her third cousin i believe said his mother and im afraid that is not prohibited  is he a ships steward said jock looking at the card with infinite disgust  a paymasters assistant i believe  that would be too much  besides theres the scot  i dont think much of that said jock  the mother and sister are keen for it but clanmacnalty is in no haste to marry and by all accounts the elf carries on promiscuously with three or four at once  and she has no fine instinct for a gentleman added bobus  it is who will spread the butter thickest  a bad look out for belforest said jock  it cant be much worse than it has been with me said his mother  thats what that little ass armine has been presuming to din into your ears said bobus as if the old women didnt prefer beef and blankets to your coming poking piety at the poor old parties  by the bye cried caroline starting those children have never come home and see how it rains  jock volunteered to take the pony carriage and fetch them but he had not long emerged from the park in the gathering twilight before he overtook two figures under one umbrella and would have passed them had he not been hailed  you demented children  jump in this instant  dont turn called armine  we must take this showing a parcel which he had been sheltering more carefully than himself or his sister  it is cord and tassels for the banner  they sent wrong ones said barbara and we had to go and match it  they would not let me go alone  get in i say cried jock who was making demonstrations with the national weapon much as if he would have liked to lay it about their shoulders  then we must drive onto the parsonage stipulated armine  not a bit of it you drenched and foolish morsel of humanity  you are going straight home to bed  hand us the parcel  what will you give me not to tie this cord round the reverend petronellas neck  thank you jock im so glad said babie referring probably to the earlier part of his speech  we would have come home for the pony carriage but we thought it would be out  take care of the drip was armines parting cry as babie turned the ponys head and jock strode down the lane  he meant merely to have given in the parcel at the door but miss parsons darted out and not distinguishing him in the dark began thank you dear armine im so sorry but it is in the good cause and you wont regret it  wheres your sister  gone home  but youll come and have a cup of tea and stay to evensong  my brother and sister are gone home thank you said jock with impressive formality and a manly voice that made her start  oh indeed  thank you mr brownlow i was so sorry to let them go but it had not begun to rain and it is such a joy to dear armine to be employed in the service  yes he is mad enough to run any risk said jock  oh mr brownlow if i could only persuade you to enter into the joy of selfdevotion you would see that i could not forbid him  wont you come in and have a cup of tea  thank you no  good night  and miss parsons was left rejoicing at having said a few words of reproof to that cynical mr robert brownlow while jock tramped away grinning a sardonic smile at the ladys notions of the joys of selfsacrifice  he came home only just in time for dinner and found armine enduring with a touching resignation learnt in miss parsonss school the sarcasm of bobus for having omitted to prepare his studies  the boy could neither eat nor entirely conceal the chills that were running over him and though he tried to silence his brothers objurgations by bringing out his books afterwards his cheeks burnt he emitted little grunting coughs and at last his head went down on the lexicon and his breath came quick and short  the harvest festival day was perforce kept by him in bed blistered and watched from hour to hour to arrest the autumn cold which was the one thing dreaded as imperilling him in the english winter which he must face for the first time for four years  and miss parsons when impressively told evidently thought it was the family fashion to make a great fuss about him  alas why are people so onesided and absorbed in their own concerns as never to guess what stumblingblocks they raise in other peoples paths nor how they make their good be evil spoken of  babie confided her feelings to jock when he escorted her to church in the evening and had detected a melancholy sound in her voice which made him ask if she thought armines attack of the worst sort  not particularly except that he talks so beautifully  jock gave a small sympathetic whistle at this dreadful symptom and wondered to hear that he had been able to talk  i didnt mean only today but this is only what he had made up his mind to  he never expects to leave belforest and he thinks—oh jock—he thinks it is meant to do bobus good  he doesnt go the way to edify bobus  no but dont you see  that is what is so dreadful  he only just reads with bobus because mother ordered him and he hates it because he thinks it is of no use for he will never be well enough to go to college  why he had this cold coming yesterday and i believe he is glad for it would be like a book for him to be very bad indeed bad enough to be able to speak out to bobus without being laughed at  does he always go on in this way  not to mother but to hear him and miss parsons is enough to drive one wild  they went on such a dreadful way yesterday that i was furious and so glad to get away to kenminster only after i had set off he came running after me and i knew what that would be  what does she do  does she blarney him  yes i suppose so  she means it i believe but she does natter him so that it would make me sick if it didnt make me so wretched  you see he likes it because he fancies her goodness itself and so i suppose she is only there is such a lot of clerical shop—then as jock made a sound as if he did not like the slang in her mouth—ay it sounds like bobus but if this goes on much longer i shall turn to bobuss way  he has all the sense on his side  no babie said jock very gravely  thats a much worse sort of folly  and he will be gone before long said barbara much struck by a tone entirely unwonted from her brother  o jock i thought reverses would be rather nice and help one to be heroic and perhaps they would if they would only come faster and armine could be out of miss parsonss way but i dont believe he will ever be better while he is here  i think—i think and she began to sob that miss parsons will really be the death of him if she is not hindered  cant he go on board the petrel with allen  mother did think of that said babie but allen said he wasnt in spirits for the charge and that cabin no 2 wasnt comfortable enough  jock was not the least surprised at this selfishness but he said—  we will get him away somehow infanta never fear  and when you have left this place youll be all right  youll have the friar and he is a host in himself  yes said babie ruefully but he is not a brother after all  oh jock mother says it is very wrong in me but i cant help it  what is wrong little one  to feel it so dreadful that you and bobus are going  i know it is honour and glory and promotion and chivalry and victoria crosses and all that sydney and i used to care for but oh we never thought of those that stayed at home  you were a famous spartan till the time came said jock in an odd husky voice  i wouldnt mind so much but for mother said poor barbara in an apologetic tone nor if there were any stuff in allen nor if dear armie were well and like himself but oh dear i feel as if all the manhood and comfort of the family would be gone to the other end of the world  what did you say about mother  i beg your pardon jock i didnt mean to worry you  i know it is a grand thing for you  but mother was so merry and happy when we thought we should all be snug with you in the old house and she made such nice plans  but now she is so fagged and worn and she cant sleep  she began to read as soon as it was light all those long summer mornings to keep from thinking and she is teasing herself over her accounts  there were shoals of great horrid bills of things allen ordered coming in at midsummer just as she thought she saw her way  do you know she thinks she may have to let our own house and go into lodgings  is that you barbara said a voice at the parsonage wicket  how is our dear patient  rather better tonight we think  tell him i hope to come and see him tomorrow  and say the vases are come  i thought your mother would wish us to have the large ones so i put them in the church  they are £3  babie thought jocks face was dazed when he came among the lights in church and that he moved and responded like an automaton and she could hardly get a word out of him all the way home  there they were sent for to armine who was sufficiently better to want to hear all about the services the procession the wheatsheaf the hymns and the sermons  jock stood the examination well till it came to evensong when as his sister had conjectured he knew nothing except one sentence which he said had come over and over again in the sermon and he wanted to know whence it came  it was seekest thou great things for thyself  even armine only knew that it was in a note in the christian year and babie looked out the reference and found that it was jeremiahs rebuke to baruch for selfseeking amid the general ruin  i liked baruch she said  i am sorry he was selfish  noble selfishness perhaps said armine  he may have aimed at saving his country and coming out a glorious hero like gideon or jephthah  and would that have been selfseeking too as well as the commoner thing said babie  it is like a bit of new testament in the midst of the old said armine  they that are great are called benefactors—a good sort of greatness but still not the true christian greatness  and that said babie  to be content to be faithful servant as well as faithful soldier said armine thoughtfully  but what had it to do with the harvest  he got no satisfaction babie could remember nothing but jocks face and jock had taken the bible and was looking at the passages referred to he sat for a long time resting his head on his hand and when at last he was roused to bid armine goodnight he bent over him kissed him and said in spite of all youre the wise one of us armie boy  thank you     chapter xxxii  the cost    o well for him who breaks his dream   with the blow that ends the strife and waking knows the peace that flows   around the noise of life                               g macdonald   jock say this is not true  the wedding had been celebrated with all the splendour befitting a marriage in high life  bridesmaids and bridesmen were wandering about the gardens waiting for the summons to the breakfast when one of the former thus addressed one of the latter who was standing gazing without much speculation in his eyes at the gold fish disporting themselves round a fountain  sydney he exclaimed are not your mother and fordham here  i cant find them  did you not hear duke has one of his bad colds and mamma could not leave him  but jock while we have time set my mind at rest  what is affecting your mind said jock knowing only too well  what cecil says that you mean to disappoint all our best hopes  theres no help for it sydney said jock too heavyhearted for fencing  no help  i dont understand  why theres going to be war real war out there  frontier tribes  what of that  it would lead to something  besides no one leaves a corps on active service  is mine  it is all the same  you were going to get into one that is  curious reasoning sydney  i am afraid my duty lies the other way  duty to ones country comes first  i cant believe mrs brownlow wants to hold you back she—a soldiers daughter  it is no doing of hers said jock but i see that i must not put myself out of reach of her  when she has all the others  that is a mere excuse  if you were an only son it would be bad enough  come this way and ill tell you what convinced me  i cant see how any argument can prevail on you to swerve from the path of honour the only career any one can care about cried sydney the romance of her nature on fire  hush sydney he said partly from the exquisite pain she inflicted partly because her vehemence was attracting attention  no wonder you say hush said the maiden with what she meant for noble severity no wonder you dont want to be reminded of all we talked of and planned  does not it break babies heart  she does not know  then it is not too late  but at that moment the brides aunt who felt herself in charge of miss evelyn swooped down on them and paired her off with an equally honourable best man so that she found herself seated between two comparative strangers while it seemed to her that lucas brownlow was keeping up an insane whirl of merriment with his neighbours  poor child her hero was fallen her influence had failed and nothing was left her but the miserable shame of having trusted in the power of an attraction which she now felt to have been a delusion meanwhile the aunt by way of being on the safe side effectually prevented jock from speaking to her again before the party broke up and he could only see that she was hotly angered and not that she was keenly hurt  she arrived at home the next day with white cheeks and red eyes and most indistinct accounts of the wedding  a few monosyllables were extracted with difficulty among them a yes when fordham asked whether she had seen lucas brownlow  did he talk of his plans  not much  one cannot but be sorry said her mother but as your uncle says his motives are to be much respected  mamma cried sydney horrified you wouldnt encourage him in turning back from the defence of his country in time of war  his country ejaculated fordham  up among the hill tribes  you palliating it too duke  is there no sense of honour or glory left  what are you laughing at  i dont think it a laughing matter nor cecil either that he should have been led to turn his back upon all that is great and glorious  thats very fine said fordham who was in a teasing mood  had you not better put it into the travellers joy  i shall never touch the travellers joy again and sydneys high horse suddenly breaking down she flew away in a flood of tears  her mother and brother looked at one another rather aghast and fordham said—  had you any suspicion of this  not definitely  pray dont say a word that can develop it now  he is all the worthier  most true but we do not know that there is any feeling on his side and if there were sydney is much too young for it to be safe to interfere with conventionalities  an expressed attachment would be very bad for both of them at present  should you have objected if he had still been going to india  i would have prevented an engagement and should have regretted her knowing anything about it  the wear of such waiting might be too great a strain on her  possibly said fordham  and should you consider this other profession an insuperable objection  certainly not if he goes on as i think he will but such success cannot come to him for many years and a good deal may happen in that time  poor lucas  he would have been much cheered could he have heard the above conversation instead of cecils wrath which like his sisters worked a good deal like madness on the brain  mr evelyn chose to resent the slight to his family and the ingratitude to his uncle in thus running counter to their wishes and plunging into what the young aristocrat termed low life  he did not spare the warning that it would be impossible to keep up an intimacy with one who chose to grub his nose in hospitals and dissecting rooms  naturally lucas took these as the sentiments of the whole family and found that he was sacrificing both love and friendship  sir james evelyn indeed allowed that he was acting rightly according to his lights  sir philip cameron told him that his duty to a widowed mother ought to come first and his own colonel a good and wise man commended his decision and said he hoped not to lose sight of him the opinions of these veterans though intrinsically worth more than those of the two young evelyns were by no means an equivalent to poor lucas  the great things he had resolved not to seek involved what was far dearer  it was more than he had reckoned on when he made his resolution but he had committed himself and there was no drawing back  he was just of age and had acted for himself knowing that his mother would withhold her consent if she were asked for it but he was considering how to convey the tidings to her when he found that a card had been left for him by the reverend david ogilvie with a pencilled invitation to dine with him that evening at an hotel  mr ogilvie after several years of good service as curate at a district church at a fashionable south coast watering place sometimes known as the english sorrento had been presented to the parent church  he had been taking his summer holiday and on his way back had undertaken to relieve a london friend of his sunday services  his sisters letters had made him very anxious for tidings of mrs brownlow and he had accordingly gone in quest of her son  he ordered dinner with a half humorous respect for the supposed epicurism of a young guardsman backed by the desire to be doubly correct because of the fallen fortunes of the family and he awaited with some curiosity the pupil best known to him as a pickle  mr brownlow  there stood a young man a soldier from head to foot slight active neatly limbed and of middle height with a clear brown cheek dark hair and moustache and the wellremembered frank hazel eyes though their frolic and mischief were dimmed and they had grown grave and steadfast and together with the firmset lip gave the impression of a mind resolutely bent on going through some great ordeal without flinching or murmuring  with a warm grasp of the hand mr ogilvie said—  why brownlow i should not have known you  i should have known you sir anywhere said jock amazed to find the ogre of old times no venerable seignior but a man scarce yet middleaged  they talked of mr ogilvies late tour in scenes well known to jock and thence they came to the whereabouts of all the family armines health and roberts appointment till they felt intimate and the unobtrusive sympathy of the old friend opened the youths heart and he made much plain that had been only half understood from mrs morgans letters  of his eldest brother and sister jock said little but there was no need to explain why his mother was straitening herself and remaining at belforest when it had become so irksome to her  and you are going out to india said mr ogilvie  thats not coming off sir  indeed i thought you were to have a staff appointment  it would not pay sir and that is a consideration  then have you anything else in view  the hospitals said jock with a poor effort to seem diverted the other form of slaughter  then as his friend looked at him with concerned and startled eyes he added unless there were some extraordinary chance of loot  you see the pagoda tree is shaken bare and i could do no more than keep myself and have nothing for my mother and i am afraid she will need it  it is a chance whether allen at his age or armine with his health can do much and some one must stay and get remunerative work  is not the training costly  her majesty owes me something luckily i got my commission by purchase just in time and i shall receive compensation enough to carry me through my studies  we shall be all together with friar brownlow who takes the same line in the old house in bloomsbury where we were all born  that she really does look forward to  i should think so with you to look after her said mr ogilvie heartily  only she cant get into it till lady day  and i wanted to ask you mr ogilvie do you know anything about expenses down at your place what would tolerable lodgings be likely to come to rent of rooms i mean for my mother and the two young ones  armie has not wintered in england since that swiss adventure of ours and i suppose st cradockes would be as good a place for him as any  i had a proposition to make brownlow  my sister and i invested in a house at st cradockes when i was curate there and she meant to retire to me when she had finished barbara  my married curate is leaving it next week when i go home  the single ones live in the rectory with me and i think of making it a convalescent home but this cant be begun for some months as the lady who is to be at the head will not be at liberty  do you think your mother would do me the favour to occupy it  it is furnished and my housekeeper would see it made comfortable for her  do you think you could make the notion acceptable to her he said colouring like a lad and stuttering in his eagerness  it would be a huge relief exclaimed jock  thank you mr ogilvie  belforest has come to be like a prison to her and it will be everything to have armine in a warm place among reasonable people  is kenminster more unreasonable than formerly  not kenminster but woodside  i say mr ogilvie you havent any one at st cradockes who will send armine and babie to walk three miles and back in the rain for a bit of crimson cord and tassels  i trust not said mr ogilvie smiling  that is the way in which good people manage to do so much harm  im glad you say so cried jock  that woman is worse for him than six months of east wind  i declare i had a hard matter to get myself to go to church there the next day  who is she  the sister of the vicar of woodside who is making him the edifying martyr of a goody book  ah you know her i see as mr ogilvie looked amused  a gushing lady of a certain age  oh yes she has been at st cradockes  she is not coming again i hope in horror  not likely  they were there for a few months before her brother had the living and i could quite fancy her influence bringing on a morbid state of mind  there is something exaggerated about her  youve hit her off exactly cried jock and youll unbewitch our poor boy before she has quite done for him  cant you come down with me on saturday and propose the plan  thank you  i am pledged to sunday  i forgot  but come on monday then  i had better go and prepare  i had rather you spoke for me somehow and a strange dew came in david ogilvies eyes i could not bear to see her there where we saw her installed in triumph now that all is so changed  you would see her the brightest and bravest of all  neither she nor babie would mind the loss of fortune a bit if it were not as babie says for other things  but those other things are wearing her to a mere shadow  no not a shadow—that is dark—but a mere sparkle but to escape from belforest will cure a great deal  so jock went away with the load on his heart somewhat lightened  he could not get home on saturday till very late when dinner had long been over  coming softly in through the dimly lighted drawing rooms over the deeply piled carpets he heard babies voice reading aloud in the innermost library and paused for a moment looking through the heavy velvet curtains over the doorway before withdrawing one and entering  his mothers face was in full light as she sat helping armine to illuminate texts  she did indeed look worn and thin and there were absolute lines on it but they were curves such as follow smiles rather than furrows of care feet rather of larks than of crows and her whole air was far more cheerful and animated than that of her youngest son   he was thin and wan his white cheeks contrasting with his dark hair and brown eyes which looked enormous in their weary pensiveness as he lent back languidly holding a brush across his lips in a long pause while she was doing his work  barbaras bright keen little features were something quite different as wholly wrapped up in her book she read—             oh then ladurlad started            as one who in his grave            has heard an angels call            yea mariately thou must deign to save            yea goddess it is she            kailyal—   are you learning japanese asked jock advancing so that armine started like ladurlad himself  dear old skipjack  skipped here again and they were all about him  have you had any dinner  a mouthful at the station  if there is any coffee and a bit of something cold id rather eat it promiscuously here  no diningroom spread pray  it is too jolly here said jock dropping into an armchair  wheres bob  dining at the schoolhouse  and whats that mariolatry  mariately said babie  an indian goddess  it is the curse of kehama and wonderfully noble  moore or browning  for shame jock cried the girl  i thought you did know more than examination cram  it is the advantage of having no mudie boxes said his mother  we are taking up our southey  and armie how are you  my cough is better thank you was the languid answer  only they wont let me go beyond the terrace  for dont i know said his mother that if once i let you out i should find you croaking at a choir practice at woodside  then after ordering a refection for the traveller came the question what he had been doing  dining with mr ogilvie  it is quite a new sensation to find oneself on a level with the ogre of ones youth and prove him a human mortal after all  thats a sentiment worthy of joe said babie  you used to know him in private life  always with a smack of the dominie  moreover he is so young  i thought him as ancient as dr lucas and behold he is a brisk youth without a grey hair  he always was younglooking said his mother  i am glad you saw him  i wish he were not so far off  well then mother heres an invitation from mahomet to the mountain which mahomet is too shy to make in person  that house which he and his sister bought at his english sorrento has just been vacated by his married curate and he wants you to come and keep it warm till he begins a convalescent home there next spring  how very kind  oh mother you couldnt burst out armine in consternation  would it be an expense or loss to him jock said his mother considering  i should say not unless he be an extremely accomplished dissembler if it eased your mind no doubt he would consent to your paying the rates and taxes  but mother again implored armine you said you would not force me to go to madeira with the evelyns  are they going to madeira exclaimed jock thunderstruck  did you not hear it from cecil  he has been away on leave for the last week  this is a sudden resolution  yes fordham goes on coughing and sydney has a bad cold caught at the wedding  did you see her  oh yes i saw her he mechanically answered while his mother continued—  mrs evelyn has been pressing me most kindly to let armine go with them but as dr leslie assures me it is not essential and he seems so much averse to it himself—  you know mother how i wish to hold my poor neglected woodside to the last cried armine  why is my health always to be made the excuse for deserting it  you are not the only reason said his mother  it is hard to keep esther in banishment all this time and i am in constant fear of a row about the shooting with that gilbert gould  has he been at it again exclaimed jock fiercely  you are as bad as rob she said  i fully expect a disturbance between them and i had rather be no party to it  oh i shall be very thankful to get away i feel like a prisoner on parole  and i feel said armine as if all we could do here was too little to expiate past carelessness  mind you are talking of mother said jock firing up  i thought she felt with me said armine meekly  so i do my dear i ought to have done much better for the place but our staying on now does no good and only leads to perplexity and distress  and when can you come mother said jock  the house is at your service instanter  i should like to go tonight without telling any one or wishing any one goodbye  no you need not be afraid armie  the time must depend on your brothers plans  st cradockes is too far off for much running backwards and forwards  have you any notion when you may have to leave us jock  you dont go with sir philip  no certainly not said jock  then with a little hesitation in fact thats all up  he has not thrown you over said his mother or is there any difficulty about your exchange  here babie broke in oh thats it  thats what sydney meant  oh jock you dont mean that you let it prey upon you—the nonsense i talked  oh i will never never say anything again  what did she say demanded jock  sydney  oh that it would break her heart and cecils if you persisted and that she could not prevent you and it was my duty mother that was the letter i didnt show you  i could not understand it and i thought you had enough to worry you  but what does it all mean asked their mother  what have you been doing to the evelyns  mother i have gone back to our old programme said jock  i have sent in my papers i said nothing to you for i thought you would only vex yourself  oh jock she said overpowered i should never have let you  no mother dear i knew that so i didnt ask you  you undutiful person but she held out her arm and as he came to her she leant her head against him sobbing a little sob of infinite relief as though fortitude found it much pleasanter to have a living column  youve done it said armine  you will see it gazetted in a day or two  then it is all over cried babie again in tears all our dreams of honour and knighthood and wounds and glorious things  you can always have the satisfaction of believing i should have got them said jock but there was a quiver in his voice and a thrill through his whole frame that showed his mother that it was very sore with him and she hastened to let him subside into a chair while she asked if it was far to the end of the canto and as babie was past reading she took the book and finished it herself  nobody had much notion of the sense but the cadence was soothing and all were composed by the time the prayerbell rang  come to my dressingroom presently she said to lucas as he lighted her candle for her  just as she had gone up stairs the front door opened to admit bobus  oh you are here was his salutation  so you have done for yourself  how do you know  your colonel wrote to my uncle  he was at the dinner and made me come back with him to ask if i knew about it  how does he take it  he will probably fall on you as he did on me tonight calling it all my fault  as how  for looking out for myself  for my part i had thought it praiseworthy but he says none of the rest of us care a rush for my mother and so the only one of us good for anything has to be the victim  but dont plume yourself  youll be the scum of the earth when he has you before him  poor old boy it is a sore business to him and it doesnt improve his temper  i believe this place is a greater loss to him than to my mother  what are your plans  rotifer as before  chacun a son gout said bobus shrugging his shoulders  i should have thought you would respect curing more than killing  if there were not a whole bag of stones about your neck  magnets said jock  thats just it  all the heavier  the brothers went upstairs together and jock was kept waiting a little while in the dressingroom till his mother came out shutting the door on barbara  the poor infanta she said  she is breaking her foolish little heart over something she said to you  as bad as the woman in the black brunswicker she says only she didnt mean it  was it so jock  i had pretty well made up my mind before  mother are you vexed that i did not tell you  you spared me much  your uncle would never have consented  but oh jock  im not a spartan mother  my heart will bound  my colonel said it was right said jock so did cameron and even sir james though he did not like it  with such an array of old soldiers on our side we may let the young ladies rage said his mother but she checked her mirth on seeing how far from a joke their indignation was to her son  he turned and looked into the fire as he said—  when did sydney write that letter mother  before meeting you at the wedding  she has not written since  i thought not muttered jock his brow against the mantelpiece  no but mrs evelyn has written such a nice letter just like herself though i did not understand it then  i think she was doubtful how much i knew for she only said how thankworthy it must be to have such a selfsacrificing spirit among my sons moral courage in fact of the highest kind and how those who were lavish of strong words in their first disappointment would be wiser byand by  i was puzzled then  but oh my dear this must have been very grievous to you  i couldnt go back but i did not know how it would be said jock in a choked voice collapsing at last and hiding his face on his mothers lap  my jock i am so sorry  i wish it were not too late  i could not have let you give up so much and she fondled his head  i did not think i had been so weak as to let you see  no mother  it was not that you were so weak but that you were so brave  besides i ought to take the brunt of it  i ruined you all by being the prime mover with that assification and i was the cause of armies illness too  i ought to take my share  if ever i can be any good to any one again he added in a dejected tone  good—unspeakably good  this is my first bright spot of light through the wood  if it were but bright to you  i am afraid they have been very unkind  not unkind  she couldnt be that but ive shocked and disappointed her and his head dropped again  what in not being a hero  my dear you are a true hero in the eyes of us old mothers but i am afraid that is poor comfort  my jock does it go so deep as that  giving up all that for me  o my boy  it is nonsense to talk of giving up said jock rousing himself to a commonsense view  what chance had i of her if i had gone to india ten times over but the wave of grief broke over him again she would have believed in me and may be have waited  she will believe in you again  no im below her  my poor boy i didnt know it had come to this  do you mean that anything had ever passed between you  no but it was all the same  even evelyn implied it when he said they must give me up if we took such different lines  cecil too  foolish fellow  jock dont care about such absurdity they are not worth it  theyve been the best of my life said poor jock but he stood up shook himself and said a nice way this of helping you  i didnt think i was such a fool  but it is over now ill buckle to and do my best  my brave boy and as the thought of the magnum bonum darted into her mind she said you may have greater achievements than are marked by victoria crosses and sydney herself may own it  and jock went to bed cheered in spite of himself by his mothers pleasure and by mrs evelyns letter which she allowed him to take away with him  colonel brownlow was not so much distressed by lucass retirement as had been apprehended  he knew the life of a soldier with small means too well to recommend it  the staff appointment he said might mean anything or nothing and could only last a short time unless lucas had extraordinary opportunities  it might be as well he was very like his grandfather poor john allen and might have had his history over again  the likeness was a new idea to caroline and a great pleasure to her indeed she seemed to armine unfeelingly joyous as she accepted mr ogilvies invitation and hurried her preparations  there was a bare possibility of a return in the spring which prevented final farewells and softened partings a little  the person who showed most grief of all was mrs robert brownlow who glad as she must have been to be free of bobus and able to recall her daughter wept over her sisterinlaw as if she had been going into the workhouse with tears partly penitent for the involuntary ingratitude with which past kindness had been received  she was as babie said much more sorry for mother carey than mother carey for herself  yet the relief was all the greater that it was plain that esther was not happy in her banishment and that general hood thought her visit had lasted long enough while the matter was complicated at home by her sister eleanors undisguised sympathy with her cousin bobus for whom she would have sent messages if her mother had not with some difficulty exacted a promise never to allude to him in her letters     chapter xxxiii  bitter farewells    but he who lets his feelings run   in soft luxurious flow shrinks when hard service must be done   and faints at every woe                             j h newman   welcome shone in mr ogilvies face in the gaslight on the platform as the train drew up and the popinjay in her cage was handed out uttering hic haec hoc  were all mother careys chicks  therewith the mother and the two youngest of her chicks were handed to their fly and driven through raindrops and splashes flashing in the gas to a door where the faithful emma awaited them and conveyed them to a room so bright and comfortable that babie piteously exclaimed—  oh emma you have left me nothing to do  presently came mr ogilvie to make sure that the party needed nothing  he was like a child hovering near and constantly looking to assure himself of the reality of some precious acquisition  later in the evening on his way from the nightschool he was at the door again to leave a parish magazine with a list of services that ought to have rejoiced armines heart if he had felt capable of enjoying anything at st cradockes and at which babie looked with some dismay as if fearing that they would all be inflicted on her he was in a placid martyrlike state  he had made up his mind that the air was of the relaxing sort that disagreed with him and no doubt would be fatal though as he coughed rather less than more he could hardly hope to edify bobus by his deathbed unless he could expedite matters by breaking a bloodvessel in saving someones life on the whole however it was pleasanter to pity himself for vague possibilities than to apprehend the crisis as immediate  it was true that he was very forlorn  he missed the admiring petting by which miss parsons had fostered his morbid state he missed the occupations she had given him and he missed the luxurious habits of wealth far more than he knew  after his winters under genial skies close to blue mediterranean waves english weather was trying and in contrast with southern scenery people and art everything seemed ugly homely and vulgar in his eyes  gorgeous cathedrals with their high masses and sweet benedictions their bannered processions and kneeling peasantry rose in his memory as he beheld the half restored church the stiff open seats and the philistine precision of the st cradockes old church congregation and anglicanism shared his distaste in spite of the fascinations of the district church  he was languid and inert partly from being confined to the house on days of doubtful character  he would not prepare any work for bobus who with jock was to follow in ten days he would not second babies wish to get up a st cradockes number of the travellers joy to challenge a madeira one he did little but turn over a few books say there was nothing to read and exchange long letters with miss parsons  armine said mr ogilvie i never let my friends come into my parish without getting work out of them  i have a request to make you  im afraid i am not equal to much said armine not graciously  this is not much  we have a lame boy here for the winter son to a cabinet maker in london  his mind is set on being a pupilteacher and he is a clever bright fellow but his chance depends on his keeping up his work  i have been looking over his latin and french but i have not time to do so properly and it would be a great kindness if you would undertake it  cant he go to school said armine not graciously  it is much too far off  now he is only round the corner here  my going out is so irregular said armine not by any means as he would have accepted a behest of petronellas  he could often come here  or perhaps the infanta would fetch and carry  he is with an uncle a fisherman and the wife keeps a little shop  stagg is the name  they are very respectable people but of a lower stamp than this lad and he is rather lost for want of companionship  the london doctors say his recovery depends on sea air for the winter so here he is and whatever you can do for him will be a real good work  what is the name asked mrs brownlow  stagg  it is over a little grocery shop  you must ask for percy stagg  perhaps armine suspected the motive to be his own good for he took a dislike to the idea at once  percy stagg he began as soon as mr ogilvie was gone  what a detestable conjunction just showing what the fellow must be  and to have him on my hands  i thought you liked teaching said his mother  as if this would be like a woodside boy  yes said babie i dont suppose he will carry onions and lollipops in his pockets nor put cockchafers down on ones book  babie that was only ted stokes  and i should think he might have rather cleaner hands and not leave their traces on every book  hell do worse said armine  he will be vulgarly stuck up and excruciate me with every french word he attempts to pronounce  but youll do it armie said his mother  oh yes i will try if it be possible to make anything of him when i am up to it  armine was not up to it the next day nor the next  the third was very fine and with great resignation he sauntered down to mrs staggs  percy turned out to be a quiet gentle pale lad of fourteen without cockney vivacity and so shy that armine grew shyer did little but mark the errors in his french exercise hear a bit of reading and retreat bemoaning the hopeless stupidity of his pupil  a few days later mr ogilvie asked the lame boy how he was getting on  oh sir brightening the lady is so kind  she does make it so plain in me  the lady  not the young gentleman  the young gentleman has been here once sir  and his sister comes when he is not well  no sir it is his mother i think  a lady with white hair—the nicest lady i ever saw  and she teaches you  oh yes sir  i am preparing a fable in the latin delectus for her and she gave me this french book  she does tell me such interesting facts about words and about what she has seen abroad sir  and she brought me this cushion for my knee  percy thinks there never was such a lady chimed in his aunt  she is very good to him and he is ever so much better in his spirits and his appetite since she has been coming to him  the young gentleman was haughty like and couldnt make nothing of him but the lady— shes so affable  she is one of a thousand  i did not mean to impose a task on you said mr ogilvie next time he could speak to mrs brownlow  oh  i am only acting stopgap till armine rallies and takes to it she said  the boy is delightful  it is very amusing to teach french to a mind of that age so thoroughly drilled in grammar  a capital thing for percy but i thought at least you would have deputed the infanta  the infanta was a little overdone with the style of thing at woodside  she and sydney evelyn had a romance about good works of which miss parsons completely disenchanted her—rather too much so i fear  let her alone she will recover said mr ogilvie if only by seeing you do what i never intended  i like it teacher as i am by trade  so each day armine imagined himself bound to the infliction of percy stagg and compelled by headache cough or weather to let his mother be his substitute  she is keeping him going on days when i am not equal to it he said to mr ogilvie  having thus given you one of my tasks said that gentleman let me ask whether i can help you in any of your studies  i have been reading with bobus thank you  and now  i have not begun again though if my mother desires it i shall  so i should suppose but i am sorry you do not take more interest in the matter  even if i live said armine the hopes with which i once studied are over  what hopes  the boy was drawn on by his sympathy to explain his plans for the perfection of church and charities at woodside where he would have worked as curate and lavished all that wealth could supply in all institutions for its good and that of kenminster  it was the vanished castle over which he and miss parsons had spent so many moans and yet at the end of it all armine saw a sort of incredulous smile on his friends face  i dont think it was impossible or unreasonable he said  i could have been ordained as curate there and my mother would have gladly given land and means and all  i was not thinking of that my boy  what struck me was how people put their trust in riches without knowing it  indeed i should have given up all wealth and luxury  i am not regretting that exclaimed armine in unconscious blindness  i did not say you were  i beg your pardon said armine thinking he had not caught the words  i said people did not know how they put their trust in riches  i never thought i did  only that you think nothing can be done without them  i dont see how it can  dont you  well the longer i live the more cause i see to dread and distrust what is done easily by force of wealth  of course when the money is there and is given along with ones self as i know you intended it is providential but i verily believe it intensifies difficulties and temptations  poverty is almost as beneficial a sieve of motives and stimulus to energy as persecution itself  there are so many things one cant do  perhaps the fit time is not come for their being done  or you want more training for doing them  remember that to bring ones good desires to good effect there is a how to be taken into account i know of a place where the mere knowledge that there are unlimited means to bestow seems to produce ingratitude and captiousness for whatever is done  on the other hand i have seen a far smaller gift that has cost an effort most warmly and touchingly received  again the power of at once acting leads to overhaste want of consideration domineering expectation of adulation impatience of counsel or criticism  i suppose one does not know till one has tried said armine but i should mind nothing from mr or miss parsons  i did not allude to any special case i only wanted to show you that riches do not by any means make doing good a simpler affair but rather render it more difficult not to do an equal amount of harm  of course said armine as this misfortune has happened it is plain that we must submit and i hope i am bowing to the disappointment  by endeavouring to do your best for god with what is left you  i hope so but with my health there seems nothing left for me but unmurmuring resignation  mr ogilvie was amused at armines notion of unmurmuring resignation but he added only which would be much assisted by a little exertion  i did exert myself at home but it is all aimless now  i should have thought you still equally bound to learn and labour to do your duty in him and for him  will you think about what i have said  yes mr ogilvie thank you i know you mean it kindly and no one can be expected to enter into my feeling of the uselessness of wasting my time over classical studies when i know i shall never be able to be ordained  are you sure you are not wasting it now  it was not possible to continue the subject  mr ogilvie had failed in both his attempts to rouse armine and had to tell his mother who had hoped much from this new influence  i think he said that armine is partly feeling the change from invalidism to ordinary health  he does not know it poor fellow but it is rather hard to give up being interesting  caroline saw the truth of this when armine showed himself absolutely nettled at his brothers on their arrival pronouncing that he looked much better—in fact quite jolly an insult which he treated with christian forgiveness  bobus had visited belforest  his mother had never intended this and still less that he should walk direct from the station to kencroft surprising the whole family at luncheon and taking his seat among them quite naturally  thereby he obtained all he had expected or hoped for when the meal was over he was able though in the presence of all the family to take esther by both hands and say in his resolute earnest voice goodbye my sweet and only love  you will wait for me and byandby when i have made you a home and people see things differently i shall come for you and therewith he pressed on her burning blushing drooping brow four kisses that felt like fire  her mother might fret and her father might fume but they were as powerless as the parents of young lochinvars bride and the words of their protest were scarcely begun when he loosed the girls hands and turning to her mother said goodbye aunt ellen  when we meet again you will see things otherwise  i ask nothing till that time comes  this was not the part of his visit of which he told his mother he only dwelt on a circumstance so opportune that he had almost been forgiven even by the colonel  he had encountered dr hermann who had come down to make another attempt on the gracious lady and had thus found himself in the presence of a very different person  an opening had offered itself in america and he had come to try to obtain his wifes fortune to take them out  the opportunity of making stringent terms had seemed to bobus so excellent that he civilly invited demetrius to dine and sleep and sent off a note to beg his uncle to come and assist in a family compact  colonel brownlow having happily resisted his impulse to burn the letter unread as an impertinent proposal for his daughter found that it contained so sensible a scheme that he immediately conceived a higher opinion of his namesake than he had ever had before  thus dr hermann found himself face to face with the very last members of the family he desired to meet and had to make the best of the situation  of secrets of the late joseph brownlow he said nothing but based his application on the offer of a practice and lectureship he said he had received from new orleans  he had evidently never credited that mrs brownlow meant to resign the whole property without giving away among her children the accumulation of ready money in hand and as he knew himself to be worth buying off he reckoned upon janets full share  he had taken mrs brownlows own statements as polite refusals and a ladys romance until he found the uncle and nephew viewing the resignation of the whole as common honesty and that she was actually gone  they would not give him her address and prevented his coming in contact with the housekeeper so that no more molestation might be possible and meantime they offered him terms such as they thought she would ratify  all that joseph brownlow had left was entirely in her power and the amount was such that if she had died intestate each of her six children would have been entitled to about £l600 exclusive of the house in london  janet had no right to claim anything now or at her mothers death but the uncle and nephew knew that mrs brownlow would not endure to leave her destitute and they thought the deportation to america worth a considerable sacrifice  therefore they proposed that on the actual bona fide departure £500 should be paid down the interest of the £1100 should be secured to her and paid halfyearly through mr wakefield who was to draw up the agreement but the final disposal of the sum was not to be promised but to depend on mrs brownlows will  such a present boon as £500 had made hermann willing to agree to anything  bobus had seen the lawyer in london and with him concocted the agreement for signature making the payments pass through the wakefield office the receipts being signed by janet hermann herself  why must all payments go through the office asked caroline  because theres no trusting that slippery greek said bobus  i should have liked my poor janet to have been forced to communicate with me every halfyear she sighed  what when she has never chosen to write all this time  yes  it is very weak but i cant help it  it would be something only to see her name  i have never known where to write to her or i would have done so  o very well said bobus you had better invite them both to share the menage in collingwood street  for shame bobus said jock  you have no right to say such things  only that all this might as well have been left undone if my mother is to rush on them to ask their pardon and beg them to receive her with open arms  i mean mother he added with a different manner if you give one inch to that greek he will make it a mile and as to janet if she cant bring down her pride to write to you like a daughter i wouldnt give a rap for her receipt and it might lead to intolerable pestering  now you know she cant starve on £50 a year besides her medical education  wakefield will always know where she is and you may be quite easy about her  caroline gave way to her sons reasoning as he thought but no sooner was she alone with jock than she told him that he must take her to london to see janet in her lodgings before the departure for the states  he was at her service and as they did not mean to sleep in town they started at a preposterously early hour with a certain mirth and gaiety at thus eloping together as the mothers spirits rose at the bare idea of seeing the firstborn child for whom she had famished so long  jock was such a perfect squire of dames and so chivalrously charmed to be her escort that her journey was delightful nor did she grow sad till it was over  then she could not eat the food he would have had her take at the station and he saw tears standing in her eyes as he sat beside her in the omnibus  when they were set down they walked swiftly and without a word to the lodgings  dr and mrs hermann had left two days ago said the untidy girl whose aspect like that of the street and house betokened that janet was drinking of her bitter brewst  what shall we do mother asked jock  you ought to rest  will you go to mrs acton or mrs lucas while i run down to wakefields office and find out about them  to miss rays i think she said faintly  nita may know their plans  heres the address taking a little book from her pocket and ruffling over the leaves you must find it  i cant see  o but i can walk as he hailed a cab and helped her into it finding the address and jumping after her while she sank back in the corner  very small and shrunken did she look when he took her out at the door leading to rooms over a stationers shop  the sisters were somewhat better off than formerly though good old miss ray was half ashamed of it since it was chiefly owing to the liberal allowance from mrs brownlow for the chaperonage in which she felt herself to have so sadly failed  jock saw his mother safe in the hands of the kind old lady heard that the pair were really gone and departed for his interview with mr wakefield  no sooner had the papers been signed and the £500 made over to them than the hermanns had hurried away a fortnight earlier than they had spoken of going  it was much like an escape from creditors but the reason assigned was an invitation to lecture in new york  so there was nothing for it but to put up with miss rays account of janet and even that was secondhand for the gentle spirit of the good old lady had been so roused at the treachery of the stolen marriage that she had refused to see the couple and when nita had once brought them in she had retired to her bedroom  nita was gone on a professional engagement into the country for a week  according to what she had told her sister demetrius and janet were passionately attached and his manner was only too endearing but miss ray had disliked the subject so much that she had avoided it in a way she now regretted  everything i have done has turned out wrong she said with tears running down her cheeks  even this  i would give anything to be able to tell you of poor janet and yet i thought my silence was for the best for nita and i could not mention her without quarrelling as we had never done before  o mrs brownlow i cant think how you have ever forgiven me  i can forgive every one but myself said caroline sadly  if i had understood how to be a better mother this would never have been  you the most affectionate and devoted  ah but i see now it was only human love without the true moving spring and so my poor child grew up without it and these are the fruits  but my dear my dear one cant give these things  poor janet always was a headstrong girl like my poor nita  i know what you mean and how one feels that if one had been better oneself said poor miss ray ending in utter entanglement but tender sympathy  she might have been a child of many prayers said the poor mother  ah but that she can still be said the old lady  she will turn back again my dear  never fear  i dont think i could die easy if i did not believe she would  jock brought back word that the lawyer had been entirely unaware of the hermanns departure and thought it looked bad  he had seen them both and his report was less brilliant than nitas  indeed jock kept back the details for mr wakefield had described mrs hermann as much altered thin haggard shabby and anxious and though her husband fawned upon her demonstratively before spectators something in her eyes betokened a certain fear of him  he had also heard that elvira was still making visits  there was a romance about her which in addition to her beauty and future wealth made people think her a desirable guest  she was always more agreeable with strangers than in her own family and as to the needful funds she had her ample allowance and no doubt her expectations secured her unlimited credit  her conduct was another pang but it was lost in the keener pain janet had given  as his mother could not bear to face any one else jock thought the sooner he could get her home the better and all they did was to buy some of armines favourite biscuits and likewise to stop at rivingtons where she chose the two smallest and neatest greek testaments she could find  they reached home three hours before they were expected and she went up at once to her room and her bed leaving jock to make the explanations and receive all bobuss indignation at having allowed her to knock herself up by such a foolish expedition  chill fatigue and far more grief after her long course of worry really did bring on a feverish attack so unprecedented in her that it upset the whole family and if mr ogilvie had not been almost equally wretched himself he would have been amused to see these three great sons wandering forlorn about the house like stray chicks who had lost their parent hen and imagining her ten times worse than she really was  babie was really useful as a nurse and had very little time to comfort them  and indeed they treated her as childish and trifling for assuring them that neither patient maid nor doctor thought the ailment at all serious  bobus found some relief in laying the blame on jock but when armine heard the illness ascribed to a long course of anxiety and harass he was consciencestricken as he thought how often his perverse form of resignation had baffled her pleadings and added to her vexations  words impatiently heard at the moment returned upon him and compunction took its outward effect in crossness  it was all that jock could do by his goodhumoured banter and repartee to keep the peace between the other two who when unchecked by regard to their mother and babie seemed bent on discussing everything on which they most disagreed  babie was a welcome messenger to jock at least when she brought word that mother hoped armine would attend to percy stagg and would take him the book she sent down for him  her will was law in the present state of things and armine set forth in dutiful disgust but he found the lad so really anxious about the lady and so much brightened and improved that he began to take an interest in him and promised a fresh lesson with alacrity  his next step in obedience was to take out his books but bobus had no mind for them and said it was too late  if armine had really worked diligently all the autumn he might have easily entered kings college london but now he had thrown away his chance  mr ogilvie found him with his books on the table plunged in utter despondency  your mother is not worse he asked in alarm  oh no she is very comfortable and the doctor says she may get up tomorrow  then is it the greek said mr ogilvie much relieved  yes  bobus says my rendering is perfectly ridiculous  are you preparing for him  no  he is sick of me and has no time to attend to me now  let me see—  oh mr ogilvie said armine looking up with his ingenuous eyes i dont deserve it  besides bobus says it is of no use now  ive wasted too much time ever to get into kings  i should like to judge of that  suppose i examined you—not now but tomorrow morning  meantime how do you construe this chorus it is a tough one  armine winked out of his eyes the tears that had risen at the belief that he had really in his wilfulness lost the hope of fulfilling the higher aims of his life and with a trembling voice translated the passage he had been hammering over  a word from mr ogilvie gave him the clue and when that stumblingblock was past he acquitted himself well enough to warrant a little encouragement  well done armine  we shall make a fair scholar of you after all  i dont deserve you should be so kind  i see now what a fool i have been said armine his eyes filling again with tears  i have no time to talk of that now said mr ogilvie  i only looked in to hear how your mother was  bring down whatever books you have been getting up at twelve tomorrow or if it is a wet day i will come to you  armine worked for this examination as eagerly as he had decorated for miss parsons and in the face of the like sneers for bobus really believed it was all waste of time and did not scruple to tell him so and to laugh when he consulted jock whose acquirements lay more in the way of military mathematics and modern languages than of university requirements  perhaps the report that armine was reading livy with all his might was one of his mothers best restoratives—and still more that when he came to wish her goodnight he said mother ive been a wretched selfsufficient brute all this time im very sorry and ill try to go on better  and when she came downstairs to be petted and made much of by all the four she found that the true and original armine had come back instead of petronellas changeling  indeed the danger now was that he would overwork himself in his fervour for bobuss continued ill auguries only acted as a stimulus nor were they silenced till she begged as a personal favour that he would not torment the boy  indeed her presence made life smooth and cheerful again to the young people there were no more rubs of temper and bobus whose departure was very near showed himself softened  he was very fond of his mother and greatly felt the leaving her  he assured her that it was all for her sake and that he trusted to be able to lighten some of her burdens when his first expenses were over  and mother he said on his last evening you will let me sometimes hear of my esther  oh bobus if you could only forget her  would you rob me of my great incentive—my sweet image of purity who rouses and guards all that is best in me  my loyalty to my future wife is your best hope for me mother  oh if she were but any one else  how can i encourage you in disobedience to your father and to hers  you know what i think about that  when my esther ventures to judge for herself these prejudices will give way  she shall not be disobedient but you will all perceive the uselessness of withholding my darling  meanwhile i only ask you to let me see her name from time to time  you wont deny me that  no my dear i cannot refuse you that but you must not assume more than that i am sorry for you that your heart is set so hopelessly indeed i see no sign of her caring for you  do you  her heart is not opened yet but it will  suppose it should do so to any one else  she is a mere child she has few opportunities and if she had— well i think it would recall to her what she only half understood i am content to be patient—and mother you little know the good it does me to think of her and think of you it is well for us men that all women are not like janet  yet if you took away our faith what would there be to hinder us from being like my poor janet  heaven forbid that i should take away any ones honest faith above all yours or essies  except by showing that you think it just good enough for us  how can i help it any more than i can help that belforest was left to elvira  wishes and belief are two different things  would you help it if you could she earnestly asked  he hesitated  i might wish to satisfy you mother and other good folks but not to put myself in bondage to what has led blindfold to half the dastardly and cruel acts on this earth beautiful dream though it be  ah my boy it is my shame and grief that it is not a beautiful reality to you  you were too wise to bore us  you have only fancied that since you fell in with the evelyns  ah if i had only bred you up in the same spirit as the evelyns  it would not have answered  we are of different stuff  and after all janet and i are your only black sheep  jock has his convictions in a strong practical working order as real to him as ever his drill and orderbook were  good old fellow he strikes me a good deal more than all ogilvies discussions  mr ogilvie has talked to you  he has done his part both as cleric and your devoted servant mother and i confess made the best of his case as an able man heartily convinced can do  good night mother  one moment bobus my dear i want one promise from you to your old mother carey  call it a superstition and a charm if you will but promise  take this greek testament keep it with you and read a few verses every night  promise me  dear mother i am ready to promise  i have read those poems and letters several times in the original  but you will do this for me beginning again when you have finished promise  i will mother since it comforts you said bobus in a tone that she knew might be trusted  the other little book with the like request in urgent and tender entreaty was made up into a parcel to be forwarded as soon as mr wakefield should learn janet hermanns address  it was all that the mother could do except to pray that this living sword of the spirit might yet pierce its way to those closed hearts  nor was she quite happy about barbara  hitherto the girl had seemed as it were one with armine and had been led by his precocious piety into similar habits and aspirations which had been fostered by her intercourse with sydney and the sharing with her of many a blissful and romantic dream  all this however was altered  petronella had drawn armine aside one way and now that he was come back again he did not find the same perfectly sympathetic sister as before  bobus had not been without effect upon her as the impersonation of common sense and antagonism to miss parsons  it had not shown at the time for his domineering tone and his sneers always impelled her to stand up for her darling but when he was poor bobus gone into exile and bereft of his love certain poisonous germs attached to his words began to grow  there was no absolute doubt—far from it—but there was an impatience of the weariness and solemnity of religion  to enjoy church privileges to the full and do good works under church direction had in their wandering life been a dream of modern chivalry which she had shared with sydney much as they had talked of going on a crusade  and now she found these privileges very tedious the good works onerous and she viewed them somewhat as she might have regarded coeur de lions camp had she been set down in it armine would have gone on hearing nothing but remember the holy sepulchre but barbara would soon have seen every folly and failure that spoiled the glory of the army—even though she might not question its destination—and would have been unfeignedly weary of its discipline  so she hung back from the frequent church ordinances of st cradockes being allowed to do as she pleased about everything extra she made fun of the peculiarities of the varieties of the genus petronella who naturally hung about it and adopted the popular tone about the curates till jock told her not to be so commonplace  indeed both he and armine had made friends with them as he did with every one and armines enjoyment of the society of a new young bright deacon who came at christmas perhaps accounted for a little of her soreness and made armine himself less observant that the two were growing apart  her mother saw it though and being seconded by jock found it easier than of old to keep the tables free from sceptical and semisceptical literature but this involved the loss of much that was clever and there was no avoiding those envenomed shafts that people love to strew about and which for their seeming wit and sense babie always relished  she did not think—that was the chief charge and she was still a joyous creature even though chafing at the dulness of st cradockes  gould and another versus brownlow and another to be heard on the l8th mr wakefield writes  so we must leave our peaceful harbour to face the world again  oh im so glad cried barbara  i am fairly tingling to be in the thick of it again  you ungrateful infant said armine when this place has done every one so much good  so does bed but i feel as if it were six in the morning and i couldnt get the shutters open  i wonder if mr ogilvie will think me fit to go in for matriculation for the next term said armine  and i ought to go up for lectures said jock who had been reading hard all this time under directions from dr medlicott  i might go on before and see that the house is put in order before you come home mother  home  it sounds more like going home than ever going back to belforest did  and well make it the very moral of the old times  weve got all the old things  what do you know about the old times—baby that you are and were said jock  the drakes move tomorrow said his mother  i must write to your aunt and richards about sending the things from belforest  we must have it at its best before ali comes home  all right said babie  you know our own things have only to go back into their places and the drake carpets go on  it will be such fun as nice as the getting into the folly  nice you call that said her mother  all i remember is the disgrace we got into and the fright i was in  i wonder what the old home will bring us  life and spirit and action cried babie  oh im wearying for the sound of the wheels and the flow of people  oh you little cockney  of course  i was born one and i am thankful for it  theres nothing to do here  babie cried armine indignantly  well you and jock have read a great deal and he has plunged into nightschools  and become a popular lecturer added armine  and you and mother have cultivated percy stagg and gone to church a great deal—pour passer le temps  ah you discontented mortal said her mother rising to write her letters  you have yet to learn that what is stagnation to some is rest to others  oh yes mother i know it was very good for you but im heartily glad it is over  sea and ogre are all very well for once in a way but they pall especially in an east wind english fog  my babie i hope you are not spoilt by all the excitements of our last few years said the mother  you wont find life in collingwood street much like life in hyde corner  no but it will be life and thats what i care for  no barbara used to constant change and eager for her schemes of helpfulness could not be expected to enjoy the peacefulness of st cradockes as the others had done  to armine indeed it had been the beginning of a new life of hope and vigour and a casting off of the slough of morbid selfcontemplation induced by his invalid life and fostered at woodside  he had left off the romance of being early doomed since his health had stood the trial of the english winter and under mr ogilvies bracing management seconded by jocks energetic companionship he had learnt to look to active service and be ready to strive for it  to jock the time had been a rest from the victory which had cost him so dear and though the wounds still smarted there had been nothing to call them into action and he had fortified himself against the inevitable reminders he should meet with in london  he had been studying with all his might for the preliminary examination and eagerness in so congenial a pursuit was rapidly growing on him while conversations with mr ogilvie had been equally pleasant to both for the exschoolmaster thoroughly enjoyed hearing of the scientific world and the young man was heartily glad of the higher light he was able to shed on his studies and for being shown how to prevent the spiritual world from being obscured by the physical and to deal with the difficulties that his brothers materialism had raised for him he had never lost and trusted never to lose hold of his anchor in the rock but he had not always known how to answer when called on to prove its existence and trace the cable  thus the winter at st cradockes had been very valuable to him personally and he had been willing to make return for the kindness for which he felt so grateful by letting the vicar employ him in the nightschools lectures and parish diversions—all in short for which a genial and sensible young layman is invaluable when he can be caught  and for their mother herself she had been sheltered from agitation and had gathered strength and calmness though with her habitual want of selfconsciousness she hardly knew it and what she thanked her old friend for was what he had done for her sons especially armine he and i shall be grateful to you all the rest of our lives she said with her bright eyes glistening  david ogilvie in his deep silent lifelong romance felt that precious guerdons sometimes are won at an age which the young suppose to be past all feeling—guerdons the more precious and pure because unconnected with personal hopes or schemes  he still knew caroline to be as entirely joseph brownlows own as when he had first perceived it ten years ago but all that was regretful jealousy was gone  his idealisation of her had raised and moulded his life and now that she had grown into the reality of that ideal he was content with the sunshine she had brought and the joy of having done her a real service little as she guessed at the devoted homage that prompted it     chapter xxxiv  blighted beings    allenadale has no faggot for burning allenadale has no farrow for turning allenadale has no fleece for the spinning yet allenadale has red gold for the winning                                               scott   the little family raft put forth from the haven of shelter into the stormy waves  the first experience was as jock said that large rooms and country clearness had been demoralising or as babie averred the bad taste and griminess of the drake remains were invincible for when the old furniture and pictures were all restored to the old places the tout ensemble was so terribly dingy and confined that the mother could hardly believe that it was the same place that had risen in her schoolgirl eyes as a vision of home brightness  armine was magnanimously silent but what would be the effect on allen who had been heard of at gibraltar and was sure to return before the case was heard in court  we must give up old associations and try what a revolution will do mother carey said  hurrah cried babie i was feeling totally overpowered by that awful round table but i thought it was the very core of mothers heart  so did i said the mother herself when i remember how we used to sit round with the lamp in the middle and spin the whole table when we wanted a drawer on the further side but it wont bring back those who sat there and now the light falls anywhere but where it is wanted and our goods get into each others way  yes babie you may dispose of it in the back drawingroom and bring in your whole generation of little tables  there was opportunity for choice for the house was somewhat over full of furniture since besides the original plenishing of the pagoda all that was individual property had been sent from belforest and this included a great many choice and curious articles small and great all indeed that any one cared much about except the more intrinsically valuable gems of art  it had been all done between messrs wakefield gould and richards who had sent up far more than mrs brownlow had marked assuring her that she need not scruple to keep it  so by the time twilight came on the second evening when the whole family were feeling exceedingly bruised weary and dusty such a transformation had been effected that each of the four on returning from the much needed toilet stood at the door exclaiming—this is something like and when john arrived a little later he looked round with—  this is almost as nice as the folly  how does mother carey manage to make things like herself and nobody else  allens comment a few days later was—whats the use of taking so much trouble about a dingy hole which you cant make tolerable even if you were to stay here  i mean it to be my home till my md son takes a wife and turns me out  why mother you dont suppose that ridiculous will can hold water  you know i dont contest it  i know but they will not look at it for a moment in the probate court  some chance friend whom he had met abroad had suggested this to allen and he had gradually let his wish become hope and his hope expectation till he had come home almost secure of a triumph which would reinstate his mother and bring elvira back to him having learnt the difference between true friends and false  it was a proportionate blow when no difficulty was made about proving the will  as the trustees acted mrs brownlow had not to appear but allen haunted the law courts with his uncle and saw the will accepted as legal  nothing remained but another amicable action to put elvira de menella in possession  he was in a state of nervous excitement at every postmans knock making sure poor fellow that elviras first use of her victory would be to return to him  but all that was heard of was a grand reception at belforest bands banners horsemen triumphal arches banquet speeches toasts and ball all no doubt in gould taste the pennyaliner of the kenminster paper outdid himself in the polysyllables of his description while colonel brownlow briefly wrote that all was as insolent as might be expected and he was happy to say that most of the county people and some of the tenants showed their good feeling by their absence  over this mrs brownlow would not rejoice  she did not like the poor girl to be left to such society as her aunt would pick up and she wrote on her behalf to various county neighbours but the heiress had already come to the house in hyde corner chaperoned by her aunt who fortified by the trust that she was as good as mrs joseph brownlow had come to fight the battle of fashion with lady flora folliott for an ally  the name of george gould esquire was used on occasion but he was usually left in peace at his farm with his daughter mary with whom her stepmother had decided that nothing could be done  kate was made presentable by dress and lessons in deportment and promoted to be white slave at least so armine and barbara inferred from her constrained and frightened manner when they met her in a shop though she was evidently trying to believe herself very happy  allen was convinced at last that he was designedly given up and so far from trying to meet his faithless lady dejectedly refused all society where he could fall in with her and only wandered about the parks to feed his melancholy with distant glimpses of her on horseback while armine and barbara who held elvira very cheap were wicked enough to laugh at him between themselves and term him the forsaken merman  jock had likewise given up his old connections with fashionable life several times if anything were going on or if he met a former brother officer in the street he would be warmly invited to come and take his share or to dine with the mess he might have played in cricket matches and would have been welcome as a frequent guest but he had made up his mind that this would only lead to waste of time and money and steadily declined till the invitations ceased  it would have cost him more had any come from cecil evelyn but all that had been seen of him was a couple of visitingcards  the rest of the family had not come to town for the season and though the two mothers corresponded as warmly as ever and fordham and armine exchanged letters there was a sort of check and chill upon the friendship between the two young girls of which each understood only her own half  jock said nothing but he seemed to have grown mothersick spent all his leisure moments in haunting his mothers steps helping her in whatever she was about and telling her everything about his studies and companions as if she were the great solace of the life that had become so much less bright to him  in general he showed himself as droll as ever but there were days when as john said all the skip was gone out of the jack  the good monk was puzzled by the change which he did not think quite worthy of his cousin having—though the son of a military man—a contempt for the pomp and circumstance of war  he marvelled to see jock affectionately hook up his sword over the photograph of engelberg above his mantelshelf and he hesitated to join the volunteers as his aunt wished by way of compelling variety and exercise  jock however decided on so doing that sydney might own at least that he was ready for a call to arms for his country  he did not like to think that she was reading a report of sir philip camerons campaign in which the aidedecamp happened to receive honourable mention for a dashing and hazardous ride  why old fellow what makes you so down in the mouth said john on that very day as the two cousins were walking home from a lecture they had had to get into a doorway to avoid the rush of rabble escorting a regiment of household troops on their way to the station and lucas had afterwards walked the length of two streets without a word  you dont mean that you are hankering after all this style of thing—row and all the rest of it  theres a good deal more going to it than row said jock rather heavily  what that donkey evelyn having cut you  i should not trouble myself much on that score though i did think better of him at eton  he hasnt cut me jock made sharp return  one pasteboard among all the family grunted the friar  i reserve to myself the satisfaction of cutting him dead the next opportunity he added magniloquently  jock laughed as he was of course intended to do but there was such a painful ring in the laugh that john paused and said—  thats not all old fellow  come make a clean breast of it my fair son  thou dost weary of thy vocation  no such thing exclaimed jock with an inaudible growl between his teeth  trust kencroft for boring on and aloud with some impatience it is just what i would have chosen for its own sake  then said john still keeping up the grand philosophical air and demeanour though with real kindness and desire to show sympathy thou art either entangled by worldly scruples leading thee to disdain the wholesome art of healing or thou art like thy brother the victim of the fickle sex  shut up said jock pushed beyond endurance cant you understand that some things cant be talked of  whew  john whistled and surveyed him rather curiously from head to foot  it is another case of deluded souls not knowing what an escape theyve had  what she thought you a catch in the old days  thats all you know about it said jock  she is not that sort the poverty is nothing but theres a fitness in things  women the best of them think much of what i suppose you call the row  it fits in with all their chivalry and romance  then shes a fool said john shortly  i cant stand any more of this monk i tell you  you know just nothing at all about it and ive no right to complain nor any one to bait me with questions  the monk took the hint and when they reached their own street jock said—  you meant it all kindly reverend friar but there are things that wont stand probing as youll know some day  poor old chap said john with his hand on his shoulder ill not bother you any more  the veil shall be sacred  if this has been going on all the time i wonder you have carried it off so well  ali is a caution said jock who had shaken himself into his ordinary manner  what would become of babie with two blighted beings on her hands  besides he has some excuse and i have not  after this at every carriage to which lucas bowed john frowned and scanned the inmates in search of the fair deceiver never making a guess in the right direction  john had enough of the kencroft character not to be original  set him to work and he had plenty of intelligence and energy perhaps more absolute force and power than his cousin lucas but he would never devise things for himself and was not discursive pausing at novelties because his nature was so thorough that he could not take up anything without spending his very utmost force upon it  his university training made him an excellent aid to armine who went up for his examination at kings college and acquitted himself so well as to be admitted to begin his terms after the long vacation  indeed he and barbara had drawn together again more  she had her home tasks and her classes at kings college and did not fret as at st cradockes for want of work she enjoyed the full tide of life and had plenty of sympathy for whatever did not come before her in a goody aspect and though there might be little depth of serious reflection in her she was a very charming member of the household then her enjoyment of society was gratified for society of her own kind had by no means forgotten one so agreeable as mrs brownlow and whereas in her prosperity she had never dropped old friends they welcomed her back as one of themselves resuming the homely inexpensive gatherings where the brains were more consulted than the palate aesthetics more than fashion   she was glad of it for the young peoples sake as well as her own and returned to her old habit of keeping open house one evening in the week between eight and ten with cups of coffee and varieties of cheap foreign drinks and slight but dainty cakes made by herself and babie according to lessons taken together at the school of cookery  as allen declared these evenings a grievance and often thought himself unable to bear family chatter she had made the old consulting room as like his luxurious apartment at home as furniture and fittings could do and he was always free to retire thither indeed the toleration and tenderness with which his mother treated him were a continual wonder and annoyance to barbara the active little busy bee who not unjustly considered him the drone of the family and longed to sting him not to death but to exertion  it was provoking that when all the other youths had long finished breakfast and gone forth mother carey should wait lingering in the diningroom to cherish some delicate hot morceau and cup of coffee till the tardy softfalling feet came down the stairs and then sit patiently as long as he chose to dally with his meal telling how little he had slept  babie had tried her tongue on both but allen when she shouted at his door that breakfast was ready came forth no sooner and when he did so told his mother that he could not have children screaming at his door at all hours of the morning  mother carey replied to her impatient champion that while waiting for allen was her time for writing letters and reading amusing books and that the day was only too long for him already poor fellow without urging him to make it longer  more shame for him muttered pitiless sixteen  after breakfast allen generally strolled out to see the papers or to bestow his time somewhere—in the picture galleries or in the british museum where he had a reading order but it was always uncertain whether he would disappear for the whole day shut himself up in his own room or hang about the drawingroom very much injured if his mother could not devote herself to him  indeed she always did so except when she was bound to take barbara to some of her classes including cookery or when she had promised herself to dr and mrs lucas who were now both very infirm and knew not how to be thankful enough for the return of one who became like a daughter to them while jock their godson at once made himself like the best of grandsons and never failed to give them a brightening cheering hour every sunday  the science of cookery was by no means a needless task for the cook was very plain and allens appetite was dainty and comfort at dinner could only be hoped for by much thought and contrivance allen was never discourteous to his mother herself but he would look at her in piteous reproach and affect to charge all failures on the cook or on children being allowed to meddle the most cutting thing to babie he could say  then the two johns always took up the cudgels and praised the food with all their might  indeed the friar was often sensible of a strong desire to flog the dawdling melancholy out of his cousin and force him no longer to hang a dead weight on his mother and even jock began to be annoyed at her unfailing patience and pity though he understood her compassion better than did those who had never felt a wound  she did in truth blame herself for having given him no profession and having acquiesced in the indolent dilettante habits which made all harder to him now and she was not certain how far it was only his fancy that his health and nerves were perilously affected though dr medlicott whom she secretly consulted assured her that the only remedies needed were good sense and something to do  at last at midsummer the crisis came in a heavy discharge of bills the consequence of allens incredulity as to their poverty and incapability of economising  he said the rascals could wait and his mother need not trouble herself  she said they must be paid and she found it could be done at the cost of giving up spending august at st cradockes as well as of breaking into her small reserve for emergencies  but she told allen that she insisted on his making some exertion for his own maintenance  yes said allen in languid assent  i know it is harder at your age to find occupation  that is not the point  i can easily find something to do  theres literature  or i could take up art  and last year there was a hungarian count who would have given anything to get me for a tutor  then why didnt you go  mother you ask me why  i know you had not made up your mind to the worst but it is a pity you missed the opportunity  there will be more said allen loftily  i never meant to be a burden but ladies are so impatient i suppose you do not wish to turn me out instantly to seek my fortune  no mother i do not mean to blame you  you have been sadly harassed and no woman can ever enter into what i have suffered  put aside those bills  long before christmas i shall be able to discharge them myself  so allen wrote to bobuss friend at oxford but he of course did not keep a pocketful of hungarian counts  he answered one or two advertisements for a travelling tutor and had one personal interview the result of which was that he could have nothing to do with such insufferable snobs  he also concocted an advertisement beginning with ma oxford accustomed to the best society and familiar with european languages but though the newspapers charged highly for it he only received one answer except those from agents and that he said with illimitable disgust was from a yankee  meantime he turned over his poems and made barbara copy out a ballad he had written for the travellers joy on some local tradition in the tyrol  he offered this to a magazine whose editor a lady was an occasional frequenter of mrs brownlows evenings  the next time she came she showed herself so much interested in the legend that allen said he should like to show her another story which he had written for the same domestic periodical  would it serve for our christmas number  i will have it copied out and send it for you to look at said allen  if it is at hand i had better cast my eye over it to judge whether it be worth while to copy it  i shall set forth on my holiday journey the day after tomorrow and i should like to have my mind at rest about my christmas number  so she carried off with her the algerine number of the joy and in a couple of days returned it with a hasty note—  a capital little story just young and sentimental enough to make it taking and not overdone  please let me have it with a few verbal corrections ready for the press when i come home at the end of september  it will bring you in about £15  allen was modestly elated and only wished he had gone to one of the periodicals more widely circulated  it was plain that literature was his vocation and he was going to write a novel to be published in a serial the instalments paying his expenses for the trial  the only doubt was what it should be about whether a sporting tale of modern life or a historical story in which his familiarity with italian art and scenery would be available  jock advised the former armine inclined to the latter for each had tried his hand in his own particular line in the travellers joy and wanted to see his germ developed  to write in the heat and glare of london was however manifestly impossible in allens eyes and he must recruit himself by a yachting expedition to which an old acquaintance had invited him half compassionately  jock shrugged his shoulders on hearing of it and observed that a tuft always expected to be paid in service if in no other way and he doubted allens liking it but that was his affair jock himself with his usual facility of making friends had picked up a big northcountry student twice as large as himself with whom he meant to walk through the scenery of derbyshire and yorkshire as far as the modest sum they allowed themselves would permit after which he was to make a brief stay in his friends paternal cumberland farm he had succeeded in gaining a scholarship at the medical school of his fathers former hospital and this with the remains of the price of his commission still made him the rich man of the family  john was of course going home and mrs brownlow and the two younger ones had a warm invitation from their friends at fordham  i should like armie to go said the mother in conference with babie her cabinet councillor  o yes armie must go said babie but—  then it will not disappoint you to stay at home my dear  i had much rather not go if sydney will not mind very much  well babie i had resolved to stay here this summer and i thought you would not wish to go without me  o no no no no mother and her face and neck burnt with blushes  then my infanta and i will be thoroughly cosy together and get some surprises ready for the others  hurrah  well do the painting of the doors  what fun it will be to see london empty  the male population were horribly scandalised at the decision  jock and armine wanted to give up their journey and john implored his aunt to come to kencroft but she only promised to send babie there if she saw signs of flagging and the infanta laughed at the notion and said she had had an overdose of country enough to last her for years  allen said ladies overdid everything and that mother carey could not help being one of the sex and then he asked her for £10 and said babie would have plenty of time to copy out the single eye  she pouted i thought you were going to put the finishing touches  ive marked them for you  why barbara i am surprised he added in an elder brotherly tone you ought to be thankful to be able to be useful  useful  ive lots of things to do  and you  as if i could lug that great ms of yours about with me on board apthorpes yacht  never mind allen said his mother who had not been intended to hear all this  i will do it for you but miss editor must not laugh at my peaked governessy hand  i did not mean that mother only babie ought not to be disobliging  babie has a good deal to do  she has an essay to write for her professor you know and her hands are pretty full  babie too said mother i never meant you to undertake it  please let me have it now  only allen will never do anything for himself that he can get any one else to do  he could not well do it on board the yacht my dear  and i dont want you to have so much writing on your hands  and so you punish me sighed barbara more annoyed than penitent  however nothing could be more snug and merry than the mother and daughter when left together for they were like two sisters and suited one another perfectly  babie was disappointed that london would not look emptier even in the fashionable squares which she insisted on exploring in search of solitude  they made little gay outings in a joyous spirit of adventure getting up early and going by train to some little station with an adjacent expanse of wood or heather whence they came home with their luncheon basket full of flowers wherewith to gladden mrs lucass eyes and those of mother careys district  they prepared their surprises too  several hopelessly dingy panels were painted black and adorned with stately lilies and irises with proud reedmaces and twining honeysuckle and bryony fluttered over by dragonflies and butterflies from the brush of mother and daughter  the stores from belforest further supplied hangings for brackets and coverings for cushions under the dainty fingers of the infanta who had far more of the household fairy about her than had her mother perhaps from having grown up in a home instead of a school and besides from being bent on having the old house a delightsome place  indeed her mother was really happier than for many years for the sense of failing in her husbands charge had left her since she had seen jock by his own free will on the road to the quest and likely also to fulfil the moral as well as the scientific conditions attached to it  she did feel as if her dream was being realised and the golden statues becoming warmed into life and though her heart ached for janet she still hoped for her  so with a mothers unfailing faith she believed in allens dawning future even while another sense within her marvelled as she copied at the acceptance of the single eye  but then was it not wellknown that loving eyes see the most faults and was not an editor the best judge of popularity  she had her scheme too  she had taken lessons some years ago at rome in her old art of modelling and knew her eye and taste had improved in the galleries  she had once or twice amused the household by figures executed by her dexterous fingers in pastry or in butter and in the empty house in her old studio amid remnants of bobuss museum she set to work on a design that had long been in her mind asking her to bring it into being  thus the teteatete was so successful that peoples pity was highly diverting and the vacation was almost too brief though when the young men began to return it was a wonder how existence could have been so agreeable without them  jock was first having come home ten days sooner than his friends were willing to part with him determined if he found his ladies looking pale to drag them out of town if only to ramsgate  they met him in a glow of animation and babie hardly gave him time to lay down his basket of ferns from the dale and flowers from the garden before she threw open the folding doors to the back drawing room  why mother who sent you that group  why do you laugh  did grinstead lend it to babie to copy  young astyanax isnt it  and i say  andromache is just like jessie  i say  mother carey didnt do it  well  she is an astonishing little mother and no mistake the moulding of it  our anatomical professor might lecture on hectors arm  ah i havent been a surgeons wife for nothing  your father put me through a course of arms and legs  and we borrowed a baby said babie  mrs jones our old grooms wife who lives in the mews was only too happy to bring it and when it was shy it clung beautifully  then the helmet  that was out of the british museum  has grinstead seen it  no i kept it for my own public first  what will you do with it  put it into the royal academy  no it is not big enough  i thought of offering it to the works that used to take my things in the old folly days  they might do it in terra cotta or parian  too good for a toy material like that said jock  get some good opinion before you part with it mother  i wish we could keep it im proud of my mother carey  allen who came home next only sighed at the cruel necessity of selling such a work  he was in deplorable spirits for gilbert gould was superintending the refitting of a beautiful steam yacht in which miss menella meant to sail to the west indies with her uncle and aunt  i knew she would  i knew she would softly said babie  that did not console allen and his silence and cynicism about his hosts gave the impression that he had outstayed his welcome since he had neither wealth nor the social brilliance or subservience that might have supplied its place  he had scarcely energy to thank his mother for her faultless transcription of the single eye and only just exerted himself to direct the neat roll of ms to the editor  the next day a note came for him  mother what have you done he exclaimed  what did you send to the weathercock  the single eye  what  not rejected  see there   dear mr brownlow—i am afraid there has been some mistake  the story i wished for is not this one but another in the same ms magazine a charming little history of a boys capture by and escape from the moorish corsairs  can you let me have it by tuesday  i am very sorry to have given so much trouble but the single eye will not suit my purpose at all   what does she mean demanded allen  i see it is a story of the childrens marcos felucca i looked at it while i was copying and thought how pretty it was  and now i remember there were some pencilmarks  well it will please the children graciously said allen  i am not sorry i did not wish to make my debut in a secondrate serial like that and now i am quit of it  she is quite right  it is not her style of thing  but allen did not remember that he had spent the £15 beforehand so as to make it £25 and this made it fortunate that his mothers group had been purchased by the porcelain works and another pair ordered  thus she could freely leave their gains to armine and babie for the latter declared the sum was alike due to both since if she had the readiest wit her brother had the most discrimination and the best choice of language  the story was only signed a b and their mother made a point of the authorship being kept a secret but little notices of the story in the papers highly gratified the young authors  armine who had returned from a round of visits to st cradockes fordham kenminster and woodside confirmed the report of elviras intended voyage but till the yacht was ready the party had gone abroad leaving the management of the farm and agency of the estate to a very worthy man named whiteside who had long been a suitor to mary gould and whom she was at last allowed to marry  he had at once made the kencroft party free of the park and gardens and indeed john and armine came laden with gifts in poultry fruit and flowers from the dependants on the estate to mrs brownlow  armine really looked quite healthy nothing remaining of his former ethereal air but a certain expansiveness of brow and dreaminess of eye  he greatly scrupled at halving the £15 when it was paid but barbara insisted that he must take his share and he then said—  after all it does not signify for we can do things together with it as we have always done  what things  well i am afraid i do want a few books  so do i terribly  and there are some christmas gifts i want to send to woodside  woodside oh  and wouldnt it be pleasant to put the choir at the iron church into surplices and cassocks for christmas  oh armie i do think we might have a little fun out of our own money  what fun do you mean said armine  i want to subscribe to rolandis and to take in the contemporary and to have one real good christmas party with tableaux vivants and charades  mother says we cant make it a mere surprise party for people must have real food and i think it would be more pleasure to all of us than presents and knicknacks  of course you can do it said armine rather disappointed  and if we had in percy stagg and the pupil teachers and the mission people—  it would be awfully edifying and goodbooky  oh yes to be sure nearly as good as hiding your little sooty shoeblacks in surplices but my dear armie i am so tired of edifying  why should i never have any fun  come dont look so dismal  ill spare five shillings for a gown for old betty grey and if theres anything left out after the party you shall have it for the surplices and youll be roland graeme in my tableau  the next day mother carey found armine with an elbow on each side of his book and his hands in his hair looking so dreamily mournful that she apprehended a fresh attack of petronella but made her approaches warily  what have you there she asked  dean churchs lectures he said  ah  i want to make time to read them  but why have they sent you into doleful dumps  not they said armine but i wanted to read babie a passage just now and she said she had no notion of making sundays of week days and ran away  it is not only that mother but what is the matter with babie  she is quite different  have you only just seen it  no i have felt something indefinable between us though i never could bear to speak of it ever since bobus went  do you think he did her any harm  a little but not much shall i tell you the truth armine can you bear it  what did i disgust her when i was so selfish and discontented  not so much you my boy as the overdoing at woodside  i can venture to speak of it now for i fancy you have got over the trance  well mother said armine smiling back to her in spite of himself i have not liked to say so it seemed a shame but staying at the vicarage made me wonder at my being such an egregious ass last year do you know i couldnt help it but that good lady would seem to me quite mawkish in her flattery  and how she does domineer over that poor brother of hers  then the fuss she makes about details never seeming to know which are accessories and which are principles  i dont wonder that i was an absurdity in the eyes of all beholders but it is very sad if it has really alienated my dear infanta from all deeper and higher things  not so bad as that my dear my babie is a good little girl  oh yes mother i did not mean—  but it did break that unity between you and prevent your leading her insensibly  i fancy your two characters would have grown apart anyhow but this was the moving cause  now i fancy so far as i can see that she is more afraid of being wearied and restrained than of anything else  it is just what i felt for many years of my life  no mother  yes my boy till the time of your illness serious thought religion and all the rest seemed to me a tedious tax and though i always i believe made it a rule to my conscience in practical matters it has only very very lately been anything like the real joy i believe it has always been to you  believe that and be patient with your little sister for indeed she is an unselfish true faithful little being and some day she will go deeper  armine looked up to his mother and his eyes were full of tears as she kissed him and said—  you will do her much more good if you sympathise with her in her innocent pleasures than if you insist on dragging her into what she feels like privations  very well mother he said  it is due to her  and so though the choir did have at least half armines share of the price of marcos felucca he threw himself most heartily into the christmas party was the poet of the versified charade acted the strongminded woman who was the chief character in blue bell and he and jock gained universal applause  allen hardly appeared at the party  he had a fresh attack of sleepless headache and palpitation brought on by the departure of miss menella for the continent and perhaps by the failure of a single eye with some of the magazines  he dabbled a little with his mothers clay and produced a nymph who as he persuaded her and himself was a much nobler performance than andromache but unfortunately she did not prove equally marketable  and he said it was quite plain that he could not succeed in anything imaginative till his health and spirits had recovered from the blow but he was ready to do anything  so dr medlicott brought in one day a medical lecture that he wanted to have translated from the german and told allen that it would be well paid for  he began but it made his head ache it was not a subject that he could well turn over to babie and when jock brought a message to say the translation must be ready the next day only a quarter had been attempted  jock sat up till three oclock in the morning and finished it but he could not pain his mother by letting her know that her son had again failed so allen had the money and really believed as he said that all jock had done was to put the extreme end to it and correct the medical lingo of which he could not be expected to know anything  allen was always so gentle courteous and melancholy that every one was getting out of the habit of expecting him to do anything but bring home news discover anything worth going to see sit at the foot of the table and give his verdict on the cookery  babie indeed was sometimes provoked into snapping at him but he bore it with the amiable magnanimity of one who could forgive a petulant child ignorant of what he suffered  jock was borne up by a great pleasure that winter  one day at dinner his mother watched his eyes dancing and heard the old boyish ring of mirth in his laugh and as she went up stairs at night he came after and said—  fancy i met evelyn on the ice today  he wants to know if he may call  what prevents him  well i believe the poor old chap is heartily ashamed of his airs indeed he as good as said so  he has been longing to make a fresh start only he didnt know how  i think he used you very ill jock but if you wish to be on the old terms i will do as you like  well said jock in an odd apologetic voice you see the old beggar had got into a pigheaded sort of pet last year  he said he would cut me if i left the service and so he felt bound to be as good as his word but he seems to have felt lost without us and to have been looking out for a chance of meeting  he was horribly humiliated by the friar looking over his head last week  very well  if he chooses to call here we are  yes and dont put on your cold shell mother mine  after all evelyn is evelyn  there are wiser fellows but i shall never warm to any one again like him  why he was the first fellow who came into my room at eton  i am to meet him tomorrow after the lecture  may i bring him home  if he likes  his mothers son must have a welcome  she could not feel cordial and she so much expected that the young gentleman might be seized with a fresh fit of exclusive disdain that she would not mention the possibility and it was an amazement to all save herself when jock appeared with the familiar figure in his wake guardsman as he was cecil had the grace to look bashful not to say shamefaced and more so at mrs brownlows kindly reception than at barbaras freezing dignity  the young lady was hotly resentful on jocks behalf and showed it by a stiff courtesy elevated eyebrows and the merest tips of her fingers  allen took it easily  he had been too much occupied with his own troubles to have entered into all the complications with the evelyn family and though he had never greatly cared for them and had viewed cecil chiefly as an obnoxious boy he was in his mournful way gratified by any reminder of his former surroundings  so without malice prepense he stung poor cecil by observing that it was long since they had met but no one could be expected to find the way to the other end of nowhere  cecil blushed and stammered something about hounslow but allen who prided himself on being the conversational man of the world carried off the talk into safe channels  as cecil was handing mrs brownlow down to the diningroom wicked barbara whispered to her cousin john—  weve such a nice vulgar dinner  it couldnt have been better if id known it  john whose wrath had evaporated in his cut shook his head at her but partook of her diversion at her brothers resignation at sight of a large dish of boiled beef with a suet pudding opposite to it allen was too well bred to apologise but he carved in the dainty and delicate style befitting the single slice of meat interspersed between countless entrees  barbara began to relent as soon as cecil after making four mouthfuls of allens help sent his plate with a request for something more substantial  and before the meal was over his evident sense of bienetre and happiness had won back her kindness she remembered that he was sydneys brother and took no more trouble to show her indignation  thenceforth cecil was as much as ever jocks friend and a frequenter of the family finding that the loss of their wealth and place in the great world made wonderfully little difference to them and rather enhanced the pleasant freedom and life of their house the rest of the family were seen once or twice when passing through london but only in calls which as babie said were as good as nothing except as she forgot to add that they broke through the constraint on her correspondence with sydney     chapter xxxv  the phantom blackcock of kilnaught    and we alike must shun regard from painter player sportsman bard wasp bluebottle or butterfly insects that swim in fashions sky                                      scott   at home  then take these  theres a lot more  ill run up said cecil evelyn one october evening nearly two years later as he thrust into the arms of the parlourmaid a whole bouquet of game while his servant extracted a hamper from his cab and he himself dashed up stairs with a great basket of hothouse flowers  but in the drawingroom he stood aghast glancing round in the firelit dusk to ascertain that he had not mistaken the number for though the maid at the door had a wellknown face and though tables chairs and pictures were familiar the two occupants of the room were utter strangers and at least as much startled as himself  a little pale child was hurriedly put down from the lap of a tall maiden who rose from a low chair by the fire and stood uncertain  i beg your pardon he said i came to see mrs brownlow  my aunt  she will be here in a moment  will you run and call her lina  you may tell her cecil evelyn is here said he but there is no hurry he added seeing that the child clung to her protector too shy even to move  you are john brownlows little sister eh he added bending towards her but as she crept round in terror still clinging he addressed the elder one i am so glad i thought i had rushed into a strange house and should have to beat a retreat  the young lady gave a little shy laugh which made her sweet oval glowing face and soft brown eyes light up charmingly and there was a fresh graceful roundness of outline about her tall slender figure as she stood holding the shy child which made her a wondrously pleasant sight  are you staying here he asked  yes we came for advice for my little sister who is not strong  im so glad  i mean i hope there is only enough amiss to make you stay a long time  were you ever in town before  only for a few hours on our way to school  here a voice reached them—             fee fa fum            i smell the breath of geranium   and through the back drawingroom door came babie in walking attire declaiming—             tis cecil by the jingling steel            tis cecil by the pawing bay            tis cecil by the tall twowheel            tis cecil by the fragrant spray   o cecil how lovely  oh the maidenhair  youve been making acquaintance with essie and lina  i did not know you were out babie said essie  was my aunt with you  yes  we just ran over to see mrs lucas and as we were coming home a poor woman besought us to buy two toastingforks and a mouse trap by way of ornament to brandish in the streets  she looked so frightfully wretched that mother let her follow and is having it out with her at the door  so you are from fordham cecil i see and i smell  how are they  duke is rather brisk  i actually got him out shooting yesterday but he didnt half like it and was thankful when i let him go home again  see sydney said i was to tell you that passionflower came from the plant she brought from algiers  the beauty  it must go into mrs evelyns venice glass said babie bustling about to collect her vases  lina with a cry of delight clutched at a spray of butterflylike mauve and white orchids in spite of her sisters gentle no no lina you must not touch  babie offered some china asters in its stead cecil muttered let her have it but esther was firm in making her relinquish it and when she began to cry led her away with pretty tender gestures of mingled comfort and reproof  poor little thing said babie she is sadly fretful  nobody but essie can manage her  i should think not said cecil looking after the vision as if he did not know what he was saying  you never told me you had any one like that in the family  o yes there are two of them as much alike as two peas  what the monks sisters  to be sure  they are a comely family all but poor little lina  will they be long here   that depends  that poor little mite is the youngest but one and the nurse likes boys best  so she peaked and pined and was bullied by edmund above and harry below and was always in trouble  nobody but johnny and essie ever had a good word for her  this autumn it came to a crisis  you know we had a great meeting of the two families at walmer and there the shock of bathing nearly took out of her all the little life there was  i believe she would have gone into fits if mother had not heard her screams and dashed on the nurse like a vindictive mermaid and then made uncle robert believe her  my aunt trusts the nurse you must know and lets her ride roughshod over every one in the nursery  the poor little thing was always whining and fretting whenever she was not in essies arms or the monks till the monk declared she had a spine and he and mother gave uncle and aunt no peace till they brought her here for advice and sure enough her poor little spine is all wrong and will never be good for anything without a regular course of watching and treatment so we have her here with essie to look after her for as long as sir edward fane wants to keep her under him and you cant think what a nice little mortal she turns out to be now she is rescued from nurse and those little ruffians of brothers  thats firstrate remarked cecil  the eucharis and maidenhair is it not  i must keep some sprays for our hairs tonight  is any one coming tonight  the promiscuous herd  oh didnt you know  our johns told mother it would be no end of kindness to let them bring in a sprinkling of their fellowstudents—poor lads that live poked up in lodgings and never see a lady or any civilisation all through the term  so she took to having them on thursday once a fortnight and dr medlicott was perfectly delighted and said she could not do a better work and it is such fun  we dont have them unmitigated we get other people to enliven them  the actons are coming and i hope mr esdale is coming tonight to show us his photographs of the lost cities in central america  youll stay wont you  if mrs brownlow will let me  i hope your toastingfork woman has not spirited her away  under the eyes of your horse and man  are you all at home  and has allen finished his novel  babie laughed and said—  poor ali  you see there comes a fresh blight whenever it begins to bud  what has that wretched girl been doing now  oh dont you know  the yacht had to be overhauled so they went to florence instead and have been wandering about in all the resorts of rather shady people where lisette can cut a figure  mr wakefield is terribly afraid that even poor mr gould himself is taking to gambling for want of something to do  there are always reports coming of elfie taking up with some count or baron  it was a russian prince last time and then ali goes down into the very lowest depths and cant do anything but smoke  you know thats good for blighted beings  i cure my plants by putting them into his room surreptitiously  you are a hardhearted little mortal babie  ah theres the bell  mrs brownlow came in with the two johns who had joined her just as she had finished talking to the poor woman jock carried off his friend to dress and babie after finishing her arrangements and making the most of every fragment of flower or leaf repaired with a selection of delicate sprays to the room where esther having put her little sister to bed was dressing for dinner  she was eager to tell of her alarm at the invasion and of captain evelyns good nature when she had expected him to be proud and disagreeable  he wanted to be said babie but honest nature was too strong for him  johnny was so angry at the way he treated jock  o we quite forget all that  poor fellow it was a mistaken reading of noblesse oblige and he is very much ashamed of it  there let me put this fern and fuchsia into your hair  ill try to do it as well as ellie would  she did so and better being more daintyfingered and having more taste  it really was an artistic pleasure to deal with such beautiful hair and such a lovely lay figure as esthers  with all her queenly beauty and grace the girl had that simplicity and sedateness which often goes with regularity of feature and was hardly conscious of the admiration she excited  her good looks were those of the family and kenminster was used to them  this was her first evening of company for on the only previous occasion her little sister had been unwell sleepless and miserable in the strange house and she had begged off  she was very shy now and could not go down without barbaras protection so at the last moment before dinner the little brown fairy led in the tall stately maiden all in white with the bright fuchsias and delicate fern in her dark hair and a creamy rose set off by a few more in her bosom  babie exulted in her work and as her mother beheld cecils raptured glance and the incarnadine glow it called up she guessed all that would follow in one rapid prevision accompanied by a sharp pang for her son in japan  it was not in her maternal heart not to hope almost against her will that some fibre had been touched by bobus that would be irresponsive to others but duty and loyalty alike forbade the slightest attempt to revive the thought of the poor absentee and she must steel herself to see things take their course and own it for the best  esther was a silent damsel  the clash of keen wits and exchange of family repartee were quite beyond her  she had often wondered whether her cousins were quarrelling and had been only reassured by seeing them so merry and friendly and her own brother bearing his part as naturally as the rest  she was more scandalised than ever today for it absolutely seemed to her that they were all treating captain evelyn long moustache and all like a mere family butt certainly worse than they would have treated one of her own brothers for rob would have sulked and joe or any of the younger ones might have been dangerous whereas this distinguishedlooking personage bore all as angelically as befitted one called by such a charming appellation as the honourable cecil evelyn  how about the shooting cecil  sydney said you had not very good sport  why—no not till i joined rainsforths party  where was your moor  in lanarkshire rather unwillingly  eh said allen in a peculiar soft languid tone that meant diversion  near l—  yes  then jock burst out into laughter inexplicable at first but allen made his voice gentler and graver as he said you dont mean kilnaught and then he too joined jock in laughter as the latter cried—  another victim to mcnab of kilnaught  he certainly is the canniest of scots  he revenges the wrongs of scotland on innocent young guardsmen  well im sure there could not be a more promising advertisement  thats just it said jock  moor and moss  how many acres of heather  how was i to expect a man of family to be a regular swindler  hush hush my dear fellow  roderick dhu was a man of family  it is the modern form  but i saw his keeper  oh cried allen  i know  old rory  tells you a long story in broad scotch of which you understand one word here and there about his grace the deuke and how many miles—miles scots—he walked  i can see evelyn listening and saying yes at polite intervals  how many birds did you actually see  well i killed two brace and a half the first day  hatched under a hen and let out for a foretaste  and there was one old blackcock  that blackcock  there are serious doubts whether it is a phantom bird or whether rory keeps it tame as a decoy  you didnt kill it  no  if you had you might have boasted of an achievement said allen  the spell would have been destroyed added jock  but you did not let him finish  did you say you saw the blackcock  i am not sure i think i heard it rise once but the keeper was always seeing it  everybody but essie was in fits of laughing at cecils frank air of goodhumoured selfdefensive simplicity and armine observed  theres a fine subject for a ballad for the travellers joy babie  the phantom blackcock of kilnaught  babie extemporised at once amid great applause—             the hills are high the lairds purse dry              come out in the morning early            mcnabs are keen the guards are green              the blackcocks tail is curly            the southrons spoil tis worthy toil              come out in the morning early            come take my house and kill my grouse              the blackcocks tail is curly            come out come out quoth rory stout              come out in the morning early            sir captain mark he rises hark             the blackcocks tail is curly   repetition babie said her mother too like the montjoie s denis poem  it saves so much trouble mother  and a recall to the freshness and innocence of childhood is so pleasing added jock  how much did the man of family let his moor for asked allen  there cecil saw the pitiful and indignant face opposite to him would have sulked and began looking at her for sympathy exclaiming at last—  havent you a word to say for me miss brownlow  i dont like it at all  i dont think it is fair broke from essie as she coloured crimson at the laugh  he likes it my dear said babie  it is a gentle titillation said allen  he cant get on without it said the friar  and comes for it like the cattle to the scrubbingstones said the skipjack  yes said armine but he tries to get pitied like chico walking on three legs when some one is looking at him  you deal in most elegant comparisons said the mother  only to get him a little more pitied said jock  he is as grateful as possible for being made so interesting  hark theres a knock cried allen  cant you instruct your cubs not to punish the door so severely jock  i believe they think that the more row they make the more they proclaim their nobility  the obvious derivation of the word stunning said mother carey as she rose to meet her guests in the drawingroom and cecil to hold the door for her  stay evelyn said allen this is the night when unlicked cubs do disport themselves in our precincts  a mistaken sense of philanthropy has led my mother to make this house the fortnightly salon bleu of st thomass  but theres a pipe at your service in my room  dr medlicott is coming said babie who had tarried behind the johns and perhaps mr grinstead and we are sure to have mr esdales photographs  it is never all students medical or otherwise  much better than allens smoke cecil  i am coming of course he said  i was only waiting for the infanta  it may be doubted whether the photographs dr medlicott or even jock were the attraction  he was much more fond of using his privilege of dropping in when the family were alone than of finding himself in the midst of what an american guest had called mrs brownlows surprise parties  they were on regular evenings but no one knew who was coming from scientific peers to daily governesses from royal academicians to medical students from a philanthropic countess to a city missionary  to listen to an exposition of the microphone to share in a shakespeare reading or worse still in a paper game was in the captains eyes such a bore that he generally had only haunted collingwood street on home days and on sundays when for his mothers sake and his own an exception was made in his favour  he followed babie with unusual alacrity and found mrs brownlow shaking hands with a youth whom jock upheld as a genius but who laboured under the double misfortune of always coming too soon and never knowing what to do with his arms and legs  he at once perceived captain evelyn to be an awful swell and became trebly wretched—in contrast to jocks openhearted genial young dalesman who stood towering over every one with his broad shoulders and hearty face perfectly at his ease as he would have been in buckingham palace and only wondering a little that brownlow could stand an emptyheaded military fop like that while cecil himself after gazing about vaguely muttered to babie something about her cousin  she is gone to see whether lina is asleep and will be too shy to come down again if i dont drag her  so away flew babie and more eyes than cecil evelyns were struck when in ten minutes time she again led in her cousin  mr acton who was talking to mrs brownlow said in an undertone—  your model  another niece  yes you remember jessie  this is a more ideal face  it was true  esther had lived much less than her elder sister in the coffinkey atmosphere and there was nothing to mar the peculiar dignified innocence and perfect unconsciousness of her sweet maidenly bloom  she never guessed that every man and every woman too was admiring her except the strongminded one who saw in her the true inane raffaelesque madonna on whom george eliot is so severe  nor did the lady alter her opinion when at the end of a very curious speculation about primeval american civilisation captain evelyn and miss brownlow were discovered studying family photographs in a corner apparently much more interested whether a hideous halffaded brown shadow had resembled john at fourteen than to what century and what nation those odd curlywhirleys on stone belonged and what they were meant to express  babie was scandalised  you didnt listen  it was most wonderful  why armie went down and fetched up allen to hear about those wonderful walled towns  i dont go in for improving my mind said cecil  then you should not hinder essie from improving hers  think of letting her go home having seen nothing but all the repeated photographs of her brothers and sisters  well what should she like to see cried cecil  im good for anything you want to go to before the others are free  the ethiopian serenaders or may be punch said jock  madame tussaud would be too intellectual  when lina is strong enough she is to see madame tussaud said essie gravely  georgie once went and she has wished for it ever since  oh well get up madame tussaud for her at home free gratis for nothing at all cried armine whose hard work inspirited him to fun and frolic  so in the twilight hour two days later there was a grand exhibition of human waxworks in which babie explained tableaux represented by the two johns armine and cecil supposed to be adapted to linas capacity  with the timid child it was not a success the disguises frightened her and gave her an uncanny feeling that her friends were transformed she sat most of the time on her aunts lap with her face hidden and barely hindered from crying by the false assurance that it was all for her pleasure  but there was no doubt that esther was a pleased spectator of the show and her gratitude far more than sufficient to cover the little ones ingratitude  those two drifted together  in every gathering when strangers had departed they were found teteatete  cecils horses knew the way to collingwood street better than anywhere else and he took to appearing there at times when he was fully aware jock would be at the nightschool or mutual improvement society  though strongly wishing on poor bobuss account that it should not go much farther under her own auspices day after day it was more borne in upon mrs brownlow that her house held an irresistible attraction to the young officer and she wondered over her duty to the parents who had trusted her  acting on impulse at last she took council with john securing him as her companion in the gaslit walk from a concert  do you see what is going on there she asked indicating the pair before them  what do you mean  oh i never thought of that  i dont think  i have seen  ever since the night of the phantom blackcock of kilnaught  he did his work on essie  essie rather thinks he is after the infanta  it looks like it   what could have put it into her head  it did not originate there  something my mother said about babie being a viscountess  you know better friar  i thought so but i only told her it was no such thing and i believe the child thought i meant to rebuke her for mentioning such frivolities for she turned scarlet and held her peace  perhaps the delusion has kept her unconscious and made her the sweeter  but the question is whether this ought to go on without letting your people know  i suppose they would have no objection said john  theres no harm in evelyn and he shows his sense by running after jock  he hasnt got the family health either  id rather have him than an old stick like jessies general  yes if all were settled i believe your mother would be very well pleased  the question is whether it is using her fairly not to let her know in the meantime  well what is the code among you parents and guardians  i dont know that there is any but i think that though the crisis might be pleasing enough yet if your mother found out what was going on she might be vexed at not having been informed  john considered a moment and then proposed that if things looked like it at the end of the week he should go down on saturday and give a hint of preparation to his father letting him understand the merits of the case  however in the existing state of affairs a week was a long time and that very sunday brought the crisis  the recollection of former london sundays of mary ogilvies quiet protests and of the effect on her two eldest children had strengthened mrs brownlows resolution to make it impossible to fill the afternoon with aimless visiting and gossiping and plenty of other occupations had sprung up  thus on this particular afternoon she and barbara were with their girls friendly society classes of which babie took the clever one and she the stupid  armine was reading with percy stagg and a party of school board pupilteachers whom that youth had brought him as very anxious for the religious instruction they knew not how to obtain  jock had taken the friars bible class of young men and allen had as a great favour undertaken to sit with dr and mrs lucas till he could look in on them  so that esther and lina were the sole occupants of the drawingroom when captain evelyn rang at the door knowing very well that he was only permitted up stairs an hour later in time for a cup of tea before evensong  he did look into allens sittingroom as a matter of form but finding it empty and hearing a buzz of voices elsewhere he took licence to go upstairs and there he found esther telling her little sister such histories of arundel society engravings as she could comprehend  lina sprang to him at once esther coloured and began to account for the rest of the family  i hear said cecil as low tones came through the closed doors of the back drawingroom they work as hard here as my sister does  i think my aunt has almost done said essie with a shy doubt whether she ought to stay  come lina i must get you ready for tea  no no said cecil dont go  you need not be as much afraid of me as that first time i walked in and thought i had got into a strange house  essie laughed a little and said a month ago  sometimes it seems a very long time and sometimes a very short one  i hope it seems a very long time that you have known me  well johnny and all the rest had known you ever so long answered she with a confusion of manner that expressed a good deal more than the words  i really must go—  not till you have told me more than that cried cecil seizing his opportunity with a sudden rush of audacity  if you know me can you—can you like me  cant you  oh essie stay  could you ever love me you peerless sweetest loveliest—  by this time mrs brownlow who had heard cecils boots on the stairs and particularly wished to stave matters off till after the friars mission had made a hasty conclusion of her lesson and letting her girls depart opened the door  she saw at once that she was too late but there was no retreat for esther flew past her in shy terror and cecil advanced with the earnest innocent entreaty oh mrs brownlow make her hear me  i must have it out or i cant bear it  oh said she it has come to this has it speaking half quaintly halfsadly and holding lina kindly back  i could not help it he went on  she did look so lovely and she is so dear  do get her down that i may see her again  i shall not have a happy moment till she answers me  are you sure you will have a happy moment then  i dont know  thats the thing  wont you help a fellow a bit mrs brownlow  im quite done for  there never was any one so nice or so sweet or so lovely or so unlike all the horrid girls in society  oh make her say a kind word to me  ill make her said little lina looking up from her aunts side i like you very much captain evelyn and ill run and make essie tell you she does  not quite so fast my dear said her aunt as both laughed and cecil solacing himself with a caress and holding the little one very close to him on his knee where her intentions were deferred by his watch and appendages  i suppose you dont know what your mother would say began mrs brownlow  i have not told her but you know yourself she would be all right now arent you sure mrs brownlow  she isnt up to any nonsense  no cecil i dont think she would oppose it  indeed my dear boy i wish you happiness but esther is a shy startled little being and away from her mother and perhaps you will have to be patient  but will you fetch her—or at least speak to her said he in a tone not very like patience and she had to yield and be the messenger  she found esther fluttering up and down her room like a newlycaught bird  oh aunt carey i must go home  please let me she said  nay my dear cant i help you for once and esther sprang into her arms for comfort but even then it was plain to a motherly eye that this was not the distress that poor bobus had caused but rather the agitation of a newlyawakened heart terrified at its own sensations he wants you to come and hear him out she said when she had kissed and petted the girl into more composure  oh must i  i dont want  oh if i could go home  they were so angry before  and i only said if and never meant—  that was the very thing my dear said her aunt with a great throb of pain  you were quite right not to encourage my poor bobus but this is a very different case and i am sure they would wish you to act according as you feel  esther drew a great gasp  you are sure they would not think me wrong  quite sure was the reply in full security that her mother would be rapturous at the nearly certain prospect of a coronet  indeed my dear no one can find any fault with you  you need not be afraid he is good and worthy and they will be glad if you wish it  wish was far too strong a word for poor frightened esther she could only cling and quiver  shall i tell him to go and see them at kencroft  oh do do dear aunt carey  please tell him to go to papa and not want to see me till—  very well my dear child that will be the best way  now i will send you up some tea and then you shall put lina to bed and you and i will slip off quietly together and go to st andrews in peace quite in a different direction from the others before they set out  meantime cecil had been found by babie tumbling about the music and newspapers on the ottoman and on her observation—  too soon sir  and pray what mischief still have your idle hands found to do  dont he burst out im on the verge of distraction already i cant bear it  is there anything the matter  youre not in a scrape  you dont want jock she said  no no—only ive done it  babie i shall go mad if i dont get an answer soon  babie was much too sharp not to see what he meant  she knew in a kind of intuitive undeveloped way how things stood with bobus and this gave a certain seriousness to her manner of saying—  essie  of course the darling  if your mother would only come and tell me—but she was frightened and wont say anything  if she wont im the most miserable fellow in the world  how stupid you must have been said babie  that comes of you neither of you ever reading  you couldnt have done it right cecil  do you really think so he asked in such piteous earnest tones that he touched her heart  dear cecil she said it will be all right  i know essie likes you better than any one else  she had almost added though she is an ungrateful little puss for doing so but before the words had time to come out of her mouth cecil had flown at her in a transport thrown his arms round her and kissed her just as her mother opened the door and uttered an odd incoherent cry of amazement  oh mother carey cried cecil colouring all over i didnt know what i was doing  she gave me hope  i give you hope too said caroline though i dont know how it might have been if she had come down just now  dont entreated cecil  babie is as good as my sister  why where is she  fled and no wonder  and wont she esther come  she is far too much frightened and overcome  she says you may go to her father and i think that is all you can expect her to say  is it  wont she see me  i dont want it to be obedience  i dont think you need have any fears on that score  you dont  really now  you think she likes me just a little  how soon can i get down  have you a trainbill  then during the quest into trains came a fit of humility  do you think they will listen to me  you are not the sort who would think me a catch and i know i am a very poor stick compared with any of you and should have gone to the dogs long ago but for jock ungrateful ass as i was to him last year  but if i had such a creature as that to take care of why it would be like having an angel about one  i would—indeed i would—reverence yes and worship her all my life long  i am sure you would  i think it would be a very happy and blessed thing for you both and i have no doubt that her father will think so too  now here are the others coming home and you must behave like a rational being even though you dont see essie at tea  mother carey managed to catch jock give a hint of the situation and bid him take care of his friend  he looked grave  i thought it was coming he said  i wish they would have done it out of our way  so do i but i didnt take measures in time  well it is all right as regards them both but poor bobus will hardly get over it  we must do our best to soften the shock and as it cant be helped we must put our feelings in our pocket  as one has to do most times said jock  well i suppose it is better for one in the end than having it all ones own way  and evelyn is a generous fellow who deserves anything  so jock as we can do bobus no good and know besides that nothing could make it right for his hopes to be fulfilled we must throw ourselves into this present affair as cecil and essie deserve  all right mother he said  theres not stuff in her to be of much use to bobus if he had her besides the other objection  it is the hope that he will sorely miss poor old fellow  ah if he had a better hope lighted as his guiding star  but we must not stand talking now jock i must take her to church quietly with me  to cecils consternation his military duties would detain him all the forenoon of the next day and before he could have started the train that brought john back also brought his father and mother the latter far more eager and effusive than her sisterinlaw had ever seen her  my dear caroline i thought youd excuse my coming i was so anxious to see about my little girl and well go to an hotel  ill leave you with her said caroline rushing off in haste to let esther utter her own story as best she might poor child  allen was fortunately in his room and his mother sprang down to him to warn him to telegraph to cecil that colonel brownlow was in collingwood street the fates being evidently determined to spare her nothing  allens feelings were far less keen as to bobus than were jocks and he liked the connection so he let himself be infected with the excitement and roused himself not only to telegraph but go himself to cecils quarters to make sure of him  it was well that he did so for just as he got into oxford street he beheld the wellknown bay fortunately caught in a block of omnibuses and carts round a tumble down cabhorse and some gasfitting  such was the impatience of the driver of the hansom that allen absolutely had to rush desperately across the noses of halfadozen horses making wild gestures before he was seen and taken up by cecils side  the most wonderful thing of all said cecil afterwards was to see allen going on like that  in consequence of his speed colonel and mrs brownlow had hardly arrived at esthers faltered story and come to a perception which way her heart lay when she started and cried oh thats his hansom for she perfectly well knew the wheels  so did her aunt and babie who had taken refuge in the studio but came out at allens call to hear his adventures and thenceforth had to remain easily accessible babie to take charge of lina who was much aggrieved at her banishment and mother carey to be the recipient of all kinds of effusions from the different persons concerned  there was the mother such a nice young man  so superior  everything we could have wished  and so much attached speaks so nicely  you are sure there will be no trouble with his mother  i see no danger of it  i am sure she must love dear little esther and that she would like to see cecil married  well you know her but you know she might look much higher for him though the brownlows are a good old family  oh my dear caroline i shall never forget what you have done for us all  her serenity in a flutter was an amusing sight  she was so full of exultation and yet had too much propriety to utter the main point of her hopes fears doubts and gratitude and she durst not so much as hazard an inquiry after poor lord fordham lest she should be suspected of the thought that came uppermost  however the colonel with whom that possibility was a very secondary matter could speak out i like the lad he is a good simple honest fellow wellprincipled and all one could wish  i dont mind trusting little essie with him and he says his brother is sure to give him quite enough to marry upon so theyll do very well even if— how about that affair which was hinted of at belforest caroline  will it ever come off  probably not  poor lord fordhams health does not improve and so i am very thankful that he does not fulfil babies ideal  poor young man said ellen with sincere compassion but great relief  thats the worst of it said the father gravely  i am afraid it is a consumptive family though this young fellow looks hearty and strong  he has always been so said caroline  he and his sister are quite different in looks and constitution from poor fordham and i believe from the elder ones  they are shorter and sturdier and take after their mothers family  i told you so papa said ellen  i was sure nothing could be amiss with him  you cant expect everybody to look like our boys well caroline you have always been a good sister and to think of your having done this for little essie  tell me how it was  had you suspected it  it was all very commonplace and happy  colonel and mrs brownlow were squeezed into the house to await mrs evelyns reply and cecil and esther sat handinhand all the evening looking as allen and babie agreed like such a couple of idiots that the intimate connection between selig and silly was explained  mrs robert brownlow whiled away the next day by a grand shopping expedition followed by the lovers who seemed to find pillars of floorcloth and tracery of ironwork as blissful as ever could be pleached alley  nay one shopman flattered cecil and shocked esther by directing his exhibition of wares to them and the former was thus excited to think how soon they might be actually shopping on their own account and to fix his affections on an utterly impracticable fender as his domestic hearth  meanwhile caroline had only just come in from amusing mrs lucas with the story when a cab drove up and mrs evelyn was with her with an eager where are they  somewhere in the depths of the city with her mother shopping ought i to have told you  of course i trust you  she must be nice—your friars sister but i could not stay at home and duke wished me to come—  how is he  so very happy about this—the connection especially  i dont think he could have borne it if it had been the infanta  how is that dear babie  quite well  i left her walking with lina in the square gardens  as simple and untouched as ever  as much as ever a lighthearted baby  ah well so much the better  and let me say once for all that you need not fear any closer intercourse with us  my poor duke has made up his mind that such things are not for him and wishes all to be arranged for cecil as his heir  not that he is any worse  with care he may survive us all the doctors say but he has made up his mind and will never ask babie again  he says it would be cruel but he does long for a sight of her bright face  well we shall be brought into meeting in a simple natural way  and babie  how does she look  i am ashamed of it but i cant help thinking more about seeing her than this new cousin  i can fancy her—handsome composed and serene  that may be so ten or twenty years hence but now she is the tenderest little clinging thing you ever saw  and my ideal would have been that cecil should have chosen some one superior but after all i believe he is really more likely to be raised by being looked up to  he has been our boy too long  quite true i have watched him content with the level my impertinent children assign him here but now trying to be manly for essies sake  you have not told me of sydney  so angry at the folly of passing over babie that i was forced to give her a hint to be silent before duke  she collapsed much impressed  forgive me if it was a betrayal but she is two years older now and would not have been a safe companion unless warned hark  is that the doorbell  therewith the private interview period set in and babie made such use of her share of it that when lina was produced in the drawing room before dinner she sat on cecils knee and gravely observed that she had a verse to repeat to him—             the phantom blackcock of kilnaught            is a marvellous bird yet uncaught                go out in all weather                you see not a feather            yet a marvellous work it has wrought            that phantom blackcock of kilnaught   what is that verse you are saying lina said her mother  lina trotted across and repeated it while cecil shook his head at wicked babie  i hope you dont learn nursery rhymes about phantoms and ghosts lina said mrs robert brownlow  this is an original poem aunt ellen replied babie gravely  more original than practical said john  you havent accounted for the pronoun  oh never mind that  great poets are above rules  i want essie to promise us bridesmaids blackcock tails in our hats  my dear said her aunt in serious reproof shocked at the rapidity of the young ladys ideas  or at least added babie if she wont youll give us blackcock lockets cecil  they would be lovely—you know—enamelled  that i will he cried  and mother carey will you model me a group of the birds  that would be a jolly present  better than esthers head eh  i have done that three times and you shall choose one cecil  nothing would serve cecil but an immediate expedition to the studio to choose as well as they could by lamplight  and during the examination mrs evelyn managed to say to caroline im quite satisfied  she is as bright and childish as you told me  essie  no the infanta  if she is not a little too much so  oh no dont wish any difference in those high spirits  she makes it a cheerful house dear child and even allen has brightened lately  and jock  he looks hardworked but brisk as ever  he does work very hard in all ways but he thoroughly enjoys his work and is as much my sunshine as babie  there are golden opinions of him in the medical school indeed there are of both my johns  they are quite the foremost of the young men of their year and carry off most of the distinctions besides being leaders in influence  so dr medlicott told us said mrs evelyn and yet he said it was delightful to see how they avoided direct rivalry or else were perfectly friendly over it  yes they avoid when it is possible going in for the same things and indeed i think jock has more turn for the scientific side of the study and the friar for the practical  there is room for them both  and what a contrast they are  what a very handsome fellow john has grown  so tall and broad and strong with that fine colour and dark eyes as beautiful as his sisters  more beautiful i should say returned caroline there is so much more intellect in them—raising them out of the regular kencroft comeliness  true the great charm of the stalwart friar as we call him is—what his father has in some degree—that quiet composed way that gives one a sense of protection  i think his patients will feel entire trust in his hands  they say at the hospital the poor people always are happy when they see one of the mr brownlows coming whether it be the big or the little one  not so very little except by comparison and i am glad jock keeps his soldierly bearing  he is a volunteer you know and very valuable there  but he has not an ounce of superfluous flesh  he puts me in mind of a perfectly polished finished instrument  that is just what used to be said of his father  colonel brownlow says he is the most like my poor young father of all the children  he is the most like you  but he puts me most of all in mind of my husband in all his ways and manner and our old friends tell me that he sets about things exactly like his father as if it were by imitation  i like to know it is so     chapter xxxvi  of no consequence    fell not but dangled in mid air for from a fissure in the stone which lined its sides a bush had grown to this he clung with all his might                               archbishop trench   lord fordham made it his most especial and urgent desire that his brothers wedding which was to take place before lent should be at his home instead of at the ladys  otherwise he could not be present for kenminster had a character for bleakness and he was never allowed to travel in an english winter  besides he had set his heart on giving one grand festal day to his tenantry who had never had a day of rejoicing since his greatuncle came of age forty years ago  mrs robert brownlow did not like it at all either as an anomaly or as a disappointment to the kenminster world but her husband was won over and she was obliged to consent  mother carey with her brood were of course to be guests but her difficulty was the leaving dr and mrs lucas  the good old physician was failing fast and they had no kindred near at hand or capable of being of much comfort to them and she was considering how to steer between the two calls when jock settled it for her by saying that he did not mean to go to fordham and if mrs lucas liked would sleep in the house  there was much amazement and vexation  he had of course been the first best man thought of but he fought off declaring that he could not afford to miss a single lecture or demonstration  friar johns university studies had given him such a start that he had to work less hard than his cousin and could afford himself the week for which he was invited but jock declared that he could not even lose the thirtysix hours that armine was to take for the journey to fordham and back  every one declared this nonsense and even mrs lucas could not bear that he should remain as she thought on her account but his mother did not join in the public outcry and therefore was admitted to fuller insight as he was walking back with her after listening to the old ladys persuasions  i think she would really be better pleased to spare you for that one day said caroline  may be good old soul said jock but as you know mother thats not all  i guessed not  it may be wiser  well  theres no use in stirring it all up again after having settled down after a fashion said jock  i see clearer than ever how hopeless it is to have anything fit to offer a girl in her position for the next ten years and i must not get myself betrayed into drawing her in to wait for me  i am such an impulsive fool i dont know what i might be saying to her and it would not be a right return for all they have been to me  you will have to meet her in town  perhaps but not as if i were in the house and at the wedding  it would just bring back the time when she bade me never give up my sword  perhaps she is wiser now  that would make it even more likely that i should say what would be better left alone  no mother  ten years hence if—  she thought of magnum bonum and said sooner perhaps  no he said laughing  it is only in the travellers joy that all the bigwigs are out of sight and the apothecarys boy saved the lord mayors life  with that laugh rather a sad one he inserted the latchkey and ended the discussion  whether barbara were really unwilling to go was not clear for she had no such excuse as her brother but she grumbled almost as much as her aunt at the solecism of a wedding in the gentlemans home and for the only time in her life showed illhumour  she was vexed with esther for her taste in bridesmaids attire hers was given by her uncle sarcastic to cecil for his choice of gifts cross to her mother about every little arrangement as to dress satirical on allens revival of spirits in prospect of a visit to a great house annoyed at whatever was done or not done and so much less tolerant of having little lina left on her hands that aunt carey became the childs best reliance  some of this temper might be put to the score of that pity for bobus which babie in her caprice had begun to dwell on most inconsistently with her former gaiety but her mother attributed it to an unconfessed reluctance to meet lord fordham again and a sense that the light thoughtlessness to which she had clung so long might perforce be at an end  so sharpedged was her tongue even to the moment of embarkation in the train that her mother began to fear how she might behave and dreaded lest she should wound fordham but she grew more silent all the way down and when the carriage came to the station and they drove past banks starred by primroses and with the blue eyes of periwinkles looking out among the evergreen trailers she spoke no word  even allen brightened to enjoy that lamblike march day and john with his little sister on his knee was most joyously felicitous  indeed the tall athletic handsome fellow looked as if it were indeed spring with him all the more from the contrast with allens languid sallow looks savouring of the fumes in which he lived  out on the steps were fordham wrapped up to the ears sydney ready to devour babie who passively submitted and mrs evelyn as usual giving her friend a sense of rest and reliance  the last visit though only five years previous to this one had seemed in past ages till the familiar polished oak floor was under foot and the low teatable in the wainscoted hall before the great wood fire looked so homelike and natural that the newcomers felt as if they had only left it yesterday  fordham having thrown off his wraps waited on his guests looking exceedingly happy in his quiet way but more fragile than ever  he had a good deal of fair beard but it could not conceal the hollowness of his cheeks and there were great caves round his eyes which were very bright and blue  yet he was called well waited assiduously on little lina and talked with animation  we have nailed the weathercock he said and telegraphed to the clerk of the weatheroffice not to let the wind change for a week  meantime we have three delicious days to ourselves said sydney before any of the nonsense and preparation begins  indeed  as if sydney were not continually drilling her unfortunate children  if you call the psalms and hymns nonsense duke—  no no  but isnt there a course of instruction going on how to strew the flowers gracefully before the bride  well i dont want them thrown at her head as the children did at the last wedding when a great cowslip ball hit the bride in the eye so i told the mistress to show them how and the other day we found them in two lines singing—             this is the way the flowers we strew   i suppose cecil is keeping his residence  no  did you not know that this little church of ours is not licensed for weddings  the parish church is three miles off and a temple of the winds  this is only a chapelry there is a special licence and cecil is hunting with the hamptons and comes with them on monday  special licence  happy mrs coffinkey ejaculated babie  everybody comes then said sydney not that it is a very large everybody after all and we have not asked more neighbours than we can help because it is to be a feast for all the chief tenants—here in this hall—then the poor people dine in the great barn and the children drink tea later in the school  come little caroline youve done tea and i have my old babyhouse to show you  come babie  oh isnt it delicious to have you  when sydney had carried off babie and the two mothers stood over the fire in the bedroom mrs evelyn said—  so lucas stays with his good old godfather  i honour him more than i can show  we did not like to leave the old people alone  they were my kindest friends in my day of trouble  you will not let me press him to run down for the one day if he cannot leave them for more  would he do you think  i believe he would if you did it said caroline slowly but i ought not let you do so without knowing his full reason for staying away  they both coloured as if they had been their own daughters and mrs evelyn smiled as she said—  we have outgrown some of our folly about choice of profession  but does that make it safer  my poor boy has talked it over with me  he says he is afraid of his own impulses leading him to say what would not be an honourable requital for all your kindness to him  he is very good  i think he is right—quite right said mrs evelyn  i am afraid i must say so  for anything to begin afresh between them might lead to suspense that my childs constitution might not stand and i am very grateful to him for sparing her  afresh  do you think there ever was anything  never anything avowed but a good deal of sympathy  indeed so far as i can guess my foolish girl was first much offended and disquieted with jock for not listening to her persuasions and then equally so with herself for having made them and now i confess i think shame and confusion are predominant with her when she hears of him  so that she is relieved at his absence  just so and it is better so to leave it i should be only too happy to keep her with me waiting for him only i had rather she did not know it  my dear friend  and again caroline thought of magnum bonum  all the evening she said to herself that sydney showed no objection to medical students when she was looking over the engelberg photographs with john who had been far more her companion in the mountain rambles they recalled than had jock in his halfrecovered state  the mother could not help feeling a little pang of jealousy as she owned to herself that the friar was a very finelooking youth with the air of a university man and of one used to good society and that he did look most perilously happy  he was the next thing to her own son but not quite the same and she half repented of her candour to mrs evelyn and wished that the keen sensitive face and soldierly figure could be there to reassert their influence  there ensued a cheerful pleasant saturday which did much to restore the ordinary tone between the old friends and to take off the sense of strangeness  it was evident that lord fordham had insensibly become much more the real head and master of the house than at the time when the brownlow party had last been there and that he had taken on him much more of the duties of his position than he had then seemed capable of fulfilling  it might cost much effort but he had ceased to be the mere invalid and had come to take his part thoroughly and effectively and to win trust and confidence  it was strange to think how babie could ever have called him a muff merely to be pitied  the sundays at fordham were always delightful  the little church was as near perfection as might be  it was satisfactory to see that fordhams gentleness and courtesy had dispelled all the clouds and barbara had returned to her ordinary manner perhaps a little more sedate and gentle than usual and towards him she was curiously submissive as if she had a certain awe of the tenderness she had rejected  after the short afternoon service sydney waited to exercise her choir once more in their musical duties but babie hearing there was to be no rehearsal of the flowerstrewing declared she had enough of classes at home and should take lina for a stroll on the sunny terrace among the crocuses where fordham joined them till warned that the sun was getting low  one there was who would have been glad of an invitation to join in the practice but who did not receive one  john lingered with allen about the gardens till the latter disposed of himself on a seat with a cigar beyond the public gaze  then saying something about seeing whether the stream promised well for fishing john betook himself to the bank of the river one of the many avons probably with a notion that by the merest accident he might be within distance at the break up of the choir practice  he was sauntering with wouldbe indifference towards the footbridge that shortened the walk to the church but he was still more than one hundred yards from it when on the opposite side he beheld sydney herself  she was on the very verge of the stream below the steep slippery clay bank clinging hard with one hand to the bared root of a willow stump and with the other striving to uphold the head and shoulder of a child the rest of whose person was in the water  one cry one shout passed then john had torn off coat boots and waistcoat and plunged in to swim across perceiving to his horror that not only was there imminent danger of the boys weight overpowering her but that the bank undermined by recent floods was crumbling under her feet and the willowstump fast yielding to the strain on its roots  and while each moment was life or death to her he found the current unexpectedly strong and he had to use his utmost efforts to avoid being carried down far below where she stood watching with cramped strained failing limbs and eyes of appealing agonising hope  one shout of encouragement as he was carried past her but stemming the current all the time and at last he paddled back towards her and came close enough to lay hold of the boy  let go he said i have him  but just as sydney relaxed her hold on the boy the willow stump gave way and toppled over with an avalanche of clay and stones  happily sydney had already unfastened her grasp and so fell or threw herself backwards on the bank scratched battered bruised and feeling half buried for an instant but struggling up immediately and shrieking with horror as she missed john and the boy who had both been swept in by the tree  the next moment she heard a call and scrambling up the bank saw john among the reedy pools a little way down dragging the boy after him  she dashed and splashed to the spot and helped to drag the child to a drier place where they all three sank on the grass the boy a sturdy fellow of seven years old lying unconscious and the other two sitting not a little exhausted sydney scarcely less drenched than the child  she was the first to gasp—  the boy  hell soon be all right said john bending over him  how came—  i came suddenly on them—him and his brother—birdsnesting  in his fright he slipped in  i just caught him but the other ran away and i could not pull him up  oh if you had not come  john hid his face in his hands with a murmur of intense thanksgiving  you should get home he said  can you  ill see to the boy  at this moment the keeper came up full of wrath and consternation as soon as he understood what had happened  he was barely withheld from shaking the truant violently back to life and averred that he would teach him to come birdsnesting in the park on sunday  and when after he had fetched johns coat and boots sydney bade him take the child now crying and shivering back to his mother and tell her to put him to bed and give him something hot he replied—  ay maam i warrant a good warming would do him no harm  come on then you young rascal you wont always find a young lady to pull you out nor a gentleman to swim across that there avon  upon my honour sir there aint many could have done that when it is in flood  he would gladly have escorted them home but as the boy could not yet stand he was forced to carry him  you should walk fast said john as he and sydney addressed themselves to the ascent of the steep sloping ground above the river  she assented but she was a good deal strained bruised and spent and her heavy winter dress muddied and soaked clung to her and held her back and both laboured breathlessly without making much speed  i never guessed that a river was so strong she said  it was like a live thing fighting to tear him away  how long had you stood there  i cant guess  it felt endless  the boy could not help himself and i was getting so cramped that i must have let go if your call had not given me just strength enough  and the tree would have come down upon us  i believe it would muttered john  mamma must thank you whispered sydney holding out her hand  he clasped it saying almost inwardly—  god and his angels were with you  i hope so said sydney softly  they still held one anothers hands seeming to need the support in the steep grassy ascent and there came a catch in johns breath that made sydney cry  you are not hurt  that snag gave me a dig in the side but it is nothing  as they gained the level ground sydney said—  we will go in by the servants entrance it will make less fuss  thank you and with a final pressure she loosed his hand and led the way through the long flagged bellhung passage and pointed to a stair  that leads to the end of the gallery you will see a red baize door and then you know your way  sydney knew that at this hour on sunday servants were not plentiful but she looked into the housekeepers room where the select grandees were at tea and was received with an astounded miss evelyn from the housekeeper  yes saunders i should have been drowned and little peter hollis too if it hadnt been for mr friar brownlow  he swam across avon and has been knocked by a tree and reeves would you be so very kind as to go and see about him  reeves who had approved of mr friar brownlow ever since his race at schwarenbach did not need twice bidding but snatched up the kettle and one of mrs saunderss flasks while that good lady administered the like potion to sydney and carried her off to be undressed  mrs evelyn was met upon the way and while she was hearing her daughters story in the midst of the difficulties of unfastening soaked garments there was a knock at the door  mrs saunders went to it and a young housemaid said—  oh if you please maam mr friar brownlow says its of no consequence but he has broken two of his ribs and mr reeves thinks mrs evelyn ought to be informed  she spoke so exactly as if he had broken a window that at first the sense hardly reached the two ladies  broken what  his ribs maam  oh  i was sure he was hurt cried sydney  oh mamma go and see  mrs evelyn went but finding that reeves and fordham were with john and that the village doctor who lived close by the park gates had been sent for she went no farther than the door of the patients room and there exchanged a few words with her son  sydney thought her very hardhearted and having been deposited in bed lay there starting trembling and listening till her brother according to promise came down  well sydney what a brave little woman you have shown yourself john has no words to tell how well you behaved  oh never mind that  tell me about him  is he not dreadfully hurt  he declares these particular ribs are nothing said fordham indicating their situation on himself and says they laugh at them at the hospital  he wanted reeves to have sent for oswald privately and then meant to have come down to dinner as if nothing had happened  mr oswald does not mean to allow that said miss evelyn  certainly not i told him that if he did anything so foolish i should certainly never call him in  now let me hear about it sydney for he was in rather too much pain to be questioned and i only heard that you had shown courage and presence of mind  the mother and brother might well shudder as they heard how nearly their joy had been turned into mourning  the river was a dangerous one and to stem the current in full flood had been no slight exploit still more the recovery of the boy after receiving such a blow from the tree  very nobly done by both said fordham bending to kiss his sister as she finished  most thankworthy said mrs evelyn  there was a brief space spent silently by both mrs evelyn and her son on their knees and then the former went up to the little bachelorroom where in the throng of guests john had been bestowed and where she found him lying rather pale but very content and her eyes filled with tears as she took his hand saying—  you know what i have come for  how is she he said looking eagerly in her face  well i think but rather strained and very much tired so i shall keep her in her room for precautions sake as tomorrow will be a bustling day  i trust you will be equally wise  i have submitted but i did not think it requisite  pray dont trouble about me  what when i think how it would have been without you  no i will not tease you by talking about it but you know how we shall always feel for you  are you in much pain now  nothing to signify now it has been bandaged thank you  i shall soon be all right  did she make you understand her wonderful courage and resolution in holding up that heavy boy all that time  mrs evelyn let john expatiate on her daughters heroism till steps were heard approaching and his aunt knocked at the door  perhaps she was the person most tried when she looked into his bright dark eyes and understood the thrill in his voice as he told of sydneys bravery and resolution  she guessed what emotion gave sweetness to his thankfulness and feared if he did not yet understand it he soon would and then what pain would be in store for one or other of the cousins  when mrs evelyn asked him if he had really sent the message that his fractured ribs were of no consequence his aunts foreboding spirit feared they might prove of only too much consequence but at least if he were a supplanter it would be quite unconsciously  as barbara said when she came up from the diminished dinnerparty to spend the evening with her friend—  those delightful things always do happen to other people  it wasnt very delightful said sydney  not at the time but you dear old thing you have really saved a life  that was always our dream  the boy is not at all like our dream said sydney  he is a horrid little fellow  oh he will come right now  if you knew the family you would very much doubt it  sydney why will you go on disenchanting me  i thought the real thing had happened to you at last as a reward for having been truer to our old woman than i  i dont think you would have thought hanging on that bank much reward said sydney  adventures arent nice when they are going on  it is only meminisse juvat you know  you must have felt like the man in ruckerts apologue with the dragon below and the mice gnawing the root above  my dear that story kept running in my head and whenever i looked at the river it seemed to be carrying me away bank and stump and all  im afraid it will do so all night  it did when some hot wine and water they made me have with my dinner sent me to sleep  then i thought of—             time with its ever rolling stream            is bearing them away   and i didnt know which was time and which was avon  in your sleep or by the river  both i think  i seem to have thought of thousands of things and yet my whole soul was one scream of despairing prayer though i dont believe i said anything except to bid the boy hold still till i heard that welcome shout  ah the excellent monk  he is the family hero  i wonder if he enjoys it more than you  did he really never let you guess how much he was hurt  i asked him once but he said it was only a dig in the side and would go off  ah well  allen says it is accident that makes the hero  now the monk has been as good as the hyena knight of the jotapata who was a mixture of tyr with his hand in the wolfs mouth and of kunimund when he persuaded amala that his blood running into the river was only the sunset  dont said sydney  i wont have it made nonsense of  indeed said babie almost piteously i meant it for the most glorious possible praise but somehow people always seem to take me for a little hard bit of spar a barbarian or a baby i wish i had a more sensible name  infanta his princess is what duke always calls you said sydney drawing her fondly to nestle close to her on the bed in her firelit room  do you know one of the thoughts i had time for in that dreadful eternity by the river was how i wished it were you that were going to be a daughter to poor mamma  esther will make a very kind gentle tender one  oh yes but she wont be quite what you are  we have all been children together and you have fitted in with us ever since that journey when we talked incessantly about jotapata  then as babie made no answer sydney gave her a squeeze and whispered i know  who told you asked babie with eyes on the fire  mamma when i was crazy with cecil for caring for a pretty face instead of real stuff  she thought it would hurt duke if i went on  does he care still said babie in a low voice  oh babie dont you feel how much  do you know sydney sometimes i cant believe it  im sure i have no right to complain of being thought a childish unfeeling little wretch when i recollect how hard and cold and impertinent i was to him three years ago  it was three years ago and we were very foolish then consolingly murmured the wisdom of twenty not without recollections of her own  i hope it was only foolishness said barbara but i have only now begun to understand the rights of it only i could not bear the thoughts of seeing him again  and now he is so kind  do you wish you had  not that  i dont think anything but fuss and worry would have come of it then  i was only fifteen and my mother could never have let it go on and even if— but what i am so grieved and ashamed at is my fancying him not enough of a man for such a selfsufficient ape as i was  and now i have seen more of the world and know what men are i see his generosity and that his patient fight with illhealth to do his best and his duty is really very great and good  i wish you could tell him so  no i know you cant but you might let him feel it for you need not be afraid of his ever asking you again  they have had a great examination of his lungs and theres only part of one in any sort of order  they say he may go on with great care unless he catches cold or sets the disease off again and upon that he made up his mind that it was a very good thing he had not disturbed your peace  as if i should not be just as sorry said babie  oh sydney what a sad world it is  and there is he going about as manful and pleased and merry about this wedding as if it were his own  and the worst of it is though i do admire him so it cant be real proper lovers love for i felt quite glad when you said he would never ask me so it is all wasted  the mothers would hardly have liked the subject of the maidens talk in their bower and barbara bade goodnight feeling as if she should never look at fordham with the same eyes again but the light of day restored commonplace thoughts of the busy monday  reeves having been sent up by his lord with inquiries found the patients toilet so far advanced that under protest he could only assist in the remainder  so the hero and heroine met on the stairs and clasped hands in haste to the sound of the bell for morning prayers in the household chapel to which they carried their thankful hearts  the fordham household was not on such a scale that the heads of the family could sit still in dignified ease on the eve of such a spectacle  every one was busy adorning the hall or the tables and john would not be denied his share though as he could neither stoop lift nor use his right arm he was reduced to making up wreaths and bouquets with lina to supply him with flowers since he was the one person with whom she never failed to be happy or good  fordham was entreated to sit still and share the employment but his long thin hands proved utterly wanting in the dexterity that the monk displayed  he was moreover the man in authority constantly called to give orders and in his leisure moments much more inclined to haunt his infantas winged steps and erect his tall person where she could not reach  artistic taste rendered her her mother and allen most valuable decorators and it might be doubted whether allen had ever toiled so hard in his life  in pity to the busy servants luncheon was served up cold on a side table when barbara who had rallied her spirits to nonsense pitch declared that metaphorically fordham and the agent carved the meal with gloves of steel and that the workers drank the red wine through the helmet barred  in the midst however in marched reeves with a tray and a napkin and a regular basin of invalid soup which he set down before john in his easy chair  there was something so exceedingly ludicrous in the poor friars endeavour to be gratified and his look of dismay and disgust that the public fairly shrieked with laughter in which he would fain have joined but had to beg pardon for only looking solemn laughter was a painful matter  however later in the afternoon when he was looking white and tired his host came and said—  your object is to be about and not make a sensation when people arrive  come and rest then then landed him on his own sofa in his sittingroom which was kept sacred from all confusion  about half an hour later mrs evelyn said—  sydney my dear willis is come for the tickets  are they ready  oh mother i meant to have done them yesterday evening  you had better take them to dukes room it is the only quiet place he is not there i wish he were  willis can wait while you fill them up said mrs evelyn not at all sorry to pin her daughter down for an hours quiet and unaware that the room was occupied  so sydney with a list of names and packet of cards betook herself to her brothers writingtable never perceiving that there was anybody under the algerine rug till there was a movement suddenly checked and a voice said—  can i help  oh dont move  im so sorry  i hope—  oh no  i beg your pardon he said with equal incoherency and raising himself more deliberately  your brother put me here to rest and i fell asleep and did not hear you come in  oh dont  pray dont  i am so sorry i disturbed you  i did not know any one was here—  pray dont go  cant i help you  sydney recollected that in the general disorganisation pen ink and table were not easy to secure and replied—  it is the people in the village who are to dine here tomorrow they must have tickets or we shall have all manner of strangers the stupid printer only sent the tickets yesterday and the keeper is waiting for them  it would save time if you would read out the names while i mark the cards but please lie still or i shall go  and she came and arranged the cushions which his movements had displaced till he pronounced himself quite comfortable  hardly a word passed but smith james two sennet widow one hacklebury nicholas three with a yes after each till they came to hollis richard  thats the boys father then said sydney  have you heard anything of him asked john  oh yes his mother dragged him up to beg pardon and return thanks but mamma thought you would rather be spared the infliction  besides that they were not my due said john  i never thought of the boy  if you did not you saved himtwice  a newfoundlanddog instinct  but i am glad the little scamp is not the worse  i suppose he is to appear tomorrow  oh yes and the vicar begs no notice may be taken of him  he is really a very naughty little fellow and if he is made a hero for getting himself and us so nearly drowned by birdsnesting on a sunday in the park it will be perfectly demoralising  you are as bad as your keeper  i am only repeating the general voice said sydney with a gleam upon her face halfdroll halftender  poor little man  i got him alone this morning while his mother was pouring forth to mine and i think he has a little more notion where thanks are due  i should like to see him said john  ill try not to demoralise him but he has given me some happy moments  the voice was low and sydney blushed as she laughed and said—  thats like babie saying it was delightful  she is quite right as far as i am concerned  the hue on sydneys cheek deepened excessively as she said—  is george hollis next  they went on steadily after that and willis was not kept long waiting  then came the whirl of arrivals cecil with his hampton cousins sir james evelyn and armine jessie and her general and the kenminster party  caroline found herself in great request as general confidante adviser and medium as being familiar with all parties and it was evidently a great comfort to her sisterinlaw to find some one there to answer questions and give her the cartedupays outwardly she was all the serene highness a majestic matron overshadowing everybody not talkative but doing her part with dignity in great part the outcome of shyness but rather formidable to simpleminded mrs evelyn  she heard of johns accident with equanimity amazing to her hostess but befitting the parent of six sons who were always knocking themselves about  indeed john was too well launched ever to occupy much of her thoughts  her pride was in her big robert and her joy in her little harry and her care for whichever intermediate one needed it most  this one at the moment was of course pretty frightened blushing esther who was moving about in one maze and dazzle of shyness and strangeness hardly daring to raise her eyes but fortunately graceful enough to look her part well in the midst of her terrors  such continual mistakes between her and eleanor were made that cecil was advised to take care that he had the right bride but ellie though so like her sister outwardly was of a very different nature neither shy nor timid but of the sturdy friar texture  she was very unhappy at the loss of her sister and had an odd little conversation with babie who showed her to her room while the rest of the world made much of the bride  ellie the finery and flummery is to be done in aunt ellens dressingroom explained babie but essie is to sleep here with you tonight  poor ellie her lip quivered at the thought that it was for the last time and she said bluntly—  i didnt want to have come  i hate it all  it cant be helped said barbara  i cant think how you and aunt carey could give in to it  it was the real article and no mistake said babie  yes she is as silly about him as possible  a mere fine gentleman poor bobus has more stuff in him than a dozen of him  he is a real honest good fellow said babie  im sorry for bobus but ive known cecil almost all my life and i cant have him abused  i do really believe that essie will be happier with a simplehearted fellow like him than with a clever man like bobus who has places in his mind she could never reach up to and lucky for her too half whispered babie at the end  i thought you would have cared more for your own brother  remember they all said it would have been wrong  besides cecil has been always like my brother  you will like him when you know him  i cant bear fine folks  they are anything but fine cried babie indignantly  they cant help it  that way of lord fordhams highbreeding i suppose you call it just makes me wild  i hate it  poor ellie  youll have to get over it for essies sake  no i shant  it is really losing her as much as jessie—  jessie looks worn  no wonder  jessie was a goose  mamma told her to marry that old man and she just did it because she was told and now he is always ordering her about and worries and fidgets about everything in the house  i wish ones sisters would have more sense and not marry  which sentiment poor ellie uttered just as sydney was entering by an unexpected open door into the next room and she observed exactly it is the only consolation for not having a sister that she cant go and marry  o ellie i am so sorry for you  this somewhat softened ellie and she was restored to a pitch of endurance by the time essie was escorted into the room by both the mothers  that polished courtesy of fordhams which ellie so much disliked had quite won the heart of her mother who having viewed him from a distance as an obstacle in esthers way now underwent a revulsion of feeling and when he treated her with marked distinction and her daughter with brotherly kindness was filled with mingled gratitude admiration and compunction  when after dinner fordham had succeeded in rousing his uncle and the other two old soldiers out of a discussion on promotion in the army and getting them into the drawingroom the colonel came and sat down by his good little sister to confide to her under cover of sydneys music that he was very glad his pretty essie had chosen a younger man than her elder sisters husband  very opinionated is hood he said shaking his head  stuck out against sir james and me in a perfectly preposterous way  caroline was not prepossessed in favour of general hood either by his conversation with herself at dinner or by the startled way in which jessie sat upright and put on her gloves as soon as he came in but she did not wish to discuss him with the colonel and asked whether john had gone to bed  is he not here  i thought he had come in with the young ones  no then he must have gone to bed  could armine or any of them show me the way to his room—for i should like to know how the boy really is  i doubt if armine knows which is his room  i had better show you for he is not unlikely to be lying down in fordhams sittingroom otherwise you must prepare for many stairs  i suppose you know how gallantly he behaved she added as they left the room  yes mrs evelyn told me  i am glad he has not lost his athletics in his london life  i always tell his mother that john is the flower of the flock  a dear good brave fellow he is  yes you have been the making of him caroline  if we dont say much about it we are none the less sensible of all you have been to our children  most generous and disinterested  this was a speech to make caroline tingle all over and be glad both that she was a little in advance and at the door of fordhams room where john was not  indeed he proved to be lying on his bed waiting for some one to help him off with his coat and he was gratified and surprised to the utmost by his fathers visit for in truth john was the one of all the sons who most loved and honoured his father  if that evening were a whirl what was the ensuing day when all who stood in the position of hosts or their assistants were constantly on the stretch receiving entertaining arranging presiding over toilettes getting people into their right places saving one another trouble  if mrs joseph brownlow was an invaluable aid to mrs evelyn allen was an admirable one to lord fordham for his real talent was for society and he had shaken himself up enough to exert it  there might have been an element of tufthunting in it but there was no doubt that he was doing a useful part  for robert was of no use at all armine was too much of a mere boy to take the same part and john was feeling his injury a good deal more could only manage to do his part as bridegrooms man and then had to go away and lie down while the weddingbreakfast went on  in consequence he was spared the many repetitions of hearing how he had saved miss evelyn from a watery grave and allen made a much longer speech than he would have done for himself when undertaking on robs strenuous refusal to return thanks for the bridesmaids  that which made this unlike other such banquets was that no one could help perceiving how much less the bridegroom was the hero of the day to the tenants than was the hectic young man who presided over the feast and how all the speeches however they began in honour of captain evelyn always turned into wistful good auguries for the elder brother  there was no worship of the rising sun there for when lord fordham in proposing the health of the bride and bridegroom spoke of them as future possessors in the tone of a father speaking of his heir apparent there was a subaudible no no and poor cecil fairly and flagrantly broke down in returning thanks  fordhams own health had been coupled with his mothers and committed to a gentleman who knew it was to be treated briefly but this did not satisfy the farmers and the chief tenant rose saying he knew it was out of course to second a toast but he must take the opportunity on this occasion  and there followed some of that genuine native heartfelt eloquence that goes so deep as the praise of the young landlord was spoken the strong attachment to him found expression and there were most earnest wishes for his long life and happiness like his brothers  poor fordham it was very trying for him and he could only command himself with difficulty and speak briefly  he thanked his friends with all his heart for their kindness and good wishes  whatever might be the will of god concerning himself they had given him one of the most precious recollections of his life and he trusted that when sooner or later he should leave them they would convey the same warm and friendly feelings to his successor  there were so many tears by that time and mrs evelyn felt so much shaken that she made the signal for breaking up  no one was more relieved than barbara  she must go to her room to compose herself before she could bear a word from any one and as soon as she could gain the back stair she gathered up her heavy white silk and dashed up rushing along the gallery so blinded by tears under her veil that she would have had a collision if a hand had not been put out as some one drew aside to let her fly past if she wished but as the mechanical beg pardon was exchanged she knew fordhams voice and paused  i was going to look after the wounded friar he said and then he saw her tearful eyes and she exclaimed i could not help it  i could not stay  you would say such things  o duke duke  it was the first time she had used the familiar old name but she did not know what she said  he put her into a great carved chair and knelt on one knee by her saying poor rogers i wish he had let it alone  it was hard for my mother and cecil  then how could you go on and break all our hearts sobbed babie  it will make a better beginning for cecil  i want them to learn to look to him  i thought every one knew that each month i am here is like an extra time granted after notice and that it was no shock to any one to look forward to that fine young couple  oh dont  i cant bear it she exclaimed weeping bitterly  dont grieve dearest  i have tried hard but i find i cannot do my work as it ought to be done  people are very kind but i am content when the time comes to leave it to one to whom it will not be such effort and weariness  this is really one of the most gladsome days of my life  wont you believe it  i know unselfish people are happy  and do you know that you are giving me the sweetest drop of all today said fordham giving one shy fervent kiss to the hand that clasped the arm of the chair just as sounds of ascending steps caused them to start asunder and go their separate ways     chapter xxxvii  the travellers joy    tis true bright hours together told  and blissful dreams in secret shared  serene or solemn gay or bold  still last in fancy unimpaired                                 keble   to his mothers surprise lucas did not betray any discomfiture at sydneys adventure nor even at johns having of necessity been left behind for a week at fordham after all the other guests were gone  all he said was that the friar was in luck  he himself was much annoyed at the despatch he had received from japan  of course there had been much anxiety as to the way in which bobus would receive the tidings of esthers engagement and his mother had written it to him with much tenderness and sympathy  but instead of replying to her letter he had written only to lucas so entirely ignoring the whole matter that except for some casual allusion to some other subject it would have been supposed that he had not received it  he desired his brother to send him out the rest of his books and other possessions which he had left provisionally in england and he likewise sent a manuscript with orders to him to get it published and revise the proofs  it proved to be a dissertation on buddhism containing such a bitter attack upon christianity that jock was strongly tempted to put it in the fire at once and had written to bobus to refuse all assistance in its publication and to entreat him to reconsider it  he would not telegraph in order that there might be more time to cool down for he felt convinced that this demonstration was a species of revenge at least so far that there was a certain satisfaction in showing what lengths the baffled lover might go to when no longer withheld by the hope of esther or by consideration for his mother  jock would have kept back the knowledge from her but she was too uneasy about bobus for him not to tell her  she saw it in the same light feared that her son would never entirely forgive her but went on writing affectionate letters to him all the same whether he answered them or not  oh what a pang it was that she had never tried to make the boy religious in his childhood  then she looked at jock and wondered whether he would harbour any such resentment against her when he came to perceive what she had seen beginning at fordham  john came back most ominously radiant  it had been very bad weather and he and sydney seemed to have been doing a great quantity of fretwork together and to have had much music only chaperoned by old sir james for fordham had been paying for his exertions at the wedding by being confined to his room  he had sent babie a book namely vaughans beautiful silex scintillans full of marked passages which went to her heart  she asked leave to write and thank him and in return his mother wrote to hers duke is much gratified by the dear infantas note  he would like to write to her unless he knows you would not object  to which caroline replied let him write whatever he pleases to barbara  i am sure it will only be what is good for her  indeed babie had been by many degrees quieter since her return  so a correspondence began and was carried on till after easter when the whole party came to london for the season  mrs evelyn wished fordham to be under dr medlicotts eye also to give sydney another sight of the world and to superintend mrs cecil evelyns very inexperienced debut  the young people had made a most exquisitely felicitous tour in the south of france and north of spain and had come back to a pleasant little house which had been taken for them near the park  there cecil was bent on giving a great housewarming a full family party he would have everybody for he had prevailed to have fordham sleeping there while his room in his own house received its final arrangements and caroline had added to ellens load of obligation by asking her and the colonel to come for a couple of nights to behold their daughter dressed for the drawingroom  that would no doubt be a pretty sight but to others her young matronly dignity was a prettier sight still as she stood in her soft dainty white receiving her guests the rosy colour a little deepened though she knew and loved them all and cecil by her side already having made a step out of his boyhood by force of adoration and protection  but their lot was fixed and they could not be half so interesting to caroline as the far less beautiful young sister who could only lay claim to an honest pleasant freshcoloured intelligent face only prevented by an air of highbreeding from being milkmaidlike  it was one of those parties when the ingenuity of piercing a puzzle is required to hinder more brothers and sisters from sitting together than could be helped  so fate or contrivance placed sydney between the two johns at the dinnertable and mother carey on the other side felt that some indication must surely follow  yet sydney was apparently quite unconscious and she was like the description in rokeby—             two lovers by the maiden sate            without a glance of jealous hate            the maid her lovers sat between            with open brow and equal mien            it is a sight but rarely spied            thanks to mans wrath and womans pride   were these to awaken  they seemed to be all three talking together in the most eager and amiable manner quite like old times and jocks bright face was full of animation  she had plenty of time for observation for the colonel liked a good london dinner and knew he need not disturb his enjoyment to make talk for his good little sister  presently however he began to tell her that the goulds and elvira had really set out for america and when her attention was free again she found that jock had been called in by fordham to explain to essie whether she had or had not seen roncesvalles while sydney and john were as much engrossed as ever  so it continued all the rest of the dinnertime  jock was talked to by fordham but john never once turned to his other neighbour  in the evening the party divided for it was very warm and rather than inconvenience the lovers of fresh air fordham retreated into the inner drawingroom where there was a fire  he had asked babie to bring the old numbers of the travellers joy as he had a fancy for making a selection of the more memorable portions and having them privately printed as a memorial of those bright days  babie and armine were there looking them over with him and the former would fain have referred to sydney but on looking for her saw she was out among the flowers in the glasscovered balcony too much absorbed even to notice her summons  only jock came back with her and sat turning over the numbers in rather a dreamy way  the ladies and the colonel were sent home in mrs evelyns carriage where ellen purred about esthers happiness and good fortune all the way back  caroline lingered somewhat purposely writing a note that she might see the young men when they came back  they wished her goodnight in their several fashions  goodnight mother  well some people are born with silver spoons  goodnight mother dear  dont you think fordham looks dreadful  oh no armie much better than when i came up to town  goodnight mother carey  if those young folks make all their parties so jolly it will be the pleasantest house in london  good night  mother said jock as the cousin softly humming a tune sprang up the stairs does the wind sit in that quarter  i am grievously afraid that it does she said  it is no wonder he said doctoring the wick of his candle with her knittingneedle  did you know it before  i began to suspect it after the accident but i was not sure nor am i now  i am said jock quietly  she is a stupid girl burst out his mother  no theres no blame to either of them  thats one comfort  she gave me full warning and he knew nothing about it nor ever shall  he is just as much a medical student as you  that vexes me  yes but he did not give up the service for it when she implored him  a silly girl  o jock if you had but come down to fordham  it might have made no odds  friar was so aggressively jolly after his christmas visit that i fancy it was done then  besides just look at us together  he will never get your air of the guards  which is preposterously ridiculous in the hospital said jock endeavouring to smile  never mind mother  it was all up with me two years ago as i very well knew  goodnight  youve only got me the more whole and undivided for the extinction of my willofthe wisp  she saw he had rather say no more and only returned his fervent embrace with interest but babie knew she was restless and unhappy all night and would not ask why being afraid to hear that it was about fordham who coughed more and looked frailer  he never went out in the evening now and only twice to the house when his vote was more than usually important but mrs evelyn was taking sydney into society and the shrinking esther needed a chaperon much more being so little aware of her own beauty that she was wont to think something amiss with her hair or her dress when she saw people looking at her  sydney had no love for the gaieties and especially tried to avoid their own county member who showed signs of pursuing her  her real delight and enthusiasm were for the surprise parties to which she always inveigled her mother when it was possible  mrs evelyn was not by any means unwilling but cecil and esther loved them not and much preferred seeing the collingwood street cousins without the throng of clever people who were formidable to esther and wearisome to cecil  jock seldom appeared on these evenings  he was working harder than ever  he was studying a new branch of his profession which he had meant to delay for another year and had an appointment at the hospital which occupied him a great deal  he had offered himself for another nightschool class and spent his remaining leisure on dr and mrs lucas who needed his attention greatly though mrs lucas had her scruples feared that he was overdoing himself and begged his mother to prohibit some of his exertions  dr medlicott himself said something of the same kind to mrs brownlow  young men will get into a rush and suffer for it afterwards he said and jock is looking ill and overstrained  i want him to remember that such an illness as he had in switzerland does not leave a mans heart quite as sound as before and he must not overwork himself  and yet i dont know how to interfere said his mother  there are hearts and hearts you know she added  ah  work may sometimes be the least of two evils and the doctor said no more  so jock will not come said mrs evelyn opening a note declining a dinner in cavendish square  his time is very much taken up said his mother  it is one of his classnights  so he says  it is a strange question to ask but i cannot help it do you think he fully enters into the situation  i say in return do you remember my telling you that the two cousins always avoided rivalry  then he acts deliberately  forgive me i felt that unless i was certain of this virtual resignation of the unspoken hope i was not acting fairly in allowing—i cannot say encouraging—what i cannot help seeing  dear mrs evelyn you understand that it is no slight to sydney but you know why he held back and now he sees that his absence has made room for john he felt that there was no chance for him and that the more he can keep out of the way the better it is for all parties honest john has never had the least notion that he has come between jock and his hopes and it is our great desire that he should not guess it  well what can i say  you are generous people you and your son but young folks hearts will go their own way  i had made up my mind to a struggle with the prejudices of all the family and i had rather it had been for jock but it cant be helped and there is not a shadow of objection to the other john  no indeed  he is only not jock—  and i do not think my sydney was knowingly fickle but she thought she had utterly disgusted and offended jock by her folly about the selling out and that it was a failure of influence  poor child it was all a cloud of shame and grief to her  i think he would have dispelled it if he had come to the wedding but as he did not—  the adriatic was free said caroline trying to smile  i see it all dear mrs evelyn  i neither blame you nor sydney and i trust all will turn out right for my poor boy  he deserves it said mrs evelyn with a sigh  there was a good deal more intercourse between cavendish square and collingwood street than mother carey had expected  mrs evelyn and her son and daughter fell into the habit of coming when they went out for a drive to see whether mrs brownlow or barbara would come with them and as it was almost avowed that babie was the object she almost always went and kept fordham company in the carriage whilst his mother and sister were shopping or making calls  he had certainly lost much ground in these few weeks he had ceased to ride and never went out in the evening but the doctors still said he might live for months or years if he avoided another english winter his mother was taking sydney into society and esther was always happier when under their wing being rather frightened by the admiration of which cecil was so proud  when they went out much before fordhams bed time he was thankful for the companionship of allen or armine generally the former for armine was reading hard and working after lectures for a tutor while allen unfortunately had nothing to prevent him from looking in whenever mrs evelyn was out to play chess read aloud or assist in that reediting of the cream of the travellers joy which seemed the invalids great amusement  fordham had a few scruples at first and when allen had undertaken to come to him for the whole afternoon of a gardenparty he consulted barbara whether it was not permitting too great a sacrifice of valuable time  you dont mean that for irony said babie  it is only so much time subtracted from tobacco  will you let me say something to you infanta returned fordham with all his gentleness  it seems to me that you are not always quite kind in your way of speaking of allen  if you knew how provoking he is  i have a great fellowfeeling for him having grown up the same sort of helpless being as he has been  i should be much worse in his place  never cried babie  you would never hang about the house worrying mother about eating and fiddlefaddles instead of doing any one useful thing  but if one cant  i dont believe in cant  happy person  oh duke you know i never meant health you know i did not and then a pang shot across her as she remembered her past contempt of him whom she now reverenced  there are other incapacities he said  but said babie halfpleading halfmeditating allen is not stupid  he used to be considered just as clever as bobus and he is so now to talk to  can there be any reason but laziness and want of application that makes him never succeed in anything except in answering riddles and acrostics in the papers  he generally just begins things and makes mother or armie finish them for him  he really did set to work and finish up an article on count ugolino since we came home from fordham and he has tried all the periodicals round and they wont have it not even the editors that know mother  poor fellow  and you have no pity  dont you think it is his own fault  it is quite possible that he would have done much better if he had always had to work for his livelihood  i grant you that even as a rich man he ought to have avoided the desultory ways which as you say are more likely to have caused his failures than want of native ability  but i dont like to see you hard upon him  you hardly realise how cruelly he has been treated in return for a very deep and generous attachment or how such a grief must make it more difficult for him to exert his powers  i dont like you to think me hard and unkind said babie sadly  only a little over just said fordham  i am sure you could do a great deal to help and brighten allen and he added smiling in the name of spoilt and shiftless heirs i hope you will try  indeed i will said babie earnestly as the footman at the shop door signalled to the coachman that his ladies were ready  she found it the less difficult to remember what he had said because allen himself was much less provoking to her  something was due to the influence and example of the strenuous endeavour that fordham made to keep up to such duties as he had undertaken not indeed onerous in themselves but a severe labour to a man in his state  it had been intimated to him also that his saturation with tobacco was distressing to his friend and he was fond enough of him to abstain from his solace except when walking home at night  perhaps this had cleared his senses to perceive habits of consideration for the family which he had never thought incumbent on himself whatever they might be in his brothers and his eyes were open as they had never yet been to his mothers straits  it was chiefly indeed through his fastidiousness  his mother and babie had existed most of this time upon their belforest wardrobe indeed the former always wearing black was still fairly provided but babie who had not in those days been out was less extensively or permanently provided and allen objected to the style in which she appeared in the enamelled carriage like a nursery governess out for an airing  or not so smart said babie merrily putting on her little black hat with the herons plume and running down stairs  she does not care said allen but mother how can you let her  i cant help it allen  we turned out all the old feathers and flowers to see if i could find anything more respectable but things dont last in bloomsbury and they only looked fit to point a moral and not at all to adorn a tail or a head  i should think not  but cant the poor child have something fresh and like other people   no her uncle had given her bridesmaids dress but there had been expenses enough connected with the journey to fordham to drain the dress purse and the sealskin cap that had been then available could not be worn in the sun of june  there had been sundry incidental calls for money  mother carey had been disappointed in the sale of a somewhat ambitious set of groups from fouques seasons which were declared abstruse and uninteresting to the public  she had accepted an order for some very humble work not much better than chimney ornaments for which she rose early and toiled while babie was out driving with her friends  when she had the money for this she would be more at ease and if it came to a little more than she durst reckon upon she could venture on some extras  babie might earn it for herself she is full of inventions  there is nothing more strongly impressed on me than that those children are not to begin being made literary hacks before they are come to maturity  one christmas tale a year is the utmost i ought to allow  i wish i could be a literary hack or anything else sighed poor allen  it was the first time he really let himself understand what a burden he was and as fordham was one of those people who involuntarily almost draw out confidence he talked it over with him  allen himself was convinced by having really tried that he was not as availably clever as others of his family  whether nature or dawdling was to blame he had neither originality nor fire  he could not get his plots or his characters to work even when his mother or babie jogged them on by remarks his essays were heavy and unreadable his jokes hung fire and he had so exhausted every ones patience that the translations and small reviewing work which he could have done were now unattainable  he was now ready to do anything and he actually meant it but there seemed nothing for him to do  mrs evelyn succeeded in getting him two pupils little pickles whom their sisters governess could not manage and whom he was to teach for two hours every morning in preparation for their going to school  he attended faithfully but he was not the man to deal with pickles the mutual aversion with which the connection began increased upon further acquaintance  the boys found out his weak points and played tricks learnt nothing and made his life a burden to him and though the lady mother liked him extremely and could not think why her sons were so naughty with him it would not be easy to say which of the parties concerned looked with the strongest sense of relief to the close of the engagement  the time spent with fordham was however the compensation  there was sincere liking on both sides and such helpfulness that fordham more than once wished he had some excuse for making allen his secretary and perhaps would have done so if he had really believed such a post would be permanent  armines term likewise ended and his examination being over with much credit he wished for nothing better than to resume the pursuits he had long shared with fordham  he had not jocks facility in forming intimacies with youths of his own age  his development was too exclusively on the spiritual and intellectual side to attract ordinary lads and his home gave him sufficient interests outside his studies and thus fordham was still his sole as well as his earliest friend outside the family  their intercourse had never received the check that circumstances had interposed between others of the two families armine had spent part of almost all his vacations with the evelyns the correspondence had been a great solace to the invalid and the friendship grew yearly more equal  armine was to join the evelyn party when they went to the seaside as they intended to do on leaving london  it was the fashion to say he looked pale and overworked but he had really attained to very fair health and was venturing at last to look forward in earnest to a clerical life a thought that began to colour and deepen all his more intimate conversations with his friend who could share with him many of the reflections matured in the seclusion of illhealth  for they were truly congenial spirits and poor fordham was more experienced in the lore of suffering and resignation than his twentyseven years seemed to imply  meantime the work of editing the travellers joy was carried on some fiveandtwenty copies were printed containing all the favourite papers—a specimen from each contributor from a shocking bad riddle of cecils to dr medlicotts commentary upon the myths of the nursery from armines original acrostic on the rhine and rhone down to the phantom blackcock of kilnaught the best illustrations from mrs brownlows sketches and dr medlicotts clever penandink outlines were reproduced and with much pains and expense fordham had procured photographs of all the marked spots from schwarenbach even to fordham church so that cecil and esther considered it a graceful memorial of their courtship  so very kind of duke they said  esther had quite forgotten all her dread of him and never was happier than when he was listening to all that had amused her in the gaieties which she liked much better in the past than in the present  the whole was finished at last after many a pleasant discussion and reunion scene and the books were sent to the binder  fordham was eager for them to come home and rather annoyed at some delays which made it doubtful whether they would be received before he with his mother and sister were to leave town  it was late and june had come in and the weight of london air was oppressing him and making him weaker and his mother anxious to get him into sea air had made no fresh engagements  it was a surprise to meet him at all saints on st peters day  come with us infanta he said pausing at the door of the carriage  i am to have my drive early today as the ladies are going to this great gardenparty  sydney said she would walk home with mrs brownlow and be taken up when babie was set down  fordham gave the word to go to the binders  i should have thought you had better have gone into some clearer air said his mother for he looked very languid  there will be time for a turn in the park afterwards he said and the books were to be ready yesterday if there is any faith in binders  the books were ready and fordham insisted on having them deposited on the seat beside him in spite of all offers of sending them and a smiling—  oh duke your name should have been babie from his mother  they then drove to cecils house where mrs evelyn went in to let esther know her hour of starting but where cecil came running down and putting his head into the carriage said—  come in mamma heres the housemaid been bullying essie and she wants you to help her  these two can go round the park by themselves cant they   those are the most comical pair of children said fordham laughing as the carriage moved on  will esther ever make a serene highness  it is not in her said babie  it might have been in jessie if her general was not such a horrid old martinet as to hinder the development but essie is much nicer as she is  meantime fordhams fingers were on the knot of the string of his parcel  oh you are going to peep in  i am so glad  since mamma is not here to laugh at me  youll tell her you did it to please the babie  there it is you that are doing it now as her vigorous little fingers plucked far more effectively at the cord than his thin weak ones  out came at last one of the choice dark green books with a clematis wreath stamped on the cover and it was put into barbaras lap  how pretty  this is mothers own design for the titlepage  and oh—how capital  dr medlicotts sketch of the mud baths with jock shrinking into a corner out of the way of the fat grafin  you have everything  here is armines easter hymn  i wished to commemorate the whole range of feeling said fordham  i see you have even picked out the least ridiculous chapter of jotapata  i wish some one had sketched you patiently listening to the nineteen copybooks  it would have been a monument of good nature  and here is actually sydneys poem about wishing to have been born in the twelfth century—             would that i lived in time of faith              when parable was life            when the red cross in holy land              led on the glorious strife            oh for the days of golden spurs              of tournament and tilt            of pilgrim vow and prowess high              when minsters fair were built            when holy priest the tonsure wore              the friar had his cord            and honour truth and loyalty              edged each bold warriors sword   the solitary poetical composition of our family said fordham chiefly memorable i fear for the continuation it elicited             would that i lived in days of yore              when outlaws bold were rife            the days of dagger and of bowl              of dungeon and of strife            oh for the days when forks were not              on skewers came the meat            when from one trencher ate three foes              oh but those times were sweet            when hooded hawks sat overhead              and underfoot was straw            where hounds and beggars fought for bones              alternately to gnaw   that was jocks i believe  how furious it did make us  good old sydney she has lived in her romance ever since  wisely or unwisely  can it be unwisely when it is so pure and bright as hers and gives such a zest to common things  glamour sometimes is perplexing  do you know duke i would sometimes give worlds to think of things as i used in those old times  you a worldwearied veteran  dont laugh at me  it was when bobus was at home  his common sense made all we used to care for seem so silly that i have never been able to get back my old way of looking at things  i am afraid glamour once dispelled does not return  yet after all truth is the greater  and i am sure that poor bobus never loosened my infantas hold on the real truth  i dont know she said looking down he or his books made me afraid to think about it and like to laugh at some things—no i never did before you  you hushed me on the very borders of that kind of flippancy and so you dont guess how horrid i am or have been for you have made things true and real to me again  fancy may die but faith is there said fordham  i think you will never shut your eyes to those realities again he added gently  it is there that we shall still meet  and my infanta will make me one promise  i would promise you any thing  never knowingly to read those sneering books he said laying his hand on hers  current literature is so full of poisoned shafts that it may not be possible entirely to avoid them and there may sometimes be need to face out a serious argument but you will promise me never to take up that scoffing style of literature for mere amusement  never duke i promise she said  i shall always see your face and feel your hand forbidding me  then as he leant back half in thankfulness half in weariness she went on looking over the book and read a preface new to her   i have put these selections together thinking that to the original travellers it may be a joy to have a memorial of happy days full of much innocent pleasure and wholesome intercourse  let me here express my warm gratitude for all the refreshments afforded by the friendships it commemorates and which makes the name most truly appropriate  as a stranger and pilgrim whose journey may be near its close let me be allowed thus to weave a parting garland of some of the brightest flowers that have bloomed on the wayside and in dedicating the collection to my dear companions and fellowwanderers in the scenes it records let me wish that on the highway of life that stretches before them they may meet with many a travellers joy as true as they have been to the editor                                                   f   babie with eyes full of tears was looking up to speak when the carriage having completed the round again stopped and mrs evelyn came down escorted by cecil with hearty thanks  essies nice clean fresh country notions were scouted by the london housemaid she said  i am happy to say the child held her own though the woman presumed outrageously on her gentleness and neither of the two had any notion how to get rid of her  arcadia had no housemaids said fordham rallying  if not it must have been nearly as bad as jocks twelfth century said babie in the same tone  ah i see said mrs evelyn laughing  and there was a little playful banter as to which had been the impatient one to open the parcel each pretending to persuade her that it had been a mere yielding to the other  thus they came to collingwood street where babie would have taken out her book  no no wait said fordham  i want to write your name in it first  ill send it this evening  ali and armie are coming to me while these good people are at their duchesss  our last gaiety i am thankful to say returned his mother as barbara felt a fervent squeeze of the hand which she knew was meant to remind her of the deeper tone of their conversation  it was a very hot day and in the cool of the evening the two johns beguiled mrs brownlow and babie into a walk  they had only just come home when there was a hurried peal at the bell and armine quite pale dashed up stairs after them  mother come directly  ive got a hansom  fordham asked john  armine sighed an affirmative  allen sent me for mother  he said one of you had better come  its a bloodvessel  we have sent for medlicott and telegraphed for the others  but oh they are so far off  mrs brownlow gave barbara one kiss and put her into jocks arms then sprang into the cab followed by john and was driven off  the other three walked in the same direction almost unconsciously as armine explained more fully  fordham had seemed tired at first but as it became cooler had roused himself seated himself at his writingtable and made one by one the inscriptions in the volumes including all their party of travellers even janet and bobus reeves who had been their binder mrs evelyns maid and one or two intimate friends—such as mr ogilvie and his sister—and almost all had some kind little motto or special allusion written below the name and the date  it had thus taken a long time and fordham leant back so weary that allen wanted him to leave the addressing of the books when wrapped up to him and armine but he said there were some he wished to direct himself and he was in the act of asking bobus right address when a cough seized him and allen instantly saw cause to ring for reeves  the last thing that armine had seen was a wave of the hand to hasten his own departure as allen despatched him for his mother and gave orders for the summoning of others more needed but who might not be fetched so promptly  then jock had time to question whether barbara ought to go on with him and armine to the door but there was a sound in her let me i must that they could not withstand and they walked on in absolute silence except that jock said reeves knew exactly what to do  dr medlicotts carriage was at the door and on their ringing they were silently beckoned into the diningroom where their mother came to them  she could not speak at first but the way in which she kissed barbara told them how it was  all had been over before she reached the house  dr medlicott had come but could do nothing more than direct allen how to support the sufferer as he sank with but little struggle while a sudden beam of joy and gladness lit up his face at the last  there had been no word from the first  by the time the flow of blood ceased the power of speech was gone and there was thus less reason to regret the absence of the nearest and dearest  mrs brownlow said she must await their return with allen who was terribly shocked and overcome by this his first and sudden contact with death  john too had better remain for his sisters sake but the others had better go home  yes my child you must go she said laying her hand on the cold ones of barbara who stood white silent and stunned by the shock  oh dont make me said a dull dreamy piteous voice  indeed you must my dear  it would only add to the pain and confusion to have you here now  they may like to have you tomorrow remember he is not here  take her jock  take care of her  the coming of sir james evelyn at that moment gave babie the impulse of movement and dr medlicott hurrying out to offer the use of his carriage made her cling to jock and then to sign rather than speak her desire to walk with her brothers  swiftly and silently they went along the streets on that june night in the throng of carriages carrying people to places of amusement the wheels surging in their ears with the tramp and scuffle of feet on the pavement like echoes from some faroff world  now and then there was a muffled sound from armine but no word was spoken till they were within their own door  then jock saw for one moment armines face perfectly writhen with suppressed grief but the boy gave no time for a word hurrying up the stairs as rapidly as possible to his own room  will not you go to bed  mother will come to you there said jock to his sister who was still quite white and tearless  please not was her entreaty  suppose they sent for me  he did not think they would but he let her sit in the dark by the open window listening and he put his arm round her and said gently—  you are much honoured babie  it is a great thing to have held so pure and true a heart not for time but eternity  dont jock  not yet  i cant bear it she moaned but she laid her head on his shoulder and so rested till he said—  if you can spare me babie i think i must see to armie  he seemed to me terribly overcome  armine has lost his very best and dearest friend she said pressing her hands together  oh yes go to him  armie can feel and i cant  i can only choke  jock apprehended a hysterical struggle but there only came one long sob like strangulation and he thought the pent up feeling might better find its course if she were left alone and he was really anxious about armine remembering what the loss was to him that it was his first real grief and that he had had a considerable share of the first shock of the alarm  his soft knock was unheard and as he gently pushed open the door he saw armine kneeling in the dark with his head bowed over his prayer desk and would have retreated but he had been heard and armine rose and came forward  the light on the stairs showed a pale tearstained face but calm and composed and it was in a steady though hushed voice that he said—  can i be of any use  i am sorry to have disturbed you  i only came to see after you this is a sore stroke on you armie  i can stand it better now  i have given him up to god as he bade me said armine  it had been a weary disappointed struggling life and he never wished it to last  the tears were choking him but they were gentle ones  he thought it might be like this—and soon—only he hoped to get home first  and i can give thanks for him what he has been to me and what he will be to me all my life  that is right armie  john did great things for us all when he caught the carriage  and how is babie  poor child she seems as if she could neither speak nor cry  it is half hysterical and i was going to get something for her to take perhaps seeing you may be good for her  poor little thing she is almost his widow though she scarcely knows it said armine coming down with his brother  they found babie still in the same intent transfixed watching state but she let armine draw her close to him and listened as he told her in a low tender voice of the talks he had had with fordham who had expressed to his young friend as to no one else his own feelings as to his state and said much that he had spared others who could not listen with that unrealising calmness that comes when sorrow never yet experienced is almost like a mere vision  and as babie listened the large soft tears began to fall drop by drop and the elder brothers anxiety was lessened  he made them eat and drink for one anothers sake and watched over them with a care that was almost parental till at nearly halfpast twelve oclock the other three came home  they said mrs evelyn had come fully prepared by the telegram and under an inexplicable certitude which made it needless to speak the word to her  she was thankful that marmaduke had been spared the protracted weeks of struggle in which his elder brothers lives had closed and she said—  we knew each other too well to need last words  indeed she was in the exalted state that often makes the earlier hours and days of bereavement the least distressing and sydney was absorbed in the care of her  neither had been nearly so much overcome as cecil and esther who had been hunted up with difficulty he seemed to be as much shocked and horrified as if his brother had been in the strongest possible health and poor esther felt it wicked and unfeeling to have been dancing and cried so bitterly that the united efforts of her aunt and brother could not persuade her that what was done in simple duty and obedience need give no pang and that mrs evelyn never thought of the incongruity  it was only her husbands prostration with grief and desolation that drew her off to do her best with her pretty childish caresses and soothings and when the two had been sent to their own home mrs evelyn was so calm that her friend felt she might be left with her daughter for the night and returned bringing her tender love to our babie as she called the girl  she clung very much to barbara in the ensuing days  the presence of every one seemed to oppress her except that of her own children and the two youngest brownlows for had not armine been the depository of all fordhams last messages  what she really seemed to return to as a refreshment after each needful consultation with sir james on the dreary tasks of the mourners was to finish the packing of those travellers joys which lay strewn about fordhams sittingroom open at the fly leaves that the ink might dry  esther was very gentle and sweet taking it quite naturally that babie should be a greater comfort to her motherinlaw than herself and content to be a very valuable assistant herself for the stimulus made her far more capable than she had been thought to be  she managed almost all the feminine details while sir james attended to the rest  she answered all the notes and wrote all the letters that did not necessarily fall on her husband and his mother and her unobtrusive helpfulness made her a daughter indeed  all the young men went to the funeral but mrs brownlow felt that it was a time for friends to hold back till they were needed when relations had retreated so she only sent babie whom mrs evelyn and sydney could not spare and she followed after three weeks when allen was released from his unwelcome work  she found mrs evelyn feeling it much more difficult to keep up than it had been at first now that she sorely missed the occupation of her life  for full twenty years she had had an invalid on her mind and cecils marriage had made further changes in her life  it was not the fault of the young couple  they did not love their new honours at all  apart from their affection cecil hated trouble and responsibility and could not bear to shake himself out of his groove and esther was frightened at the charge of a large household their little home was still a small paradise to them and they implored their mother to allow things to go on as they were and cecil continue in the guards while she reigned as before at fordham letting the cavendish square house which essie viewed with a certain nervous horror  mrs evelyn had so far consented that the change need not be made for at least a year  her dower house was let and she would remain as mistress of fordham till the term was over by which time the young lady fordham might have risen to her position and her lord be less unwilling to face his new cares  and they will be always wanting me to take the chair said he in a deplorable voice that made the others laugh in spite of themselves and he was so grateful to his mother for staying in his house and letting him remain in his regiment that he seemed to have quite forgotten that the power was in his own hands     chapter xxxviii  the trust fulfilled    you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and provd effects such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty and that he willd me in heedfullest reservation to bestow them as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note                                 alls well that ends well   another year had come and gone with its various changes and the mother of the collingwood street household felt each day that the short life of marmaduke viscount fordham had not been an unimportant one to her children  it had of course told the most on barbara  her first great grief seemed to have smoothed out the harsher lines of her character and made her gentle and tolerant as she had never been or more truly she had learnt charity at a deeper source  that last summer had lifted her into a different atmosphere  what she had shared with fordham she loved  she had felt the reality of the invisible world to him and knew he trusted to her meeting his spirit there even in this life and the strong faith of his mother had strengthened the impression             heavenly things had seemed more true           and came down closer to her view   now that his presence was among them  she had by no means lost her vivacity  there would always be a certain crispness drollery and keenness about her and she had too much of her mothers elasticity to be long depressed but instead of looking on with impatient criticism at good works she had learnt to be ardent in the cause and she was a most effective helper  to armine it was as if fordham had given him back the sister of his childhood to be as thoroughly one in aims and sympathies as ever but with a certain clearness of eye brisk alacrity of execution and quickness of judgment that made her a valuable assistant the complement as it were of his more contemplative nature  he had just finished his course at kings college and taken a fair degree and he was examining advertisements with a view to obtaining some employment in teaching that would put a sufficient sum in his hands to enable him to spend a year at one of the theological colleges in preparation for ordination  his mother was not happy about it she never would be quite easy as to armines roughing it at any chance school and she had much rather he had spent the intervening year in working as a lay assistant to mr ogilvie who had promised to give him a title for orders and would direct his reading  armine however said he could neither make himself mr ogilvies guest for a year nor let his mother pay his expenses also that he wished to do something for himself and that he felt the need of definite training  all he would do was to promise that if he should find himself likely to break down in his intended employment of tuition he would give up in time and submit to her plan of boarding him at st cradockes  but as he said to babie i dont think it is selfwill to feel bound to try to exert myself for the one great purpose of my life i am too old to live upon mother any longer  how i do wish i could do anything to help you to the year at c— mother has always said that she will let me try to publish harts tongue well when i am twentyone  living on you instead of mother  oh no armie you know we are one  though perhaps a mere story like that is not worthy to do such work  yet i think there must be something in it as duke cared for it  that would be proof positive but for the author said armine smiling but poor allens attempts have rather daunted my literary hopes  i really believe allen would write better sense now if he tried said babie  i believe lady grose is making something of him  without intending it said armine laughing  no but you see snubbing is wholesome diet if it is taken with a few grains of resolution and he has come to that now  for allen had continued not only to profess to be but to be willing to do anything to relieve his mother and dr medlicott had with much hesitation and doubt recommended him for what was called a secretaryship to a paralytic old gentleman who had been in his own estimation eminent both in the scientific and charitable worlds and still carried on his old habits though quite incapable  it really was as the doctor honestly told allen very little better than being a male humble companion for though old sir samuel grose was fussy and exacting from infirmity he was a gentleman but he had married late in life a vulgar overbearing woman who was sure to show insolent want of consideration to anyone she considered her inferior to his surprise allen accepted the situation and to his still greater surprise endured it walking to kensington every day by eleven oclock and coming home whenever he was released at an hour varying from three to eleven according to my ladys will  he became attached to the old man pitied him and did his best to satisfy his many caprices and to deal with his infirmities of brain and memory but my lady certainly was his bete noire though she behaved a good deal better to him after she had seen him picked up in the park by lady fordhams carriage  however he made light of all he underwent from her and did not break down even when it was known that though poor george gould had died at new york his widow showed no intention of coming home and wrote confidently to her stepdaughters of elvira marrying her brother gilbert  she was of age now there was nothing to prevent her and they seemed to be only waiting for a decent interval after her uncles death  allen a couple of years ago would have made his mother and all the family as wretched as he could and would have dropped all semblance of occupation but smoking  now lady grose would not let him smoke and sir samuel required him to be entertaining but the continual worry he was bearing was making him look so ill that his mother was very anxious about him  she had other troubles  it was eighteen months since janet hermann had drawn her allowance  her husband once had written in her name saying that she was ill but mr wakefield had sent an order payable only on her signature and it had never been acknowledged or presented  could janet be living  or could she be in some such fitful state of prosperity as to be able to disregard £25  her mother spent many anxious thoughts and prayers on her though the younger ones seemed to have almost forgotten her so long it was since she had been a part of their family life  nor did bobus answer his mothers letters though he continued to write fully and warmly to jock  as to the ms he said he had improved upon it and had sent a fresh one to a friend who would have none of the scruples of which physical science ought to have cured jock  it came out in a review but without his name and though it was painful enough to all who cared for him it had been shorn of several of the worst and most virulent passages so that jocks remonstrance had done some good  jock himself had come into possession of £200 and the like sum had been left to his mother by their good old friends the lucases who had died as it is given to some happy old couples to leave this world within three days of one another  the other john in the last autumn had taken both his degrees at oxford and in london with high credit and had immediately after obtained one of those annual appointments in his hospital which are bestowed upon the most distinguished of the students to enable them to gain more experience but as it did not involve residence he continued to be one of the family in collingwood street  however in the early spring a slight hurt to his hand festered so as to make the doctors uneasy and his sister set her heart on taking him to fordham for easter for a more thorough rest than could be had at kencroft while the younger ones were having measles  john however had by this time learnt enough of his own feelings to delay consent till he had written to ask mrs evelyn whether she absolutely objected to his entertaining any future hopes of sydney when he should have worked his way upward as his recent success gave him hopes of doing in time  sydneys fortune was not overpowering  £10000 was settled on each of the younger children and it had only been fordhams liberality in treating cecil as his eldest son that had brought about his early marriage  thus she was no such heiress that her husband would be obliged to feel as if he were living on her means or that exertion could be dispensed with and thus though he must make his way before he could marry there was no utter inequality for one who brought a high amount of trained ability and industry  mrs evelyn could only answer as she would once have answered jock and on these terms he went  in the meantime sydney had rejected the honourable young rector of the next parish and was in the course of administering rebuffs to the county member who was so persuaded that he and miss evelyn were the only fit match for one another that no implied negative was accepted by him  her brother whom he was coaching in his county duties was far too much inclined to bring him home to luncheon and in the clash and crisis without any ones quite knowing how it happened it turned out that mrs evelyn had been so imprudent as to sanction an attachment between her daughter and that great lout of a young doctor lady fordhams brother  not only the mp but all the family shook the head and bemoaned the connection for though it was to be a long engagement and a great secret everybody found it out  lucas had long made up his mind that so it would end and told his mother that it was a relief the crisis had come  he put a good face on it wrung his cousins hand with the grasp of a hercules observed well done old monk and then made the work for his final examination a plea for being so incessantly occupied as to avoid all private outpourings  and if he had very little flesh on his bones it was hard work and anxiety about his examination  that final ordeal was gone through at last john lucas brownlow was like his cousin possessor of a certificate of honour and a medal and had won both his degrees most brilliantly  he had worked the hardest and had the most talent and his achievement was perhaps the most esteemed because of his lack of the previous training that friar had brought from oxford  professors and physicians wrote his mother notes to express their satisfaction at the career of their old friends son and dr medlicott came to bring her a whole bouquet of gratifying praise and admiration from all concerned with him ranging from the ability of his prize essay to the firm delicacy of his hand and backed up by the doctors own opinion of the blameless conduct and excellent influence of both the cousins  and now dr medlicott declared he must have a good rest and holiday after the long strain of hard toil and study  it came like a dream to caroline that the conditions imposed by her husband fifteen years before when lucas was a mischievous imp of a skipjack had been thus completely worked out not only the intellectual but the moral and religious terms being thus fulfilled  the two cousins had come home to dinner in high spirits at the various kind things that had been said to and of jock and discussing the various suggestions for the future that had been made to them  they thought mother carey strangely silent but when they rose she called her son into the consulting room as she still termed it  my dear she said this slate will tell you why this is the moment i have looked forward to from the time your dear father was taken from us with his work half done  he had been working out a discovery  he was sure of it himself but none of the faculty would believe in it or take it up  even dr lucas thought it was a craze and i believe it can only be tested by risky experiments  all that he had made out is in this book  you know he could not speak for that dreadful throat  this is what he wrote  i copied it again putting in my answers lest it should fade but these are his very words and that is my pledge  magnum bonum was our playful pet name for it between ourselves  i promise to keep the magnum bonum a secret till the boys are grown up and then only to confide it to the one that seems fittest when he has taken his degree and is a good religious wise able man with brains and balance fit to be trusted to work out and apply such an invention and not make it serve his own advancement but be a real good and blessing to all  and oh jock she added am i not thankful that after all it should have come about that you should fulfil those conditions  did you not once mean it for john said jock hastily looking up  yes when i thought that hateful money had turned you all aside  then i think he ought to share this knowledge  i thought you would say so but it is your first right  perhaps said jock  but he is superior in his own line to me  he gave himself up to this line of his own free will not like me as a resource  and moreover if it should bring any personal benefit as an accident it would be more important to him than to me  and these other conditions he fulfils to the letter  mother let me fetch him  she kissed his brow by way of answer and a call brought john into the room  the explanation was made and john said if you think it right aunt caroline  no one can quite fulfil the conditions but two may be better than one  then i will leave you to read it together she said after pointing them to the solemn words in the first page  oh you cannot think how glad i am to give up my trust  she went upstairs to the drawingroom and about half an hour had passed in this way when jock came to the door and said mother would you please to come down  it was a strange grave voice in which he spoke and when she reached the room they set allens most luxurious chair for her but she stood trembling reading in their faces that there was something they hesitated to tell her  they looked at one another as if to ask which should do it and a certain indignation and alarm seized on her you believe in it she cried as if she suspected them of disloyalty  most entirely they both exclaimed  it is a great discovery added jock but—  but said john as he hesitated it has been worked out within the last two years  not dr hermann she cried  no indeed said jock  why  because poor janet overheard our conversation and obtained a sight of the book  it was her ambition  i believe it was fatal to her she may have caught up enough of the outline to betray it  jock you remember that scene at belforest  i do said jock but this is not that scoundrel  it is ruthven who has worked it out in a full and regular way  it is making a considerable sensation though it has scarcely yet come into use as a mode of treatment  mother do not be disappointed  it will be the blessing that my father intended all the sooner for not being in the hands of two lads like us whom all the bigwigs would scout  and what i never thought of before said john  you know we are so often asked whether we belong to joseph brownlow that one forgets to mention it every time but that day when dr medlicott took me to the westminster hospital we fell in with dr ruthven and after the usual disappointment on finding i was only the nephew and not the son he said joseph brownlow would have been a great man if he had lived  i owe a great deal to a hint he once gave me  he ought to see these notes said jock  it strikes me that there is a clue here to that difficulty he mentions in that published paper of his  you ought to show it to him said john  you ought said jock  do you know much about him asked mother carey  i dont think i ever saw him though i know his name  a fashionable physician is he not  a very good man said john  a great westend swell just come to be the acknowledged head in his own line  i suppose it is just what my uncle would have been ten years ago if he had been spared  may we show it to him mother said jock  i should think he was quite to be trusted with it  i see  i was reading an account of this method of his to dr lucas one day and he was much interested and tried to tell me something about my father but it was after his speech grew so imperfect and he was so much excited and distressed that i had to lead him away from the subject  yes dr lucass incredulity made all the difference  how old is dr ruthven john  a little over forty i should say  he may have been a pupil of my uncles  after a little more consultation it was decided that john should write to dr ruthven that his cousin had some papers of his fathers which he thought the doctor might like to see and that they would bring them if he would make an appointment  and so the magnum bonum was no longer a secret a burden and a charge  it was not easy to tell whether she who had so long been its depositary felt the more lightened or disappointed  she had reckoned more than she knew upon the honour of the discovery being connected with the name of brownlow and she could not quite surmount the feeling that dr ruthven had somehow robbed her husband though her better sense accepted and admired the young mens argument that such discoveries were common property and that the benefit to the world was the same  allen was a good deal struck when he understood the matter  he said it explained a good deal to him which the others had been too young to observe or remember both in the old home and afterwards  one wonderful part of it is how you kept the secret and janet too he said  and you must often have been sorely tempted  i remember being amused at your disappointment and her indignation when i said i didnt see why a man was bound to be a doctor because his father was before him and i suppose if bobus or i had taken to it this ruthven need not have been beforehand with us  it would have been transgressing the conditions to hold it out to you  i dont imagine i could have done it any way said allen sighing i never can enter into the taste the others have for that style of thing but bobus might have succeeded  you must have expected it of him at the time when he and i used to laugh at what we thought was a monomania on your part for our taking up medical science as a tribute to our father when we did not need it as a provision  you see if any of you had taken up the study from pure philan thropy as some people do—well at any rate in george macdonalds novels—it would have been the very qualification  but i had little hope from the time that the fortune came  i dreamt the first night that midas had turned the whole of you to gold statues and that i was wandering about like the princess paribanou to find the magnum bonum to disenchant you  it has come pretty true said allen thoughtfully that inheritance did us all a great deal of mischief  and it took a greater magnum bonum a maximum bonum to disenchant us said armine  which i fear did not come from me said his mother and i am most grateful to the dear people who applied it to you  i wish i saw my way to the disenchantment of the other two  i suppose you quite despaired till john took his turn in that direction said allen  bobus could really have done better than any of us i fancy but he would not have fulfilled the religious condition as sine qua non  bobus is not really cleverer than jock said armine  yet the skipjack seemed the most improbable one of all said his mother  i wish he were not deprived of it after all  perhaps he is not said armine  he told me he had been comparing the ms notes with dr ruthvens published paper and he thought my father saw farther into the capabilities  well he will do right with it  i am thankful to leave it in such hands as his and the monks  then it was this continued allen that was the key to poor janets history  i suppose she hoped to qualify herself when she was madly set on going to zurich  though i told her i could never commit it to her but she knew just enough to make that wretched man fancy it a sort of quack secret and he managed to persuade her that he had real ability to pursue the discovery for her  poor janet it has been no magnum bonum to her i fear  if i could only know where she is  a civil but not a very eager note came in reply to john from dr ruthven making the appointment but so dispassionately that he might fairly be supposed to expect little from the interview  however they came home more than satisfied  perhaps in the interim dr ruthven had learnt what manner of young men they were and the honours they had won for he had received them very kindly and had told them how a conversation with joseph brownlow had put him on the scent of what he had since gradually and experimentally worked out and so fully proved to himself that he had begun treatment on that basis and with success though he had only as yet brought a portion of his fellow physicians to accept his system  lucas had then explained as much as was needful and shown him the notes  he read with increasing eagerness and presently they saw his face light up and with his finger on the passage they had expected he said this is just what i wanted  why did i not think of it before and asked permission to copy the passage  then he urged the publication of the notes in some medical journal showing true and generous anxiety that honour should be given where honour was due and that his system should have the support of a name not yet forgotten  further he told his visitors that they would hear from him soon and altogether they came home so much gratified that the mother began to lose her sense of being forestalled  she was hard at work in her own way on a set of models for dinnertable ornaments which had been ordered  potboilers had unfortunately much more success than the imaginary groups she enjoyed  therefore she stayed at home and only sent her young people on a commission to bring her as many varieties of foliage and seedvessels as they could when jock and armine spent this first holiday of waiting in setting forth with babie to get a regular good country walk grumbling horribly that she would not accompany them  she was deep in the moulding of a branch of chestnut which carried her back to the first time she saw those prickly clusters on that day of opening paradise at richmond with joe by her side then still mr brownlow to her joe who had seemed so much closer to her side in these last few days  the colonel might call armine the most like joe and say that jock almost absurdly recalled her own soldier father captain allen but to her jock always the most brought back her husbands words and ways in a hundred little gestures and predilections and she had still to struggle with her sense of injury that he should not be the foremost  the maid came up with two cards dr and mrs ruthven  this was speedy and caroline had to take off her brown holland apron and wash her hands while emma composed her cap in haste and not very good will for she could not but think them her natural enemies though she was ready to beat herself for being so small and nasty when they could not help it poor things  however mrs ruthven turned out to be a pleasant lively table dhote acquaintance of six or seven years ago in her maiden days and her doctor an agreeable scotsman who told mrs brownlow that he had been here on several evenings in former days and did not seem at all hurt that she did not remember him  he seemed disappointed that neither of the young men was at home and inquired whether they had anything in view  not definitely she said and she spoke of some of the various counsels dr medlicott and others had given them  in the midst she heard that peculiar dash with which the fordham carriage always announced itself  little esther might be ever so much a viscountess but could she ever cease to be shy  in spite of her increasing beauty and grace she was not a success in society for the ladies said she was slow she had no conversation and no dash or rattle to make up for it and nothing would ever teach her to like strangers  they were only so many disturbances in the way of her enjoyment of her husband and her baby and when she could not have the former to go out driving with her she always came and besought for the company of aunt caroline and babie above all when she had any shopping to do  she knew it was very foolish but she could never be happy in encountering shop people and she wanted strong support and protection to prevent herself from being made a lay figure by urgent dressmakers  her home only gave her help and company on great occasions for eleanor persisted in objecting to fine people was determined against attracting another guardsman and privately desired her sister to abstain from inviting her  essie was aware that this was all for the sake of a certain curate at st kenelms and left ellie to carry out her plan of passive resistance becoming thus the more dependent on her aunts family  in she came too graceful and courteous for strangers to detect the shock their presence gave her but much relieved to see them depart her husband was on guard and she had a whole list of commissions for mamma which would be much better executed without him  moreover baby must have a new pelisse and hat for the country and might not she have little stockings and shoes in case she should want to walk before the return to london  as little alice was but four months old and her fathers leave was only for three months this did not seem a very probable contingency but mother carey was always ready for shopping  she had never quite outgrown the delight of the change from being a penniless school girl casting wistful fleeting glances at the windows where happier maidens might enter and purchase  then there was to be a great review in two days time cecil would be with his regiment and esther wanted the whole family to go with her lunch with the officers and have a thorough holiday  cecil had sent a message that jock must come to have the cobwebs swept out of his brain and see his old friends before he got into harness again  it was a wellearned holiday as mother carey felt accepting it with eager pleasure for all who could come though johns power of so doing must be doubtful and there was little chance of a day being granted to allen  in going out with her niece carolines eye had fallen on an envelope among the cards on the hall table ambiguously addressed to j brownlow esq mb and on her return home she was met at the door by jock with a letter in his hand  so dr ruthven has been here he said drawing her into the consultingroom  yes  i like him rather  he seems to wish to make any amends in his power  amends you dear old ridiculous mother  do you call this amends holding up the letter  he says now this discovery is getting known and he has a name for the sort of case his practice is outgrowing him and he wants some one to work with him who may be up to this particular matter and all he has heard of us convinces him that he cannot do better than propose it to whichever of us has no other designs  very right and proper of him  it is the only thing he can do  i suppose it would be the making of one of you  ah as she glanced over the letter  he gives the preference to you  he was bound to do that but i think he would prefer the monk i wonder whether you care very much about my accepting the offer  would this house be too far off  i dont know his plans enough to tell  that was not what i was thinking of but of what it would save her  essie said she was not looking well and no doubt waiting is telling on her just as her mother always feared it would  john has just not had the forbearance you have shown  that is all circumstance  there was the saving her life and afterwards the being on the spot when she was tormented about the other affair  he has no notion of having cut me out and i trust he never will  no i do him that justice  then he has the advantage of me every way out and out in looks and university training and it was to him that ruthven first took a fancy  you surpassed him in your essay and in  oh yes yes interrupted jock hastily but you see work was my refuge  i had nothing to call me off  besides i have my share of your brains instead of her serenitys but thats all the more reason if you would listen to me  depend upon it ruthven if he knew all would much prefer the connection john would have and she would bring means to set up directly  i suppose you will have it so replied she looking up to him affectionately  i should like it he said  it is the one thing for them and waiting might do her infinite harm the dear old monk deserves it every way  remember how it all turned on his desperate race  if your comfort depended on my taking it that would come first  oh no  but there is sure to turn up plenty of other work without leaving you he continued  i dont fancy getting involved in westend practice among swells and not being independent  i had rather see whether i cant work out this principle further devoting myself to reading up for it and getting more hospital experience to go upon  i dare say that is quite right  i know it is like your father and indeed i shall be quite content however you decide  only might it not be well to see how it strikes john before you absolutely make it over to him  you are trying to be prudent against the grain mother carey  trying to see it like your uncle  yes exactly as if i were trying to forestall his calling me his good little sister  i dont know what he would call me said jock for at the bottom is a feeling that after reading my fathers words i had rather not if i can help it begin immediately to make all that material advantage out of magnum bonum as you call it  well my dear do as you think right i trust it all to you  it is sure to turn out the right sort of magnum bonum to you—  the monks characteristic ring at the bell was heard and the letter was without loss of time committed to him while both mother and son watched him as he gathered up the sense  well this is jolly was his first observation  downright handsome of ruthven and then as the colour rose a little in his face just the thing for you jock home work which is exactly what you want  im not sure about that said jock i dont want to get into that kind of practice just yet  it is fitter for a family man  and who is a family man if you are not said john  wasnt it the very cause of your taking this line  theres a popular prejudice in favour of wives rather than mothers said jock  i should have said you were more likely to fulfil the conditions  oh and there was a sound in that exclamation that belied the sequel thats just nonsense  the offer is to you primarily and it is your duty to take it  i had much rather you did and so had dr ruthven  i want more time for study and experience and have set my heart on some scientific appointment—  come now my good fellow—why what are you laughing at  because you are such a good imitation of your father my dear johnny said his aunt  it is just what my father would say returned john taking this as a high compliment it would be very foolish of lucas to give up a certainty for this just because of his skipjack element which doesnt want to get into routine harness  now dont you think so mother carey  if i thought it was the skipjack element she said smiling  if it is not he said the colour now spreading all over his face i am all the more bound not to let him give up all his prospects in life  all my prospects  my dear monk do you think they dont go beyond a brougham and unlimited staircases  i only know cried john nettled into being a little off his guard that what you despise would be all the world to me  the admission was hailed triumphantly but the kencroft nature was too resolute and the individual conscience too generous to be brought round to accept the sacrifice which john estimated at the value of the importance it was to himself viewing what was real in lucass distaste as mere erratic folly which ought to be argued down  finally when the argument had gone round into at least its fiftieth circle mother carey declared that she would have no more of it  lucas should write a note to dr ruthven accepting his proposal for one or other of them and promising that he should know which in the course of a few days so that john if he chose could write to his father or anyone else  meantime there was to be no allusion to the raid of ruthven till the day of the review was over  it was to be put entirely off the tongue if not out of the head  and the two young doctors were weary enough of the subject to rejoice in obedience to her  the day was perfect except that poor allen was pinned fast by his tyrant all the others gave themselves up to the enjoyment of the moment  they understood the sham fight and recognised all the corps with jock as their cicerone they had a good place at the marching past and esther had the crowning delight of an excellent view of captain viscount fordham with his company and at the luncheon  jock received an absolutely affectionate welcome from his old friends who made as much of his mother and sister for his sake as they did of the lovely lady fordham for her husbands finding them moreover much more easy to get on with     chapter xxxix  the truant    the bird was sitting in his cage   and heard what he did say he jumped upon the window sill  tis time i was away                            ballad   there is a young lady in the drawingroom maam said the maid looking rather puzzled and uncertain on the return of the party from the review  a stranger  how could you let her in said john  at that moment a face appeared at the top of the stairs a face set in the rich golden auburn that all knew so well and half way up mrs brownlow was clasped by a pair of arms and there was a cry mother carey mother carey im come home  elvira my dear child  when—how did you come  from the station in a cab  i made her let me in but i thought you were never coming back  wheres allen  allen will come in byandby said the astonished mother carey who had been dragged into the drawingroom where elvira embraced babie and grasped the hands of the others  oh it is so nice she cried then nestling back to mother carey  but where did you come from  are you alone  yes quite alone janet would not come with me after all  janet my dear  where is she  oh not here—at saratoga or at new york  i thought she was coming with me but when the steamer sailed she was not there only there was a note pinned to my berth  i meant to have brought it but it got lost somehow  where did you see her  at the photographers at saratoga  i should never have come if she had not helped me but she said she knew you would take me home and she wrote and took my passage and all  she said if i did not find you mr wakefield would know where you were but i did so want to get home to you  please may i take off my things i dont want to be such a fright when allen comes in  it was all very mysterious but elvira must be much altered indeed if her narrative did not come out in an utterly complicated and detached manner  she was altered certainly for she clung most affectionately to mother carey and barbara when they took her upstairs  she had a little travellingbag with her the rest of her luggage would be sent from the station she supposed for she had taken no heed to it  she did so want to get home  i did feel so hungry for you mother carey  mother janet said you would forgive me and i thought if you were ever so angry it would be true and that would be nicer than lisette and indeed it was not so much my doing as lisettes  whatever it was mother carey had no hesitation in replying that she had no doubt it was lisettes fault  you see continued elvira i never meant anything but to plague allen a little at first  you know he had always been so tiresome and jealous and always teased me when i wanted any fun—at least i thought so and i did want to have my swing before he called me engaged to him again  i told jock so but then lisette and lady flora and old lady clanmacnalty went on telling me that you knew the money was mine all the time and that it was only an accident that it came out before i was married  oh elvira you could not have thought anything so wicked cried babie  they all went on so and made so sure said elvira hanging her head and i never did know the real way the will was found till janet told me  babie if you had heard lady clanmacnalty clear her throat when people talked about the will being found you would have believed she knew better than anyone  so it was  the girl weak in character and far from sensible full of selfimportance and puffed up with her inheritance had been easily blinded and involved in the web that the artful lisette had managed to draw round her  she had been totally alienated from her old friends and by force of reiteration had been brought to think them guilty of defrauding her  in truth she was kept in a whirl of gaiety and amusement with little power of realizing her situation till the breach had grown too wide for the feeble will of a helpless being like her to cross it  though she had flirted extensively she had never felt capable of accepting any one of her suitors and in these refusals she had been assisted by lisette who wanted to secure her for her brother but thanks to warnings from mr wakefield and her husbands sense of duty durst not do so before she was of age  elviras one wish had been to visit san ildefonso again  she had a strong yearning towards the lovely island home which she gilded in recollection with all the trails of glory that shine round the objects of our childish affections  lisette always promised to take her but found excuses for delay in the refitting of the yacht while she kept the party wandering over europe in the resorts of second rate english residents  no doubt she wished to make the most of the enjoyments she could obtain as elviras chaperon and guardian before resigning her even to her brother  at last the gambling habits into which her husband fell for lack poor man of any other employment had alarmed her and she permitted her party to embark in the yacht where gilbert gould acted as captain  they reached the island  it had become a coaling station  the bay where she remembered exquisite groves coming down to the white beach was a wharf ringing with the discordant shouts of negroes and cries of sailors  the old nurse was dead and fictitious foster brothers and sisters were constantly turning up with extravagant claims  oh i longed never to have come said elvira and then i began to get homesick but they would not let me come  no doubt lisette had feared the revival of the brownlow influence if her charge were once in england for she had raised every obstacle to a return  poor gould and his niece had both looked forward to elviras coming of age as necessarily bringing them to england but her uncles health had suffered from the dissipation he had found his only resource  liquor had become his consolation in the life to which he was condemned and in the hotel life of america was only too easily attainable  his death deprived elvira of the last barrier to the attempts of an unscrupulous woman who was determined not to let her escape elviras longing to return home made her spread her toils closer she kept her moving from one fashionable resort to another still attended by gilbert who was beginning to grow impatient to secure his prize  how i hated it said elvira  i knew she was false and cruel by that time but it was just like being in a trap between them  i loathed them more and more but i couldnt get away  nurtured as she had been she was helpless and ignorant about the commonest affairs of life and the sight of american independence never inspired her with the idea of breaking the bondage in which she was spellbound  still she shrank back with instinctive horror from every advance of gilberts and at last to pique her lisette brought forward the intelligence that allen brownlow was married  the effect must have surprised them for elvira turned on her aunt in one of those fits of passion which sometimes seized her accused her vehemently of having poisoned the happiness of her life and taken her from the only man she could ever love  she said and threatened all sorts of desperate things and then the poor child exhausted by her own violence collapsed and let herself be cowed and terrified in her turn by her aunts vulgar sneers and cold determination  yet still she held out against the marriage  i told them it would be wicked she said  and when i went to church all the psalms and everything said it would be wicked  then lisette said it was wicked to love a married man and i said i didnt know i couldnt help it but it would be more wicked to vow i would love a man whom i hated and should hate more every day of my life  then they said i might have a civil marriage and not vow anything at all and i told them that would seem to me no better than not being married at all  oh i was very very miserable  had you no one to consult or help you my poor child   they watched me so and whenever i was making friends with any nice american girl they always rattled me off somewhere else  i never did understand before what people meant when they talked about god being their only friend but i knew it then for i had none at all none else  and i did not think he would help me for now i knew i had been hard and horrid and nasty and cruel to you and allen the only people who ever cared for me for myself and not for my horrid horrid money though i was the nastiest little wretch  oh mother carey i did know it then and i got quite sick with longing for one honest kiss—or even one honest scolding of yours  i used to cry all churchtime and they used to try not to let me go—and i felt just like the children of israel in egypt as if i had got into heavy bondage and the land of captivity  o do speak and let me hear your voice once more  your arm is so comfortable  still it seemed that elvira had resisted till another attempt was made  while she was at a boardinghouse on the hudson a large picnic party was arranged in which after american fashion gentlemen took ladies to ride in their traps to and from the place of rendezvous in returning of course it had been as easy as possible for her chaperon to contrive that she should be left alone with no cavalier but gilbert gould and he of course pretended to lose his way drove on till nightfall and then judgmatically met with an accident which hurt nobody but which he declared made the carriage incapable of proceeding  after walking what elvira fancied half the night shelter was found in a hospitable farmhouse where the people were wakened with difficulty  they took care of the benighted wanderers and the farmer drove them back to the hotel the next morning in his own waggon  they were received by mrs gould with great demonstrations both of affection pity and dismay and she declared that the affair had been so shocking and compromising that it was impossible to stay where they were  she made elvira take her meals in her room rather than face the boardinghouse company paid the bills all of course with elviras money and carried her off to the saratoga springs having taken good care not to allow her a minutes conversation with anyone who would have told her that the freedom of american manners would make an adventure like hers be thought of no consequence at all  the poor girl herself was assured by mrs gould that this unhappy escapade left her no alternative but a marriage with gilbert  she would otherwise never be able to show her face again for even if the affair were hushed up reports would fly and mrs lisette took care they should fly by ominous shakes of the head and whispered confidences such as made the steadier portion of the saratoga community avoid her and brought her insolent attention from fast young men  it was this and a cold what can you expect from lisette that finally broke down her defences and made her permit the goulds to make known that she was engaged to gilbert  had they seized their prey at that moment of shame and despair they would have secured it but their vanity or their selfesteem made them wish to wash off the mire they had cast or to conceal it by such magnificence at the wedding as should outdo fifth avenue  the english heiress must have a weddingdress that would figure in the papers and even in the states be fabulously splendid  it must come from paris and it must be waited for  all the bridesmaids were to have splendid pearl lockets containing coloured miniature photograph portraits of the beautiful bride who for her part was utterly brokenhearted  i thought god had forgotten me because i deserved it and i only hoped i might die for i knew what the sailors said of gilbert  listless and indifferent she let her tyrants do what they would with her and it was in gilberts company that she first saw janet at the photographers  fortunately he had never seen miss brownlow and elvira had grown much too cautious to betray recognition but the vigilance had been relaxed since the avowal of the engagement and the colouring of the photographs from the life was a process so wearisome that no one cared to attend the sitter and elvira could go and come alone and unquestioned  so it was that she threw herself upon janet  whatever had been their relations in their girlhood each was to the other the remnant of the old home and of better days and in their stolen interviews they met like sisters  janet knew as little as elvira did of her own family rather less indeed but she declared mrs goulds horror about the expedition with gilbert to have been pure dissimulation and soon enabled elvira to prove to herself that it had been a concerted trick  in america it would go for nothing  even in england so mere an accident even if it had really been an accident would not tell against her  but then elvira hopelessly said allen was married  again janet was incredulous and when she found that elvira had never seen the letter in which kate gould was supposed to have sent the information and knew it only upon lisettes assertion she declared it to be probably a fabrication  why not telegraph  so in elviras name and at her expense but with the address given to janets abode the telegram was sent to mr wakefields office and in a few hours the reply had come back allen brownlow not married nor likely to be  there was no doubt now of the web of falsehood that had entangled the poor girl but she would probably have been too inert and helpless to break through it save for her energetic cousin who nerved her to escape from the life of utter misery that lay before her  what was to hinder her from setting off by the train and going at once home to england by the steamer  there was no doubt that mrs brownlow would forgive and welcome her or even if that hope failed her mr wakefield was bound to take care of her  she had a house of her own standing empty for her and the owner of £40000 a year need never be at a loss  had she enough money accessible to pay for a firstclass passage yes amply even for two  she had always been so passive and incapable of all matters of arrangement that mrs gould had never thought it worth while to keep watch over her possession of the nerves and sinews of war being indeed unwilling to rouse her attention to the fact that she was paying the by no means moderate expenses of both her tyrants  janet found out all about the hours secured—as elvira thought—two firstclass berths met her when she crept like a guilty thing out of the hotel at new york took her to the station went with her to an outfitter to be supplied with necessaries for the voyage for she had been obliged to abandon everything but a few valuables in her handbag and saw her safely on board introduced her to some kind friendly english people then on some excuse of seeing the steward left her as elvira found to make the voyage alone  it turned out that janet had spoken to the gentleman of this party and explained that her young cousin was going home alone asking him to protect her on landing and that she had come to london with them and been there put into a cab giving the old address to collingwood street where with much difficulty she had prevailed on the maid to let her in to await the return of the family  nothing so connected as this history came to the ears of mrs brownlow or her children  that evening they only heard fragments much more that was utterly irrelevant and much that was inexplic able all interspersed with inquiries and caresses and intent listening for allen  elvira might not have acquired brains but she had gained in sweetness and affection  the face had lost its soulless painteddoll expression and she was evidently happy beyond all measure to be among those she could love and trust sitting on a footstool by mrs brownlows knee leaning against her and now and then murmuring o mother carey how i have longed for you  she was not free from the fear that lisette and gilbert could still do something to her  but the johns made large assurances of defence and mr wakefield was to be called in the next day  it must be confessed that everybody rather enjoyed the notion of the pair left at saratoga with all their hotel bills to pay and the wedding dress on their hands but elvira knew they had enough to clear them for the week and only hoped it was not enough to enable them to follow her  fragments of all this came out in the course of the evening  allen did not come home to dinner and the other young men left the coast clear for confidences which were uttered in the intervals of listening till after all her excitement her landing and her journey elvira was so tired out that she had actually dropped asleep with her head on mother careys knee when his soft weary step came up the stairs and perceiving as he entered that there was a hush over the room he did not speak  babie looked up from her work with an amused smile of infinite congratulation  there was a glance from his mother  then as babie put it the prince saw the sleeping beauty and with a strange long halfstrangled gasp and clasped hands went down on one knee  at that very moment elvira stirred opened her eyes put her hand over them bewildered as if thinking herself dreaming then with a sort of shriek of joy flung herself towards him as he held out his arms with my darling  o allen can you forgive me  and oh do marry me before they can come after me  so much mother carey and babie heard before they could remove themselves from the scene which they felt ought to be a teteatete they shut the lovers in  babie said undine has found a heart at least and then they began to piece out the story by conjecture and they then discovered how little they had really learnt about janet they supposed that the hermanns must be living and practising at saratoga and in that case it was no wonder she could not come home the only strange thing was elviras expecting it  besides why had not mrs gould taken alarm at the name and why was her husband never mentioned  was there no message from her  most likely there was in the note that was lost and moreover elvira might be improved but she was elvira still and had room for very little besides herself in her minds eye  they must wait to examine her till these first raptures had subsided and in the mean time caroline wrote a telegram to go as early as possible to mr wakefield  it showed a guilty conscience that mrs gould should not have telegraphed to him elviras flight  when at last mrs brownlow held that the interview must come to an end and with preliminary warning opened the door there they were with clasped hands such as elvira had never endured since she was a mere child  allen looking almost too blissful for this world and elvira with eyes glistening with tears as she cried o mother carey you never told me how altered he was i never knew how horrible i had been till i saw how ill he looks  what can we do for him  you are doing everything my darling said allen  he of course thinks her as irresponsible as if she had been hanging up by the hair all this time in a giants larder whispered babie to armine  but elvira was really unhappy about the worn faded air that made allen look much older than his twentynine years warranted  the poor girls nerves proved to have been much disturbed she besought barbara to sleep with her and was haunted by fears of pursuit and capture and gilbert claiming her after all  she kept on starting clutching at babie and requiring to be soothed till far on into the night and then she slept so soundly that no one had the heart to wake her  indeed it was her first real peaceful repose since her flight had been planned nor did she come down till halfpast ten just when mr wakefield drove up to the door and jock had taken pity on allen and set forth to undertake sir samuel for the day  mr wakefield was the less surprised at the sight of the young lady having been somewhat prepared by her telegraphic inquiry about allen which he had not communicated to the brownlows for fear of raising false expectations  there was a great consultation  elvira was not in the least shy and only wanted to be safely mrs allen brownlow before the goulds should arrive as she expected in the next steamer to pursue her vi et armis  if it had depended on her she would have sent allen for a special licence and been married in her travelling dress that very day  mr wakefield solicitor as he was was quite ready for speed he had always viewed the marriage with allen brownlow as a simple act of restitution and the trust made settlements needless  still he did not apprehend any danger from the goulds when he found that elvira had never written a note to gilbert in her life  nay he thought that if they even threatened any annoyance they had given cause enough to have a prosecution for conspiracy held over them in wholesome terror  and considering all the circumstances mrs brownlow and allen were alike determined against undignified haste  miss menella ought to be married from among her own kindred and from her own house but this was not easy to manage for poor mary whiteside and her husband though very worthy were not exactly the people to enact parents in such a house as belforest and mrs brownlow could see why she herself should not though elvira could not think why she objected at last the idea was started that the fittest persons were mr and mrs wakefield  the latter was a thorough lady pleasant and sensible  the only doubt was whether so very quiet a person could be asked to undertake such an affair and her husband took leave that he might consult her and see whether she could bring herself to be mother for the nonce to the wild heiress of whom his family were wont to talk with horrified compassion  when he was gone it was possible to come to the examination upon janet for which mother carey had been so anxious  how was she looking  oh so old and worn and thin  i never should have guessed it was janet if i had not caught her eye and then i knew her eyebrows and nose because they are just like allens—and her voice sounded so like home that i was ready to cry only i did not dare as gilbert was there  i wonder they did not take alarm at her name  i dont imagine they ever heard it  not when she was living there  was not her husband practising  her husband  oh no i never heard any thing about him  i thought you knew i found her at the photographers  met her as a sitter  oh dear no  i thought you understood  it was she that was doing my picture  she finishes up all his miniature photographs  my dear elvira do you really mean that my poor janet is supporting herself in that way  yes indeed i do that was why i made sure she would have come home with me  i was so dreadfully disappointed when i found only her note  and are you sure you have quite lost it  yes i turned out every corner of my bag this morning to look for it  i am so sorry but i was so ill and so wretched that i could not take care of anything  i just wonder how i lived through the voyage all alone  was there no message  nothing for me  yes i have recollected it now or some of it  she said she durst not go home or ask anything of you after the way she had offended oh i wonder how she could send me for i know i was worse  but what did she say said caroline too anxious to listen to elviras own confessions  was there nothing for me  yes  she said tell her that i have learnt by the bitterest of all experience the pain i have given her and the wrong i have done then there was something about being so utterly past forgiveness that she could not come to ask it  oh dont cry so mother carey we can write and get her back and i will send her the passage money  ah yes write cried out the mother starting up  when he was yet a great way off  ah why could she not remember that  but as she sat down to her table you know her address  yes certainly i went to her lodgings once or twice such a little bit of a room up so many stairs  and you did not hear how that man her husband died  i dont know whether he is dead said this most unsatisfactory informant  she does not wear black nor a cap and i am almost sure that he has run away from her and that is the reason she cannot use her own name  elfie  o i thought you knew  she calls herself mrs harte  she took my passage in that name and that must be why my things have never come yes i asked her why she did not set up for a lady doctor and she said it was impossible that she could venture on showing her certificates or using her name—either his or hers  that was in the main all that could be extracted from elvira though it was brought out again and again in all sorts of forms  it was plain that janet had been very reticent in all that regarded herself and elvira had only had stolen interviews very full of her own affairs and besides had supposed janet to intend to return with her  both wrote elfie to announce her safety and caroline an incoherent imploring forgiving letter such as only a mother could write before they went out to supply elviras lack of garments and to procure the order for the sum needed for her passage  caroline was glad they had gone independently for on their return babie reported to her that her little ladyship was so wroth with elfie as to wonder at them for receiving her so affectionately  it was very forgiving of them but she should never forget the way in which poor allen had been treated  i told her said babie that was the way she talked about cecil and you should have seen her face  she wonders that allen has not more spirit and indeed mother i do rather wish elfie could have come back with nothing but her little bag so that he could have shown it would have been all the same  a comfortable life they would have had poor things in that case laughed her mother though i agree that it would have been prettier but i dont trouble myself about that my dear  you know in all equity allen ought to have a share in that property  it was only the old mans caprice that made it all or none and elvira is only doing what is right and just  and allens love was a real thing when he was the rich one  so i told essie and besides allen would never make any hand of poverty poor fellow  i think and hope he will make a much better hand of riches than he would have done without all he has gone through said her mother  allen showed the same feeling when he could talk his prospects over quietly with his mother  these four years had altered him at least as much for the better as elfie  he would not now begin in thoughtless selfindulgence refined indeed and never vicious but selfish extravagant and heedless of all but ease pleasure and culture  some of the enervation of his youth had really worn off though it had so long made him morbid and he had learnt humility by his failures  above all however his intercourse with fordham had opened his eyes to a sense of the duties of wealth and position such as he had never before acquired and the religious habits that had insensibly grown upon him were tincturing his views of life and responsibility  it was painful to him to realise that he was returning to wealth and luxury indeed monopolising it—he the helpless undeserving indolent son while all the others and especially his mother were left to poverty  elfie wanted mother carey and all to make their home at belforest and still be one family as of old  indeed she hung on mother carey even more than upon allen after her long famine from the motherly tenderness that she had once so little appreciated  of such an amalgamation however mrs brownlow would not hear nor would she listen to a proposal of settling on her a yearly income such as would dispense with economy and with the manufacture of potboilers  no she said she was a perverse woman and she had never been so happy as when living on her husbands earnings  the period of education being over she had a full sufficiency and should only meddle with clay again for her own pleasure  she was beginning already a set of diningtable ornaments for a weddingpresent representing the early part of the story of undine  babie knew why if nobody else did  perhaps she should one of these days mould a similar set for sydney of the crusaders of jotapata  then allen bethought him of putting into elviras head to beg at least to undertake armines expenses at the theological college for a year and to this she consented thankfully  armine had been thinking of offering himself as allens successor for a year with sir samuel but two days experience as substitute convinced him that allen was right in declaring that my lady would be the death of him  lucas could manage her and kept her wellbehaved and even polite but armine was so young and so deferential that she treated him even worse than she did her first victim  she had begun by insisting on a quarters notice or the forfeiture of the salary as long as she thought £25 was of vital importance to allen but as soon as she discovered that the young lady was a great heiress she became most unedifyingly civil called in great state in collingwood street and went about boasting of having patronised a sort of prince in disguise  meantime dr ruthvens offer seemed left in abeyance  colonel brownlow had all his sons scruples and more than his indignation at lucass folly in hesitating and john was so sure that he ought not to accept the proposal that he would not stir in the matter nor mention it to sydney  at last lucas acted on his own responsibility and had an interview with dr ruthven in which he declined the offer for himself but made it known that his cousin was not only brother to the beautiful lady fordham who had been met in collingwood street but was engaged to lord fordhams sister  at which connection the fashionable physician rubbed his hands with so much glee that jock was the more glad not to have to hunt in couples with him  the magnificent weddingdress had been stopped by telegram just as it was packed for new york and was despatched to belforest  mrs wakefield undertook the task imposed upon her and the wedding was to be grand enough to challenge attention and not be liable to the accusation of being done in a corner  it might be called hasty for only a month would have passed since elviras arrival before her weddingday but this was by her own earnest wish  she made it no secret that she should never cease to be nervous till she was allen brownlows wife even though a letter to her cousins at river hollow had removed all fear of pursuit by mrs gould she seemed bent on remaining at new york and complained loudly of the ungrateful girl whose personal belongings she retained by way of compensation  it would have been too much to expect that elvira should be a wise and clever woman but she had really learnt to be an affectionate one and in the school of adversity had parted with much of her selfish petulance and arrogance  allen whose love had always been blindly tender more like a womans or a parents love than that of an ordinary lover was rapturous at the response he at last received at the same time he knew her too well to expect from her intellectual companionship and would be quite content with what she could give  they were both of them chastened and elevated in tone by their five years discipline  the night before the party went down to belforest where they were to meet the evelyns allen lingered with his mother after all the rest had gone upstairs  mother he said i have thought a great deal of that dream of yours  i hope that the touch of midas may not be baneful this time  i trust not my dear you have had a taste of the stern rugged nurse  and mother i know i failed egregiously where the others rose  but you were rising  then you will let me do nothing for you and i feel myself sneaking into your inheritance to the exclusion of all the rest in a back door sort of way  my dear allen it cant be helped you have honestly loved your elf from her infancy when she had nothing and she really loved you at the very worst  love is so much more than gold that it really signifies very little which of you has the money  you and she have both gone through a good deal and it depends upon you now whether the possession becomes a blessing to yourselves and others  dont vex about our not having a share you know yourself how much happier we all are without the load and there will never be any anxiety now i shall always fall back on you if i want anything  that is right said allen clearing up a good deal as she looked up brightly in his face  you promise me  of course i do she said smiling  im not proud  and you did make armine consent to our paying those expenses of his that was good of you but the boy only does it out of obedience  yes he would like a little bit of selfwilled penance but it is much better for him to submit bodily and mentally  elvira has asked me whether we cant after all build the church and all the rest which he wanted so much and give it to him  caroline smiled she would not vex allen by saying how this was merely in the spirit of the story book endowing everybody with what they wanted but she said build by all means and endow when you have had time to see what is needed and what is good for the people but not for armines sake you know  he had much better serve his apprenticeship and learn his work somewhere else  he would tell you so himself  i daresay  he would talk of the touch of midas again  elvira will be sadly disappointed  she had some fancy of presenting him to it as soon as he was ordained  getting the fairies meantime to build the whole concern in secret dear elfie her plans are generous and kind  tell her with my love that her church must not be a shrine for armine but that perhaps he and it will be fit for each other in some five years time meantime if she wants to make somebody happy theres that excellent hardworking curate of eleanors who has done more good in kenminster than i ever saw done there before  i dont see why kencroft should get all the advantages  ah  you ungrateful boy  now if rob had carried off elfie you might complain  at which allen could not but laugh  and now good night mr bridegroom you want your beauty sleep though i must say you look considerably younger than you did two months ago  the wedding was a bright one involving no partings only joy and gladness and the sole drawback to the general rejoicings seemed to be that it was not mrs brownlow herself who was returning to take possession  but on that very afternoon came a chill on her heart  her own letter and elviras to janet were returned from america  it was quite probable that the right address might have been in elviras lost note and that janet might be easily found through the photographer but said her mother i do not believe she will ever come home unless i go to fetch her  the very thing i was thinking of doing said jock  letters will hardly find her now and i have not settled to anything  the dear old doctors legacy will find the means  and i am sure you want the rest of the voyage  i dont like the looks of you my jockey  i shall be all right when this is over said jock with an endeavour at laughing but i find i am a greater fool than i thought i was and i had much better be out of the way of it all till it is a fait accompli  it was of course johns marriage  this was the first time jock had seen the lovers together  in spite of vehement talking and laughing warm greetings to everyone and playing at every interval with the little cousins jock could not hide from either of the mothers that the sight cost him a good deal all the more because the showing the belforest haunts to sydney had always been a favourite scheme hitherto unfulfilled nor was there any avoiding family consult ations which resulted in the fixing of the wedding for the middle of september so that there might be time for a short tour before they settled down to johns work in london  mrs evelyn begged that barbara would come to her whilst her mother and brother were away armine would be at his theological college and there was nothing to detain mrs brownlow and her son from the journey to which both looked forward with absolute pleasure not only in the hope of the meeting but in the being together and throwing off for a time the cares of home and gratifying the spirit of enterprise  jock had one secret  he had reason to think that bobus would have a kind of vacation at the time and he telegraphed to japan what their intended voyage was to be with a hope he durst not tell that his favourite brother would not throw away the opportunity of meeting them in america     chapter xl  evil out of good    and all too little to atone for knowing what should neer be known                                         scott   the season at saratoga was not yet over the travellers were told at new york though people were fast thronging back into the city should they go on thither at once or try to find the photographer nearer at hand  it was on a friday that they landed and they resolved to wait till monday jock thinking that a rest would be better for his mother  the early autumn sun glowed on the broad streets as they walked slowly through them halting to examine narrowly every display of portraits at a photographers door  it was a right course they came upon some exquisitelyfinished ones among which they detected unmistakably the coloured likeness of elvira de menella  they went into the studio and asked to look at it  ah many ask that they were told though the sensation was a little gone by  what sensation jock asked while his mother trembled so much that she had to sit down on one of the velvet chairs  i guess you are a stranger sir from england  then no doubt you have not heard of the great event of the season at saratoga the sudden elopement of this young lady a beautiful english heiress on the eve of marriage these very portraits ordered for the bridesmaids lockets  whom did she elope with asked jock  thats the remarkable part of it sir  some say that she was claimed in secret by a lover to whom she had been long much attached but we are better informed  i can state to a certainty that she only fled to escape the tyranny of an aunt  she need only have appealed to the institutions of the country  very true said jock  let me ask if your informant was not the lady who coloured this photograph mrs harte  yes  and is she here  no sir with some hesitation  can you give me her address  i am her brother  this lady is her mother and we are very anxious to find her  the photographer was gained by the frank address and manner  i am sorry he said but the truth is that there was a monster excitement about the disappearance of the girl and as mrs harte was said to have been concerned there was constant resort to the studio to interview her and i cannot but think she treated me ill sir for she quitted me at an hours notice  and left no address exclaimed her mother grievously disappointed  not with me madam but she was intimate with a young lady employed in our establishment and she may know where to find her  and through a tube the photographer issued a summons which resulted in the appearance of a pleasantlooking girl who on hearing that mrs hartes mother and brother were in search of her readily responded that mrs harte had written to her a month ago from philadelphia asking her to forward to her any letters that might come to the room she usually occupied at new york  she had found employment and there could be no doubt that she would be heard of there  it was very near now  there was something very soothing in the services of that sunday of waiting when the church seemed a home on the other side the sea and on the monday they were on their way hearing but scarcely heeding the talk in the cars of the terrible yellowfever visitation then beginning at new orleans  they arrived too late to do anything but in early morning they were on foot breakfasting with the first relay of guests at the hotel and inquiring their way along the broad treeplanted streets of the old quaker city  it was again at a photograph shop that they paused but as they were looking for the number the private door opened and there issued from it a grey figure with a black hat and a bag in her hand  she stood on the step they on the sidewalk  she had a thin worn haggard face a strange grey look about it but when the eyes met on either side there was not a moments doubt  there was not much demonstration  caroline held out her hand and janet let hers be locked tight into it  jock took her bag from her and they went two or three paces together as in a dream till jock spoke first  where are we going  can we come back with you janet or will you come to the hotel with us  i was just leaving my rooms she said  i was on my way to the station  you will come with me said caroline under her breath and janet passively let herself be led along her mother unconsciously holding her painfully fast  so they reached the hotel and then jock said i shall go and read the papers send a message for me if you want me  you had rather be left to yourselves  the mother knew not how she reached her bedroom but once there and with the door locked she turned with open arms  oh janet one kiss and janet slid down on the floor before her hiding her face in her dress and sobbing oh mother mother i am not worthy of this  then caroline flung herself down by her and gathered her into her arms and janet rested her head on her shoulder for some seconds each sensible of little save absolute content  and you have come all this way for me whispered janet at last raising her head to gaze at the face  i did so long after you  my poor poor child how you have suffered said caroline drawing through her fingers the thin worn bony hardworked hand  i deserved a thousand times more said janet  but it seems all gone since i see you mother  and if you forgive i can hope god forgives too  my child my child and as the strong embrace and the kiss was on her brow janet lay still once more in the strange rest and relief it is very strange she said  i thought the sight of you would wither me with shame but somehow theres no room for anything but happiness  renewed caresses for her mother was past speaking  and lucas is with you  not babie  no babie is left with mrs evelyn  so poor little elvira came safe home  yes and is mrs allen brownlow  poor child you rescued her from a sad fate  she believed to the last you were coming with her and she lost your note or you would have heard from us sooner  janet went on asking questions about the others  her mother dreaded to put any and only replied  janet asked where they had been living and she answered  in the old house while the two johns have been studying medicine  not lucas cried janet sitting upright in her surprise  yes lucas  the dear fellow gave up all his prospects in the army because he thought it would be more helpful to me for him to take this line and he has passed so well janet  he has got the silver medal and his essay was the prize one  and— janet stood up and walked to the window as she said and you have told him—  yes  but janet it was too late  some hints of your fathers had been followed up and the main discovery worked out though not perfected  janets eyes glistened for a moment as they used to do in angry excitement and she asked could he bear it  he was chiefly concerned lest i should be disappointed  then he reminded me that the benefit to mankind had come all the sooner  ah said janet with a gasp theres the difference  she did not explain further but said it has not poisoned his life  then seeking in her bag she took out a packet  i wish you to know all about it mother she said  i wrote this to send home by elvira but then my heart failed me  it was well since she lost my note  i kept it and when i did not hear from you i thought i would leave it to be posted when all was over with me  i should like you to read it and i will tell you anything else you like to know  there came the interruption of the hotel luncheon after which a room was engaged for janet and the use of a private parlour secured for the afternoon and evening  jock came and went  he was very much excited about the frightful reports he heard of the ravages of yellow fever in the south and went in search of medical papers and reports janet directed him where to seek them  i was just starting to offer myself as an attendant she said  i shall still go tomorrow  you  oh janet not now was her mothers first exclamation  you will understand when you have read quietly said janet  all that afternoon according to her manifest wish her mother was reading that confession of hers while she sat by replying to each question or comment in the repose of a confidence such as had not existed for fifteen years   magnum bonum wrote janet  so my father named it  alas it has been magnum malum to me  i have thought over how the evil began  i think it must have been when i brooded over the words i caught at my fathers deathbed instead of confessing to my mother that i had overheard them  it might be reserve and dread of her grief but it was not wholly so  i did not respect her as i ought in my childish conceit  i was an oldfashioned girl  grandmamma treated her like a petted eldest child and i had not learnt to look up to her with any loyalty  my uncle and aunt too even while seeming to uphold her authority betrayed how cheaply they held her  no wonder said caroline  i was a very foolish creature then  i saw you differently too late said janet  thus unchecked by any sober word my imagination went on dwelling on those words which represented to me an arcanum as wonderful as any elixir of life that alchemists dream of and i was always figuring to myself the honour and glory of the discovery and fretting that it was destined to one of my brothers rather than myself  even then i had some notion of excelling them and fretted at our residence at kenminster because i was cut off from classes and lectures  then came the fortune and i saw at the first glance that wealth would hinder all the others even robert from attempting to fulfil the conditions and i imagined myself persevering and winning the day  as to the concealment of the will i can honestly say that to my inexperienced fancy it appeared utterly unlike my fathers and grandmothers and at the moment i hid it i only thought of the disturbance and discomfort which scruples of my mothers would create and the unpleasantness it would make with elvira with whom i had just been quarrelling  when as i grew older and found the validity of wills did not depend on the paper they were written upon i had qualms which i lulled by thinking that when my education was safe and elvira safely married to allen i would look again and then bring it to light if needful  my mothers refusal to commit the secret to me on any terms entirely alienated me i am grieved to say  i have learnt since that she was quite right and that she could not help it  it was only my ignorance that rebelled but i was enraged enough to have produced the will and perhaps should have done so if i had not been afraid both of losing my own medical training and of causing robert to take up that line in which i knew he could succeed better than anyone  janet this must be fancy  no mother  theres no poison like a blessing turned into a curse this is the secret history of what made me such a disagreeable morose girl  then came the opportunity that enabled me to glance at the book of my fathers notes  barbaras eyes made me lock the desk in haste and confusion  it was really and truly accident that i locked the book out instead of in  as you know barbara hid away the davenport and i could not restore the book when i had pored over it half the night and found myself quite incompetent to understand the details though i perceived the main drift  i durst not take the book out of the house and the loss of my keys cut me off from access to it meantime i studied and came to the perception that a woman alone could never carry out the needful experiments i must have a man to help me but i was too much warped by this time to see how my mother was thus justified  i still looked on her as insanely depriving me of my glory the world of the benefit for a mere narrow scruple then i fell in with demetrius hermann  how can i tell the story how he seemed to me the wisest and acutest of human beings the very man to assist in the discovery and how i betrayed to him enough by my questions to make him think me a prize both for my secret and my fortune  he says i deceived him  perhaps i did  any way we are quits  no not quite for i loved him as i should not have thought it in me to love anyone and the very joy and gladness of the sensation made me see with his eyes or else be preposterously blind i think his southern imagination made his expectations of the secret unreasonable and i followed his bidding blindly and implicitly in my two attempts to bring off magnum bonum which i had come to believe my right unjustly withheld from me  the second attempt as you know ended in the general crash  afterwards all the overtures were made by my husband  i would not share in them  i was too proud and would not come as a beggar or see him threaten and cringe as unhappily i knew he could do nor would i be seen by my mother or brothers  i knew they would begin to pity me and i could not brook that  my mothers assurance of exposure if he made any use of the stolen secret made demetrius choose to go to america  he said it all came out before my military brother  did that change lucass destination said janet looking up  ask him  no indeed said jock when he understood  i turned doctor as the readiest way of looking after mother  did you understand nothing  only that she had some memoranda of my fathers that the sc— that hermann wanted  i never thought of them again till she told me  mrs brownlow started at the next few words  my child was born only two days after we landed at new york  but a quick interrogative glance kept her silent  she was very small and delicate and her father was impatient both of her weakness and mine  i think that was when i began to long for my mother  he made me call her glykera after his mother  i had taught him to be bitter against mine  o mother if you could have seen her suddenly exclaimed janet she was the dearest little thing and she drew from her bosom a locket with a baby face on one side and some soft hair on the other put it into her mothers hand and hid her face on her shoulder  oh my poor janet you have suffered indeed  how long did you keep the little darling  two years  you will hear  i was not quite wretched while i had her  go on mother  theres no talking of it  we tried both practising and lecturing feeling our way meantime towards the magnum bonum  we found however in the larger cities that people were quite as careful about qualifications as at home and that we wanted recommendations  i could have got some practice among women if demetrius would have rested long enough anywhere but he liked lecturing best  i had been obliged to perceive that he had very little real science and indeed i had to give him the facts and he put them in his flowery language  while as to magnum bonum he had gained enough to use it in a kind of haphazard way for everything  i trembled at what he began doing with it when in the course of our wanderings we got out of the more established regions into the southwest  in texas we found a new township called burkeville without a resident medical man and the fame of his lectures had gone far enough for him to be accepted  there we set up our staff and demetrius—it makes me sick to say so—tried to establish himself as the possessor of a new and certain cure  i was persuaded that he did not know how to manage it i tried to make him understand that under certain conditions it might be fatal but he thought i was jealous  he had had one or two remarkable successes his fame was spreading he was getting reckless and i could not watch as carefully as i sometimes did for my child was ill and needed all my care  the favourite of all the parish was the ministers daughter a beautiful lively delicate girl loved and followed like a sort of queen by the young men of whom there were many while there were hardly any other young women none to compare with her  demetrius had lost some patients it was a sickly season and i fancy there was some mistrust and exasperation against him already for he was incompetent and grew more averse to consulting me when his knowledge was at fault  i need not blame him  everyone at home knows that i do not always make myself agreeable and i had enough to exacerbate me with my child pining in the unhealthy climate and my fathers precious secret used with the rough ignorance of an empiric  i knew enough of the case of this annie field to be sure that there were features in it which would make that form of treatment dangerous  i tried to make him understand  he thought me jealous of his being called in rather than myself  well— she died and such a storm of vengeance arose as is possible in those lawless parts  i knew and heeded nothing of it for my little glykera was worse every day and i thought of nothing else but it seems that reports unfavourable to us had come from some one of the cities where we had tried to settle and thus grief and rage had almost maddened one of annies lovers a young man of irish blood a leader among the rest  on the day of her funeral all the ruffianism in the place was up in arms against us  my husband had warning i suppose for i never saw or heard of him since he went out that morning leaving me with my little one moaning on my lap  she was growing worse every hour and i knew nothing else till my door was burst open by a little boy of eight or ten years old crying out mrs hermann mrs hermann quick they are coming to lynch you come away bring the baby  if father cant stop them theres no place safe but our house  and indeed upon the air came the sound of a great horrible yelling roar unspeakably dreadful  it seems never to have been out of my ears since  i do not know whether an american mob would have proceeded to extremities with a lonely woman and dying child but there was an irish and spanish element of ferocity at burkeville and the cold hard englishwoman was unpopular besides that i was supposed to share in the irregular practice that had had such fatal effects  but with that horrible sound one did not stop to weigh probabilities  i gathered up my child in her bedclothes and followed the boy out at the back door blindly  and where do you think i found myself where but in the ministers house  his wife whose daughter had just been carried out to her grave rose up from weeping and praying to take me into the innermost chamber where none could see me and when she saw my darlings state to give me all the help and sympathy a good woman could  oh that was my first true knowledge of christian charity  mr field himself was striving at the very grave itself to turn away the rage of these men against those whom they held his daughters murderers but he was as nothing against some fifty or sixty gathered i suppose some by real or fancied wrongs some from mere love of violence  any way when he found himself powerless against the infuriated speeches of the young irish lover he put his little boy over the graveyard wall and sent him off to take me to the last place where the mob would look for me the very room where annie died  those howls and yells round the empty house perhaps too the shaking of my rapid run hastened the end with my precious child  i do not believe she could have lived many hours but the fright brought on shudderings and convulsions and she was gone from me by nine that evening  they might have torn me to pieces then and i would have thanked them  i cannot tell you the goodness of the fields  it could not comfort me then but i have wondered over it often since  there were blistered blotted tear marks here they knew it was not safe for me to remain for there had been wild talk of a warrant out against us for manslaughter  they would have had me leave my little darlings form to their care but they saw i dreaded unreasonably i now think some insult from those ruffians for her fathers sake  mr field said i should lay my little one to her rest myself  they found a long basket like a cradle  we laid her there in her own nightdress looking so sweet and lovely  mr field himself went out and dug the little grave close to annies and there by moonlight we laid her and the good man put one of the many wreaths from annies grave upon hers and there we knelt and he prayed  i dont know what denomination his may be but a christian i know he is  cruel as the very sight of me must have been they kept me in bed all the next day and the minister went to see what he could save for me  finding no one the mob had wreaked their vengeance on our medicine bottles and glasses smashed everything and made terrible havoc of all our books clothes and furniture almost the only thing mr field had found unhurt was mothers little greek testament which i had carried about but utterly neglected till then  mr field saw my name in it brought it to me and kindly said he was glad to restore it none could be utterly desolate whose study lay there  i was obliged to tell him how you had sent it after me with that entreaty which i had utterly neglected and you can guess how he urged it on me  you have gone on now said her mother looking up at her  janets reply was to produce the little book from her handbag showing marks of service and then to open it at the fly leaf  there caroline herself had written janet hermann with the reference to st luke xv 20  she had not dared to write more fully but the good minister of burkeville had at janets desire put his own initials and likewise written in full  refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy  and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border  he might have written it for me said caroline  my child—one at least is come to me  or you have gone into her far country to seek her said janet  can i write to this good man asked caroline  i do long to thank him  o yes  i wrote to him only the day before yesterday  there was but little more of the narrative  at night he borrowed a waggon and drove me to a station in time to take the early train for the northeast supplying me with means for the journey and giving me a letter to a family relation of his in new york state  i was most kindly sheltered there for a few days while i looked out for advertisements  i found however that i must change my name for the history of the burkeville affair was copied into all the papers and there were warnings against the two impostors giving my maiden name likewise as that in which my zurich diploma had been made out this cut me off from all medical employment and i had to think what else i could do not that i cared much what became of me  seeing a notice that an assistant was wanted to colour and finish photographs i thought my drawing though only schoolroom work might serve  i applied showed specimens and was thought satisfactory  i sent my address to mr field who had promised to let me know in case my husband made any attempt to trace me or if i could find my way back to him but up to this time i have heard absolutely nothing  the few white days in my life are however when i get a cheering comforting letter from him  how i should once have laughed their phraseology to scorn but then i did not know what reality meant and they are the only balm of my life now except mothers little book and what they have led me to  but you see why i cannot come with elvira  not only do i not dare to meet my mother but it might bring down upon her one whom she could not welcome  besides it is clearly fit that i should strive to meet him again i would try to be less provoking to him now  i see my dear said caroline  but why did you never draw on mr wakefield all this time  i never thought we ought to take that money said janet  i could maintain myself and that was all i wanted  besides i was ashamed to bid him use a false name and i durst not receive a letter under my own nor did i know whether demetrius might go on applying  he did once saying that you were unwell but mr wakefield declined to let him be supplied with out your signature  janet eagerly asked the when and the where  i am glad said her mother to find that you change of name was not in order to elude him as feared at first  no said janet he never knew he was cruel but he had made a mistake altogether in me  i was a disappointment to begin with owing to my own bad management you see for if i had brought off the book and destroyed the will his speculation would have succeeded and then for his comfort he should have married a passive ignorant senseless obedient oriental and he did not know what to do with a cold proud thing who looked most hard when most wretched who had understanding enough to see his blunders and remains of conscience enough to make her sour  poor demetrius  he had the worst of the bargain  and now— she turned the leaf of the manuscript and showed with a date three days back  mr field has written to me sending a cutting of an advertisement of a month back of a spiritualist from abville which he thinks may be my husbands  i am sure it is i know the greek idiom put into english  it decides me on what i had thought of before  i shall offer my services as nurse or physician or whatever they will let me be in that stress of need  i may find him or if he have fled i may if i live trace him  at any rate by gods grace i may thus endeavour to make a better use of what has never yet been used for his service  and in case i should add no further words to this let me conclude by telling my dear dear mother that my whole soul and spirit are asking her forgiveness and by sending my love to my brothers and sister whom i love far better now than ever i did when i was with them  and to elvira too—perhaps she is my sister by this time  let them try henceforth to think not unkindly of                                     janet hermann   this had been enclosed in an envelope addressed to mrs joseph brownlow to the care of wakefield and co solicitors  you see i cannot go back with you mother dear she said though you have come to seek me  not yet said caroline handing the last page to jock who had come back again from one of his excursions  look here janet said jock mother will not forbid it i know if you will wait another day for me to arrange for her i will go with you  this is a place specially mentioned as in frightful need of medical attendance and i already doubted whether i ought not to volunteer but if you have an absolute call of duty there that settles it  mother do you remember that american clergyman who dined with us  i met him just now  he begged me with all his heart to persuade you to come and stay with his family  i believe he is going to bring his wife to call  i am sure they would take care of you  i dont want care  jock jock why should i not go and help  do you think i can send my children into the furnace without me  jock came and sat down by her with his specially consoling caress mother dear i dont think you ought  we are trained to it you see and it is part of our vocation besides janet has a call  but your nursing would not make much difference and besides you dont belong only to us—armine and babie need their home  and suppose poor bobus came back  no i am accountable to them all  they didnt send me out in charge of my mother carey that i should run her into the jaws of yellow jack  i cant do it mother  i should mind my own business far less if i were thinking about you  it would be just like your coming after me into a general engagement  lucas is quite right said janet  you know mother this is a special kind of nursing that one does not understand by the light of nature and you are not strong enough or tough enough for it  i flattered myself i was pretty tough said her mother with trembling lip  what sort of a place is it  could not i—even if you wont let me nurse—be near enough to rest you and feed you and disinfect you  that is my trade jock will allow as a doctors wife and mother  and i could collect things and send them to the sick would not that be possible my dears  jock said he would find out and then he told them he had found a church with a daily service to which they went  and then those three had a wonderfully happy evening together     chapter xli  good out of evil                      how the field of combat lay by the tombs self how he sprang from ambuscade— captured death caught him in that pair of hands                                              browning   john said sydney as they were taking their last walk together as engaged people on the banks of their avon theres something i think i ought to tell you  well my dearest  dont they say that there ought not to be any shadow of concealment of the least little liking for any one else when one is going to be married quoth sydney not over lucidly  im sure i can safely acquit myself of any such shadow said john laughing  i never had the least little liking for anybody but mother carey and that wasnt a least little one at all  well john im very much ashamed of it because he didnt care for me as it turned out but if he had as i once thought i should have liked him said sydney looking down and speaking with great confusion out of the depths of her conscience stirred up by much advice to brides and sunday novels all turning on the ladys error in hiding her first love and then perhaps because the effect on john was less startling than she had expected she added with another effort it was lucas brownlow  jock cried john  the dear fellow  yes—i did think it when he was in the guards and always about with cecil  it was very silly of me for he did not care one fraction  why do you think so said john hoarsely  well i know better now but when he made up his mind to leave the army i fancied it was no better than being a recreant knight and i begged and prayed him to go out with sir philip cameron and as near as i dared told him it was for my sake  but he went on all the same and then i was quite sure he did not care and saw what a goose i had made of myself  oh johnny it has been very hard to tell you but i thought i ought and i hope youll never think of it more for lucas just despised my foolish forwardness and you know you have every bit of my heart and soul  what is the matter john  oh have i done harm when i meant to do right  no no my darling dont be startled  but do you mean that you really thought jocks disregard of your entreaties came from indifference  it was all one mixture of pain and anger said sydney  i cant define it  i thought it was ones duty to lead a man to be courageous and defend his country and of course he thought me such a fool  why he has never really talked to me since  and you thought it was indifference again repeated john with an iteration worthy of his father  o john you frighten me  wasnt it  did you know this before  no most certainly not  i did know thus much that in giving up the army jock had given up his dearest hopes but i thought it was some fine fashionable lady whom he was well rid of though he didnt know it  and he never said a word to betray it even when i came home brimful and overflowing with happiness  and you know it was his doing that my way has been smoothed  oh sydney i dont know how to look at it  but indeed john dear i couldnt help loving you best  you saved me you know and i feel to fit in and understand you best  i cant be sorry as it has turned out  thats very well said john trying to laugh for you couldnt be transferred back to him like a bale of goods  and i could not have helped loving you but that i should have been a robber jocks worst enemy  i cant be sorry you did not guess it said sydney  then i never should have had you and somehow—  and you thought him wanting in courage recurred john  only when i was wild and silly talking out of the travellers joy  it was hearing about his going into that dreadful place that stirred it all up in my mind because i saw what a hero he is  god grant he may come safe out of it said john  ill tell you what sydney though it is a shame when i am the gainer i think your romance went astray more faith and patience would have waited to see the real hero come out and so you have missed him and got the ordinary jogtrot commonplace fellow instead  ah but love must be at the bottom of faith and patience said sydney and that was scared away by shame at my own forwardness and foolishness  and now it is all gone to the jogtrot  i want no better hero  what a confession for the maiden of the twelfth century  im very glad you dont feel moved to start off to the yellow fever  do you know sydney i do not know what i dont feel moved to sometimes i cannot understand this silence  but you said the telegram that he was mending was almost better than if he had never been ill at all  so i thought then but why do we not hear if all is well with them  three weeks since a telegram had been received by allen containing the words janet died at 230 am  lucas mending  it had been resolved not to put off the wedding as much inconvenience would have been caused and poor janet was only cousin to john and had been removed from all family interests so long even mrs robert brownlow saw no impropriety since barbara went to belforest for a fortnight returning to mrs evelyn on the afternoon of the weddingday itself to assist in her move to the dower house esther who had never professed to wish for a hero had been so much disturbed by the recent alarms of war that she was only anxious that her guardsman should safely sell out in the interval of peace and he had begun to care enough about the occupations at fordham to wish to be free to make it his chief dwellingplace  the wedding was as quiet as possible  sydney was disappointed of the only bridesmaid she cared much about and barbara felt a kind of relief in not having a second time to assist at the destruction of a brothers hopes  she was very glad to get back to fordham reporting that allen and elvira were so devotedly in love that a third person was very much de trop though they had been very kind and elvira had mourned poor janet with real gratitude and affection  still they did not take half so much alarm at the silence as she did and she was relieved to be with the evelyns who were becoming very anxious  the bridegroom and bride could not bear to go out of reach of intell igence and had limited their tour to the nearest place on the coast where they could hear by half a days post  no news had come except that seven american papers had been forwarded to barbara giving brief accounts of the pestilence in the southern cities  the numbers of deaths in abville were sensibly decreased one of these papers said  the arrival of an english physician dr lucas brownlow and his sister had been noticed and also that the sister had succumbed to the disease but that he was recovering these were all however only up to the date of the telegram and the sole shadow of encouragement was in the assurances that any really fatal news would have been telegraphed  mrs evelyn and barbara were very loving companions during this time  together they looked over those personal properties of dukes which rather belonged to his mother than his heir  mrs evelyn gave barbara several which had special associations for her and together they read over his papers and letters laughing tenderly over those that awoke droll remembrances and perfectly entering into one anothers sympathies  yet my dear said mrs evelyn i do not know whether i ought to let you dwell on this you are too young to be looking back on a grave when all life is before you  nay said babie it was he that showed me how to look right on through life  you cannot tell how delightful it is to me to be brought near to him again now i can understand him so much better than ever i did when he was here  yet it was always his fear that he might sadden your life  sadden oh no  it was he who put life into my hands as something worth using said babie  dont you know it is the great glory and quiet secret treasure of my heart that as jock said that first night i have that love not for time but eternity  and their thoughts could not but go back to the travellers in america and all the possibilities for were not whole families swept off by the disease without power of communication  however at last four days after the wedding barbara received a letter                                 ashton vineyard virginia                                             september 30th  my dearest babie—i have left you too long without tidings but i have had little time and no heart to write and i could not bear to send such news without details  of the ten terrible days at abville i may if i can tell you when we meet  i was in a sort of country house a little above the valley of the shadow of death preparing supplies and keeping beds ready for any of the exhausted workers who could snatch a rest in the air of the hill  i scarcely saw my poor janet  she had made out that her husband had been one of the first victims before she even guessed at his being there  she only came once to tell me this and they would not even allow me to come down to the church where all the clergy doctors and sisters who could used to meet every morning and evening  on the tenth day she brought home jock smitten down after incessant exertion  everyone allows that he saved more cases than anyone though he says it was the abatement of the disease  janet declares that his was a slight attack  if that was slight  she attended to him for two days then told me the crisis was past and that he would live and almost at the same time her strength failed her  the last thing she said consciously to me was dont waste time on me  i know these symptoms  attend to jock  that is of use  only forgive and pray for me  very soon she was insensible and was gone before twentyfour hours were over  the sister whom they spared to help me said she was too much worn out to struggle and suffer like most indeed as jock had done  that sister dorothea a true divine gift a sweet and fair vision of peace is a miss ashton a virginian  she broke down not with the disease only fatigue and i gave her such care as i could spare from my dear boy  when her father general ashton came to take her home he kindly insisted on likewise carrying us off to his beautiful home on a lovely hillside where we trusted jocks strength would be restored quickly  but perhaps we were too impatient for the journey was far too much for him  he fainted several times and the last miles were passed in an unconscious state  there has come back on him the intermittent fever which often succeeds the disease and what is more alarming is the faintness oppression and difficulty of breathing which he believes to be connected with the slight affection of heart remaining from his rheumatic fever at schwarenbach  then it is very difficult to give him nourishment except disguised with ice and he is altogether fearfully ill  i send such an account of the case as i can get for john or dr medlicott to see  how i long for our kind home friends  this place is unhappily very far from everywhere a lone village in the hills the nearest doctor twelve miles off  the ashtons think highly of him but he is old and i cant say that i have any confidence in his treatment  jock allows that he should do otherwise but he says he has no vigour or connection of ideas to be fit to treat himself consistently and that he should only do harm by interfering with dr vanbro indeed i fear he thinks that it does not make much difference  if patience and calmness can bring him through he would live but my dear babie i greatly dread that i shall not bring him back to the home he made so bright  he seldom rouses into talking much but lies passive and half dozing when the feverish restlessness is not on him  he told me just now to send his love to you all especially to the monk and sydney with all dear good wishes to them both  no one can be kinder than the ashtons they are always trying to help in the nursing and sending for everything that can be thought of for jock  sister dorothea and primrose are as good and loving as sydney herself could be and there is an excellent clergyman who comes in every day and prays for my boy in church ask them to do the same at fordham and at our own churches  as long as i do not telegraph remember that while there is life there is hope                                       your loving mother c   this letter was sent on to john  two days later a fly drove up to the dower house and sydney walked into the drawingroom alone  where did she come from  from liverpool  john was gone to america  i wanted to go too she said tears coming into her eyes but he said he could go faster without me and he could not take me to these ashtons or leave me alone in new york  it was very noble and good in you to let him go sydney cried babie  it would have broken his heart for ever said sydney if he had not tried to do his utmost for jock  he says jock has been more than a brother to him and that he owes all that he is and all that he has to him and mother carey and that even—if—if he were too late he should save her from coming home alone  you think he was right mamma  right indeed and i am thankful that my sydney was unselfish and did not try to keep him back  o mamma i could never have looked him in the face again if i had hindered him  and so we went up to london and luckily dr medlicott was at home and he was very eager that john should go  he says he does not think it will be too late and they talked it over and got some medicines and then john let me come down to liverpool with him and see him on board and we telegraphed the last thing to mrs brownlow so that it might be too late for her to stop him  while that message was rushing on its way beneath the atlantic it was the early morning of the ebb tide of the fever and the patient was resting almost doubled over with his head on pillows before him either slumber or exhaustion so still that his mother had yielded to urgent persuasion and lain down in the next room to sleep in the dreamless repose of the overworn watcher  for over him leant a sturdy darkbrowed darkbearded figure to whom she had ventured to entrust him  some fourteen hours before robert had with some difficulty found them out at ashton vineyard having been irresistibly drawn by jocks telegram to spend in the states an interval of leisure in his work caused by his appointment as principal to another japanese college  he had gone to the bank where jock had given an address and his consternation had been great on hearing the state of things  all this however he had left unexplained and his mother had hardly even thought of asking where he had dropped from  for jock was in the midst of one of his cruellest attacks of the fever and all she had been conscious of was a knock and summons to the door where primrose ashton gently whispered here is some one you will be glad to see and roberts low deep voice almost inaudible with emotion asked may i see him  he will not know you she said with the sad composure of one who has no time to grieve  but even in the midst of the babbling moan of fevered weakness there was half a smile as of pleased surprise and an evident craving for the strong support of his brothers arm and byandby jock looked up with meaning and recognition in his eyes though quite unable to speak in that faint and exhausted state indeed that verged nearer to death after every attack  this had passed enough for her to know there would be a respite for perhaps a good many hours and she had yielded to the entreaty or command of bobus that she would lie down and sleep trusting to him to call her at any moment  presently as morning light stole in jocks eyes were open gazing at him fondly and he whispered dear old bob then presently open the window  the sun was rising and the wooded hillside opposite was all one gorgeous mass of autumn colouring of every shade from purple to golden yellow so glorious that it arrested bobuss attention even at that instant  beautiful isnt it asked the feeble voice  wonderful as we always heard  lift me a little  i like to see it  not fast—or high—so  bobus raised the white wasted form and rested the head against his square firm shoulder  dear old bob  this is jolly  im not cramping you  o no but should not you have something  what time is it  630  too soon yet for that misery then after some silence im so glad you are come  can you take mother home  i would but you will  i dont think so  now jock you are not getting into armines state of mind giving yourself up and wishing to die  not at all  there are hosts of things i want to do first  theres that discovery of fathers  with what poor janet told me of hermanns doings and what i saw at abville if i could only get an hour of my proper wits i could put the others up to a wrinkle that would make the whole thing comparatively plain  should not you be better if you dictated it and got it off your mind  so i thought and tried but presently i saw mother looking queer and she said i was tired and had gone on enough  i made her read it to me afterwards and i had gone off into a muddle and said something that would have been sheer murder  so i had better leave it alone  old vanbro mistrusts every word i say because of the hermann connection and indeed i may not always have talked sense to him  those things work out in gods own time and the monk is on the track  id like to have seen him but ive got you  this had been said in faint slow utterances so low that bobus could hardly have heard a couple of feet further off and with intervals between and there was a gesture of tender perfect content in the contact with him that went to his heart and before he was aware a great hot tear came dropping down on jocks forehead and caused an exclamation  i beg your pardon said bobus  oh jock you dont know what it is to find you like this  i came with so much to ask and talk of to you  jock looked up inquiringly  you were right to suppress that paper of mine continued bobus i wouldnt have written it now  i have seen better what a people are without christianity be the code what it may and the civilisation it cant produce such women as my mother no nor such men as you jockey my boy he muttered much lower  are you coming back dear old man said jock with eyes fixed on him  i dont know  tell me one thing old man i always thought when you took to using your brains and getting up physical science that you must get beyond what satisfied you as a soldier  now have the two science and religion never clashed or have you kept them apart  theyve worked in together said jock  you dont say so because you ought and think it good for me  as if i could lying here  all thy works praise thee o god and thy saints do magnify thee  bobus was not sure whether this were a conscious reply or only wandering and his mother here came in wakened by the murmur of voices  the brothers could not bear to lose sight of one another though jock was too much exhausted by this conversation and by the sickness that followed any endeavour to take food to speak much again  thus when the rector came bobus asked whether he must be sent out of the room jock made an earnest sign to the contrary and he stayed  there was of course nothing to concern him especially in the brief reading and prayer but his mother looking up saw that he was finding out the passage in the little greek testament  janets lay on a little table close by the bedside  the two copies had met again  the work of one was done  was the work of the other doing at last  however that might be nothing could be gentler tenderer or more considerate towards his mother than was bobus and her kind friends felt much relieved of their fears for her since she had such a son to take care of her  towards the evening the negro servant knocked at the door and bobus took from him a telegram envelope  his mother opened it and read  friar brownlow to mrs brownlow  i embark today  a smile shone out on jocks white weary face and he said good old monk  if i can but hold out till he comes i shall get home again yet  i should like to do him credit                                    ashton vineyard october l2th  my dearest child—you know the main fact by telegram and now i can write i must tell you all in more order  we thought our darkest hour was over when the dear johns telegram came and the hope helped us up a little while  to jock himself it was like a drowning man clinging to a rope with the more exertion because he knew that a boat was putting off  at least so it was at first but as his strength faded his brain could not grasp the notion any longer and he generally seemed to be fancying himself on the snow with armine still however looking for john to come and save them and sometimes too talking about cecil and being a true brother in arms a faithful servant and soldier  the long severe strain of study work and all the rest which he has gone through body and mind coming on a heart already not quite sound throughout the past year was john thinks the real reason of his being unable to rally when the fever had brought him down after the dreadful exertion at abville  dear fellow he never let us guess how much his patience cost him  i think we had looked to johns arrival as if it would act like magic and it was very sore disappointment when his treatment was producing no change for the better but the prostration went on day after day poor bobus was in utter despair and went raging about declaring that he had been a fool ever to expect anything from kencroft and at last he had to be turned out of the sickroom  for i should tell you that the one thing that kept me up was the entire calm grave composure that john preserved throughout and which gave him the entire command  he never showed any consternation or dismay nor uttered an augury but he went quietly and vigilantly on in a manner that all along gave me a strange sense of confidence and trust that all that could be done was being done and the issue was in higher hands  he would not let anyone really help him but sister dorothea with her trained skill as a nurse  i dont think even i should have been suffered in the room if he had not thought jock might be more conscious than was apparent for he had not himself received one token of recognition all those three days  poor bobus the little gleam of light that jock had let in on him seemed all gone  i do not know what would have become of him but for the good ashtons  he had been persuaded for a time that what was so real to jock must be true but when jock was no longer conscious he had nothing to help him and i am afraid he spoke terrible words when primrose talked of prayer and faith  i believe he declared that to see one like his brother snatched away when just come to the perfection of his early manhood with all his capacity and all his knowledge in vain convinced him either that this universe was one grim pitiless machine grinding down humanity by mere law of necessity or if they would have it that there was supernatural power it could only be malevolent and then primrose so strong in faith as to venture what i should have shrunk from as dangerous presumption dared him to go on in his disbelief if his brother were given back to prayer  she pitied him so much the sweet bright girl she had so pitied him all along that i believe she prayed as much for him as for jock  of course i did not know all this till afterwards for all was stillness in that room except when at times the clergyman came in and prayed  the next thing i am sure of was johns leaning over me and his low steady voice saying the pulse is better the symptoms are mitigating  sister dorothea says they had both seen it for some hours but he made her a sign not to agitate me till he was secure that the improvement was real  indeed there was something in that equable firm gentleness of johns that sustained me and prevented my breaking down  even then it was another whole day before my darling smiled at me again and said thanks to john but oh with such a look  when bobus heard his brother was better he gave a sob such as i shall never forget and rushed away into the pinewood on the hillside all alone  the next time i saw him he was walking in the garden with primrose and with such a quieted subdued gentle look upon his face it put me in mind of the fields when a great storm has swept over them and they are lying still in the sunshine afterwards  since that day when john said we might send off that thankworthy telegram there has been daily progress  i have had one of my headaches  that monarch john found it out and turned me out  i could bear to go for i knew my boy was safe with him  he made me over to primrose who nursed me as tenderly as my babie could have done and indeed i begin to think she will soon be as near and dear to me as my sydney or elvira  she has a power over bobus that no one else ever had and she is very lovely in expression as well as features but how will so ardent a christian as she is receive one still so far off as my poor robert though indeed i think he has at least come so far as the cry help thou mine unbelief  so now they have let me come back to my jock and i see visibly his improvement  he holds out his hand and he smiles and he speaks now and then the dreadful oppression is gone and all the dangerous symptoms are abating and i cannot tell how happy and thankful we are  send my love and tell sydney she has a blessed monk he says as he wakes and sees me writing  that dear monk says he will not go home till he can carry home his patient  when that will be i cannot tell for he cannot sit up in bed yet  dear sydney how i thank her  john says it was not his treatment but under divine providence youthful nature that had had her rest and begun to rally her strength  but under that blessing it was johns steady faithful strength and care that enabled the restoration to take place                                    my dear childs loving                                                 mother carey      chapter xlii  disenchanted    whatever page we turn however much we learn let there be something left to dream of still                                         longfellow   it was on a very cold day of the cold spring of 1879 that three ladies descended at the liverpool station escorted by a military looking gentleman  he left them standing while he made inquiries but his servant had anticipated him  the steamer has been signalled my lord  it will be in about four oclock  there will be time to go to the hotel and secure rooms said one lady  oh reeves can do that  pray let us come down to the docks and see them come in  no answer till all four were seated in a fly rattling through the street but on the repetition of are we going to the docks his lordship with a resolute twirl of his long light moustache replied no sydney  if you think i am going to have you making a scene on deck falling on your husbands breast and all that sort of thing you are much mistaken  i shall lodge you all quietly in the hotel and you may wait there while i go down with reeves and receive them like a rational being  really cecil thats too bad  he let me come on board  do you think i should have brought you here if i had thought you meant to make yourself ridiculous  it is of no use sydney said babie theres no dealing with the stern and staid pere de famille  i wonder what he would have liked essie to do if he had had to go and leave her for nearly two months when he had only been married a week  essie is quite a different thing—i mean she has sense and self possession  mamma wont you speak for us implored sydney  i did behave so well when he went  nobody would have guessed we hadnt been married fifty years  still i think cecil is quite right and that it may be better for them all to manage the landing quietly  without a pack of women said cecil  here we are  i hope you will find a tolerable room for him and no stairs  as if poor mrs evelyn were not well enough used to choosing rooms for invalids  twilight had come the gas had been turned on and the three anxious ladies stood in the window gazing vainly at endless vehicles when the door opened and they beheld sundry figures entering  sydney and barbara flew the one to her husband the other to her mother and presently all stood round the fire looking at one another  mrs evelyn made a gesture to a very slender and somewhat pale figure to sit down in a large easy chair  thank you im not tired he briskly said standing with a caressing hand on his friends shoulder  heres cecil cant quite believe yet that i have the use of my limbs  yes said john no sooner did he come on board than he made a rush at the poor sailor who had broken his leg and was going to be carried ashore on a hammock  he was on the point of embracing him red beard and all when he was forcibly dragged off by jock himself whom he nearly knocked down  well said cecil as sydney fairly danced round him in revengeful glee there was the monk solicitously lifting him on one side and mother carey assisting with a smellingbottle on the other so what could i suppose  all for want of us said sydney  and think of the cunning of him added babie shutting us up here that he might give way to his feelings undisturbed  i promised to go and speak about that poor fellow at the hospital cried john with sudden recollection  you had better let me said jock  you will stay where you are  i consider him my patient  if thats the way you two fought over your solitary case all the way home said babie i wonder theres a fragment left of him  it was only three days ago said john and jock has been a new man ever since he picked the poor fellow up on deck but im not going to let him stir tonight  let me come with you johnny entreated sydney it will be so nice  oh no i dont mind the cold  here added her brother take the poor fellow a sovereign  in compensation for the sudden cooling of your affection said jock  well if it is an excuse for an excursion with sydney ill not interfere but ask him for his sisters address in london for i promised to tell her about him  oh cried babie at the word london then you have heard from dr medlicott  i did once said john with some very useful suggestions but that was a month ago or more  i meant said babie a letter he wrote for the chance of jocks getting it before he sailed  theres the assistant lectureship vacant and the professor would not like anyone so much  it is his own appointment not an election matter and he meant to keep it open till he could get an answer from jock  when was this asked jock flushing with eagerness  the 20th  dr medlicott came down to fordham for sunday to ask if it was worth while to telegraph or if i thought you would be well enough  it is not much of a salary but it is a step and dr medlicott knows they would put you on the staff of the hospital and then you are open to anything  jock drew a long breath and looked at his mother  the very thing ive wished he said  exactly  must he answer at once  the professor would like a telegram yes or no at once  then you wedded monk will you add to your favours by telegraphing for me  yes  of course it is yes  how soon should you have to begin i wonder  oh im quite cheeky enough for that sort of work if youll telegraph ill write by tonights post  ill go and do the telegraphing said cecil i dont trust those two  as if john ever made mistakes cried sydney  in fact i want to send a telegram home  to frighten essie  she will get a yellow envelope saying you accept a lectureship and the professor urgent inquiries after his baby  sydney is getting too obstreperous monk said cecil  you had better carry her off  i shall come back by the time you have written your letters jock  those two are too happy to do anything but tease one another said mrs evelyn as the door shut on the three  my rival grandmother as babie calls her was really quite glad to get rid of cecil she declared he would excite esther into a fever  he did alarm her serenity herself said babie laughing  when she would go on about grand sponsors and ancestral names he told her that he should carry the baby off to church and have him christened jock out of hand and what a dreadful thing that would be for the peerage  i believe she thought he meant it  the name is to be john said mrs evelyn—john marmaduke  he has secured his godmother—laying a hand affectionately on babie—but i must not forestall his request to his two earliest and best friends  dear old fellow murmured jock  everybody is somewhat frantic said barbara  jocks varieties of classes were almost distracted and besieged the door till susan was fain to stick the last bulletins in the window to save answering the bell then no sooner did they hear he was better than they began getting up a testimonial  percy stagg wrote to me to ask for his crest for some piece of plate and i wrote back that i was sure dr lucas brownlow would like it best to go in something for the mission church and if they wanted to give him something for his very own suppose they got him a brass plate for the door  bravo infanta that was an inspiration  so they are to give an almsdish and ali and elfie give the rest of the plate  dr medlicott says he never saw anything like the feeling at the hospital or does not know what the nurses dont mean to get up by way of welcome  my dear babie you must let jock write his letters interposed her mother who had tears in her eyes and saw him struggling with emotion  in spite of your magnificent demonstrations jock you must repair your charms by lying down  she followed him into his room which opened from the sittingroom and he turned to her speaking from a full heart  oh mother  it seems all given to me the old home the very post i wished for and all this kindness just when i thought i had taken leave of it all  he sobbed once or twice for very joy  you are sure it suits you  if i only can suit it equally well  oh i see what you mean  that is over now  i suppose the fever burnt it out of me for it does not hurt me now to see the dear old monk beaming on her  i am glad she came for i can feel sure of myself now  so theres nothing at present to come between me and my mother carey  thanks mother ill just fire off my two notes and establish myself luxuriously before cecil comes back  i say this is the best inns best room  poor mrs evelyn must have thought herself providing for fordham  oh yes i shall gladly lie down when these notes are done but this is not a chance to be neglected  now deo gratias it will be my own fault if magnum bonum is not worked out to the utmost yes much better than if we had never gone to america  even bobus owns that all things have worked together for good  his mother with another look at the face so joyous though still so wasted and white went back to the other room with an equally happy though scarcely less worn countenance  i hope he is resting said mrs evelyn  are you quite satisfied about him  fully  he may not be strong for a year or two and must be careful not to overtask himself but john made him see one of the greatest physicians in new york to whom dr medlicott had sent letters of introduction—as if they were needed he said after jocks work at abville  he said as john did there was no lasting damage to the heart and that the attack was the consequence of having been brought so low but he will be as strong and healthy as ever if he will only be careful as to exertion for a year or so  this appointment is the very thing to save him  i know his friends will look after him and keep him from doing too much  dr — was quite grieved that he had no notion how ill jock had been or he would have come to ashton any of the faculty would he said for one of the true chivalry of 1878  and he was so excited about the magnum bonum  do you think you and he can bear to crown our great thanksgiving feast  my dear my heart is all one thanksgiving  cecils rejoicing is quite as much for jocks sake as over his boy he told me how they had been pledged as brothers in arms and traces all that is best in himself to those days at engelberg  yes that night on the mountain was the great startingpoint thanks to dear little armine  i am writing to him and to allen said barbara from a corner  my love a thousand times and we will meet at home  then our joy will not feel incongruous to you said mrs evelyn  no i am too thankful for what i know of my poor janet  she is mine now as she never was since she was a baby in my arms  i scarcely grieve for happiness was over for her and hers was a noble death they have placed her name in the memorial tablet in abville church to those who laid down their lives for their brethren there  i begged it might be janet hermann daughter of joseph brownlow—for i thank god she died worthy of her father  in all ways i can say of this journey my children were dead and are alive again were lost and are found  ah i was sure it must be so if such a girl as miss ashton could accept robert  i am happier about him than i ever thought to be  i do not say that his faith is like johns or armines but he is striving back through the mists and wishing to believe rather than being proud of disbelieving and primrose knows what she is doing and is aiding him with all her power  as our esther never could have done said mrs evelyn except by her gentle innocence  no  she could only have been to him a pretty white idol of his own setting up said babie  now added her mother primrose is fairly on equal grounds as to force and intellect  she has been all over europe read and thought much and can discuss deep matters while the depth of her religious principle impresses him  they fought themselves into love and then she was sorry for him and so touched by his wretchedness and longing to take hold of the comfort his reason could not accept  i wish you could have seen her  this photograph shows you her fine head but not the beautiful clear complexion and the sweetness of those dark grey eyes  i liked her letter said babie and i am glad she was such a daughter to you mother  allen says he is thankful she is not a japanese with black teeth  he wrote very nicely to her and so did elfie said her mother and armine wrote a charming little note which pleased primrose best of all  poor armine has felt all most deeply said babie  do you remember when he thought it his mission to die and do good to bobus  well he was sure that though as he said his own life then was too shallow and unreal for his death to have done any good jock was meant to produce the effect  and he has—  yes but by life not death  armie could hardly believe it  you know he was with us at christmas and when he found that bobus was to be led not by sorrow but by this primrose path it was quite funny to see how surprised he was  yes said mrs evelyn he went about moralising on the various remedies that are applied to the needs of human nature  it made into a poem at last such a pretty one said babie  and he says he will be wiser all his life for finding things turn out so unlike all his expectations  i have a strange feeling of peace about all my children said caroline  i do feel as if my dream had come true and life true life had wakened them all  yes said mrs evelyn i think they all in their degree may be said to have learnt or be learning the way to true magnum bonum  and oh how precious it has been to me said the mother  how the guarding of that secret aided me through the worst of times    the end
