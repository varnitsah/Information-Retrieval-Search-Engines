and cartwright occupied a chair on the lawn in front of the canadian summer hotel automatic sprinklers threw sparkling showers across the rough parched grass the lake shimmered smooth as oil in the sunset and a sweet resinous smell drifted from the pines that rolled down to the waters edge the straight trunks stood out against a background of luminous red and green and here and there a slanting beam touched a branch with fire  natural beauty had not much charm for cartwright who was satisfied to loaf and enjoy the cool of the evening he had as usual dined well his cigar was good and he meant to give mrs cartwright half an hour clara expected this and although he was sometimes bored he indulged her when he could besides it was too soon for cards the lights had not begun to spring up in the wooden hotel and for the most part the guests were boating on the lake when he had finished his cigar it would be time to join the party in the smokingroom cartwright was something of a gambler and liked the american games they gave one scope for bluffing and although his antagonists declared his luck was good he knew his nerve was better in fact since he lost his money by a reckless plunge he had to some extent lived by bluff yet some people trusted tom cartwright  mrs cartwright did so she was a large dull woman but had kept a touch of the beauty that had marked her when she was young she was kind conventional and generally anxious to take the proper line cartwright was twelve years older and since she was a widow and had three children when she married him her friends declared her money accounted for much and a lawyer relation carefully guarded against cartwrights using her fortune  yet in a sense cartwright was not an adventurer although his ventures in finance and shipping were numerous he sprang from an old liverpool family whose prosperity diminished when steamers replaced sailing ships his father had waited long before he resigned himself to the change but was not altogether too late and cartwright was now managing owner of the independent freighters line the companys business had brought him to montreal and when it was transacted he had taken mrs cartwright and her family to the hotel by the ontario lake  cartwrights hair and mustache were white his face was fleshy and red he was fastidious about his clothes and his tailor cleverly hid the bulkiness of his figure as a rule his look was fierce and commanding but now and then his small keen eyes twinkled although cartwright was clever he was in some respects primitive he had long indulged his appetites and wore the stamp of what is sometimes called good living  the managing owner of the independent freighters needed cleverness since the company was small and often embarrassed for money for the most part it ran its ships in opposition to the regular liners when the conference forced up freights cartwright quietly canvassed the merchants and offered to carry their goods at something under the standard rate if the shippers would engage to fill up his boat as a rule secrecy was important but sometimes when cargo was scarce cartwright let his plans be known and allowed the conference to buy him off although his skill in the delicate negotiations was marked the company paid small dividends and he had enemies among the shareholders now however he was satisfied oreana had sailed for montreal loaded to the limit the law allowed and he had booked her return cargo before the conference knew he was cutting rates  mrs cartwright talked but she talked much and cartwright hardly listened and looked across the lake a canoe drifted out from behind a neighboring point and its varnished side shone in the fading light then a man dipped the paddle and the ripple at the bow got longer and broke the reflections of the pines a girl sitting at the stern put her hands in the water and when she flung the sparkling drops at her companion her laugh came across the lake cartwrights look got keen and he began to note his wifes remarks  do you imply barbaras getting fond of the fellow he asked  i am afraid of something like that mrs cartwright admitted in a way one hesitates to meddle sometimes meddling does harm and of course if barbara really loved the young man she paused and gave cartwright a sentimental smile after all i married for love and a number of my friends did not approve  cartwright grunted he had married clara because she was rich but it was something to his credit that she had not suspected this clara was dull and her dullness often amused him  if you think it necessary i wont hesitate about meddling he remarked shillitos a beggarly sawmill clerk  he said he was treasurer for an important lumber company barbaras very young and romantic and although she has not known him long  she has known him for about two weeks cartwright rejoined perhaps its long enough shillitos what canadians call a looker and barbaras a romantic fool ive no doubt hes found out shell inherit some money its possible shes told him now i come to think about it she was off somewhere all the afternoon and it looks as if she had promised the fellow the evening  he indicated the canoe and was satisfied when mrs cartwright agreed since he refused to wear spectacles and own his sight was going although clara was generous he could not use her money and indeed did not mean to do so but he was extravagant and his managing owners post was not secure when one had powerful antagonists one did not admit that one was getting old  i doubt if shillitos character is all one could wish mrs cartwright resumed characters very important dont you think mrs grantthe woman with the big hatknows something about him and she said he was fierce i think she meant he was wild then she hinted he spent money he ought not to spend but isnt a treasurers pay good  cartwright smiled for he was patient to his wife it depends upon the company a treasurer is sometimes a bookkeeping clerk however the trouble is barbaras as wild as a hawk though i dont know where she got her wildness her brother and sister are tame enough  sometimes im bothered about barbara mrs cartwright agreed shes rash and obstinate not like the others i dont know if theyre tame but they had never given me much anxiety one can trust them to do all they ought  cartwright said nothing as a rule claras son and elder daughter annoyed him mortimer hyslop was a calculating prig grace was finicking and bound by ridiculous rules she was pale and inanimate there was no blood in her but cartwright was fond of the younger girl barbara was frankly flesh and blood he liked her flashes of temper and her pluck  when the canoe came to the landing he got up leave the thing to me he said ill talk to shillito  he went off but when he reached the steps to the veranda in front of the hotel he stopped his gout bothered him at the top mortimer hyslop was smoking a cigarette the young man was thin and looked bored his summer clothes were a study in harmonious colors and he had delicate hands like a womans when he saw cartwright stop he asked can i help you up sir  cartwrights face got red he hated an offer of help that drew attention to his infirmity and thought mortimer knew  no thanks im not a cripple yet have you seen shillito  youll probably find him in the smoking room the card party has gone in and hes a gambler  so am i  mortimer shrugged and cartwright wondered whether the fellow meant to imply that his gambling was not important since he had married a rich wife the young man however hesitated and looked thoughtful  i dont know your object for wanting shillito but if my suppositions near the mark might i state that i approve in fact id begun to wonder whether something ought not to be done the fellows plausible not our sort of course but when a girls romantic and obstinate  cartwright stopped him exactly well im the head of the house and imagine you can leave the thing to me perhaps it doesnt matter if your sister is obstinate im going to talk to shillito  he crossed the veranda and mortimer returned to his chair and cigarette he did not approve his stepfather but admitted that cartwright could be trusted to handle a matter like this mortimers fastidiousness was sometimes a handicap but cartwright had none  cartwright entered the smokingroom and crossed the floor to a table at which two or three men stood as if waiting for somebody one was young and tall his thin face was finely molded his eyes and hair were very black and his figure was marked by an agile grace  he looked up sharply as cartwright advanced  i want you for a few minutes cartwright said roughly as if he gave an order  shillito frowned but went with him to the back veranda although the night was warm and an electric light burned under the roof nobody was about cartwright signed the other to sit down  i expect your holidays nearly up and the hotel car meets the train in the morning he remarked  what about it shillito asked im not going yet  youre going tomorrow said cartwright grimly  shillito smiled and gave him an insolent look but his smile vanished cartwrights white mustache bristled his face was red and his eyes were very steady it was not for nothing the old shipowner had fronted disappointed investors and forced his will on shareholders meetings shillito saw the fellow was dangerous  ill call you he said using a gamblers phrase  very well said cartwright i think my cards are good and if i cant win on one suit ill try another to begin with the hotel proprietor sent for me he stated the house was new and beginning to pay and he was anxious about its character people must be amused but he was running a summer hotel not a gambling den the play was too high and young fools got into trouble two or three days since one got broke well he wanted me to use my influence and i said i would  he asked you to keep the stakes in bounds its a good joke  not at all said cartwright dryly i like an exciting game so long as it is straight and when i lose i pay i do lose and if i come out fifty dollars ahead when i leave ill be satisfied how much have you cleared  shillito said nothing and cartwright went on my antagonists are old cardplayers who know the game but when you broke forman he was drunk and the other two were not quite sober you play against young fools and your lucks too good if you force me to tell all i think and something that i know i imagine youll get a straight hint to quit  you talked about another plan shillito remarked  on the whole i think the plan ive indicated will work if it does not and you speak to any member of mrs cartwrights family ill thrash you on the veranda when people are about i wont state my grounds for doing so they ought to be obvious  shillito looked at the other hand cartwrights eyes were bloodshot his face was going purple and he thrust out his heavy chin shillito thought he meant all he said and his threat carried weight the old fellow was of course not a match for the vigorous young man but shillito saw he had the power to do him an injury that was not altogether physical he pondered for a few moments and then got up  ill pull out he said with a coolness that cost him much  cartwright nodded theres another thing if you write to miss hyslop your letters will be burned  he went back to the smokingroom and playing with his usual boldness won twenty dollars then he joined mrs cartwright on the front veranda and remarked shillito wont bother us he goes in the morning  mrs cartwright gave him a grateful smile she had long known that when she asked her husbands help difficulties were removed now he had removed shillito and she was satisfied but imagined he was not cartwright knitted his white brows and drew hard at his cigar  you had better watch barbara until the fellow starts he resumed then i think you and the girls might join the vernons at their fishing camp vernon would like it and hes a useful friend besides its possible shillitos obstinate your letters neednt follow you have them sent to me at montreal which will cover your tracks i must go back in a few days  mrs cartwright weighed the suggestion vernon was a winnipeg merchant and his wife had urged her to join the party at the fishing camp in the woods the journey was long but mrs cartwright rather liked the plan shillito would not find them and mrs vernon had two sons  cant you come with us she asked mortimer is going to detroit  sorry i cant said cartwright firmly i dont want to leave you but business calls  he was relieved when mrs cartwright let it go clara was a good sort and seldom argued he had loafed about with her family for two weeks and had had enough moreover business did call if the conference found out before his boat arrived that he had engaged oreanas return load they might see the shippers and make trouble anyhow they would use some effort to get the cargo for their boats sometimes one promised regular customers a drawback on standard rates  ill write to mrs vernon in the morning mrs cartwright remarked  telegraph said cartwright who did not lose time when he had made a plan when the lines are not engaged after business hours you can send a nightletter a long message at less than the proper charge  mrs cartwright looked pleased although she was rich and sometimes generous she liked small economies  after all writing a letters tiresome she said telegrams are easy will you get me a form    chapter ii  in the dark  in the morning cartwright told the porter to take his chair to the beach and sat down in a shady spot he had not seen barbara at breakfast and was rather sorry for her but she had not known shillito long and although she might be angry for a time her hurt could not be deep lighting his pipe he watched the path that led between the pines to the water  by and by a girl came out of the shadow and going to the small landingstage looked at her wristwatch cartwright imagined she did not see him and studied her with some amusement barbara looked impatient people did not often keep her waiting and she had not inherited her mothers placidity she had a touch of youthful beauty and although she was impulsive and rather raw cartwright thought her charm would be marked when she met the proper people and so to speak got toned down  cartwright meant her to meet the proper people because he was fond of barbara she had grace and although her figure was slender and girlish she carried herself well her brown eyes were steady her small mouth was firm and as a rule her color was delicate white and pink now it was high and cartwright knew she was angry she wore boating clothes and had obviously meant to go on the lake the trouble was her companion had not arrived  hallo said cartwright are you waiting for somebody  barbara advanced and sat down on a rocky ledge  no she said im not waiting now  cartwright smiled he knew barbaras temper and his line was to keep her resentment warm  you mean you have given him up and wont go if he does arrive well when a young man doesnt keep his appointment its the proper plan  she blushed but tried to smile i dont know if youre clever or not just now although you sometimes do see things the others miss i really was a little annoyed  ive lived a long time said cartwright however perhaps its important i havent forgotten i was young i think your brother and sister never were very young they were soberer than me when i knew them first  mortimer is a stick barbara agreed he and grace have a calm superiority that makes one savage now and then i like human people who sometimes let themselves go  she stopped and cartwright noted her wandering glance that searched the beach and the path to the hotel he knew whom she expected and thought it would give her some satisfaction to quarrel with the fellow cartwright did not mean to soothe her  mr shillito ought to have sent his apologies when he found he could not come he said  barbaras glance got fixed and cartwright knew he had blundered  oh she said now i begin to see mother kept me by her all the evening but mothers not very clever and mortimers too fastidious to meddle unless he gets a dignified part of course the plot was yours  cartwright nodded sometimes he used tact but he was sometimes brutally frank  you had better try to console yourself with the wheeler boys theyre straight young fellows shillito is gone he went by the car this morning and its unlikely hell come back  you sent him off said barbara and her eyes sparkled well im not a child and youre not my father really why did you meddle  for one thing hes not your sort then im a meddlesome old fellow and rather fond of you to see you entangled by a man like shillito would hurt let him go if you want to try your powers youll find a number of honest young fellows on whom you can experiment the boys one meets in this country are a pretty good sample  theres a rude vein in you barbara declared one sees it sometimes although youre sometimes kind anyhow i wont be bullied and controlled im not a shareholder in the cartwright line i dont know if its important but why dont you like mr shillito  cartwrights eyes twinkled in a sense he could justify his getting rid of shillito but he knew barbara and doubted if she could be persuaded still she was not a fool and he would give her something to think about  its possible my views are not important he agreed all the same when i told the man he had better go he saw the force of my arguments he went and i think his going is significant since id sooner not quarrel ill leave you to weigh this  he went off but barbara stopped and brooded she was angry and humiliated but perhaps the worst was she had a vague notion cartwright might be justified it was very strange shillito had gone all the same she did not mean to submit her mothers placid conventionality had long irritated her one got tired of galling rules and criticism she was not going to be molded into a calculating prude like grace or a prig like mortimer they did not know the ridiculous goodform they cultivated was out of date in fact she had had enough and meant to rebel  then she began to think about shillito his carelessness was strangely intriguing he stood for adventure and all the romance she had known besides he was a handsome fellow she liked his reckless twinkle and his coolness where coolness was needed for all that she would not acknowledge him her lover barbara did not know if she really wanted a lover yet she imagined cartwright had got near the mark when he said she wanted to try her power cartwright was keen although barbara sensed something in him that was fierce and primitive  perhaps nobody else could have bullied shillito mortimer certainly could not but barbara refused to speculate about the means cartwright had used  shillito ought not to have gone without seeing her this was where it hurt she was entitled to be angryand then she started for a page boy came quietly out of the shade  a note miss he said with a grin i was to give it you when nobody was around  barbaras heart beat but she gave the boy a quarter and opened the envelope the note was short and not romantic shillito stated he had grounds for imagining it might not reach her but if it did he begged she would give him her address when she left the hotel he told her where to write and added if she could find a way to get his letters he had much to say  his coolness annoyed barbara but he had excited her curiosity and she was intrigued moreover cartwright had tried to meddle and she wanted to feel she was cleverer than he then shillito was entitled to defend himself and to find the way he talked about would not be difficult barbara knitted her brows and began to think  at lunch mrs cartwright told her they were going to join the vernons in the woods and she acquiesced two or three days afterwards they started and at the station she gave cartwright her hand with a smiling glance but cartwright knew his stepdaughter and was not altogether satisfied barbara did not sulk when one tried to baffle her she fought  the vernons camp was like others winnipeg people pitch in the lonely woods that roll west from fort william to the plains it is a rugged country pierced by angry rivers and dotted by lakes but a gasolene launch brought up supplies the tents were large and doubleroofed and for a few weeks one could play at pioneering without its hardships the vernons were hospitable the young men and women given to healthy sport and mrs cartwright watching barbara fish and paddle on the lake banished her doubts for herself she did not miss much the people were nice and the cooking was really good  when two weeks had gone grace and barbara sat one evening among the stones by a lake the evening was calm the sun was setting and the shadow of the pines stretched across the tranquil water now and then the reflections trembled and a languid ripple broke against the driftwood on the beach in the distance a loon called but when its wild cry died away all was very quiet  grace looked across the lake and frowned she was a tall girl and although she had walked for some distance in the woods her clothes were hardly crumpled her face was finely molded but rather colorless her hands were very white while barbaras were brown her dress and voice indicated cultivated taste but the taste was negative as if grace had banished carefully all that jarred and then had stopped it was characteristic that she was tranquil although she had grounds for disturbance they were some distance from camp and it would soon be dark but nothing broke the gleaming surface of the lake the boat that ought to have met them had not arrived  i suppose this is the spot where harry vernon agreed to land and take us on board she said  its like the spot i understand we must watch out for a point opposite an island with big trees  watch out grace remarked  watch out is good canadian barbara rejoined im studying the language and find it expressive and plain when our new friends talk you know what they mean besides id better learn their idioms because i might stop in canada if somebody urged me  grace gave her a quiet look barbara meant to annoy her or perhaps did not want to admit she had mistaken the spot now grace came to think about it the plan that the young men should meet them and paddle them down the lake was barbaras  i dont see why we didnt go with harry and the other as he suggested she said  then youre rather dull they didnt really want us they wanted to fish to know when people might be bored is useful  but there are a number of bays and islands they may go somewhere else grace insisted  oh well it ought to amuse harry and winter to look for us and if theyre annoyed they deserve some punishment if they had urged us very much to go i would have gone anyhow you neednt bother theres a short way back to camp by the old loggers trail  grace said nothing she thought barbaras carelessness was forced barbara was sometimes moody perhaps she felt shillitos going more than she was willing to own for all that the fellow was gone and barbara would no doubt presently be consoled  if mother could see things barbara resumed sometimes one feels one wants a guide but all one gets is a ridiculous platitude from her oldfashioned code one has puzzles one cant solve by outofdate rules however since she doesnt see theres no use in bothering  im your elder sister but you dont give me your confidence  barbaras mood changed and her laugh was touched by scorn you are worse than mother shes kind but cant see you dont want to see id sooner trust my stepfather hes a very human old ruffian i wish i had a real girl friend but you tactfully freeze off all the girls i like its strange how many people there are whom virtuous folks dont approve  grace missed the note of appeal in her sisters bitterness she did not see the girl as disturbed by doubts and looked in perplexity for a guiding light afterwards when understanding was too late grace partly understood  mr cartwright is not a ruffian she said coldly  i suppose youre taking the proper line and youd be rather noble only youre not sincere you dont like cartwright and know he doesnt like you all the same its not important we were talking about getting home and since the boys have not come for us we had better start  the loon had flown away and nothing broke the surface of the lake the shadows had got longer and driven back the light thin mist drifted about the islands the green glow behind the trunks was fading and it would soon be dark  in winter the big timber wolves prowl about the woods barbara remarked horrible savage brutes i expect you saw the heads at the packers house still one understands they stay north until the frost begins  she got up and when they set off grace looked regretfully across the lake for she would sooner have gone home on board the fishing bateau she was puzzled the bays on the lake were numerous and islands dotted the winding reaches but it was strange the young men had gone to the wrong spot they knew the lake and had told barbara where to meet them in the meantime however the important thing was to get home  darkness crept across the woods and as she stumbled along the uneven trail grace got disturbed she felt the daunting loneliness the quiet jarred her nerve the pines looked ghostly in the gloom they were ragged and strangely stiff it looked as if their branches never moved and the dark gaps between the trunks were somehow forbidding  grace did not like canada her cultivation was artificial but canada was primitive and stern in the towns one found inventions that lightened labor and brought to the reach of all a physical comfort that in england only the rich enjoyed but the contrasts were sharp one left ones hotel with its very modern furniture noisy elevators and telephones and plunged into the wilderness where all was as it had been from the beginning grace shrank from primitive rudeness and hated adventure living by rule she distrusted all she did not know she thought it strange that barbara who feared nothing let her go in front  they came to a pool all round the black tops of the pines cut the sky the water was dark and sullen in the gloom the trail followed its edge and when a loons wild cry rang across the woods grace stopped she knew the cry of the lonely bird that haunts the canadian wilds but it had a strange note like mocking laughter grace disliked the loon when its voice first disturbed her sleep at the fishing camp she hated it afterwards  go on said barbara sharply  for a moment or two grace stood still she did not want to stop but something in barbaras voice indicated strain if barbara were startled it was strange then not far off a branch cracked and the pinespray rustled as if they were gently pushed aside  oh grace cried something is creeping through the bush  then dont stop said barbara perhaps its a wolf  grace clutched her dress and ran at first she thought she heard barbara behind but she owned she had not her sisters pluck and fear gave her speed she must get as far as possible from the pool before she stopped besides she imagined something broke through the undergrowth near the trail but her heart beat and she could not hear properly  at length her breath got labored and she was forced to stop all was quiet and the quiet was daunting barbara was not about and when grace called did not reply grace tried to brace herself perhaps she ought to go back but she could not she shrank from the terror that haunted the dark then she began to argue that to go back was illogical if barbara had lost her way she could not help it was better to push on to the camp and send men who knew the woods to look for her sister she set off and presently saw with keen relief the light of a fire reflected on calm water    chapter iii  barbara vanishes  graces arrival was greeted by a shout and when she stopped in front of the diningtent a group of curious people surrounded her the double roof of the big tent was extended horizontally and a lamp hanging from a pole gave a brilliant light grace would sooner the light had been dim for she was hot and her clothes were torn and wet with dew besides she must tell her tale and admit that she had not played a heroic part  wheres barbara mrs cartwright asked  i dont know harry vernon did not meet us and we started home by the loggers trail i lost barbara by the pool something in the bush tried to creep up to us a wolf i think  oh shucks remarked a frank winnipeg girl who did not like miss hyslop in summer you cant find a wolf south of broken range looks as if you were scared for nothing but i cant see why barbara didnt beat you at hitting up the pace  others asked questions and when grace got breath she tried to satisfy their curiosity some of the group looked thoughtful and mrs vernon said  nothing can have hurt barbara and if she has lost her way she cannot wander far because she must be in the loop between the river and the lake but harry did go to meet you and when he found you had not come back went off again with bob i expect theyll soon arrive with barbara  they waited for halfanhour and then when the splash of paddles stole out of the dark ran down to the beach presently a doubleended bateau crossed the beam of light and grounded a young man helped barbara out and gave her his arm  you mustnt bother harry i can walk all right she said  get hold said vernon youre not going to walk if youre obstinate ill carry you  barbara leaned upon his arm but her color was high and her look strained when he helped her across the stones harry vernon was a tall thin wiry canadian with a quiet face when he got to the tent he opened the curtain and beckoning mrs cartwright pushed barbara inside  youll give her some supper maam and ill chase the others off he said the little girls tired and mustnt be disturbed  barbara gave him a grateful look and the blood came to his sunburned skin  i am a little tired she declared and added too quietly for mrs cartwright to hear youre a white man  vernon pulled the curtain across and joining the others lighted a cigarette  the girls stopped at false point two miles short of the spot we fixed he said i reckon bobs directions were not plain enough since we didnt come along they started back by the loggers trail while we went to look for them by the other track at the pool they thought they heard a wolf thats so miss hyslop  yes said grace i ran away and thought i heard barbara following but what happened afterwards  she fell hurt her foot had to stop and then couldnt make good time we found her limping along and shoved through the bush for the river so she neednt walk well i think thats all  it was plausible but grace was not altogether satisfied moreover she imagined vernon was not and noted that mrs vernon gave him a thoughtful glance all the same there was nothing to be said and she went to her tent  at daybreak vernon left the camp and when he reached the pool walked round its edge and then sat down and lighted his pipe a few yards in front a number of faint marks were printed on a belt of sand by and by he heard steps and frowned when winter came out from an opening in the row of trunks they were friends and bob was a very good sort but vernon would sooner he had stopped away  hallo he said why have you come along  i lost my huntingknife winter replied it was hooked to my belt and i thought the clip let go when we helped miss hyslop over the big log a bully knife i wanted to find the thing he paused and smiled when he resumed i reckon you pulled out of camp to meditate  vernon hesitated had winter stopped a few yards off he would have begun some banter and drawn him away from the pool bob was a woodsman and his eyes were keen the sun was however rising behind the pines and a beam of light touched the sand there was no use in trying to hide the marks in fact vernon imagined bob had seen them  no he said i thought id try to trail the wolf miss hyslop talked about  looks as if youd found some tracks winter remarked well theyre not a wolfs he sat down opposite vernon a mans i saw another at a soft spot he followed the girls from the lake and stopped for some time i allow i reckoned on something like that  vernon made an experiment might have been a packer going to a logging camp or perhaps an indian  shucks said winter although he gave vernon a sympathetic smile there are no indians about the lake and packers boots dont make marks like those a city boot and a city man a fellow whos wise to the bush lifts his feet anyhow i reckon he doesnt belong to your crowd  a sure thing vernon agreed i can fix where all the boys were besides if somebody in our lot had wanted to talk to miss hyslop he wouldnt have hung around in the woods my mothers pretty fastidious about her guests well ill own up the thing bothers me  winter nodded harry was frank and honest and bob imagined he had felt barbara hyslops charm he was sorry for harry the thing was awkward  what are you going to do about it he asked  to begin with im going to hide these tracks after all i dont see much light i suppose i ought to tell my mother and put mrs cartwright wise but i wont spying on a girl and telling is mean all the same im surely bothered in a sense my mothers accountable for her guests and the girls nice id like it if i could talk to the man  nothing doing there hell watch out well well hide up his tracks and look for my knife dyou think grace hyslop knew the job was put up  i dont said vernon dryly i reckon she was puzzled but thats all you couldnt persuade miss hyslop her sister liked adventures in the dark anyhow the things done with we have got to let it go  they went off and winter pondered harry had got something of a knock perhaps he was taking the proper line anyhow it was the line harry would take but bob doubted the girl was very young and the man who met her in the dark was obviously a wastrel  when they returned for breakfast barbara had joined the others and wore soft indian moccasins bob looked at harry and understood his frown harry had played up when he helped her home but he no doubt thought the game ought to stop bob wondered whether barbara knew because she turned her head when harry advanced  after breakfast mrs vernon carrying a small bottle joined mrs cartwrights party under the pines outside the tent the dew was drying and the water shone like a mirror but it was cool in the shade barbara occupied a campchair and rested her foot on a stone mrs cartwright knitted and grace studied a philosophical book her rule was to cultivate her mind for a fixed time every day harry vernon strolled up to the group and mrs cartwright put down her knitting  youre kind but the childs obstinate and wont let me see her foot she said to mrs vernon  its comfortable now barbara remarked when something that hurt you stops hurting i think its better to leave it alone besides one doesnt want to bother people  you wont bother me and ill fix your foot in two or three minutes so it wont hurt again mrs vernon declared the elixirs famous and i havent known it to miss i always carry some when we camp in the woods she turned to her son tell barbara how soon i cured you when you hurt your arm  you want to burn miss hyslop with the elixir  it doesnt burn much you said you hardly felt it and soon after i rubbed your arm the pain was gone  harry glanced at barbara and saw she was embarrassed although her mouth was firm since she did not mean to let mrs vernon examine her supposititious injury his business was to help and he laughed  miss hyslops skin is not like my tough hide you certainly fixed my arm but it was a drastic cure and i think miss hyslop ought to refuse i try to indulge you like a dutiful son but you are not her mother  i am her mother and she will not indulge me mrs cartwright remarked with languid grievance and barbara gave harry a quick searching glance his face was inscrutable but she wondered how much he knew she felt shabby and ashamed  when mrs vernon went off with the elixir harry sat down  if you could bring mr cartwright out i might persuade my father to come along he said the old man likes cartwright declares hes a sport  he is a shipowner grace remarked i think he used to shoot but its some time since  harry looked at barbara and his eyes twinkled american english isnt oxford english but your people are beginning to use it and miss barbara learns fast all the same running the independent freighters is quite a sporting proposition and i imagine mr cartwright generally makes good the old man and i would back him to put over an awkward deal every time  my husband is a good business man mrs cartwright agreed but you belong to winnipeg and i understand his business is at montreal  the steamship conference understood something like that until cartwright put them wise you see we western people grow the wheat that goes down the lakes and when the conference got to know an independent boat was coming out they went round and offered montreal shippers and brokers a drawback on the rates that is if the shippers gave them all their stuff theyd meet their bills for a rebate some time afterwards bully for the shippers but it left the western men who raised the wheat in the cold well while the conference got after him at montreal cartwright came west and booked all the grain he could load before it started off when the conference got wise the cargo was in the independent freighters hold cartwrights surely a business man  barbara laughed and mrs cartwright languidly agreed but grace frowned although she did not approve cartwright he was the head of her house and to know his clever tricks were something of a joke hurt her dignity harry saw her frown  anyhow cartwrights promise stands he resumed if he ran his boat across half empty hed make good you can trust him  he went off and barbara mused unhappily she thought harry had talked to help her over an awkward moment and she was grateful but disturbed it looked as if he knew something and he might know much all the same when he talked about her stepfather she agreed cartwright was bold and clever and although he was sometimes not very scrupulous people did trust him barbara wished she had his cleverness and his talent for removing obstacles there were obstacles in her path and the path was dark yet she had promised to take it and must make good she tried to banish her doubts and began to talk  after lunch she allowed one of the party to help her on board a canoe the afternoon was calm and the light breeze that now and then sighed in the pinetops hardly ruffled the shining water in the evening when the straight trunks cut against a blaze of gold and green they sat by a smudge fire that kept off the mosquitoes and sang to an accompaniment of banjos and mandolins barbara sang with the others but it cost her an effort the tranquil day was nearly done and she felt it was the last tranquillity she might know for long her companions were frank and kind canadians but her sort and she was going to make a bold plunge with another who was not yet she knew one could not rebel for nothing and she had pluck the light faded behind the trees a loons wild cry rang across the dark water and the party went to bed  in the morning grace awoke mrs cartwright quietly  barbara is gone she said  ridiculous said mrs cartwright  she is gone her clothes are not about but we must be calm and not disturb the camp mrs vernon ought to know but nobody else you see its important  mrs cartwright saw and a few minutes afterwards her hostess knew  its plain i must give harry my confidence to some extent mrs vernon said and went to look for her son  she found him going off for a swim and when she told her tale he frowned  in a way perhaps im accountable but well talk about this again he said get mrs cartwright on board the launch and come along yourself as soon as bobs inside his clothes well start  but bob mrs vernon began  bob knows and ill need a partner if miss hyslop didnt leave the settlement on the night express shell be hitting the trail through the woods for the united states you must hustle  mrs vernon left him and a few minutes afterwards the fast motor launch swung out from the landing and sped down river with a white wave at her bows grace watched the boat vanish behind a wooded point and then went to her tent she was horribly angry and shocked barbara had cheated her and disgraced them all    chapter iv  the girl on the platform  the vancouver express was running in the dark through the woods west of fort william after the rain of early summer washouts that undermine the track are numerous and the express had been delayed now however the road was good and the engineer drove his big locomotive with throttle wide open black smoke blew about the rocking cars cinders rattled on the roofs and showers of sparks sped past the windows the wheels roared on shaking trestles and now and then awoke an echoing clang of steel for the company was doubling the track and replacing the wooden bridges by metal  this was george listers business and he lounged in a corner of a smokingcompartment and rather drowsily studied some calculations he was bound west from montreal and in the morning would resume his labors at a construction camp there was much to be done and the construction bosses who had sent for him were getting impatient  listers thoughts wandered from the figures he liked his occupation and admitted that he had been lucky but began to see he had gone as far as he could expect to go the trouble was he had not enjoyed the scientific training that distinguished the men who got important posts his mechanical career began in the engineroom of a wheatboat on the lakes and he had entered the railroad companys service when shipping was bad and steamers were laid up although he had studied for a term or two at mcgill university he knew his drawbacks sometimes promotion was given for merit but for the most part the men who made progress came from technical colleges and famous engineering works  an accident in the ranges on the pacific slope when a mountain locomotive jumped the track and plunged down a precipitous hillside gave lister his first chance he got the locomotive back to the line and being rewarded by a better post stubbornly pushed himself nearer the front now however it looked as if he must stop rules were not often relaxed in favor of men who had no highlyplaced friends yet lister wondered  not long since a gentleman whose word carried some weight at the companys office had visited the construction camp with his indulged daughter the girl was clever adventurous and interested by pioneer work and lister had helped her to some thrills she obviously enjoyed she had with his guidance driven a locomotive across a shaking halfbraced bridge fired a heavy blasting shot and caught big gray trout from his canoe although lister used some reserve their friendship ripened and when she left she hinted she had some power she might be willing to use on his behalf  all the same lister was proud the girl belonged to a circle he could not enter and if he got promotion it must be by his merits he was not the man to get forward by intrigue and the clever use of a womans influence he had no talent for that kind of thing he let it go and tried to concentrate on his calculations  by and by the colored porter stopped to tell him his berth was fixed and the passengers were going to bed lister nodded put up his papers and then lighted a cigarette the smokingcompartment was hot the light the rocking lamp threw about had hurt his eyes and he thought he would go out on the platform for a few minutes  he went the draught that swept the gap between the cars was bracing and cool there was a moon he saw water shine and dark pines stream past the snorting of the locomotive broke in a measured beat through the roll of wheels the rocks threw back confused echoes about the clanging cars then the gleam among the trees got wider and lister knew they were nearing a trestle that crossed an arm of a lake in fact he had wondered whether he would be sent to pull down the bridge and rebuild it with steel  he sat down on the little boxseat with his back against the door the platform had not the new guards the company was then fitting there was an opening in the rails and one could go down the steps when the train was running the moonlight touched the back of the car in front but lister was in the gloom and when the vestibule door opposite opened he was annoyed if somebody wanted to go through the train he must get up  a girl came out of the other car and seizing the rails looked down she was in the light and lister remarked that she did not wear traveling clothes he thought her small knitted cap short dress and loose jacket indicated that she had come from a summer camp then she turned her head and he saw her face was rather white and her look was strained it was obvious that something had disturbed her  the girl did not see him and while he wondered whether he ought to get up she put her foot on the step and leaned out as if she weighed the possibility of jumping off she swung back when the cars lurched round a curve and the measured roll of wheels changed to a sharp broken din the train was running on to the trestle and lister saw the water shine below the platform he got up and moving quietly seized the girls arm and pulled her from the rails  a jolt might throw you off he said  she looked up with a start and the blood came to her skin but she gave him a quick searching glance lister was athletic his face was bronzed by frost and sun and his look was frank she lowered her eyes and her color faded  does the train stop soon she asked  if the engineers lucky we wont stop until he makes the next watertank and its some distance  she turned with a quick nervous movement and glanced at the door lister imagined she was afraid somebody might come out  could one persuade or bribe the conductor to pull up  lister hesitated he knew the train gang and was a railroad boss but the company was spending a large sum in order to cut down the timeschedule and somebody must account for all delay  i think not you see unless theres a washout or the track is blocked nothing is allowed to stop the vancouver express  the girl glanced at the door again and then gave him an appealing look  but i must get off i oughtnt to have come on board i want to go east towards montreal and not to winnipeg  although he was not romantic lister was moved she was very young and her distress was obvious somehow he felt her grounds for wanting to leave the train were good indeed he rather thought she had meant to jump off had they not run on to the bridge yet for him to stop the express would be ridiculous the conductor and engineer would pay for his meddling with quiet firmness he pulled the girl farther from the opening of the rails  we stop long before we get to winnipeg he said soothingly then its possible well be held up by a blocked track washouts are pretty numerous on this piece of line however if we do stop and you get down youll be left in the woods  oh she said thats not important all i want is to get off  very well said lister if we are held up ill look for you but i dont know if the jolting platform is very safe hadnt you better go back to your car  she gave him a quick glance and he thought she braced herself  im not going back i cant its impossible  lister was curious but hesitated about trying to satisfy his curiosity the girl was afraid of somebody and seeing no other help she trusted him  then you had better come with me and ill find you a berth where you wont be disturbed he said  she followed him with a confidence he thought moving and when they met the conductor he took the man aside  thats all right said the other nobodys going to bother her while im about  lister returned to the smokingcompartment but the adventure had given him a pleasant thrill and he did not feel sleepy he got out his calculations and tried to interest himself until a man entered the car the fellow was rather handsome and his clothes were good but lister thought he looked perplexed he gave lister a keen glance and went on through the car some minutes afterwards he came back frowning savagely stopped in front of lister as if he meant to speak hesitated and went out by the vestibule  it was plain the fellow had gone to look for the girl and had not found her the conductor had seen to that lister smiled but admitted that the thing was puzzling the man was older than the girl although he was not old enough to be her father if he were her husband she would not have run away from him and it did not look as if he were her lover lister saw no light but since it was obvious she feared the man he resolved if possible to help her to escape  some time afterwards the whistle pierced the roll of wheels and lister going to the platform saw a big electric headlamp shine like a star the cars were slowing and he imagined the operator had tried to run a construction train across the section before the express came up they would probably stop for a minute at the intersection of the main and side tracks hurrying through the train lister found the conductor who look him to a curtained berth and the girl got down she was dressed and wore her knitted cap  if you are resolved to go i may be able to help you off lister said  i must go she replied and although lister remarked that her hands trembled as she smoothed her crumpled dress her voice was steady  very well he said come along  when he opened the vestibule door the train was stopping and the beam from a standing locomotives headlamp flooded the track with dazzling light for a moment the girl hesitated but when lister went down the steps she gave him her hand and jumped lister felt her tremble and was himself conscious of some excitement he did not know if he was rash or not but since she meant to go speed was important because the man from whom she wanted to escape might see them on the line he went to the waiting engine in front of a long row of ballast cars on which a big gravel plough loomed faintly in the dark  whos on board he asked  a man he knew looked out from the cab window  hallo mr lister im on board with jake were going to malcolm cut for gravel washouts mixed things operator reckoned he could rush us through  then youll stop and get water at the tank lister interrupted will you make it before the eastbound comes along  we ought to make it halfanhour ahead wires all right that way nothings on the road  lister turned to the girl if youre going east you must buy a new ticket at malcolm have you money  i have some she said and stopped and lister imagined she had not until then thought about money and had not much  youll take this lady to malcolm roberts and put her down where she can get to the station he said to the engineer nobody will see you have a passenger but if the agents curious ill fix the thing with him  it was breaking rules but the man knew lister and lister knew he could be trusted he took some bills from his wallet and as he helped the girl up the steps pushed the paper into her hand  she turned to the cab door and lister imagined she was hardly conscious of the money he had given her her color was high but her look indicated keen relief  oh she said i owe you much you dont know all you have done i will not forget  somebody waved a lantern a whistle shrieked and the locomotive bell began to toll lister jumped back and seized the rails above the platform steps as the car lurched forward they moved faster the beam of the headlamp faded and the train rolled on into the dark    chapter v  shillito gets away  when the train started lister did not go to his berth his curiosity was excited and he wondered whether he had been rash now he came to think about it the girl was attractive and perhaps this to some extent accounted for his willingness to help moreover she was young and it was possible her relations had put her in the mans control if so his meddling could not be justified  after a time he heard the whistle and imagined the train was going to stop at a small station to which mails were brought from some mining camps the neighboring country was rugged and lonely but a trail ran south through the woods to the american frontier when the cars stopped he pushed down the window and looked out  small trees grew along the track and the light from the cars touched their branches the line was checkered by illuminated patches and belts of gloom lister heard somebody open the baggage car and then saw a man run along the line beside the train another jumped off a platform and they met not far from listers window the man who got down was the fellow who had gone through the car looking for the girl the locomotive pump throbbed noisily and lister could not hear their talk but he thought they argued  the one who came up the line looked impatient and put his hand on his companions arm as if to urge him away the other stepped back and his gesture implied that he refused to go the train was long the passengers were asleep and the men no doubt imagined nobody saw them lister thought the fellow who got down did not know the girl was gone and did not mean to leave the train without her the light touched the mens faces and it was obvious that one was angry and the other disturbed the scene intrigued lister it was like watching an act in a cinema play of which one did not know the plot  after a minute or two a lantern flashed up the track the bell tolled and the nearer man jumped back on the step lister heard a vestibule door shut and then the throb of wheels began the fellow on the line frowned and threw out his hands angrily from the movement of his lips lister thought he swore but the car rolled past him and he melted into the dark  lister went to his berth but did not undress much of the night had gone he would reach his camp soon after daybreak and the train would only stop long enough for him to jump off he could sleep in his clothes for an hour or two a slackening of the roll of wheels wakened him and he got out of his berth but the big lamps were burning and when he went to the door he saw dawn had not come it was obvious they had not reached the construction camp lister shivered and was returning to his berth when the conductor opened the door  our lucks surely not good tonight he said theyre pulling us up at maple if its not a washout somebody will get fired  he went off grumbling but when the train stopped came back with a trooper of the northwest mounted police  wheres the guy you told me to watch out for he asked  lister said he did not know and offered to go with them and help find the man it looked as if he were going to see the end of the play  when they opened a vestibule door a man came out of the car in front and stopped as if he were dazzled by the beam from the conductors lifted lamp  thats the fellow lister shouted  he thought the other saw the troopers uniform because he stepped back quickly the door however was shut when he let go the handle the springbolt had engaged  nothing doing that way said the trooper my partners coming along behind you youre corraled all right ive a warrant for you louis shillito  the northwest police work in couples and the situation was plain one trooper had begun his search at the front of the train the other at the back and shillito hearing the first turn the passengers out of their berths had tried to steal away and met the other his face got strangely white but lister thought it was rather with rage than fear his lips drew back in a snarl and the veins swelled on his forehead he occupied the center of the illuminated circle thrown by the conductors lamp and his savage gaze was fixed lister saw he was not looking at the policeman but at him  blast you shillito shouted if you hadnt butted in  cut it out said the trooper hands up weve got you dont make trouble  shillitos hand went behind him it was possible he felt for the door knob but the trooper meant to run no risks although he had put down his rifle and taken out his handcuffs he jumped forward across the platform and shillito bent sideways to avoid his spring the fellow was athletic and his quick sidemovement indicated he was something of a boxer the policeman was embarrassed by his handcuffs and young shillito seized him and threw him against the rails close to the gap where the steps went down the trooper gasped his grasp got slack and his body slipped along the rails it looked as if shillito would throw him down the steps and lister jumped  he saw shillitos hand go up and next moment got a heavy blow for all that he seized the man and held on though blood ran into his eyes and he felt dizzy shillito struggled like a savage animal and lister imagined the trooper did not help much he got his arms round his antagonist and tried to pull him down shillito was trying to reach the opening in the rails after a moment or two lister felt his muscles getting slack lurched forward and saw nothing in front he plunged out from the gap struck a step with his foot and somebody fell on him then he thought he heard a rifleshot and knew nothing more  by and by somebody pulled him to his feet and he saw the conductor holding his arm a group of excited passengers stood round them in the light that shone from the train and some others ran along the edge of the woods the trooper and shillito were gone  listers head hurt he felt shaky and when he wiped his face his hand was wet with blood  my heads cut spose i hit something when i fell he said  shillito socked it to you pretty good the conductor replied and waved his lamp all aboard he shouted and pushed lister up the steps  when they reached the platform the car jolted and lister sat down with his back against the door  my legs wont hold me he said in an apologetic voice did shillito get off  knocked out the trooper and made the bush the other fellow was way back along the train the conductor replied they want him for embezzlement and will soon get on his trail but the washouts broke the wires and i reckon hell cross the frontier ahead now you come along and ill try to fix your cut  lister went and soon after a porter helped him into his berth his head hurt and he felt very dull and slack but he slept and when he woke bright sunshine streamed into the standing car and he saw the train had stopped at winnipeg soon afterwards the conductor and one of the station officials put him into an automobile  if the reporters get after you remember youre not to talk about the girl he said to the conductor  the other nodded and signed the driver to start the car rolled off and stopped at the house of a doctor who dressed the cut on listers head and ordered him a weeks rest lister went to a hotel and in the morning found a romantic narrative of shillitos escape in the newspaper but was relieved to note that nothing was said about the girl the report however stated that a passenger who tried to help the police had got badly hurt and shillito had vanished in the woods the police had not found his trail and it was possible he would reach the american frontier  lister thought the thing was done with and when a letter arrived from the construction office telling him to stay until he felt able to resume his work resigned himself to rather dreary idleness for some days his head ached and he could not go out the other guests were engaged in the city and there was nobody to whom he could talk he got badly bored and it was a relief when one afternoon the gentleman he had met at the construction camp arrived with his daughter for all that lister was surprised duveen was a man of some importance miss duveen was a fashionable young lady and lister had imagined they had forgotten him he took his guests to a corner of the spacious rotunda where a throbbing electric fan blew away the flies and duveen gave him a cigarette  the record did not give your name but we soon found out who was the plucky passenger he said with a friendly smile ruth thought shed like to see you and since i wasnt engaged this afternoon we came along  i did want to come but i really think you proposed the visit ruth remarked  oh well said duveen i dont know if its important but perhaps we oughtnt to make mr lister talk  lister declared he wanted to talk and duveen said presently i dont see why you butted in  for a moment or two lister hesitated he was resolved to say nothing about the girl it was obvious she would not like her adventure known but he must be cautious duveen was clever and he thought miss duveen gave him a curious glance  the trooper was young and i sympathized with his keenness looked as if it was his first important job and he meant to make good  a romantic impulse duveen remarked and laughed well when one is young i expect its hard to stand off while a fights going on all the same its strange you didnt sympathize with the fellow who was corraled thats youths natural instinct although i allow its not often justified  the trooper was corraled hed put down his rifle and shillito had a gun i reckon it was the sharp butt of a heavy automatic that cut my head then i didnt like the fellow hed come through the train before and looked a smart crook  he is a crook and got away with a big wad of the lumber firms money however you were rash to jump for a man with a pistol you didnt know hed use the butt all the same you look brighter than we thought and can take a rest i expect the construction office wont rush you back until youre fit  i want to get back loafing round the hotel is dreary and my jobs not getting on although im ordered to lie off this wont count for much ill be made accountable for getting behind  duveen said nothing for a moment or two but he looked thoughtful and lister imagined miss duveen studied him quietly he did not belong to the duveens circle he was ruder in fact it was rather strange to see these people sitting with him engaged in friendly talk although now he thought about it miss duveen had not said much  she was a pretty girl and lister liked her fashionable dress somehow ruth duveen harmonized with the tall pillars and rich ornamentation of the rotunda one felt she belonged to spacious rooms duveens clothes were in quiet taste he wore a big diamond and looked commanding one felt this was a man whose word carried weight  youre something of a hustler he remarked with a smile for all that you got a nasty knock and your quitting for a time is justified well if you feel lonesome come along and dine at our hotel then well go and see the american opera im told the show is good  lister made some excuses but duveen would not be refused  when we stopped at your camp you made things smooth for us you gave ruth some thrills showed her the romance of trackgrading and generally helped her to a good time anyhow the thing is fixed well send the car for you  they went off soon afterwards and lister mused and smoked he had hardly expected to meet the duveens again and wondered whether he owed the visit to ruth or her father he had remarked at the camp that she was generally indulged well it was plain duveen could help him and lister was ambitious but he frowned and pulled himself up he was not going to intrigue for promotion and use a girls friendship in order to force his chiefs to see his merits things like that were done but not by him it demanded qualities he did not think were his moreover he did not know if ruth duveen was his friend she was attractive but he imagined she was clever all the same if he could get the doctor to fix his bandage so as to make it inconspicuous he would dine with the duveens    chapter vi  winnipeg beach  lister went to the opera with his hosts and was moved by the music and the feeling that he was one of a careless pleasureseeking crowd for the most part his life had been strenuous and the crowds he knew were rude his home was a bare shack sometimes built on the windswept alkali plains and sometimes in the tangled woods from daybreak until dusk fell hoarse shouts the clank of rails the beat of heavy hammers filled his ears and often the uproar did not stop at dark when a soft muskeg swallowed the new track he must watch by the flaring blastlamps noisy ploughs throw showers of gravel from the ballast cars  labor and concentration had left their mark listers muscles were hard but his body and face were thin he looked finedrawn and alert his talk was direct and quick as a rule his skin was brown but now the brown was gone and the lines on his face were deeper his injury accounted for something and he felt the reaction from a strain he had hardly noted while it must be borne although he had not altogether hidden his bandage and his clothes were not the latest fashion ruth duveen was satisfied somehow he looked a finer type than the business men in the neighboring stalls one felt the mans clean virility and got a hint of force  lister was highly strung the music stirred his imagination and when the curtain went down the light and glitter the perfume that drifted about the womens dress and the society of his attractive companion gave him a curious thrill he began to see he had missed much ambitions that had forced him to struggle for scope to use fresh efforts took another turn life was not all labor ruth duveen had enlightened him  he studied her she had grace and charm it was much to enjoy for one evening the society of a girl like this duveen went off between the acts to meet his friends but ruth stopped and talked her smile was gracious and lister let himself go he told her about adventures on the track and asked about her life in the cities perhaps it was strange but she did not look bored and when the curtain went down for the last time he felt a pang the evening was gone and in a day or two he must resume his labor in the wilds lister did not cheat himself he knew the strange romantic excitement he had indulged would not be his again when they went down the passage ruth gave him a smiling glance and saw his mouth was firm  you look rather tired she said have we tired you  lister turned and his eyes were thoughtful she had stopped to fasten her cloak and the people pushing by forced her to his side an electric lamp burned overhead and her beauty moved him he noted the heavy coils of her dark hair her delicate color and the grace of her form  im not at all tired he said i feel remarkably braced and keen as if id waked up from sleep in fact i think i have awakened  ruth laughed she saw he was not smiling and his graveness gave her a sense of power he had owned with typical frankness that she had moved him  sometimes to wake up suddenly gives one a jolt she said however you will soon get calm again in the woods  he sensed something provocative and challenging in her voice but he would not play up  i wonder he said quietly in a way the proper lines to go to sleep again  sometimes one dreams i expect you dream about locomotives breaking through trestles and dumpcars plunging into muskegs  he laughed theyre things i know and safe to dream about all the same i rather expect ill be haunted by lights and music pretty dresses and faces  he stopped and ruth remarked if these have charm there are no very obvious grounds for your going without you can command a locomotive and winnipegs not very far from your camp but were stopping the people and i cant fix this clasp  she moved and the opera cloak fell back from her arm which was uncovered but for the filmy sleeve that reached a little below the shoulder he noted its fine curves and the silky smoothness of her skin although he fastened the clasp with a workmans firm touch he thrilled then the crowd forced them on and they found duveen waiting by the car when they stopped at listers hotel ruth said we are going to winnipeg beach saturday would you like to come  duveen nodded a happy thought ive got to talk to some business people who make ruth tired if you come along i neednt bother about her  thats how ones father argues ruth exclaimed  lister hesitated i was told to lie off because i was hurt if im fit to enjoy an excursion im fit to work  youre too scrupulous young man have a good time when its possible or youll be sorry afterwards i reckon youre justified to take all the company will give  it was caution not scruples suppose i meet one of the railroad chiefs  ill fix him duveen rejoined your bosses wont get after you when you belong to my party anyhow well look out for you  the car rolled off and lister going to the rotunda lighted a cigarette and mused ruth duveen had beauty he liked her but must use caution since he imagined the friendship she had given him was something of an indulged girls caprice then he began to think about the girl he had met on board the train now he was able undisturbed to draw her picture he saw she too had charm but she was not at all like ruth the strange thing was one did not note if she were beautiful or not in a way this did not matter her pluck and firmness fixed ones interest  lister threw away his cigarette he was poor and not romantic the girl he had helped had vanished and after their excursion he hardly expected to see ruth again ruth was kind but she would soon forget him when he was gone he would go to winnipeg beach with her and then return to the woods and let his job absorb him in the meantime his head had begun to ache and he went to bed  the saturday morning was typical of winnipeg in summer the fresh northwest breeze that sweeps the manitoba plains had dropped dark thunderclouds rolled about the sky but the sun was hot and an enervating humidity brooded over the town the perspiring crowd in main street moved slackly the saloon bars were full and the groups of holidaymakers flocking to the station wore a languid look  lister met his hosts in the marble waiting hall where a goldframed panorama of canadian scenery closes the view between the rows of stately pillars duveen had brought three or four keeneyed nervous business men a rather imposing lady and ruth and they got on board a local train soon after lister arrived winnipeg beach was then beginning to attract holidaymakers from the prairie town one could row and fish in sheltered bays and adventure on board a gasoline launch into the northern wilds boating however had no charm for duveens friends the excursion was an opportunity for friendly business talk and when lunch was over ruth and lister went out on the lawn in front of the hotel  there was no wind a few dark clouds floated motionless overhead but outside their shadow the lake shone like glass running back until it melted into faint reflections on the horizon a varnished launch flashed in the sun and trailed a long white wake across the water  do you want to stay and talk to mrs knapp ruth asked  i do not said lister anyhow i imagine mrs knapp doesnt want to talk to me im not a bigbusiness man  ruth laughed oh well when you speculate at the board of trade a railroad engineer is not a useful friend i suppose i ought to stay but the things one ought to do are tiresome lets go on the lake  lister got a canoe and fixing a cushion for ruth picked up the paddle  where shall we go  north as far as you can lets get away from the boats and trippers and imagine were back in the woods where you helped me catch the big gray trout  then you liked it at the construction camp lister remarked it was a pretty rude spot  for an indulged city girl ruth said smiling well perhaps id got all the satisfaction dinner parties and dances and the society at hotels can give i knew the men who handle finance and work the wires behind the scenes but i wanted to know the others who do the strenuous things and keep the country going i came and you helped me to understand the romance of the lakes and woods  lister did not remember if he had tried to do so and thought he had not all the same the girl was keen and interested in summer it was not hard to feel the lonely sheets of water and tangled bush were touched by romance then perhaps everybody felt at times a vague longing for the rude and primitive but he was not a philosopher and dipping the paddle he drove the canoe across the tranquil lake  in the meantime he imagined ruth studied him with quiet amusement and wondered whether she thought he was not playing up he did not mean to play up the game was intricate and if he were rash might cost him much he had taken off his hat and jacket and effort had brought back the color to his skin his thin face had the clean bronze tint of an indians the soft shirt showed the finedrawn lines of his athletic figure but lister was not conscious of this he knew his drawbacks but not all his advantages  when he had gone some distance and the hotel and houses began to melt into the background he stopped and let the canoe drift  how far shall we go he asked  ruth indicated a rocky point cut off by the glimmering reflection that seemed to float above the horizon  lets see what is on the other side now and then one wants to know explorations intriguing dont you think so  sometimes in a practical sense when a height of land cuts the landscape i wonder whether one could find an easy downgrade for the track across the summit thats about as far as my imagination goes  oh well said ruth exploration like that is useful and one doesnt run much risk but risk and adventure appeal to some people  lister resumed paddling the girl had charm and he was young if he were not cautious there might be some risk for him he was not a clever philanderer and ruth and duveen had been kind by and by a puff of cool wind touched his hot skin and he looked round a black cloud had rolled up and there were lines on the water  we may get a blow and some thunder he remarked shall we go back  not yet well make the point first if it does thunder summer storms dont last  he paddled harder and a small white wave lapped the canoes bows the sky was getting dark and now the lines that streaked the lake were white but the wind was astern and they were going fast the glimmering reflections had vanished and the rocks ahead rose sharply from the leaden water the point was some distance off but lister knew he must reach it soon  a flash of forked lightning leaped from the sky and touched the lake there was a long rumbling peal and then a humming noise began astern angry white ripples splashed about the canoe and lumps of hail beat listers head then while the thunder rolled across the sky the canoe swerved it was blowing hard the high bow and stern caught the wind the strength was needed to hold her straight with the single paddle if he brought her round he could not paddle to windward and to steer across the sea that would soon get up might be dangerous they must make the point and land he threw ruth his jacket for spray had begun to fly and the drops from the paddle blew on board  put on the thing ive got to work he said  in a few minutes his work was hard short white waves rolled past the canoe lurched and swerved and lister knew if she swung off across wind and sea she might capsize he must keep her running and let the combers split against her pointed stern the combers were getting large and their hissing tops surged by some height above the gunwale but so long as he could keep her before them they would not come on board when her bows went up she sheered as if she meant to shoot across the hollow left by the sea that rolled by he stopped her with a backstroke and then drove hard ahead for he must have speed to steer when the next sea came on in the meantime the lightning flickered about the lake and between the flashes all was nearly dark the tops of the waves tossed against leaden cloud and he could hardly see the rocks for which he steered  by and by however the point stood out close ahead the trees on the summit bent in the wind spray leaped about the bowlders where the white foam rolled he must go round and find a landing to lee but to go round he must cross the belt of breaking water with the savage wind abeam the canoe shipped some water and riding in on a combers crest narrowly missed a rock that lifted its top for a moment out of the foam then lister drove her in behind the point and helped ruth to land on a gravel beach her eyes sparkled and he saw she had not been daunted  were all right now but we have got to stay until the storm blows out he said  they found shelter in a hollow of the cliff and sat among the driftwood while the rain that blotted out the lake drove overhead the deluge did not reach them and the cold was going  you go back on monday ruth said at length  lister smiled with humorous resignation i must the strange thing is when i left my job before i was keen to get back now id rather stop and loaf  then you were not bored at winnipeg  not at all lister declared if it would give me a holiday like this id get hurt again  i expect the woods get dreary then perhaps one doesnt make much progress by sticking to the track dont you want to get into the office where the big plans are made  i dont know said lister thoughtfully on the track youre all right if you know your job at headquarters you need qualities i dont know are mine anyhow im not likely to get there if i want or not  ruth gave him a curious glance sometimes ones friends can help would you really like a headquarters post  lister moved abruptly and his mouth got firm perhaps ruth exaggerated her fathers importance but it was possible duveen could get him promotion all the same lister saw what his taking the job implied he must give up his independence and be duveens man moreover if the girl meant to help she had some grounds for doing so he thrilled and was tempted but he thought hard it looked as if she liked him and was perhaps willing to embark upon a sentimental adventure but he thought this was all she would not marry a poor man  no he said with a touch of awkwardness i reckon i had better stick to the track to know where you properly belong is something and if i took the other job my chiefs would soon find me out  youre modest ruth remarked one likes modest people but dont you think youre obstinate  when the trail you hit goes uphill obstinacys useful  if you wont take help you may be long reaching the top but well let it go the wind hasnt dropped much how can we get back  we must wait lister replied with a twinkle the trouble about an adventure is when you start youre often forced to stay with it and put it over that sometimes costs more than you reckon  ruths eyes sparkled but she forced a smile logical people make me tired but why do you imagine i havent the pluck to pay  i dont said lister ive no grounds to imagine anything like that my business was to take care of you and i ought to have seen the storm was coming now im mad because i didnt watch out  sometimes youre rather nice ruth remarked you know i made you go on all the same we must start as soon as possible  lister got up presently and launched the canoe the thunder had gone but the breeze was strong and angry white waves rolled up the lake to drive the canoe to windward was heavy labor and while she lurched slowly across the combers the sun got low listers wet hands blistered and his arms ached but he swung the paddle stubbornly and at length the houses and hotel stood out from the beach when they got near the landing ruth looked ahead  the trains ready to pull out she exclaimed can you make it  lister tried his face got dark with effort and his hands bled but in a few minutes he ran the canoe aground ruth jumped out and they reached the station as the bell began to toll duveen waved to them from the track by the front of the train and then jumped on board and lister pushed ruth up the steps of the last car the car was secondclass and crowded by returning holidaymakers but the conductor who did not know lister and miss duveen declared all the train was full and they must stay where they were when he went off and locked the vestibule lister looked about  all the seats and much of the central passage were occupied for the most part by young men and women some were frankly lovers and did not look disturbed by the banter of their friends lister was embarrassed for ruths sake until he saw with some surprise that she studied the others with amused curiosity looking down he met her twinkling glance and thought it something like a challenge his embarrassment got worse one could not talk because of the noise and to shout was ridiculous he must stand in a cramped pose and try not to fall against ruth when the cars rocked he admitted that his proper background was the rude construction camp and it was something of a relief when they rolled into winnipeg  duveens car was at the station and ruth stopped for a moment before she got on board  you start on monday and we will be out of town tomorrow i wish you good luck  lister thanked her and when she got into the car she gave him a curious smile i think i liked you better in the woods she said and the car rolled off    chapter vii  listers dissatisfaction  soon after his return from winnipeg lister stood one evening by a length of track planned to cut out an awkward curve the new line ran into a muskeg that sucked down brush and logs and the loads of numerous gravel trains angry foremen declared one could not fill up the bog and lister knew the heads of the construction office grumbled about the delay he was tired for he had been strenuously occupied since morning but could not persuade himself that the work had made much progress  small trees lay in tangled rows about the fresh gravel farther back the standing bush ran in a broken line against the fading light in front thin mist drifted across the muskeg where slender trunks rose from the quaking mud not far off a high wooden trestle carried the rails across a ravine the bridge would presently be rebuilt with steel but in the meantime the frame was open and the gaps between the ties were wide  it was getting dark and noisy blastlamps threw up pillars of white fire the line had sunk in the afternoon and it was necessary to lift the rails and fill up the subsidence before the next gravel train arrived lister was angry and puzzled for he had pushed the roadbed across to near the other side but the rails had not sunk in the new belt but in ground over which the trains had run  by and by a man joined him and remarked the boys have got the ties up but i reckon they wont fix the track for three or four hours looks as if the blamed muskeg was going to beat us  she cant beat us lister rejoined impatiently the trouble is hauling the stuff she swallows runs up construction costs and that counts against us did you leave willis with the gang  the other laughed i did not he was tired wanted something at the office and allowed hed stop and take a smoke  hustle him out when you go along kemp id sooner our chiefs down east had kept that young man the jobs not soft enough for him however i spose he lighted the lamp across the bridge  willis has friends kemp remarked meaningly and indicated a reflection behind the trees the lamps burning  lister glanced at the trembling light i expect its good enough for the engineer but the flames not steady willis hasnt bothered to get the pressure right its possible he didnt wait until she warmed the oil  the powerful lamp had been carried across the bridge in order to warn the engineer of the gravel train who on his last journey had run to the end of the line the light could be seen for some distance up the track  i got after hardie about making good time we must dump his load in the soft spot before we stop lister resumed  hes coming now climbing the height of land said kemp hell let her go all out when he makes the top  a measured throb rolled across the woods and as the noise got louder the beat of the exhaust marked the progress of the train the explosive snorts indicated that the locomotive labored up the last steep pitch and lister sat down by the rails he was tired and would not be needed until the gravel plough threw the rattling ballast off the cars after a few moments he looked up for a man came out of the gloom  hello willis i spose youve been taking a quiet smoke  thats so said the other ive hustled round since sunup and imagined the gang could get along for half an hour without my watching you want to leave something to your foremen  lister said nothing he did not choose his helpers but tried to make the best use of those the bosses sent willis had some useful qualities but he was slack and got sulky if one drove him hard the young man had come from the drawingoffice of a famous bridgebuilding works  in the meantime the rumble of the gravel train grew to a pulsating roar the locomotive had crossed the divide and was running furiously down grade the roughlyballasted track was uneven but the engineer had been on board since daybreak and no doubt wanted to finish his job  shes in the rock cut now kemp remarked hardie ought to throttle down when he runs out and sees the light  lister listened the swelling note indicated that the train had left the cut but it did not look as if the engineer was pulling up  shes coming along pretty fast said willis if he doesnt snub her soon shell jump the steel and take the muskeg  next moment lister was on his feet hardie was driving too fast lister doubted if he could stop before the heavy train plunged through the broken track the unsteady white flicker behind the trees had sunk and changed to smoky red if looked as if the oil was not vaporizing properly and the lamp was going out when the engineer saw the light it would be too late  get the boys off the track ill try to fix the lamp lister shouted and started for the bridge  the errand was not his willis had lighted the lamp moreover one might have sent a workman but when a job was urgent lister went himself the job was urgent and dangerous unless he made good speed he would meet the train on the bridge and the cylinders of the locomotive projected beyond the edge  the track was rough and fresh gravel rolled under his feet now and then he struck a crosstie and nearly fell it had got dark and among the trees the gloom was deep one could not see the ties yet he must run and his breath got labored and his heart thumped he did not know where the train was only that it was near the woods throbbed with a savage din the big cars loaded with rattling gravel clanged and roared as they plunged down grade  lister hardly thought he could stop the train it looked as if he would be caught on the trestle but he meant to go on he did not argue about it he was rather moved by instinctive stubbornness at moments of strain one does not argue and logic has no appeal character counts for all and lister followed his bent his job was urgent and must be carried out  when he reached the bridge he saw white threads of water between the timbers of the open frame the spacing of the ties was not regular and if he stepped short or too far he would go through then if he did not strike a brace he would fall upon the rocks in the stream all the same he saw the blaze of the headlamp pick out the trees across the ravine and sprang on to the bridge  somehow he hit the ties perhaps by subconscious judgment and perhaps by good luck then he felt loose gravel under his feet and thrilled with a strange fierce satisfaction his breath was labored and his body wet by sweat but the moving beam had not reached the lamp he was going to make it  when the black front of a gravel car leaped out of the gloom he jumped off the track the locomotive pushed the cars the train was long and the lamp was but a few yards off it had not gone out although the flame had sunk to a faint red jet that would not be seen in the dust his hands shook but he gave the pump a few strokes and turned the valve wheel the red jet got white and leaped higher and lister pumping hard looked up the track big cars rocking and banging rushed past in a cloud of dust bits of gravel struck him and rattled against the lamp the blurred dark figures of men who sat upon the load cut against the fanshaped beam and in the background he saw a shower of leaping sparks  but the other light was growing and lister turned the wheel burning oil splashed around him a pillar of fire rushed up and when a whistle screamed he let go the valve and turned from the blinding dust he was shaking but the heavy snorting stopped the engineer had seen the light and cut off steam  when lister looked round the train was gone he had done what he had undertaken and after waiting for a few moments he started back now he could go cautiously he stopped and tried to brace himself at the end of the bridge although he had run across not long since he shrank from the dark forbidding gaps for all that he must get back and feeling carefully for the ties he reached the other side and was for some time engaged at the muskeg where two cars had overrun the broken rails at length he went to the log shack he used for his office and sleepingroom and soon after he lighted his pipe kemp came in  you made it kemp remarked when you stopped me at the bridge i saw youd get there  lister laughed now you talk about it i believe i did shout you to go back anyhow you were some way behind did willis come  he did not willis was badly rattled and started for the muskeg thought he might get the track thrown across the hole perhaps im rather sorry for the kid but what are you going to do about it  report we had two cars bogged and state the cost of labor thats all i think  kemp nodded well perhaps theres no use in talking about the lamp our business is to make good using the tools weve got all the same if they want a man somewhere else i guess id recommend willis  he smoked quietly for a time and then resumed we dont get forward much in fact if the new western irrigation company would take me on i think id quit  lister pondered since his short stop at winnipeg he had been conscious of a strange restlessness he wanted something the woods could not give and had begun to think life had more to offer than he had known besides he was not making much progress  since the double track is to be pushed on across the plains the department will need a bigger staff and there ought to be a chance for some of us he said then theres the new work with the long bridges on the lake section that will carry higher pay were next on turn and have some claim they ought to move us up  i doubt we didnt come from a famous office and its not always enough to know your job  somebody will get a better post and if im lucky ill stay if not i think ill try the irrigation works  i feel like that kemp declared but suppose the irrigation people turn our application down  then ill lie off for a time except when i went to mcgill with money i earned on a wheat barge i havent stopped work since i was a boy now im getting tired and think ill pull out and go across to look at the old country my father was an englishman and i have some money to burn  a good plan kemp agreed after a change you come back fresh with a stronger punch well if were not put on to the lake section well try the irrigation scheme  he got up and went off but lister sat on his bunk and smoked the bunk was packed with swampgrass on which his coarse hudsons bay blankets were laid and the shack was bare ragged slickers and old overalls occupied the wall long gumboots a corner a big box carried an iron washbasin and a small table some drawing instruments lister was not fastidious and as a rule did not stop long enough at one spot to justify his making his shack comfortable besides he found it necessary to concentrate on his work and had not much time to think about refinements  all the same he felt the shack was dreary and his life was bleak he had not felt this until he went to winnipeg on the whole he had liked the struggle against physical obstacles it was his proper job but the struggle was stern and sometimes exhausting and his reward was small now he wanted something different and gave himself to vague and brooding discontent  ruth duveen had broken his former tranquillity in a sense she had awakened him and he imagined she had meant to do so all the same to think she loved him was ridiculous she was rather experimenting with fresh material yet she was accountable for his discontent she had helped him to see that while he labored in the woods he had missed much he wanted the society of cultivated women and men with power and influence to use control instead of carrying out orders and to know something of refinement and beauty after all his father was a cultivated englishman although lister imagined he had inherited qualities that helped him most from his canadian mother it was all he had inherited except some debts he had laboriously paid  he admitted that to realize his ambitions might be hard but he meant to try canada was for the young and stubborn if his chiefs did not promote him he would make a plunge and if his new plan did not work he would go over and see the old country then he would come back braced and refreshed and try his luck again  putting down his pipe he got into bed he was tired and in the morning the gravel cars must be pulled out of the muskeg the job was awkward and while he thought about it he went to sleep    chapter viii  the test  a boisterous wind swept the high plain and round whiteedged clouds rolled across the sky the grass that ran back from the horizon was parched and in the distance a white streak of blowing dust marked a dried alkali lake dust of dark color drove along the row of wooden stores and houses that fronted the railroad track across which three grain elevators rose like castles the telegraph posts along the track melted into the level waste and behind the spot where they vanished the tops of a larger group of elevators cut the edge of the plain  the street was not paved and the soil was deeply ploughed by wheels the soil was the black gumbo in which the wheat plant thrives but the town occupied the fringe of a dry belt and farming had not made much progress now however a company was going to irrigate the land with water from a river fed by the rockies snow the town was square and although it looked much smaller than realestate agents maps indicated it was ornamented by four wooden churches a ymca like a temple and an ambitious public hall  the tecumseh hotel occupied a corner lot at the end of the street and was not remarkably commodious or clean but its charges were less than the occidentals by the station and lister and kemp were not fastidious some time had gone since they pulled the gravel cars out of the swamp and they had not been sent to the lake section in consequence they had applied to the irrigation company for a post and having been called to meet the engineers and directors imagined they were on the short list  lister lounged against the rails on the tecumseh veranda the boards were cracked and dirty burned matches and cigar ends were scattered about and a skeleton gauze covered door that shut with a powerful spring kept some of the flies and mosquitoes out of the hotel  well know tomorrow he remarked presently  kemp nodded i cant figure on our chances feel anxious about it  not much in fact i mean to use the thing to test my luck if were engaged ill stay in canada if they turn us down ill start for the old country  you have no particular plans i reckon  no said lister smiling im going to look about i know our new western towns but i want to see old cities churches and cathedrals the great jobs men made before they used concrete and steel then id like to study art and music and see the people my father talked about ours is a good country but when its all you know it gets monotonous he indicated the row of wooden houses and lonely plain one wants more than the track and this  its possible you may go across said kemp looks as if the companys short list was pretty long theres a gang of candidates in town we have no pull on the directors and i dont know if our advantages are very marked he stopped and laughed for a man came round the corner hello willis he exclaimed when did you arrive  i came in on the last train got a notice to meet the irrigation board  oh well said kemp since the applicants are more numerous than the posts i reckon another wont count do you expect theyre going to take you on  i expect my chance is as good as yours  ill sell you my chance for ten dollars kemp rejoined  nothing doing at the price said willis and went off  kemp laughed willis was marked by a superficial smartness his comrades sometimes found amusing and sometimes annoying for the most part they bore with him goodhumoredly but did not trust him when work that needed careful thought was done  the kid looks confident but his applying for a job is something of a joke kemp remarked id put his value at fifty cents a day  lister agreed and looked up the dusty street the fronts of the small frame houses were cracked by the sun and some were carried up to hide the roof and give the building a fictitious height a cloverleaf wagon stood in front of a store the wheels crusted by dry mud and the team fidgeted amidst a swarm of flies except for one or two railroad hands waiting by the caboose of a freight train nobody was about the town looked strangely dreary  yet lister knew it stood for all the relief from labor in the stinging alkali dust one could get one could loaf in a hard chair in front of the hotel lose a dollar or two at the shabby poolroom or go to a movie show and see pictures of frankly ridiculous western melodrama in the real west the pictures were ridiculous because romantic shootingsup did not happen in fact unless a stubborn labor dispute began nothing broke the dull monotony of toilsome effort romance had vanished with the buffaloes lister admitted that he had not long felt the monotony the trouble began when he stopped at winnipeg  i think ill go up the street he said  a rough plank sidewalk ran in front of the houses and lister imagined it was needed when the spring thaw and summer thunderstorms softened the gumbo soil opposite the occidental he stopped for duveen occupied a chair on the veranda while lister hesitated duveen beckoned him to come up  its hot and dusty will you take a drink he said  lister refused with thanks and wondered whether ruth was at the hotel in a way he would like to see her but admitted that perhaps he had better not when he asked if she was well duveen said she had gone to quebec and gave lister a cigar  it looks as if you had left the railroad he remarked  i have not left yet said lister cautiously  then you wont go unless you get a better job did you know i had joined the irrigation board  lister said he did not know and got embarrassed when duveen gave him a thoughtful glance he wondered whether ruth had talked to duveen before she hinted he might get a better post  perhaps i ought not to have come up in fact i hesitated  duveen laughed so i remarked you reckoned the occidental stoop was pretty public and your talking to me might imply that you wanted my support well ill risk that its obvious youre on the short list do you want a post  for a moment or two lister pondered he did want a post anyhow he ought to try for it on the whole he liked duveen and thought he might have liked ruth better had she not been rich all the same duveen was a shrewd manipulator of new industries and to take a post by his favor would be to own a debt for which payment might be demanded yet duveen had been kind and lister hesitated  i asked for a post he said if im engaged ill try to make good but i must make good at the dam or on the ditch then i dont want to bother my friends the company has my engineering record and must judge my usefulness by this if theyre not satisfied i wont grumble much  youre an independent fellow but i think i understand duveen rejoined with a twinkle a company directors duty is to judge an applicant for a post by his professional record if you are appointed you want us to appoint you because we believe you are the proper man  something like that said lister quietly  duveen nodded and his glance rested for a moment on listers forehead  i see the mark you got on board the train hasnt altogether gone did you hear anything about the girl you helped  i did not said lister starting for he had not imagined duveen knew about the girl i have not seen her since she went off on the locomotive  then she has not written to you since  she could not write because she doesnt know who i am and i dont know her we talked for a minute or two thats all  duveens face was inscrutable and lister wondered whether he doubted his statement he was annoyed because the other knew so much  oh well said duveen i expect you heard they didnt catch shillito and since he got across the frontier its possible the canadian police wont see him again but i must get ready for supper will you stay  lister excused himself and went back to the tecumseh where the bill of fare was frugal and the serving rude he imagined he had refused much more than a firstclass supper but was satisfied he had taken the proper line for one thing duveen knew ruth had given him her friendship and since he knew his daughter it was significant that he had not thought it necessary to meddle lister wondered whether he had meant to use him and was glad he had kept his independence if he got the post now he would know he had rather misjudged duveen but he doubted all the same he liked the man  after supper kemp and he sat on the veranda and watched the green glow fade from the edge of the plain they did not talk much but by and by kemp remarked i thought i saw you go into the occidental  duveen called me on to the stoop  duveen kemp exclaimed then hes got his hand on the wires if the irrigation company puts the undertaking over a number of the dollars will go to duveens wad if hes your friend i expect you know he could get you the job  its possible all the same i hinted i didnt want his help  kemp laughed you surprise me every time im all for a square deal and down with scheming grafters and logrollers but i allow i hate them worst when they give another fellow the post i want  the things not fixed yet the companys engineers are going to judge and our records pretty good they may engage us well know tomorrow  sure thing kemp remarked dryly i reckon well both pull out on the first train  it began to get dark and lister went off to bed he must get water from a cistern in the roof and to carry the heavy jug was awkward when one could not see at the tecumseh the guests were expected to carry water for themselves and lister groping along the shadowy passage with his load thought his doing so had some significance it was part of the price he must pay for freedom  at the time fixed in the morning he went to the occidental and was shown into a room where a number of gentlemen occupied a table one or two were smoking and the others talked in low voices but when lister came in and the secretary indicated a chair they turned as if to study him duveen sat next a man at the end of the table and gave lister a nod somehow lister thought he was amused  listers heart beat he felt this was ridiculous because he had persuaded himself it did not matter whether he got the post or not now however when the moment to try his luck had come he shrank from the plunge he had resolved to make if he were not engaged after all he knew and liked his occupation to let it go and try fresh fields would be something of a wrench  the gentlemen did not embarrass him on the whole they were urbane and when the secretary gave the chairman his application one asked a few questions about the work he had done lister was able to answer satisfactorily and another talked to him about the obstacles encountered when one excavated treacherous gravel and built a bank to stand angry floods for all that lister was anxious the others looked bored as if they were politely playing a game he thought they knew beforehand how the game would end but he did not know the inquiries that bored the urbane gentlemen had important consequences for him and the suspense was keen  at length they let him go and duveen gave him a smile that lister thought implied much when he returned to the hotel kemp remarked that he looked as if he needed a drink and suggested that lister go with him and get one  i need three or four drinks but mean to go without said lister grimly i begin to understand how some men get the tanking habit  he started off across the plain and coming back too late for lunch found kemp on the veranda kemp looked as if he were trying to be philosophical but found it hard  the secretary arrived not long since he said a polite man he didnt want to let us down too heavily  ah said lister the irrigation people have no use for us  kemp nodded willis has got the best job theyve hired up two or three others but were left out  willis exclaimed lister and joined in kemps laugh  after all the money hes going to get is theirs said kemp in this country were a curious lot we let grafters and wirepullers run us and when we start a big job get away with much of the capital we want for machines but somehow we make good we shoulder a load we neednt carry and hit the pace up hot if we got clean control i reckon wed never stop however theres not much use in philosophizing when youve lost your job and the eastbound train goes out in a few minutes youd better pack your grip    chapter ix  barbara plays a part  lister returned to the railroad camp and stayed until the company sent a man to fill his post in the meantime he wrote to some of his fathers relations whom he had not seen and their reply was kind they stated that while he was in england he must make their house his home when his successor arrived he started for montreal and one afternoon sat under a tree in the square by the cathedral  the afternoon was calm a thunderstorm that wet the streets had gone and an enervating damp heat brooded over the city after the fresh winds that sweep the woods and plains lister felt the languid air made him slack and dull his steamer did not sail until daybreak and since he had gone up the mountain and seen the cathedral and notre dame he did not know what to do the bench he occupied was in the shade and he smoked and looked about  cabs rolled up the street to the big hotel across the square and behind the trees the huge block of the cpr station cut the sky one heard whistles the rumble of heavy wheels and the tolling of locomotive bells pigeons flew down from the cathedral dome and searched the damp gravel  a group of foreign emigrants picnicked in the shade their clothes were old and greasy they carried big shapeless bundles and looked tired and worn lister could not guess their nationality but imagined they had known poverty and oppression in eastern europe it was obvious they had recently disembarked from a crowded steerage and waited for an emigrant train they were going west to the land of promise and lister wished them luck he and they were birds of passage and with all old landmarks left behind rested for a few hours on their journey  he studied the group the men looked dull and beaten the women had no beauty and had grown coarse with toil their faces were pinched and their shoulders bent only the children in spite of rags and dirt struck a hopeful note yet the forlorn strangers had pluck they had made a great adventure and might get their reward lister had seen others in the west who had made good breaking soil they owned and walking with the confident step of selfrespecting men on the plains stubborn labor was rewarded but one needed pluck to leave all one knew and break customs familiar but heavy yoke  by and by lister remembered he wanted to take his relations a few typically canadian presents he had seen nothing that satisfied him at winnipeg and had better look about the shops at montreal anyhow it would amuse him for an hour or two he got up went along the path for a few yards and then stopped  across the clanging of the locomotive bells and the roll of trolley cars at the bottom of the hill he heard sweet voices the music was faint and somehow ethereal as if it fell from a height one lost it now and then it came from the cathedral and lister stopped and listened he did not know what office was being sung but the jaded emigrants knew for a child got up and stood with bent head holding a greasy cap and a ragged womans face got gentle as she signed herself with the cross it looked as if the birds of passage had found a landmark in a foreign land lister was moved and gave the child a coin before he went off  he strolled east past notre dame towards the post office about which the stately banks and imposing office blocks stand this quarter of the city drew him for one saw how constructive talent and imagination could be used and he wondered whether england had new buildings like these sometimes one felt the western towns were raw and vulgar but one saw the bold canadian genius at its best in montreal  after a time he stopped in front of a shop in a short side street indian embroidery work and enameled silver occupied the window and although lister was not an artist he had an eye for line and knew the things were good the soft stained deerskin was cleverly embroidered he liked the warm colors of the enamel and going in was shown a tray of spoons  the shop shut in by high buildings was dark and smelt of aromatic wood and leather but a beam from a window pierced the gloom and sparkled on the silver this was emblazoned with the arms of the provinces the ship the wheatsheaves and the red maple leaf lister picked up the articles and while he did so was vaguely conscious that a girl at the opposite counter studied him he however did not look up until he had selected a few of the spoons and then he started  the light that touched the girls face did not illuminate it all her profile was sharp as an old daguerreotype he saw the flowing line from brow to chin drawn with something of austere classic beauty the arched lips and the faint indication of a gentlyrounded cheek the rest was in shadow and the contrast of light and gloom was like a rembrandt picture then the enameled spoons rattled as lister put down the tray he knew the picture when he last saw the girl her face was lighted like that by the blaze of a locomotive headlamp  ill take these things he said and crossed the floor  the girl moved back but he indicated a bundle of deerskin articles he thought her business was to sell her color was high he noted the vivid white and pink against the dull background of stained leather  what does one do with those bags he asked  theyre useful for keeping gloves and handkerchiefs she replied the pattern is worked in sinews but we have some with a neat colored embroidery she paused and signed to a saleswoman farther on will you bring this gentleman the revillon goods  listers object for stopping her was not very plain but he did not mean to let her go  please dont bother i expect to find something in this bundle he said to the approaching saleswoman then he turned to the girl in front let me look at the bag with the arrowhead pattern  she gave him the bag and although her glance was steady he knew she was embarrassed  if you will wrap it up ill keep this one he resumed i expect you have not forgotten me when i came into the shop i didnt imagine i should meet you but if youd sooner i went off ill go  i have not forgotten she admitted and her color faded and came back to her delicate skin  very well since i sail tonight on the allan boat its plain you neednt be afraid of my bothering you all the same we were partners in an adventure that ought to make us friends cant i meet you for a few minutes when you stop work  she hesitated and then gave him a searching glance  come to the fountain up the street in an hour this is my early evening  lister went off with the bag and spoons and when he returned to the fountain saw her crossing the square in front she was dressed like the shopgirls he had seen hurrying on board the street cars in the morning her clothes were pretty and fashionable but lister thought the material was cheap he felt she ought not to wear things like that while she advanced he studied her she was attractive in a way he had hardly remarked on board the train one rather noted her quick resolute movements the sparkle in her eyes and her keen vitality lister began to think he had unconsciously noted much  im going to take you to supper and you can send me off when you like afterwards he said and started across the square a famous restaurant was not far off  no she said as if she knew where he was going if i go with you it must be the tearooms i and my friends use she gave him a rather hard smile and added theres no use in my going where i dont belong  lister said nothing but while they walked across the town she talked with a brightness he thought forced and when they stopped at a small tearoom in a side street he frowned he was persuaded she did not belong there she was playing a part perhaps not very cleverly since he had found her out she wanted him to think her a shopgirl enjoying an evenings adventure her talk and careless laugh hinted at this but lister was not cheated  they went in the room was small and its ornamentation unusual imitation vines crawled about light wooden arches cutting up the floor space into quiet corners the room was rather dark but pink lamps shone among the leaves and the soft light touched the tables and clusters of artificial grapes lister thought the plan was well carried out for the grapes were the small red muskokas that grow in canada when he picked up the menu card he understood why girls from the stores and offices used the place  lister ordered the best supper the frenchcanadian landlady could serve and then began to talk while he helped his companion the corner they occupied was secluded and he owned that to sup with an attractive girl had a romantic charm he noted that she frankly enjoyed the food and he liked her light quick laugh and the sparkle in her eyes her thin summer clothes hinted at a slender finelylined form and her careless pose was graceful  he wondered whether she felt her meeting him was something of an adventure but he was persuaded she was playing a part her frankness was not bold the little frenchcanadian gestures were obviously borrowed and some of the colloquialisms she used were out of date except for these her talk was cultivated for a time lister tried to play up and then resolved to see if he could break her reserve  it looks as if you made malcolm all right on board the gravel train he remarked  she gave him a quick glance and colored yes i made it and got the eastbound express the engineer was kind i expect you told him he must help  when i put you on board the locomotive i knew roberts would see you out hes a sober fellow and has two girls as old as you  you dont know how old i am she said with an effort for carelessness  anyhow its plain you are young enough to be rash lister rejoined  she put down her cup and her glance was soft he saw she was not acting  i dont think i really was rashnot then its something to know when you can trust people and i did know  lister was embarrassed but her gentleness had charm he did not want her to resume her other manner then he was tempted to make an experiment  you know shillito got away  her lips trembled and the blood came to her skin but she fronted him bravely and he felt ashamed  yes she said i think i would sooner he had been caught but why did you begin to talk about shillito  perhaps i oughtnt im sorry  she studied him and he thought she pondered although it was possible she wanted to recover her calm  unless you are very dull you know something she resumed with an effort well i was rash but just before i saw you on the platform i found out all id risked i think i was desperate i meant to jump off the train only it was going fast and water shone under the bridge then you pushed me from the step and i felt i must make another plunge and try to get your help now im glad i did so but thats all  lister understood that the thing was done with she would tell him nothing more and he was sorry he had indulged his curiosity  oh well he said theres not much risk of my bothering you about the fellow again i start for england in a few hours  her glance got wistful she moved her plate and her hand trembled  you are english he resumed  i met you first on board a canadian train and now you find me helping at a montreal store isnt this enough why do you try to find out where i come from  im sorry all the same youre not a canadian  i am a canadian now she rejoined and then added as if she were resolved to talk about something else theres a mark on your forehead like a deep cut you hadnt got it when i saw you on the platform  no said lister i fell down some steps not long afterwards  she looked at him sharply and then exclaimed oh the newspapers said there was a struggle on the train somebody helped the police and got hurt it was you shillito knew you had meddled you got the cut for me  we agreed we wouldnt talk about shillito i got the cut because i didnt want to see a young police trooper knocked out people who meddle do get hurt now and then anyhow its some time since and i think well let it go suppose you tell me about montreal and your job at the store  she roused herself and began to talk lister thought it cost her something but she sketched her working companions with skill and humor she used their accent and their frenchcanadian gestures lister laughed and led her on although he got a hint of strain the girl was not happy and he had noted her wistful look when she talked about england at length she got up and stopping at the door for a moment gave him her hand  thank you i wish you bon voyage she said  cant we go somewhere else is there nothing doing at the theaters lister asked  no she said resolutely im going home anyhow im going where i live  lister let her go but waited watching her while she went up the street somehow she looked forlorn and he felt pitiful he remembered that he did not know her name which he had wanted to ask but durst not  when he returned to his hotel he stopped at the desk and gave the clerk a cigarette as a rule a canadian hotel clerk knows something about everybody of importance in the town  i bought some souvenirs at a curiosity depot he said and told the other where the shop was although they charged me pretty high the things looked good  you havent got stung the clerk remarked the folks are frenchcanadians but they like a square deal if you put up the money they put up the goods  the shop hands looked smart and bright if you study the sales people you can sometimes tell how a store is run  thats so those girls dont want to grumble theyre treated all right  oh well said lister since i dont know much about enameled goods and deerskin truck im glad ive not got stung  when he went off the other smiled for a hotel clerk is not often cheated and he thought he saw where listers remarks led lister however was strangely satisfied it was something to know the storekeepers were honest and kind to the people they employed    chapter x  vernons curiosity  silky blue lines streaked the long undulations that ran back to the horizon and the flaminian rolled with a measured swing when her bows went down the shining swell broke with a dull roar and rainbows flickered in the spray about her forecastle then while the long deck got level one heard the beat of engines and the grinding of screws a wake like an angry torrent foamed astern and in the distance where the dingy smokecloud melted the crags of labrador ran in faint broken line ahead an icefloe glittered in the sun the liner had left belle isle strait and was steaming towards greenland on the northern atlantic course  harry vernon occupied a chair on the saloondeck and read the montreal star which had been sent on board at rimouski the light reflected by the white boats and deck was strong he was not much interested and put down the newspaper when lister joined him they had met on the journey from winnipeg to montreal and on boarding the flaminian lister was given the second berth in vernons room vernon liked lister  take a smoke he said indicating a packet of cigarettes nothing fresh in the newspapers theyve caught the fellow porteous he was trying to steal across to detroit  lister sat down and lighted a cigarette porteous was a clerk who had not long since gone off with a large sum of his employers money  canada is getting a popular hunting ground for smart crooks it looks as if our business men were easily robbed  there are two kinds of business men one lot makes things the other buys and sells some of the first are pretty good manufacturers but stop at that they concentrate on manufacturing and hire a specialist to look after finance  but if the specialists a crook cant you spot him when he gets to work  as a rule the men who get stung know all about machines and material but nothing about bookkeeping vernon replied a bright accountant could rob one or two ive met when he was asleep for example there was shillito his employers were big and prosperous lumber people clever men at their job but shillito gambled with their money for some time before they got on his track i expect you read about him in the newspapers  lister smiled and pushing back his cap touched his forehead  i know something about shillito thats his mark  then you were the man he knocked out vernon exclaimed but he hasnt got your money why did you help the police  it isnt very obvious somehow i didnt like the fellow then you see the girl  the girl what had a girl to do with it  lister frowned he had not meant to talk about the girl and was angry because he had done so but did not see how he could withdraw his careless statement moreover vernon looked interested and it was important that both were typical canadians the young canadian is not subtle as a rule his talk is direct and at awkward moments he is generally marked by a frank gravity vernon was grave now and lister thought he pondered he had not known vernon long but he felt one could trust him  i met a girl on board the train he said she was keen about getting away from shillito  why did she want to get away  i dont know looked as if she was afraid of him when i first saw her she was on the car platform and i reckoned she was bracing herself to jump off since we were running across a trestle i pulled her from the steps thats how the thing began  but it didnt stop just then  it stopped soon afterwards lister replied she wanted to get off and go east the train was bound west but we were held up at a sidetrack and i put her on board a gravel train locomotive  then she went east said vernon thoughtfully and studied the other  lister sat with his head thrown back and the sun on his brown face his look was calm and frank his careless pose brought out the lines of his thin but muscular figure vernon felt he was honest he knew listers type  she went off on board our construction locomotive lister replied  but i dont see yet why did you meddle why did she give you her confidence  she didnt give me her confidence lister said and smiled she wanted to get away and i helped thats all its obvious i wasnt out for a romantic adventure because i put her off the train  vernon nodded listers argument was sound besides he did not look like a philanderer  then you dont know who she is  i dont know she didnt put me wise and my business was not to bother her  what was she like did you guess her age how was she dressed  lister lighted a fresh cigarette vernons keenness rather puzzled him but he thought he had told the fellow enough in fact he doubted if the girl would approve his frankness he was not going to state that he had met her at montreal anyhow not yet if vernon talked about the thing again and gave proper grounds for his curiosity he might perhaps satisfy him  she was young he answered vaguely attractive something of a looker i think i dont know much about womens clothes  oh well said vernon you helped her off and shillito found this out and got after you  he got after me when he saw he was corraled lister replied and narrated his struggle on the platform he was now willing to tell vernon all he wanted to know but saw the others interest was not keen and they presently began to talk about something else  what are you going to do in the old country vernon asked  i have no plans for a time i guess ill loaf and look about then i want to see my fathers folks whom i havent met  your father was english  why yes said lister smiling if you reckon up youll find a big proportion of the staunchest canadians parents came from the old country in fact i sometimes feel canada belongs to us and the boys of the sourdough stock between us we have given the country its stamp and made it a land for white men but well soon be forced to make good our claim if were slack well be snowed under by folks from eastern europe whose rules and habits are not ours  vernon nodded its a problem we have got to solve but are you going back to the railroad when you have looked about  im going back some time but now i have pulled out i want to see all i can id like to look at europe egypt and india  wandering around costs something vernon remarked  that is so my wads small but if ive not had enough when its used up ill look for a job if nothing else is doing ill go to sea  vernons smile was sympathetic and he looked ahead over the dipping forecastle to the far horizon the sea shone with reflected light and an iceberg glimmered against the blue he felt the measured throb of engines and the ship leap forward vernon was a young canadian and sprang from pioneering stock the vague distance called he felt the lure of going somewhere  if the thing was possible id go with you he said all the same im tied to business and the old man cant pull his load alone my jobs to stick to the traces and help him along but do you know much about the sea  i was engineer on board a pacific coasting boat and a wheat barge on the lakes  well said vernon thoughtfully i know an english shipping boss who might help you get a berth id rather like you to meet him but well talk about this again now lets join those fellows at deckquoits  their friendship ripened but it was not until the last day of the voyage vernon said something more about the english shipowner flaminian was steaming across the irish sea with the high blue hills of mourne astern and the manx rocks ahead vernon lounged on the saloondeck and his face was thoughtful as he looked across the shining water  well make liverpool soon after dark and if i can get the train i want ill pull out right then he said you allowed you might try a run on board an english ship before you went back  its possible said lister depends on how my wad holds out and on somebodys being willing to give me a post  vernon nodded thats where im leading he stopped and lister wondered why he pondered the thing did not seem worth the thought his companion gave it  i reckon you dont know cartwright of the independent freighters but he could put you wise about getting a ship vernon resumed im stopping for a week or two at his country house the freighters are small boats but cartwrights worth knowing in fact to know him is something of an education in the west were pretty keen business men and ive put across some smart deals at the winnipeg board of trade but ill admit cartwright would beat me every time where do you mean to locate  lister said he was going to the neighborhood of a small country town in the north of england and was puzzled by vernons start  that fixes it the things strangely lucky cartwrights country house is not far off you had better come along by my train soon after i arrive ill get mrs cartwright to ask you across  i mustnt bother your friends said lister besides i really dont know if i want to go to sea  all the same youll come over to carrock you ought to know cartwright and i reckon hell like to know you i have a notion you and he would make a good team  lister wondered whether vernon had an object for urging him to meet his friend but this looked ridiculous  whats cartwright like he asked carelessly  my notion is cartwrights unique you imagine hes something of a highbrow englishman rather formal and polite but he has an eye like a fishhawks and his orders go hair and mustache white you dont know if his clothes are old or new but you feel theyre exactly what he ought to wear thats cartwright so to speak on top but when you meet him you want to remember youre not up against a canadian were a straight type when were tough were very tough all the time when were cultivated you can see the polish shine in the old country its harder to fix where folks belong  you imply that you have got to know cartwright before you fix him  vernon laughed i havent quite fixed him yet at one time hes a sober gentleman of the stiff old school at another hes as rough as the roughest hobo ive met in the west i reckon hed beat a business crook at the others smartest trick but if youre out for a straight deal youll find cartwright straight  he went off to change some money and lister went to his cabin and began to pack his trunk when he came up they had passed the chicken rock and a long bright beam touched the sea astern in the east water and sky faded to dusky blue but presently a faint light began to blink as if it beckoned the light got brighter and gradually drew abeam the foaming wake glimmered lividly in the dark the beat of screws seemed quicker and lister thought the ship was carried forward by a stream of tide  other lights began to blink they stole out of the dark got bright and vanished and lister leaning on the rails felt they called him on one knew them by their colors and measured flashes they were beacons burning on a wellordered plan to guide the navigator but he did not know the plan in a sense this was important and he began to muse  now he would soon reach the old country he felt he had made a momentous plunge adventure called he knew canada and wanted something fresh but he wondered whether this was all perhaps the plunge had so to speak not been a thoughtless caprice in a sense things had led up to it and made it logical for example it might not have been for nothing he met the girl on the train and got hurt his hurt had kept him at winnipeg and stopping there had roused his discontent then he had met vernon who wanted him to know the english shipowner it was possible these things were like the flashes that leaped out of the dark he would know where they pointed when the journey was over then lister smiled and knocked out his pipe  when he went on deck again some time afterwards the ship was steering for a gap between two rows of twinkling lights they ran on closing on each other like electric lamps in a long street and in front the sky shone with a dull red glow it was the glimmer of a great port they were entering the mersey and he went off to get up his luggage  part iithe reckoning    chapter i  vernons plot  lister occupied the end of a slateflag bench on the lawn at carrock mrs cartwrights house in rannerdale rannerdale slopes to a lake in the north country and the old house stands among trees and rocks in a sheltered hollow the sun shone on its lichened front where a creeper was going red in the background birches with silver stems and leaves like showers of gold gleamed against somber firs across the lawn and winding road the tranquil lake reflected bordering woods and then long mountain slopes that faded from yellow and green to purple closed the view  while lister waited for the tea mrs cartwright had given him to cool he felt the charm of house and dale was strong perhaps it owed something to the play of soft light and shade for as a rule in canada all was sharply cut the english landscape had a strange elusive beauty that gripped one hard and melted as the fleecy clouds rolled by when the light came back color and line were as beautiful but not the same  there was no grass in canada like the sweep of smooth english turf and lister had not thought a house could give the sense of ancient calm one got at carrock since his boyhood he had not known a home his resting place had been a shack at a noisy construction camp a room at a crowded cheap hotel and a berth beside a steamers rattling engines then the shining silver on the teatable was something new he marked its beauty of line and the blue and gold and brown pattern on the delicate china he was almost afraid to touch in fact all at carrock was marked by a strange refinement and quiet charm  he liked his hosts mrs cartwright was large rather fat and placid but he felt the house and all it stood for were hers by rightful inheritance her son and daughter were not like that lister thought they had cultivated their wellbred serenity and by doing so had cultivated out some virile qualities of human nature grace hyslop had beauty but not much charm lister thought her cold and imagined her prejudices were strong and conventional mortimers talk and manners were colorlessly correct lister did not know yet if hyslop was a prig or not  cartwright was frankly puzzling he looked like a sober country gentleman and this was not the type lister had thought to meet his clothes were fastidiously good his voice had a level restrained note but his eye was like a hawks as vernon had said now and then one saw a twinkle of ironical amusement and some of his movements were quick and vigorous lister thought cartwrights blood was red  vernon lounging at the opposite end of the bench talked about a day hyslop and he had spent upon the rocks and rather struck a foreign note he had not hyslops graceful languidness he looked alert and highlystrung his thin face was too grave for carrock and his glance too quick lister listening to his remarks was surprised to note that hyslop was a bold mountaineer  oh well he said with a deprecatory smile when vernon stopped this small group of mountains is all the wild belt we have got and you like to find a stranger keen about your favorite sport then your keenness was flattering in your country with its lonely woods and rivers running to the north you have a field for strenuous sport and adventure  the woods pull vernon agreed all the same im a business man betting at the board of trade is my proper job and ive got to be satisfied with a week at a fishing camp now and then adventure is for the pioneers lumber men and railroad builders like my friend  lister looked up he did not see why vernon talked about him  my adventures dont count for much he said sometimes a car went into a muskeg and we had to hustle to dig her out sometimes the boys made trouble about their pay railroad building is often dull  i dont know if were all modest in canada but my partner is vernon observed if you want a romantic tale persuade him to tell you how he got the mark on his head  oh shucks said lister i had sooner you had cut that out he turned to the others apologetically it was a dispute with a fellow on board a train who threw me down the steps i dont want to bore you with the tale  the man was the famous crook shillito vernon remarked  cartwright lifted his head and looked at vernon hard then he looked at lister who felt embarrassed and angry he saw grace and mrs cartwright were curious and thought hyslops glance got keen  if it will not bother mr lister we would like to hear his narrative said cartwright quietly but lister got a hint of command  he narrated his adventure on the train and although he tried to rob the story of its romance was surprised when he stopped for a moment vernon was carelessly lighting a cigarette but lister saw his carelessness was forced when he got a light he crossed the grass as if he meant to throw the match over the hedge lister thought cartwright watched harry with dry amusement mrs cartwrights look was obviously disturbed but she had not altogether lost her calm one felt her calm was part of her but the hyslops was cultivated lister imagined it cost them something to use control  go on said cartwright rather sharply  lister resumed but presently cartwright stopped him  you imagined the girl was afraid of shillito what were your grounds  she was disturbed and declared she must get off the train i think she meant to jump off although we were going fast then she asked me if the conductor could be bribed to stop  perhaps we can take it for granted she wanted to get away from somebody why did you surmise the man was shillito  he came through the car afterwards as if he tried to find the girl and gave me a keen glance when he came back i thought him angry and disappointed by and by i had better grounds for imagining he suspected i had helped her  cartwright pondered but lister did not think he doubted it rather looked as if he weighed something carefully the lines on his face got deeper and his look was thoughtful  i understand the girl did not give you her name he said what was she like how was she dressed  lister was rather surprised to find he could not answer satisfactorily it was not the girls physical qualities but her emotions he had marked he remembered the pluck with which she had struggled against the fear she obviously felt her impulsive trust when he offered help and her relief when she got into the locomotive cab although he had studied her at montreal it was her effort to play a part that impressed him most  she was young and i think attractive he replied she wore a knitted cap and a kind of jersey a girl might use for boating i thought she came from a summer camp  cartwrights face was inscrutable but lister saw the others interest was keen mrs cartwrights eyes were fixed on him and he got a hint of suspense although grace was very quiet a touch of color had come to her skin as if she felt humiliated mortimers pose was stiff and his control over done then cartwright turned to his stepdaughter  have you told jones about the box of plants for liverpool  graces look indicated that she did not want to go but cartwrights glance was insistent and she got up lister looked about and saw vernon had not come back he was studying the plants in a border across the lawn when grace had gone cartwright asked  can you remember the evening of the month and the time when you first saw the girl  lister fixed the date and added it was nearly ten oclock the porter had just gone through the car and when he said my berth was ready i looked at my watch he went to the next pullman and i thought he was getting busy late  cartwright nodded and mortimer glanced at him sharply but next moment looked imperturbable mrs cartwrights relief however was obvious her face had become animated and her hands trembled  thank you said cartwright go on  lister narrated his putting the girl on board the gravel train and mrs cartwright interrupted  do you know if she had money  she had some enough to buy a ticket east  its strange said mrs cartwright and then exclaimed you mean you gave her some  oh well said lister awkwardly id seen her look at her purse and frown and as i helped her up the locomotive steps i pushed a few bills into her hand i dont think she knew they were paper money she was highlystrung and anxious to get off before shillito came along  mrs cartwright gave him a look that moved him her eyes shone and he knew she was his friend  the poor girl was strangely lucky when she met you she said  lister resumed his narrative but it was plain the climax had passed the others interest was now polite and he went on as fast as possible he had begun to see a light and wanted to finish and get away he did not however see that while he told his artless tale he had drawn his character when he stopped cartwright said  then you did not know her name  i dont know it yet said lister as coolly as he could but got embarrassed when he saw cartwrights smile  you dont imagine shillito rejoined her afterwards  no said lister firmly i think its impossible the gravel train was going east and when the police boarded the cars we had run some distance west he stopped for a moment because he saw he was very dull if his supposition were correct there was something the others ought to know besides he resumed i met her not long since at montreal  at montreal mrs cartwright exclaimed  at a shop where they sold souvenirs lister replied i didnt expect to meet her i went in to buy some enameled things it was a pretty good shop and the hotel clerk declared the people were all right she knew me and we went to a tearoom she left me at the door and i think thats all  he got up i dont know if i have bored you but i felt you wanted me to talk now i must get off and i want to see harry before i go  mr vernon does not seem to be about cartwright remarked with some dryness ill go to the gate with you  mrs cartwright gave lister her hand and her glance was very kind you will come back so long as you stop here i hope you will feel our house is open to you  hyslop got up but cartwright stopped him with a sign he was quiet while they crossed the lawn but when they reached the wood by the road he said i imagine you know we owe you much after a time your efforts to use some tact were rather obvious well the girl you helped is my stepdaughter  at the beginning i did not know this lister declared  it was plain said cartwright well i agree with her motherbarbara was very lucky when she met you but since you look embarrassed well let this go did she repay your loan  she wanted to pay me said lister i refused  why cartwright asked looking at him hard  lister hesitated for one thing i didnt know the sum then i knew her wages were not high you ought to see i couldnt take the money  you ought to have taken the money for the girls sake  oh said lister i think she knew i didnt refuse because i wanted her to feel she owed me something  its possible she did know said cartwright dryly you must try to remember the sum when you come again now i want the name of the shop at montreal  lister told him and added you mean to write to miss hyslop  cartwright smiled im going across as soon as possible to bring my stepdaughter home    chapter ii  barbaras return  when lister had gone cartwright returned to the teatable and looked at hyslop who got up and went off hyslop did not altogether want to go but he had cultivated discretion and it was plain his stepfather meant to get rid of him then cartwright gave his wife a sympathetic glance mrs cartwright was calm but when she put some cups together her hand shook  leave the things alone said cartwright in a soothing voice vernons plot was clever  do you think harry planned that lister should tell us  it looks like that said cartwright dryly he was keen about bringing his friend over but was cautious enough to wait until the fellow began to know us when he talked about listers adventures i wondered where he was leading the other was puzzled and didnt see until near the end  but why didnt harry himself tell us all he knew  vernons a good sort and more fastidious than one thinks he saw hed be forced to venture on rather awkward ground and there was some doubt he wanted us to weigh the story and judge if the clew he gave us ought to be followed this was not vernons job although i think he was satisfied  but you are satisfied  yes said cartwright listers portrait of barbara was lifelike and his own was pretty good i think he drew himself and her better than he knew and perhaps its lucky we have to deal with fellows like these a good canadian is a fine type however we must bring barbara back  ah said mrs cartwright i want her back one must hide ones hurt but to hide it is hard she pulled herself up and added will you send a cablegram  i think not the girl is proud and as wild as a hawk she thinks she has humiliated us and if shes startled shell probably run away  you dont think she has humiliated us mrs cartwright said in a hesitating voice  cartwright smiled its plain that her escapade must not be talked about but we can trust these canadians and i know barbara in a sense listers narrative wasnt necessary the girl is headstrong but i was persuaded she would find the rascal out looks as if she did so soon after they got on board the cars and i imagine shillito had an awkward few moments barbaras temper is not mild then its important that she was desperately anxious to escape from him theres no more to be said  mrs cartwright gave him a grateful look her husband had never failed her and he had justified her trust again  if you dont send a cablegram how shall we get barbara back  ill go myself said cartwright if she cant be persuaded ill bring her by force its lucky i can charge the cost to the office the new wheat is coming down to montreal and the conference people have a plan to get it all but i expect to beat them and engage some cargo for our boats before the st lawrence freezes however since im going i must get to work  he started for the house and met his stepson at the porch mortimer looked thoughtful and held an unlighted cigarette cartwright studied him with scornful amusement  have you been speculating about the proper way of handling an awkward situation  i have been talking to grace hyslop replied in an even voice  i rather think grace has been talking to you but expect you agreed you have no doubt decided the best plan is to leave your headstrong sister alone  we did agree about something like that said hyslop coolly although when cartwright fixed his eyes on his he turned his head we thought if barbara were given an allowance she might for example stay with the vernons graces notion  cartwrights mouth got hard and his mustache bristled when he was moved his urbanity vanished and his talk was very blunt  well let graces notion go my form is not my stepchildrens but i try to moderate my remarks about women well admit grace is a woman although i sometimes doubt anyhow you are not a man you havent a drop of warm blood in your veins youre a curled and scented fine ladys lapdog pup  i dont see much use in talking about my qualities sir  you dont see cartwright agreed thats your drawback you see nothing thats rude and human youre afraid to look all thats obvious is barbara must not come home to throw an awkward reflection on graces puritanical virtue people might find out something and talk if anybody talks while im about ill ram the implication down his throat you dont see or perhaps you dont mind the drawbacks to separating barbara from her mother and banishing her from home shes trustful rash and fiery and not a statue like grace anyhow barbara is coming back and if you dont approve ill expect you to be resigned now get off before i let myself go  hyslop went one gained nothing by arguing with a brute like cartwright and since mrs cartwrights infatuation for her husband could not be disturbed hyslop knew he must acquiesce cartwright rather braced by the encounter went to the library and wrote some letters to liverpool a few days afterwards he packed his trunk and was driven to the station in mrs cartwrights car grace got up an hour earlier than usual in order to see him off and when she brought his scarf and gloves cartwright accepted her ministrations with politeness although he knew she disapproved of him she thought her duty was to do things like this and he played up  when the throb of the car was getting faint she met mortimer going to the lake he stopped and looked up at the valley which was streaked by a thin line of dust  for three or four weeks well be undisturbed he said i admit i like carrock better when my stepfather is away  barbaras coming back with him grace remarked in some ways her return will be awkward but perhaps she ought to come  mortimer gave her a surprised glance this was not your view  oh well i have been thinking barbara is rash and very young in canada she would be free from all control and one must not weigh drawbacks against ones duty perhaps cartwright takes the proper line although of course it costs him nothing you didnt tell me what he said the other evening  mortimer shrugged as a rule my stepfathers remarks wont bear restating he was a little franker than usual  he is coarse said grace one feels he gets coarser as if his thoughts had begun to react on his body there is a link and of course with his habits  i rather think you mean with his appetites cartwright does not often let himself go when hes at home but when he is away hes another man  grace looked thoughtful one likes restraint all the same i sometimes think rude primitive people have a vigor we have not its strange but indulgence seems to go with force one feels our friends are rather bloodlessim using cartwrights phrase  our canadian friends are not bloodless i expect you have remarked that barbaras the type they like  she has an appeal for men like that grace agreed and mused  it was hard to own but she began to see that when she thought barbara ought to stop in canada she was inspired by jealousy barbaras charm for men was strong and when she was about they left grace alone still she had a vague perception that her sisters charm was not altogether physical she herself had a classical beauty that did not mark the younger girl it looked as if barbara had attractive qualities that were not hers lister for example was not a brute like cartwright but it was plain that barbara had attracted him grace approved his soberness and frank gravity and then she pulled herself up she must not be jealous about her sister  cartwrights power is stronger because he does not use our money mortimer resumed i dont know if it was cleverness or scruples that urged him to refuse all the same if he were forced to ask mothers help his influence would be less  but his needing help is not probable hes managing owner of the line  mortimer smiled he gets a commission on the boats earnings but does not hold many shares then the fleet is small and the boats dont earn very much things are not going smoothly and some shareholders would like to put cartwright off the board at the last meeting one fellow talked about the need for fresh blood however i expect cartwrights clever enough to keep off the rocks and when one cant get rid of a drawback one must submit  lighting a cigarette he started for the lake and grace returned thoughtfully to the house mortimer hated cartwright and grace admitted he had some grounds although her brother was indolent and philosophical he did not forget rude disputes jarred him but if by some chance he was able to injure the other grace thought he would do so grace herself strongly disapproved of cartwright all the same he was her stepfather and she had tried to cultivate her sense of duty she was prejudiced cold and censorious but she meant to be just and did not like mortimers bitterness  cartwright was occupied for some time at montreal and the birch leaves had fallen when he returned the evening was dark and chilly mist rolled down the dale but a big fire burned in the hall at carrock and tall lamps threw a cheerful light on the oak paneling a flooded beck roared in the hollow of a ghyll across the lawn and its turmoil echoed about the hall mrs cartwright stood by the fire grace moved restlessly about and mortimer appeared to be absorbed by the mornings news  i wish you would sit down mother he said presently you can hear the car you know and the train is often late  for a few minutes mrs cartwright did not move and then she started and fixed her eyes on the door she heard an engine throb there was a noise in the porch and a cold wind blew into the room then the door opened and cartwright entered shaking the damp from his fur coat he turned beckoning somebody behind and barbara came out from the arch her face was flushed her eyes were hard and she stopped irresolutely mortimer advanced to take the coat she carried and grace crossed the floor but barbara waited as if she did not see them then her strained look vanished for mrs cartwright went forward with awkward speed and took her in her arms  cartwright saw his wife had forgotten him and turning to the others with a commanding gesture drove them and the servants from the hall when they had gone he gave mrs cartwright a smile  ive brought her back he said not altogether an easy job barbaras ridiculous but she can fight  he went off and barbara clung to her mother she was shaking and her breath came hard  you were ridiculous said mrs cartwright in a gentle voice i expect you were very obstinate but he was kind  hes a dear i love him barbara replied he understands everything i think he ought to have stopped at liverpool the secretary met us and talked about some business but if he hadnt come with me i could not have borne  she stopped and resting her head on mrs cartwrights shoulder began to cry mrs cartwright said nothing but kissed and soothed her with loving gentleness  when some time afterwards barbara came down the stairs that occupied one side of the hall she was composed but tea by the fire was something of a strain it was plain that graces careless talk was forced and mortimers efforts to keep on safe ground were marked now and then cartwrights eyes twinkled and barbara thought she knew why he sometimes made a joke that jarred the others when the meal was over he took them away  i imagine your sister understands grace and you are willing to take her back and forget the pain she gave you he said to hyslop your handling of the situation was tactful and correct but you can leave her to her mother  mrs cartwright stopped with barbara who brought a footstool to the hearthrug and sitting down leaned against her knee  i have been an obstinate selfish romantic fool she broke out  mrs cartwright touched her hair and smiled for she felt comforted this was the tempestuous barbara she thought she had lost  my dear she said its not important since you have come back  i oughtnt to have come back if you had not sent father i would not have come hes determined but hes gentle you know he sympathizes  although i wanted him to go i did not send him mrs cartwright replied he went because he loves you but we can talk about this again she hesitated for a moment and went on it was not long i think before you found shillito was a thief mr listers story indicated this  a wave of color came to barbaras skin but she looked up and her eyes flashed  at the beginning i did not know he was a thief i found out he was a cunning brute afterwards when i read about his escape in the newspapers i rather wished the trooper who shot at him had not missed she shook with horror and anger and it was a moment or two before she resumed i cant tell you all mother i was frightened but anger gave me pluck he said i must stick to him because i could not go back i think i struck him and then i ran away people were going to their berths in the pullman and he durst not use force when i got to the car platform and was going to jump off i saw mr listerbut he has told you  mrs cartwright nodded for she was satisfied  my dear she said its done with still i wonder why you were willing to leave us  sometimes i wonder to begin with i have owned i was a fool but things were dreary and i wanted a thrill then i had begun to feel nobody at home wanted me father and you were kind but he seemed to think me an amusing willful child grace always disapproved and mortimer sneered they knew i was not their sort and very proper people are cruel if you wont obey their rules i hated rules graces correctness made me rebel then louis came and declared i was all to him he was handsome and romantic and i was tired of restraint i thought i loved him but it was ridiculous because i hate him now mortimers a prig but louis is a brute  mrs cartwright sighed she liked tranquillity and the girls passion jarred she tried to soothe her and presently barbara asked in a level voice where is harry vernon  he went to town a few days since  when he knew i would soon arrive his going is significant i shall hate harry next  you must not be unjust i imagine he thought to meet him would embarrass you  it would have embarrassed me but harry would not have known barbara declared if i have been a fool i can pay still i ought to have stayed in canada fathers obstinate and i wanted to come home but things will be harder than at montreal  mrs cartwright kissed her my poor child the hurt is not as deep as you think we will try to help you to forget    chapter iii  lister clears the ground  the sun was on the rocks and the lichen shone in rings of soft and varied color blue shadows filled the dale which from the side of the buttress looked profoundly deep a row of young men and women followed a ledge that crossed the face of the steep crag mortimer hyslop leading a girl and vernon a few yards behind lister and barbara farther off  hyslop knew the rocks and was a good leader he was cool and cautious and did not undertake a climb until he was satisfied about his companions powers the slanting edge looked dangerous but was not although one must be steady and there was an awkward corner at the turning the ledge got narrow and one must seize a knob and then step lightly on a stone embedded in mossy soil  when they reached the spot hyslop stopped and told vernon what to do the girl immediately behind him was a clever mountaineer they went round and lister watched from a few yards off for a moment or two each in turn supported by one foot with body braced against the rock grasped the knob and vanished round the corner it was plain one must get a firm hold but lister thought this was all he was used to the tall skeleton trestles that carried the rails across canadian ravines  after the others disappeared lister seized the knob he thought the stone he stood on moved and he cautiously took a heavier strain on his arm he could get across but he obeyed an impulse and gave the stone a push it rolled out and when he swung himself back to the ledge plunged down and smashed upon the rocks below for a few moments the echoes rolled about the crags and then hyslop shouted are you all right can you get round  lister said he thought not and hyslop replied that it did not matter barbara would take him up a grassy ridge and the others would meet them at the top a rattle of nailed boots indicated that he was going off and lister turned and glanced at barbara she had sat down on an inclined slab and her figure and face in profile cut against the sky a yard or two beneath her the sloping rock vanished at the top of a steep pitch and one saw nothing but the crags across the narrow dale yet lister thought the girl was not disturbed  i expect i was clumsy he apologized  well she said it looks like that  he gave her a quick glance and pondered although he had gone to carrock since she came home she had been strangely cold and so to speak aloof he had imagined their meeting might embarrass her but she was not embarrassed in fact she had met him as if he were a friend but he had not seen her afterwards unless somebody was about now he meant to force her to be frank  i was clumsy he resumed all the same when i felt the stone begin to move i might have pulled myself across by my hands i expect the block would have been firm enough to carry you  yes i know said barbara you didnt want me to get across  lister studied her he doubted if it was altogether exertion that had brought the blood to her skin and given her eyes the keen sparkle clinging to the rock with the shadowy gulf below she looked strangely alert and virile her figure cut against the sky he noted its slenderness and finelydrawn lines she was not angry although he had admitted he pushed down the stone but he felt as if something divided them and doubted if he could remove the obstacle  i wanted to talk and had found i could not get near you unless the others were about he said it looked as if i had unconsciously given you some grounds for standing me off well i suppose i did put your relations on your track  it wasnt that said barbara i imagine harry vernon helped you there you were forced to tell your story  i was forced all the same i think harrys plan was good  he went away a few days before i arrived barbara remarked  lister thought he saw where she led and knitted his brows he was on awkward ground and might say too much but to say nothing might be worse  harrys a good sort and i expect he pulled out because he imagined youd sooner he did so he said for all that i reckon he ought to have stayed  although her color was vivid barbara gave him a searching glance in order to imply i had no grounds for embarrassment if i met him harry was at the camp in the woods  he knew you had no grounds for embarrassment lister declared i knew and harrys an older friend  barbara turned her head and when she looked back lister thought his boldness was justified in a sense she had been very frank although perhaps this situation made for frankness they were alone on the face of the towering crag all was very quiet but for the noise of falling water and the only living object one could see was a buzzard hovering high up at a white clouds edge one could talk in the mountain solitude as one could not talk in a drawingroom for all that lister felt he had not altogether broken the girls reserve  one envies men like you who build railways and sail ships she said and now lister wondered where she led you live a natural life knowing bodily strain and primitive emotions sometimes youre exhausted and sometimes afraid your thoughts fixed on the struggle youre keenly occupied isnt it like that  something like that lister agreed sometimes the strain gets monotonous  but its often thrilling men and women need to be thrilled people talk about the modern lust for excitement but it isnt modern and i expect the instincts sound civilization that gives us hot water before we get up and food we didnt grow is not all an advantage our bodies get soft and were driven back on our emotions where we want action we get talk then one gets up against the rules you mustnt be angry you mustnt be sincere you must use a dreary level calm  lister was puzzled and said nothing but barbara went on perhaps some girls like this others dont and now and then rebel we feel were human we want to live adventure calls us as it calls you we want to front lifes shocks and storms unsatisfied curiosity drives us on then perhaps romance comes and all the common longings of flesh and blood are transfigured  she stopped and lister began to see a light this was her apology for her rashness in canada all she would give and he doubted if she had given as much to others on the whole he thought the apology good  romance cheats one now and then he remarked and pulled himself up awkwardly but barbara was calm  i wonder whether it always cheats one  i think not he said sometimes one must trust ones luck and venture all the same philosophizing is not my habit and when i didnt step lightly on the stone  you mean when you pushed the stone down barbara interrupted  oh well anyhow i didnt mean to philosophize i wanted to find out why you kept away from me  although you knew why i did so you admitted you knew why harry went off  i see ive got to talk said lister shillito was a cheat but when you found him out you tried to jump off the train you let me help because i think you trusted me  i did trust you its much to know my trust was justified for one thing it looks as if i wasnt altogether a fool  afterwards when i met you at montreal you were friendly although you tried to persuade me you were a shop girl  barbara smiled i was a shop girl besides you were a stranger and its sometimes easy to trust people one does not expect to see again  my plans to trust the people i like all the time lister replied when i found you on the car platform i knew i ought to help i saw you meant to escape from something mean then at montreal it was plain you were trying in make good because you were proud and would not go back i liked that although i thought you were not logical well i told your story because vernon bluffed me but if id known your stepfather as i know him now id have told the tale before  then it was in order that i might understand this you sent the stone down the crag  i think it was said lister i hope i have so to speak cleared the ground  barbara gave him a puzzling smile youre rather obvious but its important you mean to be nice however i expect the others are waiting for us and we must join them although we wont go by the grass ridge she indicated the slope of cracked rock in front the hold is pretty good do you think you can get up  lister doubted he was athletic and steady but the climb looked awkward for a beginner  if you are going ill try  you imagine you can go where i can go  something like that lister admitted if im beaten youre accountable and will have to help  he was satisfied by barbaras frank laugh her mood was changeable not long since he had with awkward sympathy thought her a proud humiliated woman now she was marked by the humor of a careless girl he could however play up to her later mood and when they set off he began to joke  the rock slanted and cracks and breaks gave a firm hold but there was not a crack wherever one was needed and the pitch was steep then in places the slabs were slippery with wet lichen and listers ordinary walking boots could get no grip his jokes stopped and the sweat began to dew his face his breath got hard and he felt his heart beat it was obvious that climbing needed study  for all that he went on and found a strange delight in watching barbara her clothes harmonized with the soft colors of lichen and stone her movements were confident and light he got no sense of effort her pose was seldom strained and the lines of her limbs and body flowed in easy curves he thought she rather flitted than labored up the rock practice no doubt accounted for much but something was due to temperament barbara did not hesitate she trusted her luck and went ahead  at length she stopped pressed against the stone in the hollow of a gully while lister crept obliquely across a long wet slab he looked up and saw her face finely colored after effort against a background of green and gold the berries on a small mountainash in a cranny harmonized with the carmine of her skin she looked down and smiled with careless amusement  then listers foot slipped and he could get no hold for his hands his smooth boots drew a greasy line across the wet slab as he slid down perhaps the risk was not very daunting but he knew he must not roll down far at the bottom of the slab he brought up with his foot braced against a knob and he saw barbara coming after him when she stopped her glance was apologetic  i forgot you hadnt proper boots give me your hand and try again  no thanks said lister do you think im going to let you pull me up  why not she asked with a twinkle  to begin with im obstinate and dont mean to be beaten by a bit of greasy rock then i expect im heavier than you think  youre ridiculously proud it would hurt to let a girl help barbara rejoined after all youre a conventionalist and i rather thought you were not  anyhow im going up myself lister declared  he got up but his clothes gathered some slime from the rock and his skin was stained by soil and moss barbara looked at him with a twinkle  your obstinacy cost you something she remarked if youre tired you had better stop and smoke  lister lighted a cigarette she had been rather keen about rejoining the others but he thought she had forgotten barbaras carelessness gave her charm perhaps he ought to go on but he meant to take the extra few minutes luck had given him  im really sorry i forgot about your boots and brought you up the rock she said  i wonder why you did bring me up  oh well a number of the men i know have a comfortable feeling of superiority of course nice men dont make you feel this but its there one likes to give such pride a jolt  i think i see if its some comfort ill own you can beat me going up awkward rocks but where does this take us  barbara smiled it takes us some distance when you admit a girls your equal friendships easier you know one reason mortimer and i cant agree is his feeling of superiority is horribly strong  couldnt you take him up an awkward gully and get him stuck  no said barbara in a regretful voice hes really a good cragsman and knows exactly how far he can go when he starts an awkward climb he reckons up all the obstacles and is ready to get round them when they come the plans good people like mortimer dont get stuck  its possible but i expect they miss something now and then there isnt much thrill in knowing you are safe  sometimes you play up rather well barbara remarked  im not playing up im preaching my code im not as sober and cautious as you perhaps think  for example  youll probably get bored but in canada i turned down a pretty good job because it was monotonous i wanted something fresh and thought id go across and see the old country well im here and alls charming but i dont know how ill get back when my wad runs out  ah said barbara you mean your money will soon be gone but you have relations somebody would help  its possible but i would refuse lister rejoined youre not adventuring much when another meets the bill when my wallets empty ill pull out and take any old job the chances are ill go to sea  barbara gave him an approving glance she had known but one other adventurer and he was a rogue lister was honest and she thought he would go far she liked his rashness but if he found it hard to get on board ship she imagined she could help all the same she would not talk about this yet  we really must go she said and they started up a gully where holes and wedged stones helped them up like steps  when they left the gully they saw a group of people on the neighboring summit of the hill and for a moment lister stopped  we have had a glorious climb he said now its over i hope youre not going to stand me off again  barbara gave him a curious smile one cant stop on the mountains long were going down to the everyday level and all looks different there  the others began to wave to them and crossing a belt of boggy grass they joined the group when they returned to carrock cartwright was not about and mrs cartwright said he had got a telegram calling him to liverpool    chapter iv  a dissatisfied shareholder  cartwright had read the mornings letters and the journal of commerce and finding nothing important turned his revolving chair to the fire he had been forced to wait for a train at a draughty station and his feet were cold his office occupied an upper floor of an oldfashioned building near the docks fog from the river rolled up the street and the windows were grimed by soot but cartwright had not turned on the electric light the fire snapped cheerfully and he lighted his pipe and looked about  the furniture was shabby the carpet was getting threadbare and some of the glass in the partition that cut off the clerks office was cracked cartwright had thought about modernizing and decorating the rooms but to do the thing properly would cost five hundred pounds and money was scarce besides a number of the merchants who shipped goods by his boats were conservative and rather approved his keeping the parsimonious rules of the old school  the house was old and had been at one time rich and powerful cartwrights father however had used sailing ships too long and cartwrights speculations and extravagance when he took control had not mended its fortunes then had come a number of lean years when few shipping companies earned a dividend and the lines capital steadily melted now the shareholders were not numerous and the ships were small  cartwright glanced at the pictures in tarnished gold frames oreana drawn plunging across an atlantic comber was the best of the fleet but her engineer had for some time demanded new boilers since the reserve fund was low and other boats needed expensive repairs cartwright resolved to wait he had bought melphomene above the fireplace very cheap but her engines were clumsy compounds and she cost much to coal still she was fast and now and then got a paying load by reaching a port where freights were high before the conference found out that cartwright meant to cut the rates  titania with the white deckhouse and shadedeck carried a good load on a light draught and sometimes picked up a profitable cargo in shallow african lagoons when he glanced at her picture cartwrights look got thoughtful she was one of two sister ships launched at a famous yard and cartwright had wanted both but the builders demanded terms of payment he could not meet and another company had bought the vessel she was wrecked soon afterwards and now lay buried in the sand by an african river bar the salvage company had given up their efforts to float her but cartwright imagined she could be floated if one were willing to run a risk but no one it seemed was willing on the failure of the salvage company the underwriters had put the steamer into the hands of messrs bull and morse a firm of ship brokers and marine auctioneers but at the public auction no bids whatever had been made subsequently advertisements appeared in the shipping papers inviting offers for the ship as she lay and for the salvage of the cargo these had run for several weeks but without result cartwright had cut them out now and then he looked at them and speculated about the undertaking  by and by the bookkeeper came in and filed some letters gavins hair was going white and he had been with cartwrights since he was a boy he was fat redfaced and humorous although his humor was not refined gavin liked to be thought something of a sport but cartwright knew he was staunch  you imagine mrs seaton will look me up this morning cartwright said presently  yes sir she called and demanded to see you in fact i think she doubted when i told her you hadnt come back from the north she said the shareholders meeting would be soon and she expected you to give a bigger dividend the blue funnel people had paid five per cent if you didnt return before long she might run up to carrock so i sent the telegram  cartwright nodded he trusted his bookkeeper who had grounds for imagining it was not altogether desirable mrs seaton should arrive at carrock  have you heard anything from manners while i was away  nothing direct sir his nephew hatton came round with a tender for the bunker coal and implied that he ought to get the job then i had a notion mrs seaton so to speak was primed looked as if somebody had got at her her arguments about the dividend were rather good  its possible said cartwright dryly if she comes you can show her in but what about the wine  i dont know if it will see you out theres not a great deal left and last time  cartwrights eyes twinkled exactly send for another bottle and see you get the proper stuff some of the biscuits too you know the kind rather a bother but perhaps the best plan  safer than going out to lunch gavin remarked then in the office youre on your own ground that counts  gives you moral support and handicaps an antagonist whos not a business man cartwright suggested well perhaps it does so but i see some drawbacks anyhow get the wine  gavin went off and cartwright mused by the fire the morning was raw and foggy and if he went out the damp might get at his throat moreover gavin would reply to his letters cartwright had begun to feel it was time to let others work while he looked on his control counted for less than he had thought things went without much guidance and it was enough to give them a push in the proper direction now and then to rouse himself for an effort was getting harder and he would have been satisfied to rest had not his pride and to some extent his stepchildrens antagonism prevented his doing so he needed money and would not use his wifes  one must pay for old extravagances and the bills were coming in mrs seatons expected call was an example ellen was a widow but before she married seaton cartwright knew she counted him her lover they were alike in temperament rash strongwilled and greedy for all that gave life a thrill in fact ellen was a stimulating comrade but not the kind of girl one married cartwright married clara and knew mrs seaton bore him a lasting grudge  since seaton was a merchant whose investments in liverpool were numerous it was perhaps not strange he left his widow shares that gave her some control of the cartwright line although she was not poor she was greedy and extravagant in fact cartwright imagined greed was now her ruling passion  by and by he heard steps in the passage behind the partition and thought he knew the tap of highheeled shoes then he heard a laugh and gavins voice ellen was using her charm on his bookkeeper and the old sport would play up the door opened the room smelt of violets and mrs seaton came in she was tall and her furs gave her large figure a touch of dignity her color was sharply white and red and in the rather dim light her skin was like a girls cartwright knew ellen was younger than he but not very much  you look hipped and rather slack tom she said when he got up and gavin fetched a chair  i feel the cold and damp cartwright replied then managing a trampsteamship line when freights are low is a wearing job  mrs seaton took off her coat your office is shabby and climbing all those stairs is a pull why dont you launch out get a lift and modernize things  my trouble is to keep the boats supplied with coal and stores besides you see i dont often use my office for a drawingroom  youre very cautious mrs seaton remarked with a laugh you start to get on guard before i begin my attack  oh well said cartwright smiling i know your power but would you like a cigarette  she took the curiouslydecorated box he gave her and broke the seal since you dont smoke these things tom you were rather nice to remember  you had better take the box said cartwright i sent for a few when titania went to the levant one understands theyre hard to get in england but i have something else you like if you will wait a moment  he rang a bell and gavin entered carrying two small glasses a bottle and some biscuits when he went out cartwright turned the bottle so mrs seaton could see the label  climbing our stairs is a fag he said and filled the glasses  mrs seaton smiled and took hers cartwright saw her rings sparkle and the gleam of her regular white teeth the reflection from the grate touched her hair and it shone a smooth goldenbrown he admitted with amusement that ellen was nearly as attractive as he had thought her thirty years since  this is like old times tom she said i remember evenings when you brought me sandwiches and iced cup at a dancebut i dont think you were ever remarkably romantic  cartwright remembered an evening when they sat under a shaded lamp in a quiet corner of a supper room listening to music that somehow fired ones blood but perhaps it was the iced cup he had generously drunk all the same he had not been a fool though he was tempted he knew something about ellen then but he knew her better now perhaps it was typical that she had promptly put the box of eastern cigarettes in her muff  managing ships is not a romantic occupation he rejoined  anyway your welcomes kind and i feel shabby because im forced to bother you but suppose some of your customers arrive  we shall not be disturbed said cartwright smiling gavin knows his job  very well do you expect to declare a better dividend at the shareholders meeting  i do not if im lucky i may keep the dividend where it is but i dont know yet  two per cent is really nothing mrs seaton remarked ive been forced to study economy and you know how i hate to pinch besides i know an investment that would give me eight per cent  then if youre satisfied the venture is not risky you ought to buy the shares  i want to buy but its a small private company and the people stipulate i must take a large block i have not enough money  cartwright doubted but her plan was obvious when trade is slack one ought to be careful about investing in a private company that pays eight per cent he said after all it might be prudent to be satisfied with a small profit  but im not satisfied and your dividend is remarkably small are you really unable to make it larger  one cant pay dividends out of capital anyhow one cant keep it up for long  then as i mean to make a plunge i must sell some of the investments that dont earn me much my shares in the line carry a good number of votes and if people grumble at the meeting would give you some control will you buy them tom  cartwright knitted his brows he thought her hint about the shares giving him useful power was significant in fact it looked as if somebody had put ellen on his track he wondered whether manners but she must not think him disturbed  what is your price he asked  my price she said with a puzzled look he thought well done of course i want the sum the shares stand for  im sorry its impossible just now the shares of very few shipping companies are worth their face value for example fivepound shares in a good line were not long since offered at two pounds ten  mrs seaton looked disturbed thats dreadful she exclaimed but im not rich enough to bear a heavy loss and if you bought my lot the voting power would enable you to break the grumblers opposition theyre worth more to you than anybody else cant you help me  cartwright gave her a smiling glance although he was bothered ellen was not a fool and he noted her insistence on the value of the shares to him where this led was obvious he had one or two powerful antagonists and knew of plots to force his retirement ellen had given him his choice he must promise a larger dividend or buy her shares at something over their market price this of course was impossible but he imagined she did not know how poor he was  i cant buy he said i must trust my luck and fighting power although we have had stormy meetings and rates are bad the line is running yet  if you havent enough money why dont you ask your wife shes rich and hasnt risked much of her capital in the line  that is so cartwright agreed ellen meant to be nasty but he must be cool although my wife is rich i dont use her money  youre not logical and sometimes your fastidiousness isnt very marked however it looks as if you didnt marry because clara was rich she was romantic before she began to get fat  cartwrights face got red he had had enough and saw ellen was getting savage she had not forgotten that in a sense he ought to have married her and since he would not buy her shares she would no doubt help his antagonists crossing the floor he poked the fire noisily  shall i give you some more wine he asked and while he was occupied with the glasses the telephone bell rang behind the partition a few moments afterwards gavin came in  moreton has rung up sir if you can give him five minutes hell come across he says its important  mrs seaton put on her coat i mustnt stop when an important customer is coming then she laughed and gave cartwright her hand you are very obstinate tom but i know your pluck  she went off gavin took away the wine and cartwright opened the window the smell of violets vanished but when he sat down again he pondered he knew mrs seaton and thought she meant to hint his pluck might soon be needed when ellen smiled like that she was plotting something    chapter v  cartwrights scruples  the drawingroom at mrs cartwrights house on the cheshire side of the mersey was large and oldfashioned cartwright thought the stiff thick curtains and victorian walnut furniture ugly but mrs cartwright liked the things and he was satisfied clara herself frankly belonged to the old school she was conventional and often dull but she had a placid dignity that did not mark all the uptodate women cartwright knew moreover the house was comfortable one got there by the mersey tunnel and it was only a few minutes walk from the station for all that the encroaching town had not yet reached the neighborhood and the windows commanded a pleasant view of clean rolling country and the blue welsh hills  cartwright felt the house was a snug harbor where he could rest when he was too old and battered to front the storms that had for some time been gathering and sitting by the fire one evening he speculated about the rocks and shoals ahead all the same the time to run for shelter was not yet he thought he could ride out another gale  an arch with heavy molding occupied the middle of the spacious room the folding doors had been removed and curtains partly screened the arch on the other side a group of young men and women stood about the piano on cartwrights side the lights were low he had dined well and liked to loaf after dinner besides he felt dull his gout bothered him and he had been forced to run for his train he had begun to find out one could not do that kind of thing mrs cartwright sat opposite knitting quietly and her smooth rhythmic movements were soothing clara was never abrupt and jerky  i got a letter from stormonts by the afternoon post she said they have been repaid the mortgage and theres something about a foreign bond drawn for redemption they want to talk about a new investment  stormont wilmot and stormont were her lawyers and cartwright nodded the money ought to be earning interest and you can safely buy stock stormonts approve their judgments sound  for all that i think id like to choose for myself suppose i bought some shares in the line i have a number but its really not large and i have felt im not supporting the house as i ought  cartwright knitted his brows clara did not know much about business but she was sometimes shrewder than one thought he wondered whether mortimer had been talking if the pup had talked the thing was ominous because it implied that others knew the difficulties cartwright might have to meet  do you imagine the house needs supporting he asked carelessly  mrs cartwright hesitated i really know nothing about it but dont people grumble when you cant pay them much and their shares go down perhaps if the family owned a good part of the capital you could take a firmer line  it was plain that clara had been pondering mortimer had talked and somebody who was not cartwrights friend had informed him cartwright was tempted to let his wife do as she wanted clara owned shares in the line that he had let her buy when freights were good and she had afterwards refused to sell now however freights were very bad and the company was nearer the rocks than he hoped the shareholders knew cartwright imagined he could yet mend its fortunes if he were left alone but the job was awkward and opposition might be dangerous to command a solid block of votes would certainly help  for all that there was a risk clara ought not to run his antagonists were getting stronger and if they meddled and baffled him the company would fail its bankruptcy would not ruin his wife but she would feel the loss of her money and he was not going to use clara for a shield against ellen seatons attacks the thing was shabby all the same the situation was humorous and he saw with an ironical smile the advantages of mrs cartwrights plan  im not a business woman but i have noted youre sometimes moody as if you were anxious and i want to help she resumed  you do help the storms ive weathered have left a mark and now im old and strained its much to make a quiet port at night you take all bothers from me and send me out in the morning braced for another watch in the pilothouse  some time you must give another the helm said mrs cartwright quietly i wish i could persuade you to do so soon  cartwright sighed for the strain was heavy and he wanted to rest the trouble was the putoff reckoning for past extravagance was at hand and he shrank from asking his wife to pay he had not been very scrupulous but he had his code then hyslop came through the arch and stopping noted cartwrights awkwardly stretchedout leg  gout bothering you again sir he said you ought to lie up for a few days but i expect youre needed at the office i heard the ep line had a stormy meeting and the dissatisfied shareholders came near turning out the directors johnson declared they only saved the situation by a few votes  they ought to be turned out a blundering lot theyve let a good fleet down  hyslop smiled he had pale and watery blue eyes that generally annoyed cartwright an awkward doctrine sir if all the steamship directors who might have used the shareholders money to better advantage were called to account i imagine a number of respectable gentlemen would find their occupation gone besides when people start deposing rulers they dont know where to stop the things so to speak contagious and panicky investors are not logical  he went off and cartwright braced himself mortimer meant to be nasty but his languid malice bit deeper than he knew cartwright had hesitated weighing the value of his wifes help against his scruples until his stepsons hints had tipped the beam after all if he used claras money and saved his skin at her cost the pup would have some grounds to sneer  i must keep control for some time yet he said times are bad and if i let go the helm i doubt if my successor could steer a safe course when the need is gone ill willingly give up but i must bring the old ship into port first in the meantime you had better let stormonts buy you sound corporation stock  mrs cartwright acquiesced and cartwright watched the young people beyond the arch with the stiff curtains for wingscenes and the lights concealed the end of the room made a proscenium it was like looking at a drawingroom comedy on the stage two of the girls were pretty and he approved their fashionable clothes when she was quiet grace was almost beautiful but somehow none had barbaras charm yet cartwright thought the girl was getting thin and her color was too bright a friend of mortimers occupied the music stool and cartwright admitted that the fellow played well although he was something like a character from a gilbert opera  lister sat near the piano and talked to barbara he smiled but his smile had a touch of gravity cartwright thought him a good canadian a bit rugged perhaps but staunch and his quiet sincerity was after all better style than the cleverness of mortimers friends cartwright imagined barbara studied lister who did not know in fact it looked as if he were puzzled and cartwright smiled lister had not his talents when cartwright was young he knew how to amuse a pretty girl  the man at the piano signed to barbara who got up and began to sing the song was modern and the melody not marked cartwright liked the victorian ballads with tunes that haunted one and obvious sentiment but because barbara sang he gave the words and music his languid interest after all the thing was clever there was so to speak not much on the surface but one heard an elusive note of effort as if one struggled after something one could not grasp on the whole cartwright did not approve that kind of sentiment his objects were generally plain then he thought the hint of strain was too well done for a young girl and when barbara stopped he turned to his wife  are you satisfied about barbara he asked  why should i not be satisfied  i have felt shes not quite up to her proper form looks thin and sometimes shes quiet then why has young vernon gone off i havent seen him recently  harrys in town he goes home in a few days mrs cartwright replied she hesitated and resumed i imagined he wanted to marry barbara although she told me nothing about this barbara does not tell one much  do you think she likes him  i dont know but i rather think if she had liked him she would have refused  ah said cartwright thoughtfully well vernons a good sort but i see some light the girl is sensitive and very proud no doubt she feels her canadian adventureridiculous of course but barbaras hard to move all the same if vernons the proper man and is resolute  i doubt if he is the proper man mrs cartwright replied  cartwright pondered sometimes clara did not say all she thought and his glance wandered back to the group at the other end of the room barbara was again talking to lister he looked thoughtful and her face was serious they were obviously not engaged in philandering cartwright felt their quiet absorption was significant after a minute or two however the party about the piano broke up and went off barbara stopped to put away some music and then came through the arch  mr lister wants to go a voyage she said to cartwright i suggested you might help him to get a post on board a ship  i imagine he did not suggest you should persuade me  certainly not he refused to bother you barbara replied and with some hesitation added however perhaps in a sense we ought to help  that is so cartwright agreed why did mr lister come to liverpool  he wanted to go round the shipping offices mother told him our house was always open  cartwright nodded of course well ill think about it and may see a plan  barbara went off and cartwright looked at his wife i dont know if this is a fresh complication but if she refused harry shed no doubt refuse the other perhaps its important that shes willing he should go to sea  one is forced to like mr lister and we owe him much mrs cartwright remarked  certainly cartwright agreed however it looks as if some engineering talent is all he has got and i think a long voyage is indicated he stopped and resumed with a twinkle for all that the fellow is not an adventurer and i married a rich woman  mrs cartwright gave him a gentle smile i have been happy and barbara is not but in one sense i dont imagine we need be disturbed barbara has not recovered from the jar  she got up and cartwright dozed until he heard a step and lister crossed the floor  hallo he said are you going there is no train just now  lister said he meant to walk to the tramline but cartwright asked him to stop for a few minutes  barbara tells me you are trying for a post in an engineroom he remarked  that is so said lister with a touch of embarrassment still i didnt mean miss hyslop to bother you  barbara likes to meddle and im a shipowner to begin with why dyou want to go to sea  i must go to sea or back to canada lister said smiling ive had a pretty good holiday but my wads nearly gone  then wouldnt it be prudent to return to your occupation  i havent an occupation i turned mine down its possible ill find another but im not ready yet in canada were a restless wandering lot and i want to look about the world before i go back you see when you only know the woods and our western towns  cartwright saw and sympathized he remembered how adventure called when he was young well he had got adventure but perhaps not the kind lister seemed to enjoy anyhow he had not started off with an empty wallet to look about the world  how much does your roll amount to he asked with a bluntness he sometimes used  when lister told him he laughed the young fellow was good stuff cartwright liked his rashness  well he said you have pluck and if youre obstinate pluck takes you far have you got a promise from any of our shipping offices  lister said he had not there were some difficulties about certificates he had sailed on lake boats and made coasting voyages but the english board of trade rules were strict then he looked at the clock and cartwright gave him his hand  come and see me at the office well talk about this again  lister thanked him and when he had gone cartwright mused the young fellow was not an adventurer anyhow not in the sense shillito was an adventurer his honesty was obvious it was plain he did not want barbaras money and cartwright thought he did not know she was rich in fact he was barbaras sort there was the trouble cartwright weighed this for a time and then went to sleep    chapter vi  a nasty knock  frost sparkled on the office windows and cartwright with his feet on the hearthrug studied an atlantic weather chart the temperature reported by the liners captains was low and winter had begun unusually soon since cartwright had hoped for a mild november this was unlucky as a rule cargo is plentiful at montreal shortly before the st lawrence freezes and the last steamers to go down the river do so with heavy loads cartwrights plan was to run a boat across at the last moment and pick up goods the liners would not engage to carry and he had sent oreana because she was fast when the drift ice began to gather speed was useful  a cablegram two or three days since stated that she had sailed and cartwright who knew the st lawrence calculated the progress she ought to have made perhaps he had cut things rather fine but captain davies was a good navigator and would push on although the narrow waters below montreal where the stream runs fast between the islands would be open lake st peter was freezing and the liner parthian had some trouble to get through still the channels were not yet blocked and when davies had passed the narrows he would get open water down the gorge to quebec allowing for cautious navigation davies ought to be near rimouski at the mouth of the river and his passing would no doubt soon be telegraphed from the signal station cartwright admitted that to get the message would be some relief  by and by his bookkeeper came in  direct cablegram from davies sir  cartwright took the form and frowned the message was not from rimouski and ran delayed peter passing quebec  awkward sir gavin remarked sympathetically  very awkward said cartwright davies needed all the time hes lost it will be a near thing if he gets out  he picked up the weather chart and got no comfort cable malcolm at st johns youll find questions in the codebook about ice and wind  gavin withdrew and cartwright grappled with disturbing thoughts he had counted on oreanas earning a good sum and had engaged a paying cargo for her when she got back in fact the two good runs ought to have made the disappointing balance sheet he must shortly submit to the shareholders look a little better all the same there was no use in meeting trouble davies had passed quebec and if he made good progress in the next twentyfour hours one might begin to hope  below quebec there were awkward spots where steamers used buoyed channels and if these were blocked by ice davies must risk crossing the shoals if he got across the water was deep and he need only bother about the floes until he came to the gulf since belle isle strait was frozen davies would go south of anticosti and out by the cabot passage but the gulf was often dark with snow and fog and one met the old greenland ice well much depended on the weather and cartwright went to get his lunch  the restaurant under a big building was warm and for a time cartwright occupied his favorite corner of the smokingroom his tips were generous and so long as he was punctual the waitress allowed nobody to use his chair the noise of the traffic in the street was softened to a faint rumble the electric light was cleverly shaded and his big chair was easy he got drowsy but frowned when he began to nod the trouble was he was often dull when he ought to be keen his doctor talked about the advantages of moderation but when one got old ones pleasures were few and cartwright liked a good meal at the luncheon room they did one well and he was not going to use selfdenial yet  by and by a merchant he knew pulled up a chair opposite very cold and slippery outside he remarked i nearly came down on the floating bridge and looked in for a drink a jar shakes a man who carries weight  what were you doing on the floating bridge cartwright asked  i went to the stage to meet some canadian friends on board the nepigon theyd a bad voyage thick mist down the st lawrence and they lost a day cruising about among the floes in the gulf what about your little boat  i understand shes coming down river  hasnt she started rather late  if id sent her sooner the conference would have knocked me out cartwright rejoined id have got nothing but lowrated stuff the liners didnt want one must run some risks  the other nodded that is so when shareholders must be satisfied well i expect im lucky because my partners a good sort when you neednt bother about other folks greediness you can take a cautious line now i come to think of it i heard some of your people grumbling i hope your boat will get across all right  he got up and cartwright pondered if outsiders knew his shareholders were dissatisfied things were worse than he had thought and he might expect trouble at the next meeting then he looked at his watch but his chair was deep and when he tried to get up his leg hurt he sank back again gavin knew where to find him if a reply from st johns arrived  by and by his office boy carrying a cable companys envelope came in and cartwrights hand shook when he opened the message it stated that an easterly gale and snowstorm raged about the newfoundland coast and the thermometer was very low the gale would drive the drift ice up the gulf and pack the floes things looked bad cartwright felt he ought to get about and make some plans to meet the threatened blow but he did not see what he could do  he sat still the other customers had gone and all was quiet but for the faint rumble of traffic and soothing throb of an electric fan cartwright mused about oreana and pictured davies sheltering behind the windscreens on his bridge and trying to pierce the snow and the lookout man half frozen in the spray that leaped about the forecastle oreana was a wet boat when she was loaded deep now and then perhaps a buoy loomed in the tossing flakes one tried to read the number and see the color then the steeringengine rattled as the rudder was pulled across and oreana headed for another mark  the work was nervous because dangerous shoals bordered the channels and davies must let the steamer go he knew when a risk must be run and the engineer was staunch the trouble was oreanas boilers were bad the money cartwright durst not spend on repairs would have been a good investment now still the old boat was fast and davies would drive her fullspeed  the captains job would not be easier when he left the shoals the easterly gale would send the floes up stream cartwright knew the strange chill one felt when ice was about and the faint elusive blink that marked its edge in the dark sometimes one did not see the blink until the floe was almost at the bows and when the lookouts startled cry reached the bridge one must trust to luck and pull the helm over quick then to dodge the floe might mean one crashed upon the next it was steering blind but as a rule the sailors instinct guided him right farther on the river got wide and in thick weather one saw no lights davies must keep midchannel and trust his reckoning while he rushed her along for a thousand miles the old boats track was haunted by dangers against which one could not guard and cartwright thought she carried his last chance to mend his broken fortunes  if she were wrecked the reckoning he had long put off must be fronted for when his embarrassments were known his antagonists would combine and try to pull him down one must pay for ones extravagance but to pay would break him and if he were broken mortimer would sneer and grace treat him with humiliating pity he would be their mothers pensioner and to lose his independence was hard he had long ruled and bullied others  by and by a waitress moved some glasses and cartwright looked up with a start the afternoon was nearly over he must have gone to sleep returning to the office he gave his bookkeeper some orders and then went to the station the pavements were slippery with frost and tall buildings with yellow lights loomed in the fog cartwright shivered but reflected that davies fighting the snow and gale was no doubt colder for a day or two he must bear the suspense and then if no cablegram arrived he could take it for granted that oreana had reached the atlantic after dinner he sat by the fire and smoked while mrs cartwright knitted  in the afternoon i went to mrs olivers and met mrs seaton she said presently she talked to me for some time at the beginning i thought it strange  its pretty obvious that you dont like her cartwright remarked  ellen seaton is not my sort but i understand she was a friend of yours  she was my friend said cartwright carelessly its long since and i rather doubt if she is my friend now  then why did she buy her shares in the line  ellen did not buy the shares seaton bought them when shipping was good  mrs cartwright looked relieved and cartwright resumed all the same i dont see her object for telling you she was a shareholder  she wanted to sell her shares to me i knew she had some plan when she crossed the floor i was talking to janet but ellen got janet away and persuaded a young man on the other side to move it was clever i dont think mrs oliver or anybody else remarked what she was doing but you know ellen  i know ellen rather well said cartwright dryly however when you saw she wanted to get you alone why did you indulge her  for one thing i was curious then it wasnt worth while to spoil her plan i didnt think ellen would persuade me if i did not approve  cartwright smiled clara did not argue much and generally agreed with him but sometimes she was as immovable as a rock he pictured with amusement the little comedy at mrs olivers but all the same he was annoyed  well ellen wanted you to buy her shares did she give you any grounds  she declared she wanted money then she said it would help you if i took the lot there might be a dispute at the meeting the directors report would not be satisfactory people would ask awkward questions and she expected some organized opposition it would be useful for you to command a large number of votes  cartwrights face got red ellen was well informed in fact it was ominous that she knew so much had she not been greedy he thought she would have kept the shares in order to vote against him but she obviously meant to sell them before the crash she expected came if a number of others agreed with her his retirement would be forced  what price were you to pay he asked  mrs cartwright told him and he laughed if ellen found a buyer at a number of shillings less she would be lucky well i understand you didnt take her offer  i did not said mrs cartwright tranquilly when i wanted to buy some shares not long since you did not approve since you refused to let me help i didnt mean to be persuaded by ellen seaton  youre staunch said cartwright and mrs cartwright resumed her knitting in the morning he went to the office sooner than usual but there was no news and the dark cold day passed drearily when he started for home gavin promised to wait until the cable offices closed and cartwright had gone to dinner when he was called to the telephone when he took down the instrument his hand shook  hallo he said hoarsely is that you gavin  yes sir said a voice he knew cablegram from davies just arrived part in code ill give it you slow  go on said cartwright  oreana ashore east cape chat surrounded ice water in fore hold think some plates broken have abandoned ship salvage impossible until ice breaks  there was a pause and gavin added thats all have you got it sir  ive got enough cartwright replied  he hung up the instrument and going back to the diningroom drained his glass then he turned to mrs cartwright who had remarked his grim look  ive got a nasty knock oreanas in the ice and may be wrecked anyhow we cant get her off until spring and shes the best of the fleet  mrs cartwright gave him a sympathetic glance and signed a servant to bring another plate as a rule she did not say much she studied her husband quietly and was not much comforted when he resumed his dinner this was characteristic but it was plain he had got a nasty knock    chapter vii  the shareholders meeting  the afternoon was dark and electric lights burned along the cornice of the room engaged for the shareholders meeting the room was big and cold and as gavin moved about the table on the platform his steps echoed hollowly he was the companys secretary and was putting down papers by the blotting pads a group of gentlemen engaged in thoughtful talk stood by the fire they were directors of the line and did not look happy nominally by the companys constitution the shareholders elected the board in practice cartwright had so far appointed the directors and meant if possible to do so again the gentlemen by the fire were eligible for reëlection and cartwright was satisfied although he had not chosen them for their business talent their names were good in liverpool and their honesty was known cartwright did not want clever men he was head of the house and knew it would totter to a disastrous fall unless he kept his firm control  now and then gavin gave his employer a keen glance cartwrights lips were rather blue and the lines round his eyes were sharply drawn his white mustache stuck out and one got a hint of stubbornness but except for this his face was inscrutable although gavin thought cartwright would score again he was anxious nobody but cartwright could persuade the dissatisfied shareholders to accept that balance sheet  cartwright himself felt in rather good form he had curtailed his lunch and been satisfied with a single glass of liquor that generally braced him up he imagined he would need all his skill and coolness before the meeting was over the trouble was he might not get much support the directors did not know all he knew but they knew something and he saw one or two hesitated then mrs cartwright was ill and although she had given her husband her proxy votes had sent mortimer mortimer was entitled to come because he had some shares but cartwright did not know the line he meant to take the pup did not like him and was cunning presently cartwright looked at his watch  they wont be long i imagine we are going to have some opposition  its very possible one of the others agreed a twopercent dividend is disappointing and we are paying this by cutting down the reserve fund then people know we have lost the use of our best boat for six months and may lose her for good when we reduced our insurance i urged that we were rash  we saved a good sum and economy was needful cartwright rejoined insurance is expensive for our type of boats  the balance sheet looks bad ill admit id sooner not be accountable for a state of things like this another remarked  cartwright smiled the balance sheet looked better than it was but jordan had given him a useful lead he knew his colleagues weaknesses and how they might be worked upon  we are all accountable i have consulted you frankly and you approved my plans  jordan gave him a rather doubtful look anyhow we must front an awkward situation suppose the shareholders ask for an investigation committee  we must refuse said cartwright with quiet firmness a frightened committee would probably urge a drastic reconstruction scheme the writing off much of our capital and perhaps winding up the line when rates are bad and cargos scarce one must take a low price for ships our liabilities are large and i imagine selling off would leave us much in debt  cartwright paused he saw his remarks carried weight and knew his codirectors he would give them a few moments for thought before he finished his argument  very well he resumed jordan declares he does not like to be accountable for an unsatisfactory balance sheet i take it he would much less like to be made accountable for a bad bankruptcy no doubt you sympathize with him  it was obvious that they did so and one said if i thought my occupying a seat on the board would lead to this i would sooner have given my shares away  i have not talked about my feelings cartwright went on all the same i am head of the old house you can imagine i do not want to see it fall but rates are not always low and if im not embarrassed by rash meddlers my persuasion is i can keep the fleet running until better times arrive  he saw he had won them the number of shares they owned was not very large for the most part the men were rich and not disturbed about their money they valued a high place in business and social circles and their good name to be entangled by a bankruptcy was unthinkable  then i feel we ought to support you jordan replied for all that our powers not very great we are going to meet some opposition and if the dissatisfied people are resolute they can turn us out  so long as i know the board will back me im not afraid of the shareholders cartwright declared  you imagine you can save the situation a redfaced gentleman remarked  its possible said cartwright dryly  very well said the other we must try to see you out  they went to the table soon afterwards and the shareholders began to arrive they were not numerous and the scattered groups emphasized the bareness of the big echoing room cartwright studied the people as they came in some looked gloomy and some stubborn a few looked frankly bored there were five or six women and two whispered while the others glanced about with jerky movements cartwrights face hardened when he saw mrs seaton and then he noted hyslop in a back row he thought hyslop looked languidly amused  when all was quiet he took the notes gavin handed him glanced at the paper and put it down then speaking in a steady voice he gave the report of the years work and talked about the balance sheet he was frank but not apologetic and claimed in view of the difficulties that the directors had well guarded the companys interests when he stopped there were murmurs of approval as if some of the despondent had begun to hope the cautious admitted that cartwright had made a bad situation look better  one or two asked questions which he answered candidly and then there was a pause and somebody moved the adoption of the chairmans report and balance sheet his seconder made a short nervous speech and mrs seaton got up at the end of the room she pushed back her veil took out her handkerchief put her hand on a chair in front and gave the directors an apologetic smile  i dont know if it is usual for a woman to speak at a business meeting but i have a number of shares in the line and its long since i got a good dividend she said two per cent is ridiculous and my lawyer tells me i could get four per cent where the security is really good she paused and added naïvely to have twice as much to spend would be very nice  somebody laughed and cartwright braced himself ellen seaton was cleverer than she looked and he thought her dangerous but in the meantime he durst not stop her  one feels that securitys important and its plain ours is not firstclass she resumed well i suppose if we accept the report it means we are satisfied to let the companys business be managed on the old plan  it does mean something like that a man agreed  then im not satisfied for one thing i want a proper dividend  we all want a proper dividend somebody remarked  mrs seaton smiled as if she were encouraged to go without is disappointing but perhaps the dividend is not most important id like to feel my shares were worth the money they cost and find out they are not we have drawn on the reserves and i expect this implies we are losing money you cant go on losing money very long and we ought to stop while we have some capital left  a number of the others applauded and she continued our directors have worked very hard to manage ships that dont pay must be tiring and perhaps we oughtnt to ask them to bear the heavy strain could we not choose somebody with fresh ideas to help  thats what we want said one the board needs new blood  then the storm broke and for a time cartwright lost control of the meeting mrs seaton had loosed passions he might have restrained and the shareholders were frankly moved by fear distrust and greed men got up asking angry questions and shouting implications but for a few minutes cartwright sat like a rock and let them rage when they stopped and there was an awkward pause mortimer hyslop got up he looked languid and his voice was soft but cartwright admitted his speech was clever  he and mrs cartwright whom he represented owned shares in the line and he had not risen before because the chairman was his relation now when attacks perhaps not altogether justified had been made on the board he was forced to state his conviction that nobody else could have steered the company past the dangers that threatened one must admit the situation was bad and for a minute or two mortimer cleverly indicated its drawbacks for all that he argued it was rash to change pilot and officers in the middle of a storm the officers they knew and had trusted must be left control until the gale blew over  mortimer sat down and cartwright knitted his brows on the surface his stepson had taken the proper line mortimer meant to support the board but he had indicated that he did so because it was his duty his remarks about the dangers by which the company was surrounded had made things look worse all the same he had calmed the meeting but cartwright did not know if this was an advantage criticism was harder to meet when the critics were cool  another man got up and began to talk in a quiet voice  mr hyslop has an object for trusting the chairman that we have not got we wont grumble about his staunchness but we are entitled to weigh his arguments which are not altogether sound he owns the situation is awkward and the outlook dark but he urges us to trust the officers who got the ship in danger one feels this is not remarkably logical then he declares nobody else could have kept the fleet running i think the claim is rash in this city we are conservative and names long known in business circles carry an exaggerated weight we expect a man to work wonders because his father started a prosperous line and another because he long since made a lucky plunge men like these are often satisfied with former triumphs while times and methods change we want fresh thought and modern methods its obvious the old have brought us near the rocks  cartwright saw the shareholders were moved and the time for him to speak had come he got up and fronted a doubting and antagonistic audience his face was inscrutable but he looked dignified  we have heard angry criticism and hints about slackness he began some of you have suggested rejecting the report a committee of inquiry and new members for the board but no substantive motion has been put well before this is done i claim your patience for a few minutes if you are not satisfied i and your directors are jointly accountable we stand together if you get rid of one you get rid of all this is a drastic but risky cure  he paused and one or two of the gentlemen at the table looked surprised it was plain they felt the chairman had gone farther than he ought the redfaced man however smiled as if he approved and cartwright resumed  times are bad the markets are flat and goods are not moved about the world i venture to state no steamship company is free from embarrassments you can no doubt find men with business talent equal to ours and give them control but you cannot give them the knowledge gained by long experience one needs to grapple with the particular difficulties the cartwright line must meet the personal touch is needed your manager must be known by the companys friends and its antagonists who would not hesitate to snatch our trade from a stranger they know me and the others and are cautious about attacking us in all thats important until times get better i am the company  cartwright stopped and drank some water he saw he had struck the right note and began again  i will not labor the argument the thing is obvious if i go the line will stop running before the new men learn their job well im old and tired but it would hurt to see the houseflag hauled down it was carried by famous oak clippers in my grandfathers time you hesitate to risk your money i risk mine and much that money cannot buy the honor of a house whose ships have sailed from liverpool for a hundred years  the shareholders were moved and one heard murmurs of sympathy boldness paid and cartwright saw he was recovering his shaken power but it was not all good acting to some extent he was sincere he got his breath and resumed  i dont urge you with a selfish object to let me keep my post id be relieved to let it go counted in money the reward for my labor is not large i want to save the cartwright line to pilot it into port and if there is no rash meddling i believe i can but i warn you the thing is in no others power well i have finished you must choose whether your directors go or not  there was an awkward silence and then somebody asked will the chairman state if he has a plan for meeting a situation he admits is difficult  cartwright smiled rather grimly i will not make a public statement that might be useful to our antagonists so long as i am chairman you must trust me my proposition is give us six months and then if things are no better we will welcome a committee of inquiry in the meantime a motion is before the meeting  it is proposed and seconded that the directors report and balance sheet be accepted gavin remarked  the resolution was carried the directors were reelected and the meeting broke up cartwright sat down rather limply and wiped his face  i pulled it off but they pushed me hard he said at one time it looked as if our defenses would go down  you have put off the reckoning i think thats all one of the directors remarked  we have six months said cartwright this is something if they call a meeting then i imagine i can meet them  he signed to gavin who helped him with his big coat and went off to the underground restaurant where he presently fell asleep in a chair by the fire    chapter viii  a stolen excursion  barbara stopped at the top of james street and looked down hill to the river the afternoon was dark and the pavement wet thin fog drifted about the tall offices lights shone in the windows and she heard steamers whistles down the street a white plume of steam streaking the darkcolored fog marked the tunnel station and barbara glanced at a neighboring clock  she could get a train in a few minutes but she would be forced to wait at a station on the cheshire side and there was not another train for some time she had bought the things she needed and did not know what to do one could pass half an hour at a café but mrs cartwright did not like her to go to a café alone and barbara frowned impatiently her mother was horribly conventional and barbara missed the freedom she had enjoyed in canada in fact it was very dull at home graces correct serenity and cold disapproval made one savage mortimers very proper friends were tiresome  barbara was restless and dissatisfied she wanted to play an active part and feel she was alive moreover since she came home she had felt she was being watched and so to speak protected from herself her relations had forgiven her canadian escapade but they meant to guard against her doing something of the kind again perhaps from their point of view they were justified but barbara was not tempted to make a fresh experiment she had not yet got over the shock she saw how near her romantic trustfulness had brought her to disaster and thought her faith in men and women had gone this was perhaps the worst because she was generous and had frankly trusted people she liked  now she imagined the gloomy day had reacted on her spirits she was moody and longed for something that would banish the dreariness starting down hill for the station she stopped abruptly a few moments afterwards lister was crossing the street and if she went on they would meet it was some time since she had seen him and she noted with surprise that he wore a rather soiled blue uniform his cap which had a badge in front was greasy and he carried an oilskin coat  he walked quickly looking straight in front with his head well up and barbara got a hint of purposeful activity barbara liked him much but she had as a rule quietly baffled his efforts to know her better she waited rather hoping he would pass until he looked round and advanced to meet her  im lucky he remarked and his satisfaction was comforting its long since i have seen you  you know our house barbara rejoined  oh well he said with a twinkle when i last came you talked to me for about two minutes and then left me to play billiards with your brother he was polite but in canada we play pool and my games not very good i imagined he was bored  mortimer is like that said barbara but why are you wearing the steamship badge and sailors clothes  lister laughed theyre engineers clothes i go to sea thats another reason i didnt come over  ah said barbara did my stepfather get you a post on board ship  he did not he told me to look him up at the office but i didnt go one would sooner not bother ones friends  canadians are an independent lot barbara remarked in this country we use our friends for all they are worth and were justified so long as they want to help if cartwright said he would help he meant to do so but what ship are you on board  ardrigh crosschannel cattle boat shes unloading irish steers sheep and pigs not far off will you come and see her i dont suppose youve been on board a noahs ark before  barbara did not hesitate she doubted if mrs cartwright would approve and knew grace would not but this was not important grace disapproved all she did and the stolen excursion would break the monotony then listers twinkling smile appealed and somehow her reserve vanished when she was out of doors with him  id like to go she said  then come along he urged and they started for the elevated railway at the bottom of the street  while the electric cars rolled along the docks barbaras moodiness went she could not see much in the fog wet warehouse roofs masts and funnels and halfseen hulls floating on dull water loomed up and vanished inside the car lights glimmered on polished wood the rattling and shaking were somehow cheerful barbara felt braced and alert lister talked and she laughed she could not hear all he said because of the noise and thought he did not hear her but she did not mind she liked his cheerfulness and frank satisfaction the gloom outside and the blurred lights in the fog gave the excursion a touch of romantic adventure  they got down at a station by a muddy dockroad ponderous lorries with giant horses rolled out of the gloom between stacks of goods wet cattle were entangled in the press of traffic and barbara was relieved when lister pushed back a sliding door then she stopped for a moment half daunted by the noise and bustle and looked about  big lights hung from the room of the long shed but did not pierce the gloom that lurked between the piles of cargo a flock of sheep moving in a dense woolly mass came down a gangway squealing pigs occupied a bay across the piles of goods the front of the shed was open and in places one saw a faint reflection that looked like water opposite barbara the gap between the low roof and docksill was filled by a deckhouse and a steamers funnel steam blew across the opening farther on and in the vapor bales and boxes shot up and rattling chains plunged down through the roar of the winches she heard coarse shouts and the bellowing of cattle  lister took her to a slanting plank that spanned a dark gulf and she saw dim water and then the hollow of a steamers hold men who looked like ghosts moved in the gloom and indistinct cattle came up a railed plank barbara could not see where they came from they plunged out of the dark their horns glimmering in the beam of the lamps  after a few moments lister helped her down on the steamers bridgedeck the boat listed away from the wall her tall red funnel was inclined sharply much of her side was above water and muddy streams poured from the scuppers on the after deck where men with long boots pulled a hosepipe about the boat was horribly dirty but her lean bows and the length of the iron engineroom casing indicated speed  a man came along the bridgedeck and barbara thought the gold bands on his cap indicated the captain he stopped and when he glanced at lister she blushed for there was a hint of sympathetic understanding in her smile  we wont want you until highwater he said and went off  barbara hoped lister had not seen her blush and thought he had not he took her down some iron steps and to a door in a dark passage  our messroom he said i expect its the quietest spot on board the ship  he pushed the door open and stopped the small room was bright with electric light and a young man and woman sat opposite each other at the table the mans uniform was stained by oil the girl was pretty and fashionably dressed but barbara knew her clothes were cheap she stood at the door hesitating and the man gave lister a smile like the captains  i didnt expect you yet but come in he said the teas not cold and mike has made some doughnuts  mr robertson my chief lister said to barbara and the man presented lister to his companion and put a machine in a box on the floor now theres room i was pulling out the indicator diagrams he added wont you take off your coat miss hyslop and try mikes doughnuts  the little room was hot and when barbara hung up her furs she noted the other girls appraising glance miss grant poured some black tea from a big cracked pot and pushed across a tin of condensed milk and a plate of greasy buns when barbara picked one up and looked at it doubtfully robertson opened a drawer  we pull ours in two but i expect youd like a knife he said  he found a knife which he rubbed on the tablecloth i used the thing on the indicator the contraption in the box but i think its clean enough  barbara ate her doughnut and drank the bitter tea miss grant looked friendly and she liked the engineer they were frank human people and she thought them kind robertson began to talk about carpets gasstoves and pans and miss grant told barbara what the articles cost they had been buying furniture and robertson stated they were to be married soon  i reckon you havent got so far yet he said to lister and when barbara saw miss grant touch him she blushed it was ridiculous but the blood came to her skin and then noting listers embarrassment she began to laugh  jim will talk like that miss grant remarked  oh well said robertson i expect its rather soon mr lister hasnt joined us long and you dont begin at the top he turned to barbara with an encouraging smile all the same he knows his job and has got one move up perhaps if he sticks to it for a year or two  miss grant stopped him and asked barbaras views about curtains she had some patterns and while they contrasted the material and the prices the door opened and a greasy redhaired fellow gave the group a benevolent grin  was thim doughnuts all right he inquired  ive had better but youve made some worse mike robertson replied  yez said tea for two if yed told me it was a party id have been afther stealing the captains cork butter a cook cannot do his best whin the shoresteward sends him enginegrease annyhow whin yere young an romantic whats it mather what ye ate  he went off and robertson began to talk about ardrigh he was naïvely proud of the boat and his engines and narrated hard runs in bad weather to land the livestock in time for important markets sometimes the hollow channelseas that buried the plunging forecastle filled the decks and icy cataracts came down the stokehold gratings sometimes the cattle pens broke and mangled bullocks rolled about in the water and wreckage  robertson had a talent for narrative and barbara felt something of the terror and lure of the sea she liked the ardrighs rather grimy crew their cheerfulness and rude goodhumor they did useful things big things now and then they were strong warmblooded fellows not polished loafers like mortimers friends then she approved miss grants frank pride in her lover there was something primitive about these people they were so to speak human and not ashamed of their humanity lister was somehow like them she wondered whether this had attracted her perhaps she was attracted but the attraction must not be indulged  by and by miss grant resumed her talk about curtains and when they had agreed about the material that ought to wear best barbara looked at her watch miss grant gave her her hand and robertson declared she must come back when the boat was in port again lister took her down the gangway and was quiet until they reached the station then he smiled apologetically  you played up well i didnt know robertson was on board but hes a very good sort sos the girl i think  barbara laughed i didnt play up i liked the people the excursion was delightful ive enjoyed it all  lister saw she was sincere and thrilled he had begun to think he ought not to have suggested the adventure but he was not sorry now barbara was not bothered by ridiculous conventions she talked gayly while the cars rolled along beside the warehouse walls but when they got down at the station she stopped in the middle of a sentence cartwright had alighted from the next car and was a yard or two in front lister knew his fur coat and rather dragging walk if he and barbara went on they would confront cartwright when he turned to go down the steps  barbara gave him a twinkling glance and remarked that he knitted his brows but did not hesitate in the few moments since her stepfather left the train she had seen three or four plans for avoiding him lister obviously had not and on the whole she approved his honesty he advanced and touched cartwright  i didnt know you were on board our train sir  cartwright looked at him rather hard and barbara waited although she had been caught enjoying a stolen excursion she was not afraid of her stepfather but she was curious  i was in front said cartwright dryly barbara has picked a rather dreary day for a run to the north docks i understood she was going to the shops  miss hyslop met me near the station and i persuaded her to come and see my ship  then you have got a ship said cartwright if you are not on duty come to the office in the morning and tell me about the boat in the meantime ill put barbara on the tunnel train  he went off with the girl but barbara turned her head and lister saw her smile    chapter ix  cartwright sees a plan  in the morning lister went to cartwrights office to some extent he was embarrassed because he had begun to see that barbaras relations might not approve her going on board his ship and he imagined cartwright meant to talk about this when he came in cartwright gave him a nod and indicated a chair  i understand you did not arrange for barbara to meet you and go to the dock he said  no sir i didnt expect to meet miss hyslop i was talking about the boat and thought miss hyslop might like to see her  cartwright turned and the electric light touched his face he looked thoughtful but somehow lister imagined he was not thinking about his stepdaughter  oh well he said as if the matter were not important and went on i might have got you a post had you looked me up what boat are you on board  ardrigh perhaps you know her  yes belfast model long bow and fine lines aft dont know if i approve the type give you speed at the cost of carrying power but makes a wet ship in a head sea  she is wet lister agreed with a smile last run we couldnt keep the water out of the stokehold had to cover and batten gratings and then a boat fetched adrift and smashed the engine skylights  whats your rating cartwright asked  lister told him and he remarked you have made some progress  i was lucky she burst some boiler tubes in my watch we were steaming hard head to an ugly sea with a lot of cattle on board and were forced to keep her going two firemen were scalded but i was able to put the patentstoppers in the tubes i used a trick id learned on a canadian lake boat rather risky but it worked afterwards the company moved me up  cartwright was not surprised he knew men and saw the young fellow was all he had thought all the same it might be worth while to get some particulars about the accident from the ardrighs owners  you wont go far in the crosschannel trade why did you not try for a berth with an atlantic line  there was some trouble about your board of trade rules and i might have been required to prove my qualifications for an english certificate while i was inquiring i heard an engineer was wanted on board ardrigh the regulations dont apply to coasting voyages  you might have got your certificate would it not have been worth while  lister hesitated his main object for joining the ardrigh was that she sailed from liverpool and he wanted to see barbara now and then as a rule he was frank but he did not think it prudent to enlighten cartwright  i dont know he said you see i may go back to the railroad soon  he wondered whether cartwright did see and thought he had remarked his hesitation the old fellow was very keen cartwrights look however was inscrutable and for a few moments he said nothing then he picked up some papers on his desk  look me up now and then when youre in port i might have a job for you but i dont know yet he said and added in a meaning voice if you want to see my family mrs cartwright will receive you at her house  lister colored and got up ill remember sir perhaps i oughtnt to have persuaded miss hyslopi didnt stop to think  when he went off cartwright smiled but soon afterwards he put his cigarcase in his pocket and told gavin he was going out he thought he knew where to find the cattle boats shoreengineer and when he did so the waitress gave them a table at which they would not be disturbed in half an hour cartwright had found out all he wanted to know and returning to his office he smoked and mused  lister had not exaggerated his pluck and coolness had kept ardrighs engines going when to stop might have meant the loss of the livestock on board well cartwright had known the fellow was good stuff and he might soon want a man like that somebody staunch and resolute who knew his job he had beaten his antagonists at the shareholders meeting but doubted if he could do so again in fact he had only put off the reckoning for six months in which he must make good and he knitted his brows while he studied titanias picture he thought about her sister ship wrecked and abandoned on the african coast  arcturus was a useful boat and cheap to run although times were bad cartwright could run her and earn some profit he had known the company that bought her was getting near the rocks but they had insured her heavily and there was something strange about the wreck cartwright understood the underwriters had hesitated before they paid he himself would not have paid he had a notion  an effort had been made to float arcturus but the salvors did not know all cartwright thought he knew if his supposition were correct the wreck might be worth buying and one could no doubt buy her very cheap the boat had for some time lain halfburied in shifting sands at the mouth of an african river  the underwriters would be lucky if they sold her for old iron  cartwright weighed the cost of floating if he employed a regular salvage company this would be high because they would bargain for a large part of the value recovered his plan was to do the job himself with cheaper appliances than theirs the trouble was he could not go out and superintend he was too old and one ought to be an engineer cartwright had grounds for imagining the job was rather an engineers than a sailors well he knew a young fellow who would not be daunted and would work for him honestly but to get the proper man was not all  he pondered about the money somehow he might get the necessary sum but if the venture failed it would be the last nobody would trust him again he would be forced into retirement and dependence on his wife it was a risk he hesitated to run and he resolved to wait  in the evening after dinner barbara joined him in the drawingroom and cartwright waited with some amusement for he thought he knew what she wanted  did mr lister come to the office she asked presently  he did come did you think he would not  oh no said barbara smiling i knew he would come mr lister is like that  i suppose you mean hes honest  i think i mean hes scrupulous when you crossed the station platform in front of us he got a jolt  then you did not get a jolt  not at all said barbara to keep behind and meet you after id sent lister off would not have bothered me however i was curious although i think i knew the line hed take you see for an unsophisticated young man the situation was awkward  if he felt it awkward it indicated he knew he ought not to have taken you on board his boat  youre horribly logical barbara rejoined with a twinkle when we started he didnt know i ought not to have gone mr lister is not like you hes very obvious of course i did know but i went  i wonder why said cartwright dryly  sometimes youre keen but you didnt remark i meant to give you a lead well i didnt go altogether because i wanted to enjoy mr listers society to see a cattle boat was something fresh and i was dull  then when did lister see a light since he stopped me its plain hed got some illumination  i think it was when the engineer and the girl robertson is going to marry began to talk about house furnishings in the ardrighs messroom they took it for granted lister was my lover and he was horribly embarrassed the thing really was humorous  folks have hinted im getting a backnumber cartwright remarked to talk to a modern girl makes me feel i am outofdate  grace is not modern and to talk to her makes you tired barbara rejoined but ill tell you about the teaparty in the messroom if you like  then you got tea in the cattle boats messroom  of course said barbara black tea and condensed milk and a ruffian with red hair whom they called mike had made some doughnuts with lard like enginegrease for all that they were very nice people and if you dont interrupt ill tell you  she told him about the party and cartwright chuckled he pictured her in the dirty messroom looking exotic in her fashionable clothes and expensive furs but no doubt quite serene she said the other girl was pretty but cartwright admitted that barbara was beautiful he rather sympathized with listers embarrassment and wondered whether barbara meant to throw some light on the young mans character  when she stopped he asked did they talk about some burst boiler tubes  no said barbara we talked about gasstoves and kitchen pans then she gave cartwright a keen glance but what are boiler tubes do they sometimes burst  they carry the flame from the furnace through the water if youre much interested gavin will show you a plan of a ships boiler when you come to the office in the meantime have you found out all you want to know  you really are keen barbara rejoined  i was a little curious about what you said to mr lister  ah said cartwright i imagined something like this i told him if he wanted to see my family he must come to the house  barbara looked thoughtful this was all was it worth while to tell him to come to the office to order him in fact  it was all thats important i think it was important and expect you to agree  well you have carried out your duty and ought to be satisfied said barbara who got up and gave cartwright a smiling glance all the same if you want a man for an awkward job i think you can trust mr lister  she went off and cartwright laughed barbara was clever the strange thing was she had been cheated by a theatrical rogue but clever girls were sometimes like that he imagined she liked lister but this was perhaps all since she had been frank in one sense lister was the man for barbara he was honest sober and resolute and she needed firm control the girl was as wild as a hawk and although she was marked by a fine fastidiousness would revolt from a narrowminded prig lister was not a prig his blood was red  in another sense perhaps the thing was ridiculous barbara was rich and ought to make a good marriage but good marriages sometimes brought unhappiness  human nature was stubborn one paid for forcing it to obey the rules of worldly prudence then barbara had a romantic vein she would risk all for her lover and not grumble if she were forced to pay for her staunchness besides she and lister had qualities he had not they were marked by something ascetic or perhaps he meant spartan and if it were worth while could go without much that he required  cartwright admitted that indulgence had cost him dear he had paid with grim philosophy but he did not want barbara to pay although she was not his daughter he loved the girl and her recent moodiness bothered him if she did not love lister why was she disturbed sometimes cartwright thought he saw a gleam of light suppose she did love the fellow and was trying to keep him off because of her canadian adventure lister knew about that and barbara was proud  cartwrights eyes got bloodshot and he clenched his fist he would very much like to meet shillito his muscles were getting slack but he had not lost all his power anyhow he could talk well the thing was humiliating but he must not get savage when he let himself go he suffered for it afterwards getting up he threw away his cigar and went off to talk to his wife    chapter x  a bold speculation  after weighing for some weeks all he could learn about the wreck on the african coast cartwright went to london and was carried up one morning to the second floor of an imposing office block black marble columns supported the molded roof of the long passage the wide stairs were guarded by polished mahogany and shining brass and a screen of artistic iron work enclosed the elevator shaft cartwrights fur coat and gloves and varnished boots harmonized with the surroundings he looked rich and important but as he went along the corridor his face was stern he was going to make a plunge that would mend or break his fortune unless he got straight in the next six months he must retire from the board and make the best bargain possible with his creditors  he opened a door and giving a clerk his card was shown into a handsome private office mr morse at a writingtable indicated a chair and when cartwright sat down rested his chin in his hand  we have considered your letters and my partner mr bull agrees that if we can come to terms your suggestion has some advantages he said  the advantages for your clients are obvious cartwright remarked  the other smiled they paid out a good sum when arcturus was wrecked and would frankly like to get something back well we understand you are willing to buy her as she lies  at my price ill give you a check when the agreements signed  then i expect you have made some calculations and know all about the efforts to float the wreck if we sell her to you the job is yours but i admit some curiosity why do you expect to float her when the salvage company failed  for one thing they started the job on extravagant lines cartwright replied they sent out two firstclass tugs and a number of highlypaid men they ought to have hired negro laborers at the spot the surf is often bad they could only work when it was calm and while they were doing nothing wages mounted up so did their bills for the coal they must bring from sierra leone where coal is expensive then they were bothered by fever and were forced to send men home they saw the contract would not pay and let it go the job was not impossible it was costing too much  mr morse agreed that cartwrights statement was plausible and probably accurate but thought he rather labored his argument  you mean to use another plan he said  my outfit will be small and cheap this has the advantage that when my men cant work i wont pay much for wasted time all the same my risk is obvious the things a rash speculation on which i cant embark unless you are satisfied to take a very small price  for a few moments the ship broker pondered cartwrights line was the line a man who wanted to buy something cheap would take all the same mr morse did not altogether see why he wanted to buy the wreck  what about the cargo he suggested of course you understand that i have no authority to sell this you noticed the wording of our original advertisement and for the salving of the cargo precisely it is on that basis alone that the cargo underwriters will deal together with your offer for the steamer as she lies you must accept a percentage of the value of the cargo you save  what is the cargo  she carried palmkernels in the forehold i expect they have fermented and rotted perhaps the palm oil aft isnt spoiled  the barrels will have gone to bits  oak barrel staves stand salt water long  the iron hoops do not cartwright rejoined anyhow i dont reckon on the cargo i expect to make my profit on buying the hull  yet the cargo is worth something i imagine you know she carried some valuable gums ivory and a quantity of gold  cartwright smiled i do know the goods were on the ships manifest how much gold did the salvage company get  six boxes but this was not all that was shipped  i imagine its all that will be recovered cartwright remarked  the other looked hard at him but his face was inscrutable and he went on well i dont want the cargo and may be forced to heave much of it overboard in order to lighten the hull however if we find stuff worth saving well put it on the beach and ill take a thirdpart of the value and you can send out an agent to tally the goods  very well said the other who approved the latter plan although he imagined cartwright knew something he did not lets be frank he resumed personally i felt from the beginning there was a mystery about the wreck  oh well said cartwright the owners of the boat went broke and the merchant who put the goods on board died his son sold the business to a small company in which he took shares the new house is prosperous and respectable it would be necessary to know your ground well before you bothered them then i have nothing to go upon but a vague supposition in fact the things a risky plunge and if you refuse my offer i wont grumble all the same i doubt if anybody else would give you for example five hundred pounds for arcturus  five hundred pounds is of course ridiculous the other rejoined and they began to bargain  when cartwright left the office he was on the whole satisfied he could finance the undertaking but this was all there would be no margin to cover unforeseen difficulties it was his last gamble and besides his money he staked his post and reputation if he lost he was done for and the house must fall soon after his return he sent for lister and told him about the wreck and his salvage plans  i had some bother to get a captain he said the job has not much attraction for a sober man but brown is not sober hes frankly reckless and irresponsible the strange thing is ive known him make good where cautious men have failed then much depends on the engineer i brought you across to ask if you would go  listers eyes sparkled yes sir ive been looking for a chance like this  cartwright studied him quietly listers keenness was obvious the young fellow liked adventure but cartwright imagined this did not account for all  from one point of view i think the chance is pretty good he said if you can float the wreck and bring her home i expect some of the big salvage companies will offer you a post anyhow youll get your pay and if we are lucky a bonus that will depend on the cost of the undertaking and the value of all we salve  im going lister declared and cartwright noted that he did not inquire about the pay then he hesitated and resumed but i havent got an english chiefengineers certificate  i dont know if its important i expect youll find the adventure is marked by a number of small irregularities however to satisfy the board of trade is my business  then you can reckon on me but theres another thing why do you hope to lift the wreck when the salvage men could not  cartwright smiled i have been asked this before but saw no grounds for satisfying the inquirers curiosity all the same ill enlighten you  he did so and lister looked up sharply he had known cartwright was clever but the old fellow was cleverer than he thought it was possible he had solved a puzzle that had baffled the salvage engineers after all perhaps it was not strange they were baffled they had reckoned on mechanical obstacles cartwright had reckoned on the intricacies of human nature  i expect you have got it sir lister agreed if her bilge was in the sand and the divers couldnt break into the engineroom he paused and laughed a powerful centrifugal pump lifts some water but you cant pump out the atlantic  it looks as if the salvage company tried said cartwright dryly however  he talked about the undertaking giving lister particulars he thought he ought to know and when the young man went off all important plans had been agreed upon soon afterwards cartwright went home and found mrs cartwright had gone to bed he was getting disturbed about her but since the doctor had said she must rest he talked to barbara in the evening he told her about the wreck and smiled when he stated that lister would have control  i think you declared he was the man for an awkward job he said  barbara looked at him rather hard perhaps i did say so you dont imply you are sending mr lister because you thought id like it  not at all said cartwright the things a business venture still your statement carried weight i admit your judgment sometimes is sound  she turned her head and when she looked up and replied her voice was rather hard  you must not trust my judgment i have been cheated  my dear said cartwright perhaps my remark was unlucky but the cleverest of us is sometimes cheated and you were not cheated long well let it go im bothered about your mother she feels the damp and cold and is not picking up perhaps we ought to send her south i must talk to the doctor  in the morning he saw the doctor who said they had better wait for a time and cartwright occupied himself by outfitting the salvage expedition finding it necessary to go to london he called on the gentleman from whom he had bought the wreck a short time ago  when we made the agreement you asked if i knew anybody who would give me five hundred pounds for the boat remarked mr morse just then i did not know but not long since i was offered a better price than yours  ah said cartwright thoughtfully she lay in the sand for some time and nobody bothered about her who was willing to buy  the other smiled a shipbroker stated a sum at which he would take her off our hands it was plain he was an agent but he wouldnt give his customers name i dont imagine you will find out from him i tried  cartwright said it was strange and went off soon afterwards when he went down in the lift he smiled for he thought he saw a light after all his speculation was not as rash as it looked  when he got home mrs cartwright had come downstairs and she joined the others at dinner the doctor said she was stronger and might soon undertake a journey south he suggested the canaries and cartwright approved  if you sail by a cape liner its a short run and after you leave the spanish coast the sea is generally smooth he said since i must stay at the office we must decide who is going with you  hyslop said he would like to go and would do so if it were necessary but to get away just then was awkward grace declared somebody must stop to look after cartwright and the house and she imagined this was her post for all that since she was older than barbara it was hard to see her duty mrs cartwright did not indicate whom she wanted although she glanced at barbara since she was ill she had got very languid and cartwright did not meddle he knew his stepchildren and it was characteristic that grace talked about her duty taking care of an invalid at a foreign hotel had not much charm for grace  very well said barbara i gave you and mortimer first chance because im not important but since you have good grounds for staying we wont argue she turned to mrs cartwright im going because i want to go  mrs cartwright gave her a gentle smile and it was plain that she was satisfied but when she had gone to bed and cartwright was alone he pondered barbara loved her mother and would have gone had she not wanted to go but he thought she did want and had an object he had told her something about his plans and had stated that he would use grand canary as a supply depot for the expedition then he had found the girl studying an atlantic chart in the library barbara had no doubt noted the island lay conveniently near the african coast and knew it was an important coaling station at which steamers bound south from liverpool called cartwright wondered whether she had argued she might see lister at grand canary    chapter xi  the start  rain was falling and the light had hardly reached the opening between the tall warehouses in the dock the water was smooth and shone with dull reflections but the gates were open and the muddy swell the flood tide brought up the river splashed about the entrance ponderous lorries rumbled across a bridge indistinct figures moved and shouted on the pierhead and men in wet oilskins splashed about terriers deck  she was a battered propeller tug and lay against the wall with large cases of machinery lashed to her bulwarks and a stack of coal built up beside the engineskylights her bunkers were full but the fuel she carried would not last very long and coal is dear at foreign ports coils of thick wire rope and diving gear occupied her shallow hold and cartwright was annoyed because she could not take the massive centrifugal pump which he had sent by an african liner some extra coal and supplies were loaded on a clumsy wooden hulk but he durst not risk her carrying expensive machinery  when he talked to the captain in the pilothouse he was on the whole satisfied browns face was flushed and his voice was hoarse but he would pull himself together after he got to sea cartwright knew browns habits when he gave him the job although in an important sense the job was listers to trust the young fellow was a bold experiment but cartwright did so if lister were not the man he thought cartwright imagined his control of the line would presently come to an inglorious end to some extent this accounted for his bringing barbara to see the salvage expedition start he knew the power of love  barbara had not gone up the greasy ladder to the bridge and waited on deck she had left home without much breakfast in the dark and was cold and rather depressed all was gloomy and strangely flat the tug looked small and was horribly dirty coaldust covered rails and ropes grimy drops from the rigging splashed on the trampled black mud on deck the crew were not sober and their faces were black two or three draggled women called to them from the pierhead their voices sounding melancholy and harsh  barbara had not seen lister and wondered where he was until a man plunged out from the neighboring door of the engineroom the abruptness of his exit indicated that he had been rudely propelled by somebody behind and as he lurched across the deck lister appeared at the door his cap was dark with grease his overalls were stained and a black smear ran from his eye to chin  hustle and get that oil drum on the wharf you drunken hog he shouted if i hadnt watched out youd have left half the truck  he stopped when he saw barbara this is very kind he said to her i knew cartwright was on board but hadnt hoped you would come to give us a good sendoff  barbara noted his satisfaction and was moved by something in his voice he looked thin and finedrawn in his stained engineers clothes and his hands were greasy the surroundings were not romantic but somehow they got brighter and her gloom vanished listers eyes sparkled he wore the stamp of strength and confidence  i doubted if my stepfather would bring me but i really meant to come she said for one thing i wanted to ask you  she hesitated for it was hard to strike the right note she had begun to see there was something exciting and perhaps heroic about the adventure the handful of men had undertaken a big thing there was much against them and daunting risks must be run moreover she had studied cartwright and remarked the anxiety he thought he had hid cartwright was rather inscrutable but sympathy had given her power to understand she thought he was engaged in a reckless gamble and could not afford to lose  whatever you want lister declared but she stopped him  i want you to do your best  you can reckon on that anyhow cartwright has hired me im his man  barbara smiled yes i know youre honest and will do all you engaged but in a sense this is not enough i want you to make an extra effort because  she paused and the blood came to her skin when she went on you see its important you should float the wreck and bring her home it means much to my stepfather very much i think hes kind and i love him i feel i ought to help  lister saw her statement was significant and her embarrassment indicated that she knew it was so in fact she had admitted that she knew he would for her sake use all his powers he was moved but he was not a fool the girl wearing her costly furs looked rich and dignified he was a working engineer and conscious of his greasy clothes he loved her but for a time he must be cautious to begin with he would not have her think he made a claim  youre not very logical he replied carelessly when i took the job i undertook to earn my pay cartwright sends me off to float the wreck and if its possible i must make good  i am logical barbara declared while her color came and went one thinks one does ones best but sometimes when the strain comes one can do better it really isnt ridiculous emotion sentiment give one extra force she stopped and resumed in a strangely gentle voice you are young and if you dont make good it wont hurt very much mr cartwrights old he cant try again then hes not my stepfather only hes my friend and i know he trusts you for his sake i must be franki trust you  lister smiled but his voice betrayed him although he thought he used control  very well if its possible for flesh and blood well bring arcturus home thats all the things done with  she gave him her hand and kept the glove with the dark grease stain then seeing there was no more to be said she looked about ragged clouds rolled up from the southwest and the disturbed swell that splashed about the dock gates indicated wind down channel a shower beat upon the engine skylights and barbara moved beneath the bridge a great rope rose out of the water as the men at the winch hauled up the clumsy hulk two or three others dragging a thin stiff wire rope floundered unsteadily across the deck  they look rough and theyre not very sober barbara remarked  lister laughed theyre frankly drunk a pretty hard crowd but brown and i have handled a hard crowd before in fact i reckon cartwright has got the proper men for the job  captain brown is like them said barbara thoughtfully you are not  you havent seen me hustling round when things go wrong  i saw you throw a man out of the engineroom not long since  with a gang like ours one must prove ones claim to be boss at the start anyhow there are different kinds of wastrels and the fellow who gets on a jag at intervals is often a pretty good sort the wastrel one has no use for is the fellow who keeps it up but i see mr cartwright coming and mustnt philosophize  a gateman on the pierhead began to shout to the captain and cartwright gave lister his hand  they are waiting for you and we must get ashore he said well ive given you and brown a big job but i expect youll see me out  well put in all weve got sir said lister quietly  cartwright nodded as if he were satisfied and touched barbara who turned and gave lister a smile  good luck she said and following cartwright went up the steps in the wall  she thought it significant cartwright had left her for some time and had given lister a quick searching glance lister had said nothing about their talk and his promise she had known he would not do so yet this was not because he was clever he had a sort of instinctive fastidiousness she liked his reply to cartwright he would put in all he had got and a man like that had much fine courage resolution and staunch loyalty  when barbara reached the pierhead terriers engines began to throb the propeller churned the green water and the tug bumped against the wall gatemen shouted the big towrope splashed and tightened with a jerk and the hulk began to move then the tugs bow crept round the corner and swung off from the gates the engine throbbed faster and a blast of the whistle echoed about the warehouses brown waved his cap and signed to a man in the pilothouse the hulk swung round in a wide sweep and the adventurous voyage had begun  terrier steaming across the strong current looked small and dingy when she rolled as the helm went over the swell washed her low bulwarks she got smaller until a rain squall blew across from the cheshire side and she melted into the background of dark water and smoke barbara felt strangely forlorn and it was some relief when cartwright touched her arm and they set off along the wall  after the rain the wind freshened and when brown steamed out from the river a confused sea rolled across the shoals the light was not good but a double row of buoys led out to sea the ebbtide was running and terrier made good progress she shipped no water yet and the hulk lurched along without much strain on the rope the rope was fastened to a massive iron hook and ran across a curved wooden horse at the tugs stern sometimes it slipped along the horse and tightened with a bang for the clumsy hulk sheered about when her stern went up one saw an indistinct figure holding the wheel  when they passed the bar lightship lister climbed to the bridge and for a few minutes looked about the plunging red hull to starboard was the last of the mersey marks for the northwest ship was hidden by low clouds ahead the angry gray water was broken by streaks of foam terrier rolled and quivered when her bows smashed a sea and showers of spray beat like hail against the screens on the bridge  shes loggish brown remarked if you dont burn up that coal soon shell wash it off looks like a dirty night and im pushing across for lynas point with the wind at southwest i want to get under the anglesey coast therell be some sea in the channel when we open up holyhead  the boats good said lister engines a bit neglected but theyre running smooth and cool and she has power to shove her along cartwright has an eye for a useful craft  brown nodded the old fellow has an eye for all thats useful i reckon he sees farther than any man i know theres something encouraging about this because the job hes given us looks tough  he stopped for the towrope slipped noisily across the horse there was a clang of iron as the hook took the strain and the captain frowned that hulk is going to bother us before very long  lister seized the slanted rails the lightship had vanished but a bright beam pierced the haze astern ahead the sea was empty gray water rolled beneath low and ragged clouds spray flew about the plunging bows and the tug rolled uneasily lister turned and left the bridge but stopped for a few moments at the engineroom door barbara had stood just opposite where the iron funnelstay ran down her rich furs gave her girlish figure a touch of dignity the color was in her face and her eyes shone  lister knew the picture would haunt him and he would come to the engine door to recapture it when he needed bracing he would need bracing for there were obstacles ahead but he had promised barbara to help cartwright out stepping across the ledge to a slippery platform he went below  part iiithe breaking strain    chapter i  the first struggle  the engineroom floorplates slanted and light and shadow played about the throbbing machinery it looked as if the lamps swung in a semicircle but they did not all else slanted at an everchanging angle the swiveled lamps were still overhead the dark and bulky cylinders cut against the reflected glimmer on the skylights below valvegear and connectingrod flashed across the gloom and the twinkling cranks spun in their shallow pit one saw the big columns shake and strain as the crosshead shot up and down the thrustblocks groaned with the back push of the propeller  a door in the bulkhead was open and now and then a blaze from the stokehold lighted the engineroom shovels clanged and the thud of a hammer jarred upon the throb of machinery men moved about like ghosts their feet made no noise for a moment one saw their sweatstreaked faces and then they vanished lister sat on a toolbox an old pipe in his mouth and was happier than he had been for long for one thing his men were getting sober and he saw they knew their job then he was satisfied with his engines and relished the sense of control he was chief and until the tug came back from africa the engines were his  in the meantime he need not move about it was like listening to an orchestra of which he knew all the instruments and he heard no jarring notes the harmony was good and the rhythm well marked the clash and clang rose and fell with a measured beat but the smooth running of his engines did not account for all listers satisfaction in a sense barbara had given him his job he was her servant doing her work and this was much although he scarcely durst hope for another reward  cartwright had not without careful thought sent lister on board he knew the young fellows staunchness as he knew barbaras and because his need was great had not hesitated to use him and the girl he was old and must be resigned to sit at his desk and plan but as a rule his plans worked and he had a talent for choosing his tools when it was possible he used his tools carefully he hated to overstrain fine material  terriers regular lurch and roll indicated that she was steaming along the coast in some shelter from the wind that blew obliquely off the land by and by however the lurches got violent and when lister heard the thud of water on deck he went up and opening the door on the lee side looked out water splashed against the ledge that protected the engineroom the stack of coal worked and he heard big lumps fall spray blew across the bulwarks and fell in heavy showers from a boat on the skids for a few moments this was all he could distinguish and then he saw slopes of water slanting away from the tugs low side a halfmoon shone for a few moments between ragged clouds and was hidden  lister stepped across the ledge and went aft terrier felt the drag of the hulk astern and he wanted to see how she was towing he heard the iron ring clang on the hook and when he stopped by the horse the big towrope surged to and fro across the arch the hulk steered wildly and if the sea got worse he doubted if they could hold her he knew where he was because he had steamed along the coast on board the cattle boat the anglesey shore was fringed by reefs the tideraces ran in white turmoil across the ledges the tide had now nearly run out but when they turned the corner at carmel point they would meet the flood stream and the big combers the gale drove up channel going to the pilothouse lister lighted his pipe  a fierce night he remarked to brown who peered through the sprayswept glass i reckon youll want to slow down when we make carmel  the house was dark but lister saw the captain turn im bothered brown admitted we ought to push on but while we might tow the hulk under we cant tow her down channel we cant turn and run its blowing down the menai strait like a bellows spout and theres all the mersey sands to leeward we have got to face the sea and try to make holyhead will your engines shove her through  theyll give you six or seven knots head to wind will your tow rope hold  i doubt we have a steel hawser ready but if she breaks the hemp rope shell probably break the wire  lister agreed the thick hemp rope stretched and absorbed the strain the wire was less elastic they were approaching carmel point and holyhead was not far but they must front the gale when they got round the corner in the meantime the engines were running smoothly and lister smoked and waited while the sea got worse flashing lights ahead and the violent lurching indicated that they crept round the point then terrier plunged into a white sea and deck and bulwarks vanished her bows swung out of the foam and lister ran to the door he felt the tug leap forward and knew the rope had gone  he got out in front of brown and plunged down the ladder since terrier must be stopped and turned he was needed water ran from his clothes when he reached a slanted platform and seized a greasy wheel the telegraph gong was clanging and the beat of engines slackened as he followed the orders then the spinning cranks stopped altogether and for a minute or two there was a strange quietness one heard the wind and water splashed in the bilges  lister got the signal ahead slow and when he restarted his engines ran up the ladder he could trust the man he left and wanted to see what was happening it was a moment or two before he could satisfy his curiosity and then a bright beam illuminated the tug and angry water brown was burning a bluelight while terrier crept up to the hulk he meant to pass the fresh hawser but could not launch a boat and lister doubted if the men on the hulk could heave the heavy wire rope on board although one must get near to throw a line it looked as if brown were going alongside  two dark figures crouched on terriers rail like animals ready to spring cut against the blaze brown was going alongside anyhow he was going near enough for the men to jump but the thing was horribly risky if the rolling hulk struck the tug planks and iron plates would be beaten in moreover the men must jump from the slanted rail and if they jumped short their long boots and oilskins would drag them down  it looked as if cartwright knew how to choose men for an awkward job for as the tug got nearer lister saw the men meant to go she swung up on the top of a white sea the hulk swept by spray rolled down with her deck close below the steamers rail one felt they must shock but they did not the dark figures leaped there was a faint shout a line whirled out from terriers bridge and the hulk drove astern then the blue light vanished and lister plunged into the engineroom somehow the thing was done  the gong signaled halfspeed the rhythmic clash of engines began and lister felt terrier tremble as she tightened the rope brown had played his part and listers had begun he wondered whether they could keep the water out of the engineroom they had drifted offshore and now they had opened up the channel the combers leaped on board the seas were not regular they ran in short steep ridges and gave the tug no time to lift while she swung her bows from the foaming turmoil the next swept her deck but to watch the seas and keep the hulk in line was the captains business and lister was occupied by his  standing on a slanted platform with his hand on the throttle he waited for the lurch that lifted the spinning screw when the blades left the water the engines raced with a horrible din and he must cut off steam if he let the engines go something might break when the propeller got hold again the work demanded a firm but delicate touch since the pressure must change with the swiftlychanging load one could not argue when the bows would plunge and the stern swing clear one must know instinctively the muscular effort was not hard but listers face was wet with sweat and when he was slow and the engineroom rang with the clash of machinery his heart beat the big columns that held the cylinders rocked crank and connectingrod spun too fast for him to see there was a confusing flash of steel and a daunting uproar  for the most part he was able to get control before the stern came down moreover he was not using full steam to let her go would swamp the boat and wash the men off the laboring hulk lister knew the rope held because he felt the heavy drag although she rolled and plunged there was no life in terriers movements she was sluggish embarrassed by the load she hauled  lister thought about the men on board the hulk two buffeted by wind and spray must hold the wheel on the short quarterdeck that lifted them above the shelter of the bulwarks forward of this the water rolled about washing on board and pouring out the men could not for a moment slack their watchfulness sweating and straining at the spokes they must hold her straight to let her sheer when she crossed a combers top would break the rope  the strain on the laboring engines indicated that the men held out and lister fixed his thoughts on his machinery one could not see much but while he turned the valvewheel he listened if a bearing got hot or a brass shook loose he would hear the jar an engine running as it ought to run was like a welltuned instrument  he heard no discord the heavy thud of the crossheads flashing between their guides beat time to the clang of the valvegear a pump throbbed like a kettledrum and something tinkled like a highpitched triangle all went well the engines were good and terrier stubbornly forged ahead  by and by the strain was less marked the load was getting lighter and after a time lister let go the wheel and wiped his wet face he could stand on the platform without support the plunges were easy and regular calling a man to relieve him he went to the door  the sea was white but it no longer ran in crested ridges and a vague dark line crossed the foam ahead sometimes part of the line vanished and reappeared like a row of dots with broad gaps between lister knew it was breakwater on the other side anchorlights tossed and in the background a dull reflected illumination indicated a town then the gong rang and lister went back to the platform in a few minutes he would get the signal to stop his engines the first struggle was over brown had made holyhead    chapter ii  the wreck  the night was calm but now and then a faint hot wind blew from the shadowy coast and rippling the water brought a strange sour smell lister did not know the smell brown knew and frowned for he had been broken by the malaria that haunts west african river mouths heavy dew dripped from the awnings on terriers bridge and in places trickled through the material since canvas burns in the african sun brown searched the dark coast with his glasses trying to find the marks he had noted on the chart lister leaned against the rails and mused about the voyage  they had ridden out a winters gale in the bay of biscay and for a night had lost the hulk and the men on board then they went into vigo where listers firemen wrecked a wine shop and it cost him much in bribes to save them from jail he had another taste of their quality at las palmas where they made trouble with the port guards and brown brawled in the cheap wine shops behind the cathedral in fact it was some relief when the captain fell off the steam tram that runs between town and port and a cut on his head stopped his adventures  then they steamed for fourteenhundred miles before the northeast trades with a misty blue sky overhead and long whitetopped seas rolling up astern the trade breeze was cool and bracing but they lost it near the coast and now the air was hot and strangely heavy one felt languid and cheerfulness cost an effort the men had begun to grumble and lister was glad the voyage was nearly over and it was time to get to work  lightning flickered on the sea touching the back of the smooth swell and then for a few moments left all very dark the moon was new the sky was cloudy and the swell ran high for it rolled unbroken and gathering momentum from the antarctic ice when the lightning was bright one saw a low cloud that looked like steam with a white streak beneath that marked the impact of the big rollers on the sandy coast the crash of breakers came out of the dark like the rattle of a goods train crossing an iron bridge  four fathoms at spring tides and a shifting channel brown remarked quoting from a pilotbook the depth however varies with the wind and a stranger must use caution when entering the lagoon he stopped and laughed as he resumed if this was a sober undertaking id steam off and wait for daylight  i reckon it would be prudent said lister dryly  we have nothing to do with prudence brown rejoined our jobs to work in a sun that knocks a white man down and stew in the hot malaria damp the land breeze brings off at night cartwrights orders are to lose no time and i want to finish before the fever finishes me very well when the moon is new highwaters at twelve oclock and along this coast sunsets about six hours later if we wait for noontomorrow it will be four or five oclock before we get on board the wrecki understand the tide doesnt leave her until about four hours ebb if we push across the bar tonight well see her at daybreak and can make our plans for getting to work  lister agreed expenses were heavy and it was important they should not lose a day moreover cartwright had hinted that he expected them to run risks and lister had promised barbara to help him out if brown touched bottom steaming in tug and barge would soon break up but lister was not going to be daunted  ill go down and raise some extra steam he said youll need full pressure to shove her through the surf  he was occupied for some time but when a plume of steam blew from the escapepipe he came up to the door and looked about terriers languid roll was getting sharper mast and funnel swung into a wide sweep sometimes the dark hull lurched up high above the tugs stern and sometimes sank in a hollow the rollers had angry white tops and a belt of filmy vapor that looked luminous closed the view ahead lister knew the vapor was phosphorescent spray flung up by the turmoil on the bar through which they must go if the tug struck and stopped the white seas would beat her down into the sand in the meantime she was using full steam because since tide and surf carried her on one must have speed to steer  the spray cloud got thick and wavered with luminous tremblings when the long rollers broke they came up spangled with green and gold flashes from astern shook their fiery crests about the tug and vanished ahead but one heard them crash lister thought the tug throbbed to the savage concussion he could not hear his engines one heard nothing but the daunting uproar  by and by he felt a shock not a violent shock but as if the boat had touched and was pushing through something soft she slowed and lister saw the black hulk swing up and ride forward on a giant rollers top it looked as if she were coming on board the tug and lister jumped through and slammed the iron door brown would need him now  he heard the roar of water on deck there was a crash of broken glass and a shower fell on his head a cloud of steam and a loud hissing came from the stokehold and he knew the sea that swept the tug had covered the gratings if she stuck the next sea would swamp her and drown the fires but she had not altogether stopped the propeller was beating hard and he opened the throttle wide he felt her move and tremble as if she struggled in the grip of the sand and then lift buoyantly the water that pressed her down had rolled off the deck and the oncoming comber had picked her up and was carrying her along  her progress was obvious one felt the headlong rush and lister thought about a toboggan speeding down an icy slope the roller would bear her on until it broke but if she struck the sand she might not lift again she did not strike there was another wild leap forward a savage plunge and a comber crashed astern it looked as if she had crossed the shoal and lister let go the wheel and got his breath he had used no effort but he gasped and his hand shook  the gong signaled halfspeed and when he slowed his engines the roar of escaping steam pierced the turmoil of the surf this was significant because he could not have heard the steam a few minutes earlier terrier rolled but the rolling was not violent and began to get easy the gong signaled stand by stop he shut the valve and presently heard the anchor plunge and the rattle of running chain then terrier swung languidly and all was quiet but for the monotonous rumble in the background lister gave some orders and went to his room  in the morning he put a greasy jacket over his pajamas and went on deck the land breeze had dropped and it was very calm vague trees loomed in the fog that hid the beach there was a belt of dull heaving water and then the spray cloud closed the view the air was heavy the men on deck moved slackly and listers skin was wet by sweat he felt dull and shrank from effort but when he saw brown in a boat alongside he jumped on board  the light was getting brighter and the wreck lay about a hundred yards off the stump of her broken funnel a bare iron mast a smashed deckhouse and a strip of slanted side rose from the languid swell the rows of plates were red with rust and encrusted by shells when the smooth undulations sank long weed swung about in the sandy water lister thought the story of the wreck was on the surface plain steaming out with a heavy load arcturus had struck the bar the surf had beaten in her hatches broken some plates and afterwards washed her back across the sand then while the captain tried to reach the beach she had sunk in deeper water the story was plausible but if cartwright had found the proper clew it did not account for all  they rowed round arcturus she lay with a sharp list and her other side was under water the tide was beginning to rise and when it crept up her slanted deck they pulled back to the tug  well moor the hulk alongside and rig the diving pumps i think thats all today brown remarked when the sun is low ill go to the factory up the creek and try to hire some native boys on this coast a white man who does heavy work soon gets fever  in the afternoon they took two men and rowed up a muddy creek that flowed into the lagoon but the factory was farther than they thought and when they landed dusk was falling the whitewashed wooden house stood near the bank with a stockaded compound between it and the water it was built on piles and at the top of the outside stairs a veranda ran along the front the compound was tunneled by landcrabs holes and light mist crept about the giant cotton woods behind there was no movement of air a sickly smell rose from the creek and all was very damp  lister and brown went up the stairs and were received by a white man in a big damp room a lamp hung from a beam and the light touched the patches of mildew on the discolored walls there was not much furniture a few canvas chairs a desk and a table flies crawled about the table and hovered in a black swarm round the lamp the room smelt of palm oil and river mud the white man was young but his face was haggard and he looked worn his rather long hair was wet and his duck jacket was dirty it was obvious that he did not bother about his clothes  good of you to look me up i expect you know im montgomery the house is montgomery and raeburn he said however to begin with you had better have a drink ill call my boy  a negro came in and got a bottle and some glasses he was a stronglybuilt fellow with a blue stripe on his forehead and muscular arms and chest but his legs which stuck out from short cotton trousers were ridiculously thin he beat up some frothy liquor in a jug and when he filled the big glasses lister felt disturbed for he knew brown and had noted the quantity of gin the negro used the captain however was cautious and they began to talk lister asked montgomery if he carried on the factory alone  im doing so for a time my clerk died two or three weeks since and i havent got another yet  fever said brown  common malaria perhaps this spot is worse than others because although were beginning to kill mosquitos and poison the drains we cant keep english boys the last two didnt hold out six months  lister got thoughtful he knew the african coast was unhealthy but had not imagined it was as bad as this he said nothing and montgomery resumed i have been forced to lie up and am shaky yet malaria gets us all but as a rule it gets strangers particularly the young soonest looks as if the microbe liked fresh blood  if i was an african merchant id let an agent run my factories brown remarked  montgomery smiled sometimes its necessary for me to come out this factory is perhaps our best and when nevis our agent died i started by the first boat montgomerys is an old house but since the big men combined and the amalgamation built a factory on the next creek we have had some trouble to pull along our capital is small and we cant use uptodate methods in fact i imagine our situation is much like cartwrights when he bought the wreck he no doubt felt some strain but wont you take another drink  brown indicated his glass which still held some liquor and lister refused politely he noted that montgomery knew their object and was surprised since he thought cartwright had not talked much about the undertaking then although montgomery was obviously ill one felt he tried to paint the coast in the darkest colors  what do you think about our job brown asked  i think it a rash experiment and imagine cartwright agrees all the same the old fellows a bold gambler and is perhaps willing to speculate on the chance of getting out of his embarrassments however this is his business and youll no doubt get your wages although you wont float the wreck  what do you reckon the obstacles  fever said montgomery dryly the salvage people lost some men surf will wash the sand about her if the wind comes fresh from the southeast then the sharks may give you some trouble theyre nearly as numerous as they are at lagos roads he paused and added carelessly i expect you know my father loaded arcturus  i heard something about it brown replied all the same cartwright sent us to lift her and we have got to try will you let me hire some of your factory boys  sorry but theyre liberian kroos engaged on a twelvemonths contract to work in my compound and im accountable for them to the liberian government  then what about boys from the bush  montgomery smiled i cant recommend the bushmen theyre a turbulent lot but you might send a present to the headman at the native town up river and its possible hell let you go to see him for all that some cautions indicated the fellows a cunning old rascal  brown looked thoughtful but began to talk about something else and by and by got up montgomery went with him and lister to the steps and when they reached the compound they found the sailors bemused with gin under the veranda brown had some trouble to get the men on board and when they awkwardly pulled away lister was conscious of relief  i agree with the fellow caution is indicated brown observed    chapter iii  a fuel problem  a few days after his visit to the factory lister sat one morning under a tarpaulin they had stretched across the hulk the paint on the canvas smelt as if it burned but the awning gave some shade and one could not front the sun on the open deck the sea breeze had not sprung up and dazzling reflections played about the oily surface of the swell in one place where the shadow of the wreck fell the water was a cool dull green  a row of bubbles slowly crossed the belt of shade stopped and made a frothy patch and then lengthened out a flexible pipe slipped across the edge of the open gangway and lister felt the line he held the line was slack and he knew the diver needed nothing two halfnaked men their skins shining with sweat turned the airpumps handles and the rattle of the cranks cut the dull rumble of the surf brown sitting on a toolbox studied a plan of the wreck cartwright had given him and lister thought it typical cartwright had got the plan the old fellow was very keen  by and by brown looked up and indicated the panting men  we want colored boys for this job and must get a gang i expect you noted montgomery declared his lot were kroos the kroos are hefty boys and pretty good sailors but they come from liberia and there are regulations about their employment you must engage them on a contract hold yourself accountable for their return and so forth all the same my notion is montgomery didnt mean to help  then we had better try the native headman he talked about  brown smiled ive no use for bushmen but didnt see much use in telling montgomery id been on the coast before for one thing his boys were not all kroos you know the kroo by his blue foreheadstripe but i saw two or three with another mark thought them gold coast fantis and a fanti fisherman is useful on board ship in a day or two im going back to see  lister lighted his pipe and weighed the captains remarks on the whole he agreed that it did not look as if montgomery meant to help the fellow was hospitable but hospitality that implied his pressing liquor on the captain and making the sailors drunk had drawbacks brown had used control but lister doubted if his resolution would stand much strain then although montgomerys story about the need for his being on the spot was plausible it was perhaps strange the head of a merchant house would stop for some time at a factory where his clerks died however now lister thought about it montgomery did not state if he had been there long  the fellow was generous with his liquor and his boy can mix a cocktail he remarked  brown grinned on the coast theyre all generous with liquor montgomery knows this but ive a notion you are wondering whether he knows me i reckon not but he knows the kind of skipper you generally meet in the palm oil trade still the types going out now shipowners pay higher they get better men in fact im something of a survival from the old school  he picked up the plan and lister thought about montgomery the man was ill and highlystrung but this was not strange the factory was rather a daunting spot reeking with foul smells and haunted by a sense of gloom lister thought one might get morbid and imaginative if one stopped there long yet he rather liked montgomery there was something attractive about him perhaps if they had met in brighter surroundings when the others health and mood were normal they might have been friends now however he doubted and saw brown was not satisfied  the line he held jerked and he signed to the men at the pump one kept the cranks turning the other went to the top of a ladder lashed to the hulks side the bubbles moved away from the wreck and broke the surface in a fixed sparkling patch the diver was coming up and lister presently helped him on board when they had taken off his copper helmet and unfastened his canvas he leaned against the pump and breathed hard  well said brown after waiting a minute or two for the man to get back his normal breathing  she lies with a sharp list sands high up her starboard bilge engineroom doors jambed but i found the stokehold grating and got some way down the ladder sands washed down and buried the starboard bunkers to clear out the stuff will be a long job  packed hard  the diver nodded like cement i reckon the pump wont move it  lister understood the captains frown sometimes the sand that enters a sunken vessel solidifies with the pressure of surf or tide into a mass that one can hardly dig out this however was not all  starboard bunkers buried brown resumed they were pretty full when she left forcados she had a list to port and they trimmed her by using the coal on that side first well its awkward i reckoned on getting the fuel  there is some coal on the port side said lister  if cartwrights plan and notes are accurate theres not enough to see us out the wrecking pump will burn a lot brown rejoined and turned to the diver did you see any sharks  one big fellow he hung about as if he was curious and i didnt like him near my airpipe but he left me alone the pulps you meet in warm seas are worse than sharks when i was down at the spanish boat crawling through the holes in her broken hull was nervous work once i saw an arm as thick as mine waving in the dark and started for the ladder we blew in that piece of her bilge with dynamite before i went on board again however when ive cleared up a bit ill take mr lister down  the diver got into the boat and rowed to the tug but the others stopped in the shade of the awning they had brought a spare diving dress and before they tried to lift the wreck lister must find out if cartwrights supposition was correct because if cartwright had found the proper clew the job would be easier for all that lister frankly shrank from the preparatory exercise diving in sharkhaunted water had not much charm  in the morning they hauled the tug alongside the wreck and at lowwater rigged a derrick and opened the fore hatch the palm kernels had rotted and a horrible pulpy mass swollen by fermentation rose nearly to the ledge it was glutinous and too thick for the pump to lift since the water that filled the vessel drained away through the broken plates as the tide sank brown kneeling on the hatchcoaming knitted his brows  the stuffs waterborne forced up by its buoyancy he said we may find it looser as we get down in the meantime suctions no use we have got to break it out by hand start your winch and well fill the skip  lister signaled a man on board the tug the winch rattled and a big iron bucket hanging by a wire rope dropped into the hold a gang of men climbed across the ledge and began to cut the slimy mass with spades the surface heaved beneath them like a treacherous bog and the smell was horrible now and then a spade made an opening for the gases to escape and the nauseated men were driven back for all that they filled the skip and the swinging derrick carried the load across the deck and tilted it overboard  the heat was almost unbearable the reflections from the oily swell and wet deck hurt ones eyes and lister noted that the deck did not dry until the sea breeze began to blow the wind brought a faint coolness and drove back the smell but the mens efforts presently got slack the labor was exhausting and one must wear some clothes because the sun burned ones skin they held out until the rising water drove them from the hatch and when they went back to the tug brown looked thoughtful  the men cant keep it up the things impossible a week like this would knock out the lot he said we must use native boys and im going to get some  in the morning lister took his first diving lesson and when the big copper helmet was screwed on and the air began to swell his canvas clothes he shrank from the experiment the load of metal he carried was crushing he could hardly drag his weighted boots across the deck and at the top of the ladder he hesitated watching the bubbles that marked the spot where the diver had vanished then he remembered his promise to barbara and cautiously went down  the dazzling sunshine vanished a wave of misty green closed above the helmet glass hot compressed air blew about his head and his eardrums began to throb then lead and copper lost their weight he felt buoyant and clung to the steps at the bottom he was for a few moments afraid to let go but an indistinct monstrous object came out of the strange green gloom and beckoned him on lister went making an effort for balance because he now felt ridiculously light then the reflections were puzzling for the light came and went with the rise and fall of the swell yet he could see and he followed the diver until they stopped opposite the wrecks port bilge her side went up like a dark wall covered by waving weed  listers head ached and his breathing was labored but not much pressure was needed to keep out the shallow water and the diver had promised to warn him when they had stayed long enough he forced himself to examine the plate the other indicated arcturus was a buttstrapped vessel and a number of the straps had burst plates were smashed and some of the holes were large but in places the iron was drilled and in others patches had been bolted on the salvage company had done part of this work and he thought it possible to make the damage good if they could stop the remaining holes the big pump ought to throw out the water but cartwright had talked about another opening and this would be awkward to reach  signing the diver to go on he followed him round the vessels stern the sand on the other side was high and one could climb on board but lister shrank from the dark alleyway that led to the engineroom for all that he went in and saw the diver had opened the jambed door when he reached the ledge a flash from the others electric lamp pierced the gloom and he tried to forget his throbbing head and looked about  sparkling bubbles from his and the divers helmets floated straight up to the skylights along which they glided and vanished through a hole in the glass the water moving gently with the pulse of the swell broke the beam of light and objects it touched were distorted and magnified the top of the big lowpressure cylinder looked gigantic and the thick columns appeared to bend long weed clung to the platforms from which iron ladders went down but so far as lister could distinguish all below was buried in sand  he had seen enough to clear the engines would be a heavy task and one must work in semidarkness amidst a maze of ladders gratings and machinery to keep signalline and airpipe free from entanglement looked impossible but perhaps when they had broken the surface the pump would lift the sand anyhow he was getting dizzy and his breath was labored  he touched the diver and they went back along the alleyway and round the vessels stern lister was desperately anxious to reach the ladder and it cost him an effort to use control as he went up his dress got heavy and he was conscious of his weighted boots the pressure on his lungs lessened he was dazzled by a strong light and feeling the edge of the hulks deck he got his knee on her coveringboard and lurched forward somebody took off his helmet and lifted the weight from his chest he shut his eyes and for a few moments lay on the deck  well said brown presently you reached the engineroom  lister nodded shes badly sanded up its plain we shant get much coal from the starboard bunkers until we can lift her to an even keel  that will be long brown rejoined and pondered we must have coal he resumed if i cant find another plan you must take the tug to sierra leone and bring a load but well let it go just now the first thing is to hire some negro laborers and as soon as i can leave the wreck ill try again    chapter iv  montgomerys offer  highwater was near and a trail of smoke creeping up along the coast streaked the shining sea brown watched the smoke until two masts and a funnel rose out of the vapor and began to get distinct then he put down his glasses and lighted his pipe the steamer was making for the lagoon  he had not long since gone to the native town up the creek and returned with a gang of laborers so far the negroes had worked well but just now he did not need them and they lay about in the shade some wearing a short waistcloth and some a sheet of cotton that hung from their shoulders the tide had covered the wreck but the big rotary pump was running and since the men had loosened the top of the cargo it lifted the slimy stuff  a plume of steam that looked faint and diaphanous in the strong light blew away from the noisy machine a large flexible pipe rose from the submerged hold and another ran from the pump across the hulks deck from the end of the pipe a thick brown flood poured into the water and stained the green lagoon as the flood tide carried it along the clash and rattle of the engine carried far for the load was heavy and lister was using full steam the boiler was large and the furnace burned more coal than he had thought sometimes palm kernels that had not altogether rotted jambed the fans and he held the valvewheel trying to ease the shocks while the perspiration dripped from his blistered skin when brown indicated the steamer he looked up  shes coming in i think i know the hooker the captain remarked shallowdraught coasting tank goes anywhere shell float for twenty tons of freight the skipper no doubt expects montgomerys got a few hogsheads of oil and its possible hell sell us some coal the parcelsvanners are pretty keen to trade  we want coal said lister and turned abruptly  the pump jarred and stopped the swollen suction pipe shrank and the splash of the discharge died away for some time lister was occupied and when he restarted the engine and looked about again the steamer was steering for the hulk she was a small vessel going light with much of her rusty side above water a big surfboat hung ready for lowering at her rail and a wooden awning covered her bridgedeck when the throb of her engines slackened two or three white men leaned over her bulwarks and looked down at the hulk with languid curiosity their faces were haggard and their poses slack the stamp of the fevercoast was plain  the telegraph rang the engines stopped and a man on the bridge shouted good morning you have taken on an awkward job  his voice was hollow and strained and by contrast browns sounded full and hearty  were getting ahead all the same where are you for  sar leone after we call at montgomerys  then you can fill your bunkers and our coals getting short can you sell us some  the other asked how much brown wanted and how much he would pay then he beckoned a man on the deck to come up and turned to brown again  we might give you two or three surfboat loads but ill see you when we come back we must get up the creek and moor her before the tide ebbs  he seized the telegraph handle the propeller began to turn and when the steamer forged ahead brown looked thoughtful  perhaps id better take a trip up the creek in the evening we want the coal and i dont altogether trust montgomery he said  lister agreed that it might be prudent for brown to go but he was occupied by the pump and they said no more to lift the cargo when the water covered the wrecks hatches and loosened the pulpy mass was easier and he must keep his engine running full speed when they stopped he was exhausted by the heat and the strain of watching and did not go with brown  the captain did not as he had promised come back in the morning but after a time a smoketrail streaked the forest and the steamer moved out on the lagoon lister sent a boy for the glasses since he expected brown was on board but so far as he could see the captain was not the white wave at the bows indicated that the vessel was steaming fast and it did not look as if she was going to stop in order to reach the channel across the bar she must pass near the hulk and lister waved to the captain  what about the coal he shouted  the other leaned out from the rails and lister studying him with the glasses saw a small patch like sticking plaster on his forehead the side of his face was discolored as if it were bruised and frowning savagely he shook his fist  you can go to sar leone or the next hottest spot for your coal he roared and began to storm  lister had sometimes disputed with western railroad hands and marine firemen but he thought the captains remarks equaled the others best efforts in fact it was some relief when a lump of coal thrown by a sailor on the hulk crashed upon the wooden awning and for a moment the savage skipper paused for all that lister stopped the sailor who was going to throw another block  hold on the stuff is valuable he said  the captain began again but the steamer had forged ahead and his voice got fainter and was presently drowned by the beat of the screw lister went back to the pump the machine was running unevenly and sometimes the powerful engine jarred he meant to take it down but so long as the pump sucked up the kernels he durst not stop speed was important they must finish the job and get away before the heat and malaria wore them out in the meantime he was disturbed about brown who ought to have returned and at sunset he started for the factory in the tugs second boat  dark came suddenly and when he landed a hot clammy fog thickened the gloom little fires the factory boys had lighted by ancient custom twinkled in the haze and a yellow beam from the veranda windows touched the towering cottonwoods but all else was dark and the spot was somehow forbidding one felt the gloom was sinister a few miles up the creek the naked bushmen served their savage gods with fantastic rites and the juju men and ghost leopards ruled the shadowy land at the factory white men got sick and died  lister went up the steps and entering the big room saw montgomery in a madeira chair his face was wet by sweat but although his thin form was covered by a blanket he shook with ague brown occupied a rude couch made from two long boxes in which flintlock guns are shipped he lay in an ungainly pose his head had fallen from a cushion and his face was dark with blood his eyes were shut and he breathed with a snoring noise  whats the matter with the captain lister asked although he thought he knew  hes exhausted by his efforts and the worse for liquor montgomery answered with a laugh on the whole i think you had better let him sleep perhaps you remarked that some of the glass is broken and two of my chairs are smashed  lister had not remarked this but he looked about and began to understand he had seen brown throw a spanish landlord out of a grand canary wine shop  your captain arrived when the steamboat men were dining with me montgomery resumed in this country were a hospitable lot and its the custom to send west african factories a supply of liquor every three months mine arrived not long since and if you open the cupboard youll see how much is left but there are cigarettes in the tin box they mildew unless theyre canned make yourself a cocktail i dont want to get up and my boys in the compound playing a drum to keep off the ghosts  lister lighted a cigarette and listened a monotonous rhythmic throb stole into the room and he felt there was something about the noise that jarred  ill cut out the cocktail youre rather generous with your liquor he remarked dryly but how did the trouble brown made begin  by a dispute about some coal  ah said lister who looked at montgomery hard  he imagined the steamboat captain had meant to give them coal since the man had agreed with brown about the price in fact it looked as if he had been willing to do so until he arrived at the factory then he refused and brown no doubt got savage  montgomery was not embarrassed and indicated the unconscious skipper  if cartwrights not losing his keenness its strange he sent out a man like this but perhaps he couldnt get a sober captain to go  brown has some talents for example he got the boys we wanted although you refused to help  we must see if he can keep them montgomery rejoined with a meaning smile in the meantime its not important are you making much progress at the wreck  lister admitted that they were not getting on as fast as he had hoped and when montgomery gave him a keen glance tried to brace himself he felt slack and his head ached he had been getting slack recently and now when he imagined he must be alert to think was a bother  you have not been long at the lagoon but youre beginning to feel the climate the other remarked its perhaps the unhealthiest spot on an unhealthy coast and a white man cannot work in the african sun however you know why the salvage company threw up their contract they lost a number of their men and if you stay until the morning you can see their graves the rest of the gang had had enough and were too sick to keep the pump running  you are not encouraging lister observed  i dont exaggerate i know the country and the caution one must use but you see im ill  the thing was obvious montgomerys hollow face was wet by sweat his eyes were dull and his hands shook lister saw he tried to be cool but thought him highly strung  if youre wise youll give up your post and get away before fever knocks you out montgomery resumed in fact i think i can promise you another berth the house owns two or three factories and at one we are going to start a big oillaunch running to a native market up river then we have bought new machinery for breaking palm nuts and extracting the kernels and have fixed a site for the building at a dry sandy spot i dont claim the neighborhoods healthy but its healthier than this and we have inquired about an engineer would you like the post  i think not im cartwrights man ive taken his pay  montgomery smiled ironically lets be frank i expect you want to force me to make a high bid you dont know the african coast yet but youre not a fool and are beginning to understand the job you have undertaken you cant float the wreck the fellow cartwright sent to help you is a drunken brute and i have grounds for thinking cartwright himself will soon go broke well we need an engineer and ill admit we have not found good men keen about applying if you can run the launch and palmnut plant well give you two hundred pounds bonus for breaking your engagement besides better wages than cartwright pays  lister knitted his brows and lighted a fresh cigarette he was not tempted but he wanted to think and his brain was dull to begin with he wondered whether montgomery did not think him something of a fool because it was plain the fellow had grounds for offering a bribe his doing so indicated that he did not want the wreck floated anyhow montgomery had imagined he would not hesitate to break his engagement for two hundred pounds he must be cautious and control his anger  on the whole it wouldnt pay me to turn down cartwrights job he said two hundred pounds is not a very big wad and if we can take the boat home i reckon the salvage people would give me a good post i must wait until im satisfied the things impossible  when you are satisfied ill have no object for engaging you we want an engineer now montgomery replied  well said lister i reckon that is so he paused and thinking he saw where the other led resolved to make an experiment all the same since you are willing to buy me off it looks as if we had a fighting chance to make good then if i am forced to quit i rather think youd pay me something not to talk for example if i put cartwright wise  montgomery gave him a scornful smile youre keener than i thought but you cant tell cartwright much he doesnt believe he knows ill risk your talking to somebody else  oh well said lister i guess well let it go in the meantime ill get off and take the captain along i allow you have fixed him pretty good but he put his mark on the steamboat man and your furniture  he called the sailors and finding the two who had brought brown to the factory carried him downstairs and put him on board the boat the captain snored heavily and did not awake when they pushed off and with the other boat in tow drifted down the creek lister pondered  he did not know if he had well played his part but he had not wanted montgomery to think his staunchness to his employer must be reckoned on he would sooner the fellow thought him something of a fool when montgomery offered the bribe he probably knew he was rash his doing so indicated that he was willing to run some risk and this implied that cartwrights supposition about the wreck was justified montgomery was obviously resolved she should not be floated and might be a troublesome antagonist for example he had stopped their getting coal and lister was persuaded he had made brown drunk if the control the captain had so far used broke down it would be awkward since montgomery would no doubt supply him with liquor  it was plain the fellow meant to bother them as much as possible but since he had not owned the wrecked steamer his object was hard to see in the meantime lister let it go and concentrated on steering the boat past the mud banks in the creek    chapter v  montgomery uses his power  some time after lister went to the factory he woke one night from disturbed sleep his small room under terriers bridge was very hot and the door and port were open a faint draught blew in and the mosquito curtain moved about his bed the tug rolled languidly and the water splashed against her side farther off the gentle swell broke with a dull murmur across the wreck  this was all but lister was persuaded he had when half awake heard something else at dusk a drum had begun to beat across the lagoon and the faint monotonous noise had jarred it was typically african the negroes used drums for signaling although white men had not found out their code lister had come to hate all that belonged to the fever coast  the drum however was not beating now and he rather thought he had heard the splash of a canoe paddle there was no obvious reason this should bother him but he was bothered and after a few minutes got up and put on a thin jacket on deck it was very hot and he felt the warmth of the iron plates through his slippers in west africa one puts on slippers as soon as one gets out of bed for fear of the jigger insect that bores into ones foot a gentle land breeze blew across the lagoon and the air was hot and damp like steam lister smelt river mud and aromatic forest  there was no moon but he saw the dark hull rise and fall and the flash of phosphorescent foam where the swell washed across the deck in the distance the surf rumbled and now and then there was a peal of thunder lister wondered why he had left his berth he was tired and needed sleep for he had been occupied all day at the pump which was not running well recently he had been conscious of a nervous strain and things that were not important annoyed him then he often woke at night feeling that some danger threatened  walking along the deck he found a white sailor sitting on the windlass drum the man did not move until lister touched his arm  did you hear something not very long since watson  no sir said the other with a start now and then a fish splashed and she got her cable across the stem links rattled that was all  lister thought the man had slept but it was not important since there was no obvious necessity for keeping anchor watch  did you hear something sir the other inquired  i dont know i imagine i did  the sailor laughed as if he understood a queer country ive been here before beautiful bits of it shining surf yellow sands and palms but it plays some funny tricks with white men about half of them at the factories get addled brains if they stay long believe in things the bushmen believe ghosts and magic and such perhaps its the climate but on this coast you get fancies you get nowhere else id sooner take lookout on the focasle in a north sea gale than keep anchor watch in an african calm  lister nodded he thought the man felt lonely and wanted to talk and he sympathized there was something insidious and daunting about the african coast he walked round the deck and then returning to his room presently went to sleep  at daybreak he heard angry voices and going out found brown storming about the deck two white sailors had come back in the boat from the hulk with the news that the negroes berthed on board her had vanished in the night except for three or four whom the sailors had brought to the tug when brown got cooler he went up to the men who squatted tranquilly on the hatch they were big muscular fellows and wore instead of the usual piece of cotton ragged duck clothes  wheres the rest of the gang brown asked  no savvy sah said one some fella put them ting juju on him and he lib for bush  whats a juju lister inquired  hocuspocus magic of a sort the captain growled when a white man knows much about juju his proper place is an asylum he turned to the boys how did them other fellows go  no savvy sah we done hear noting  i expect they were afraid to meddle brown remarked and resumed why did you lib for stop  we accra boy white mans boy them bushman him dn fool too much run in bush like monkey without him cloes  brown knitted his brows and then made a sign of resignation i reckon its all well know well the tides falling and we must shift for some kernels before the sun is hot better start your pump  the pump was soon at work and lister watching the engine mused he wondered how much the accra boys knew or if it was possible the others had stolen away without waking them watson the lookout had heard nothing and lister remembered browns remarks about the juju and thought the boys did know something but were afraid to tell watson had said the country was queer and if he meant fantastic lister agreed there was something about it that reacted strangely on ones imagination in the north american wilds one was so to speak a materialist and conquered savage nature by using wellknown rules in africa one did not know the rules and felt the power of the supernatural it looked as if there was a mysterious malignant force but the pump was running badly and lister saw he must not philosophize  when the sun got hot he stopped for breakfast and afterwards he and brown smoked for a few minutes under the awning  im bothered about the boys going the captain declared theres not much doubt montgomery got somebody to put juju on them bribed a magician to frighten them by a trick since theyre a superstitious lot i reckon we cant hire another gang in this neighborhood however now hes stopped our coal youll have to go to sar leone and may pick up some british kroos about the port  then id better go soon said lister the braces i bolted on the pump wont hold long she rocks and strains the shaft when shes running hard i must get a proper casting made at a foundry besides the engine crossheads worn and jumps about i must try to find a forge and machineshop  theyve got something of the kind at sar leone i dont know about a foundry brown replied take learmont to navigate and start when you like well shift the hulk to leeward of the wreck and she ought to ride out a southeast breeze  lister sailed a few days afterwards and reaching sierra leone found nobody could make the articles he required for all that they must be got and he resolved to push on for grand canary the distance was long he had not men enough for an ocean voyage and would be lucky if he got back to the lagoon in three or four weeks but if he could not mend the pump the salvage work must stop lister knew when to run a risk was justified  after he passed the gambier wind and sea were ahead his crew was short and he was hard pressed to keep the engine going and watch the furnaces he slept when he could in snatches with his clothes on and now and then used an exhausted firemans shovel on the steamy african coast the labor and watchfulness would have worn him out but the cool trade breeze was bracing although he was thin and got thinner the lassitude he had felt at the lagoon vanished and the fatigue he fought against was not the fatigue that kills  in the meantime terrier pushed stubbornly north across the long foamtipped seas that broke in clouds of spray against her thrusting bows she was swept by the sparkling showers but the showers were warm and the combers were not often steep enough to flood her deck for all that their impact slowed her speed she must be driven through their tumbling crests full steam was needed to overcome the shock and the wornout men moved down coal from the stack on deck to feed the hungry fires  listers eyes ached from the glare of smoky lamps that threw puzzling lights about the machinery after long balancing on slanted platforms his back and legs were sore his brows were knit in a steady frown and his mouth was always firm when the strain was over he sometimes wondered what he thought about in the long exhausting watches but remembered nothing except his obstinate concentration on his task the strange thing was he did not think much about barbara although he was vaguely conscious that for her sake he must hold out he meant to hold out perhaps his talents were not numerous but he could handle engines and when it was necessary he could keep awake  at length learmont called him one morning to the bridge and he leaned slackly against the rails his eyes were dull and for some hours he had breathed the fumes of burning tallow a slide had given him trouble he could keep the metal cool on the bridge however the air was keen and sweet and he felt the contrast terrier plunged and threw the spray about but the seas were short as if something ahead broke the wind by and by learmont indicated a lofty bank of mist  teneriffe he said i was halfasleep when i took the sun but my reckoning was not very far out  lister looked up in the distance a sharp white cone rising from fleecy vapor cut the sky and lister with dull satisfaction knew the famous peak nearer the tug was another bank of mist that looked strangely solid but ragged as if it were wrapped about something with a broken outline some minutes afterwards a high dark object like a mountaintop loomed in the haze  grand canary learmont remarked the range behind las palmas town i expect the smudge ahead is the isleta hill  weve made it lister said hoarsely and braced himself now the strain was gone he felt very slack  the sun rose out of the water the mist began to melt and rolling back uncovered a line of surf and a belt of rough hillside then volcanic cliffs a sandy isthmus and a cluster of masts and funnels got distinct and lister fixed the glasses on a white stripe across a cinder hill his hand shook but he steadied the glasses and saw the stripe was a row of huge letters   ary engineering co  he read  his heart beat when he went below luck had given him a hard job but he had put it across soon after terrier arrived he went to the engineering companys office and the manager looked at him curiously then he gave lister some wine and after studying his drawings and patterns said he could make the things required lister drove to the town and going to a spanish barbers started when he saw his reflection in a glass he had not shaved for long and fresh water was scarce on board the tug his face was haggard the engine grime had got into his skin and his eyes were red he was forced to wait and while the barber attended to other customers he fell asleep in his chair when he left the shop he went to a hotel and slept for twelve hours    chapter vi  lister meets an old antagonist  the hotel catalina halfway between las palmas harbor and the town was not crowded and a number of the quests had gone to a ball at the neighboring metropole barbara going out some time after dinner found the veranda unoccupied and sat down mrs cartwright was getting better and did not need her and barbara was satisfied to be alone her thoughts were disturbing and trying to banish them for a few minutes she looked about  the veranda was long and the lights from the hotel threw the shadow of the wooden pillars across the dusty grass barbaras figure was outlined in a dark silhouette she did not wear a hat and since the night was warm had put nothing over her thin dinner dress she looked slender and very young  a strip of parched garden where a few dusty palms grew ran down to the road across which the square block of the metropole cut the shining sea steamers lights swung gently against the dark background of the isleta hill beyond the metropole a white belt of surf ran back to the cluster of lights at the foot of the mountain that marked las palmas one heard the languid rollers break upon the beach and the measured crash of surges on the reefs across the isthmus sometimes when the throb of the surf sank music came from the metropole a distant rattle indicated a steamtram going to the port  the long line across the harbor was the mole and barbara had thought the small steamer lying near its end like terrier there was nothing in the soft blue dark behind the mole until one came to the african coast then barbara firmly turned her glance in a sense she had sent lister to africa but she was not going to think about him yet she must not think about him until she had weighed something else  a few hours since she had got a jar walking in the town she saw a man whose figure and step she thought she knew he was some distance off and she entered a shop and bought a spanish fan she did not want perhaps her disturbance was ridiculous but the man was very like shillito and their meeting at the busy port was not impossible las palmas was something like an important railway junction numerous steamers called and passengers from all quarters particularly south america and the west indies changed boats then barbara understood that a fugitive from justice was safer in south and central america than anywhere else she wondered with keen anxiety whether the man had seen her  she knew now she had not loved shillito he had cunningly worked upon her ignorance discontent and longing for romance illumination had come on board the train but although she had found him out and escaped she had afterwards felt herself humiliated and set apart from happy girls who had nothing to hide the humiliation was not altogether earned and the people who knew about her adventure were not numerous but they were all the people for whom she cared when she thought about it she hated louis shillito  the steamtram stopped at the metropole and went on to the port trailing a cloud of dust when the rattle it made began to die away barbara roused herself with a start from her moody thoughts a man was coming up the path and when he reached the steps she shrank back against the wall the light from the hotel touched his face and she saw it was shillito  anger conquered her shrinking for barbara had pluck and her temper was hot when shillito lifting his hat advanced she got up and stood by a pillar her skin had gone very white but her eyes sparkled and her hands were clenched shillito bowed and smiled  it looks as if i was lucky he remarked and barbara imagined his not finding mrs cartwright about accounted for his satisfaction  i suppose you saw me in the calle mayor she said  he nodded you went into a shop your object was pretty obvious i allow it hurt  barbara gave him a scornful glance the statements ridiculous do you imagine you can cheat me now as you cheated me in canada  in one way i did not cheat you when i said i loved you i was honest  i doubt it all was dishonest from the beginning you taught me deceit and made me ashamed for my shabbiness for your sake i tricked people who loved and trusted me but to you i was rashly sincere i trusted you and was willing to give up much in order to marry you  you mean you thought you were willing until you knew the cost shillito rejoined then you saw you couldnt make good and resolved to turn me down  the blood came to barbaras skin but she fronted him steadily  i had found you out had you been something of the man i thought i might have gone with you and helped to baffle the police but you were not you were very dull and played a stupid part when you thought you had won and i was in your power i knew you for a brute  shillito colored but forced a smile perhaps i was dull i was desperate you had kept me hanging round the summer camp when i knew the police were on my track and i had been put wise they might hold up the train a man hitting the trail for liberty doesnt use the manners of a highbrow carpetknight i reckoned you were human and your blood was red  ah said barbara i was very human although i was afraid i felt all the passion hate can rouse you declared i must stay with you because i durst not go back i had broken rules and my fastidious relations would have no more to do with me something like that in a sense it wasnt true but you said it with brutal coarseness when i struck you i meant to hurt i looked for something that would hurt  she stopped and struggled for calm to indulge her anger was some relief but she felt the man was dangerous and she must be cool there was not much use in leaving him and going to her mother because he would no doubt follow and disturb mrs cartwright it was unlucky her stepfather had not arrived he was coming out but his boat was not expected for a day or two  oh well said shillito lets talk about something else i didnt calculate to meet you at las palmas but when i saw you in the calle i hoped you might after all be kind for old times sake however its obvious you have no use for me and if you are willing to make it easier ill pull out and leave you alone  barbara gave him a keen glance she had known he wanted something  how can i make it easier for you to go  you dont see well ive had some adventures since you left me on board the train i had money but id waited too long to negotiate some of the bonds and my partner robbed me i made san francisco and found nothing doing there went down the coast to chile and got fixed for a time at a casino in which i invested the most part of my wad one night a chileno pulled his knife on another who cleaned him out and when the police got busy the casino shut down i pushed across for argentina but my luck wasnt good and i made las palmas not long since on board an italian boat on the whole i like the dagos and reckoned i might try cuba or perhaps the philippines  a lopez boat sails for havana in two or three days barbara interrupted  that is so shillito agreed smiling because he noted her relief the trouble is i havent much money five hundred pounds would help me along  you thought i would give you five hundred pounds  sure said shillito coolly youre rich anyhow mrs cartwright is rich and i reckoned you would see my staying about the town has drawbacks for one thing the english tourists are a gossiping lot it ought to pay you and your mother to help me get off  barbara tried to think the drawbacks shillito indicated were plain and as long as he stayed at las palmas she would know no ease of mind but she had not five hundred pounds and mrs cartwright must not be disturbed moreover one could not trust the fellow he might take the money and then use his power again he had power to humiliate her but unless she was willing to meet all his claims she must resist some time  i imagine you put your importance too high she said you can stay if you like i certainly will not bribe you to go away  he studied her for a few moments barbara looked resolute but he thought her resolution forced  very well since i cant start for cuba without money i must find an occupation at las palmas and i have a plan you see i know some spanish and something about running a gambling joint the people here are sports and one or two are willing to put up the money to start a club that ought to attract the english tourists if i found the thing didnt pay before you went back i could quit and get after you  i think not said barbara desperately if you came to england a cablegram to the canadian police  shillito laughed you wouldnt send a cablegram if i was caught i could tell a romantic story about the girl who helped me get off no im not going to bother about your putting the police on my trail  he turned his head and barbara clenched her hand for a rattle of wheels in the road broke off as if a tartana had stopped at the gate if the passengers from the vehicle were coming to the hotel she must get rid of shillito before they arrived  you waste your arguments she declared i will not give you money if you come back i will tell the mayordomo you are annoying me and he must not let you in  the plans not very clever shillito rejoined if i made trouble for the hotel porters the guests would wonder and when people have nothing to do but loaf they like to talk i expect youd find their curiosity awkward he paused and laughed when he resumed youre embarrassed now because somebody will see us  barbara was embarrassed a man was coming up the path and she knew her figure and shillitos cut against the light when the stranger reached the veranda he would see she was disturbed but to move back into the gloom where shillito would follow her would be significant she thought he meant to excite the others curiosity  the man stopped for a moment at the bottom of the steps and barbara turned her head since she imagined he would think she was quarreling with her lover then he ran up the steps and when he stopped in front of shillito her heart beat fast it was lister and she knew he had remarked her strained look for his face was very stern  hallo he said are you bothering miss hyslop again he glanced at barbara i expect the fellow is bothering you  for a moment barbara hesitated but she had borne a heavy strain and her control was going besides one could trust lister and he knew  she signed agreement and he touched shillito  get off the veranda  shillito did not move his pose was tense and he looked malevolent  you wont help miss hyslop by butting in like a clumsy fool the things too delicate for you to meddle  get off the veranda lister shouted and threw shillito back  he was highly strung and worn by want of sleep and exhausting labor but he had some notion of all barbara had borne on shillitos account although perhaps caution and tact were indicated he was going to use force when shillito struck him he seized the fellow and rocking in a savage grapple they fell with a crash against the rails lister felt the others hand at his throat and straining back jerked his head away while he tried to lift his antagonist off the ground he pulled him from the rails and they reeled across the veranda and struck the wall  a neighboring window rattled with the shock the heavy tramp of their feet shook the boards and barbara knew the noise would soon bring a group of curious servants to the door besides all the guests had not gone to the metropole yet she could not meddle the mens passions were unloosed they fought like savage animals driven by an instinctive fury that would not vanish until one was beaten she looked on trembling and helpless while they wrestled with swaying bodies and hands that felt for a firmer hold her face was very white and she got her breath in painful gasps there was something horribly primitive about the struggle but it fascinated  in the meantime lister was conscious that he had been rash shillito was muscular and fresh but he was tired it was plain he could not keep it up for long moreover unless the fight soon ended people would come to see what the disturbance was about this would be awkward for barbara he wanted to tell her to go away but could not he was breathless and shillito was trying to choke him  afterwards he knew he was lucky they had got near the steps and he threw shillito against the post at the top the jar shook the other his grasp got slack and lister saw that for a moment the advantage was his using a desperate effort he pushed his antagonist back and struck him a smashing blow shillito vanished and a crash in the gloom indicated that he had fallen on an aloe in a tub by the path lister leaned against the rail and laughed because he knew aloe spikes are sharp  then he heard steps and voices in the hotel and turned to barbara his face was cut his hat was gone and his white jacket was torn he looked strangely savage and disheveled but barbara went to him and her eyes shone lister stopped her  dont know if ive helped much but you must get off he gasped people are coming go in by another door  he turned and plunged down the stairs and barbara seeing that shillito had vanished ran along the veranda a few moments afterwards she stood by the window of her room and saw a group of curious servants and one or two tourists in the path at the bottom of the steps it looked as if they were puzzled and the mayordomo gravely examined listers battered hat  barbara went from the window and sat down she was horribly overstrained and wanted to cry but she began to laugh and for some minutes could not stop she must get relief from the tension and after all in a sense the thing was humorous    chapter vii  barbaras refusal  in the morning barbara went to the catalina mole the short lava pier was not far off and one got the breeze although the hotel garden was hot besides she did not want to meet people and talk about the strange disturbance on the veranda on the whole she thought nobody imagined she could satisfy the general curiosity finding a block of lava in the shade she sat down and looked about  a boat crossed the harbor mouth swinging up on the smooth swell and vanishing when the undulations rolled by a tug towed a row of barges to an anchored steamer and the rattle of winches came down the wind in the background clouds of dust blew about the coaling wharfs and a string of flags fluttered from the staff on the isleta hill barbara beckoned a portguard and inquired what the signal meant  the spaniard said an african mailboat from england was coming in and barbara was conscious of some relief cartwright was on board and would arrive sooner than she had thought the boat had obviously not called at madeira the timebills stated cartwright would know how to deal with shillito if he bothered her again in the meantime she mused about lister she had thrilled when he ran up the steps at the hotel but in a sense his arrival just then was awkward  she turned her head for the sunshine on the water dazzled her eyes and the port was not attractive the limekilns coalwharfs and shabby lava houses had for a background volcanic rocks bare cinder slopes and tossing dust besides she wanted to think she would see lister soon she wanted to see him but she shrank for one thing the line she ought to take was hard  by and by she heard a rattle of oars thrown on board a boat behind the neighboring wall somebody shouted and lister came up his white clothes were clean but crumpled and barbara smiled when she saw his hat was new crossing the lava pavement he stopped opposite her and she noted a piece of stickingplaster on his cheek  may i join you for a few minutes he asked  of course she said graciously  lister sat down the sailors had gone off and except for an officer of the commandancia nobody was about  i was going to the hotel to look for you for one thing i reckoned i ought to apologize when i came into the veranda and saw shillito  i think you stopped for a moment at the bottom of the steps barbara remarked  he colored but gave her a steady look that is so i admit the things ridiculous but at first i felt id better pull out then i noted something about your pose you looked angry  ah said barbara it was a relief to see i was angry you were satisfied then  i was really satisfied before it was impossible you should engage a brute like that in friendly talk anyhow i took the wrong line and might have made things awkward in fact the situation needed a lighter touch than mine all the same when i saw the fellow was bullying you  you butted in barbara suggested smiling although her heart beat  like a bull moose said lister with a frown i ought to have kept cool used caution and frozen him off by a few short arguments you can picture cartwrights putting across the job after all however i dont know the arguments i could have used and i remembered how the fellow had injured you  he saw barbaras color rise and stopped for a moment it looked as if he had not used much caution now  since i thought you in africa i dont understand how you arrived she began  the things not very strange said lister i saw your name in a visitors list and meant to ask for you in the morning then i ran up against shillito who didnt know me and when he got on board the steam tram i hired a tartana thought he might mean trouble and id better come along  well he resumed im sorry i handled the job clumsily since i might have hurt you worse but i hated the fellow on my own account and saw red perhaps it was lucky i was able to throw him down the steps because i expect neither of us meant to quit until the other was knocked out he paused and added with a laugh now im cool i think the chances were i got knocked out last time we met he threw me off the car i reckon my luck has turned  barbara studied him and was moved by pity and some other emotions he was very thin and his face was pinched he looked as if he were exhausted by the work she had sent him to do barbara admitted that she had sent him before cartwright planned the salvage undertaking she had declared he would find lister the man for an awkward job  you ran some risk for my sake and i must acknowledge a fresh debt she said i would sooner be your debtor than anothers but sometimes im embarrassed you see i owe you so much  you have paid all by letting me know you lister declared  she was quiet for a few moments and then asked are you making much progress at the wreck  our progress is slow but we are getting there lister replied and seeing her interest narrated his and browns struggles and his long voyage with a short crew on board the tug  the story was moving and barbaras eyes sparkled lister had borne much and done all that flesh and blood could do he was the man she had thought and she knew it was for her sake that he had labored  its a splendid fight she said  we havent won yet he replied and was quiet for a few moments then his look got very resolute and he went on all the same if the thing is anyhow possible im going to win you see ive got to win when cartwright engaged me i was engineer on board a cattle boat a man of no importance without friends or money and with no particular chance of making good now ive got my chance if we put across the job a big salvage company turned down ill make my mark somebody will give me a good post ill have got my foot on the ladder that leads to the top  i wish you luck said barbara i expect you will get near the top  if you are willing you can help  ah said barbara with forced quietness i think not  he stopped her i didnt expect to find you willing my business is to persuade you and i mean to try well i wasnt boasting and my drawbacks are plain but if i make good in africa some will be cut out and you can help me remove the others ive long wanted you and now my lucks turning i was going to catalina to tell you so if brown and i float arcturus will you marry me  barbaras color came and went but she said quietly when you came to the hotel in the evening you met shillito  i did said lister with incautious passion if i had killed the brute id have been justified however i threw him on to the aloe tub and ran off the thing was grotesquely humorous a boys fool trick  you ran off for my sake said barbara i liked you for it i like you for many things but i will not marry you  he saw she was resolute her mouth was firm and her hand was tightly closed he thought he knew the grounds for her refusal and his heart sank barbara was stubborn and very proud moreover the situation was awkward but the awkwardness must be fronted  lets be frank perhaps you owe me this he urged since you allow you do like me whats to stop our marrying  for one thing my adventure in canada she replied and turned her head  lister put his hand on her arm and forced her to look up now youre clean ridiculous shillito cheated you hes a plausible wastrel but you found him out it doesnt count at all besides nobody but your relations know  you know said barbara and getting up started along the mole  lister tried to brace himself for he saw she could not be moved yet there was something to be said  you are the girl i mean to marry he declared some day perhaps youll see youre indulging a blamed extravagant illusion and im going to wait when youre logical ill try again  barbara forced a smile sometimes i am logical i feel im logical now but i have left my mother alone rather long and you must let me go  lister went with her to the road and got on a tram going to the town he was hurt and angry but not altogether daunted barbaras ridiculous pride might break and she was worth waiting for when he returned on board a small african liner had anchored not far off and while he watched the boats that swarmed about the ship one left the others and came towards the tug the spanish crew were pulling hard and a passenger occupied the stern learmont lounging near turned his glasses on the boat  im not sorry you are boss he said the old man is coming  a few minutes afterwards cartwright got over the tugs rail his face was red and he looked very stern  why have you left the wreck he asked lister  i came for some castings i couldnt get at sierra leone the pump and engine needed mending  then wheres brown  hes busy at the lagoon sir theres enough to keep him occupied unless the pump plays out before i get back  cartwright looked relieved but asked meaningly did you know mrs cartwright and miss hyslop were at las palmas  i did not know until yesterday evening twentyfour hours after i arrived but well talk about this again i expect you want to know how we are getting on at the wreck  cartwright nodded i think my curiosity is natural lets get out of the sun and if you have liquor on board order me a drink when the mailboat steamed round the mole and i saw terrier i got a nasty jolt  lister took him to the captains room and gave him some sour red canary wine cartwright drained his glass and looked up with an ironical smile  if you use stuff like this brown ought not to be tempted much however you can tell me what you have done at the lagoon and the difficulties you have met you neednt bother to smooth down browns extravagances i knew the captain before i knew you  lister told his story and when he stopped cartwright filled his glass raised it to his lips and put it back with a frown  send somebody along the mole to garcias shop for two or three bottles of his amontillado and white muscatel charge the stuff to ships victualing when you got brown out of the factory did you think it possible he had a private stock of liquor  im satisfied he had not montgomery gave him the liquor and i imagine meant to give him too much  it looks like that cartwright agreed if we take something i suspect for granted montgomerys opposition would be logical i imagine you know part of the cargo was worth much expensive stuff in small bulk you see  i have studied the cargolists and plans of the holds sir  cartwright nodded well find out presently if my notion how the boat was lost is accurate the cargos another thing there may have been conspiracy between merchant and shipowner i dont know yet but if it was conspiracy this would account for much some of the gum shipped was very costly and african alluvial gold washed by the negroes has been found mixed with brass filings  montgomery frankly stated his father loaded the vessel  his frankness may have been calculated cartwright rejoined and knitted his brows yet ill admit the young fellows name is good at liverpool and all he sells is up to sample his father was another sort but he died and the house is now well run however in the meantime well let it go  he looked up for a fireman carrying a basket came in cartwright took the basket and opened a bottle of white wine  take some of this he said i understand you have seen mrs cartwright  not yet sir said lister quietly i met miss hyslop soon before your boat arrived perhaps i ought to tell you i asked her if she would marry me if we floated the wreck  ah said cartwright but why did you add the stipulation  it ought to be obvious if we put the undertaking over i expect to get a post that will enable me to support a wife although she might be forced to go without things id like to give her  i see said cartwright with some dryness well i dont know if barbara is extravagant but she has not used much economy was she willing to take the plunge  she was not sir  then i suppose she stated her grounds for refusing  that is so said lister perhaps miss hyslop will tell you what they are i will not  cartwright looked at him hard all the same i imagine you did not agree  i did not agree if i make good at the wreck i will try again  barbara is pretty obstinate cartwright remarked with a smile and then filled listers glass i must go but come to the hotel in the morning we must talk about the salvage plans  he went off but when the boat crossed the harbor he looked back at the tug with twinkling eyes lister was honest and had not asked barbara to marry him until he saw some chance of his supporting a wife since barbara was rich the thing was amusing all the same it was possible the young fellow must wait barbara exaggerated and indulged her imagination but she was firm    chapter viii  cartwright gets to work  the morning was hot and barbara sitting on the hotel veranda struggled against a flat reaction the glitter of the sea hurt her eyes and the dust that blew in clouds from the road smeared her white dress her mouth dropped and her pose was languid to refuse lister had cost her much and although she had done so because she felt she ought the sense of having carried out a duty was not remarkably soothing it was a relief to know she need not pretend to cartwright who occupied a basketchair opposite one could not cheat her stepfather by false cheerfulness  when you disappointed lister you took the prudent line he said the young fellow has some talent but he has not yet made his mark i approve your caution and expect your mother will agree  i wasnt cautious i didnt argue at all like that barbara declared besides i havent told mother she mustnt be disturbed  cartwright looked thoughtful to some extent he was sympathetic and to some extent amused  then i dont altogether understand why you did refuse  oh well said barbara and the blood came to her skin for one thing mr lister waited for some time and then asked me to marry him after shillito arrived she paused and her look got hard when she resumed perhaps he thought he ought sometimes hes chivalrous  cartwright imagined barbara was badly hurt and this accounted for her frankness  your reasoning isnt very obvious but i think i see a light he said its possible however he asked you because he wanted you and there is an explanation for his waiting i understand he hesitated because he doubted if he could support a wife it looks as if mr lister didnt know you were rich  he doesnt know i think i didnt want him to know barbara admitted with some embarrassment  shillito knew but one learns caution cartwright remarked well shillito became somewhat of a nuisance and i dont imagine you want him to look us up again i rather think i must get to work  i hate him said barbara passionately until your boat was signaled i was horribly alarmed but then the trouble went i felt i neednt bother after you arrived her voice softened as she added you are a clever old dear one feels safe while youre about  thank you said cartwright i am old but i have some useful talents well is there something else about which you want to talk  barbara hesitated there was something for which she meant to ask although her object was not very plain perhaps shillitos demand for money had made her feel its power moreover she was independent and liked to control her affairs  my birthday was not long since and im entitled to use some of the money that is mine  that is so cartwright agreed with a twinkle all the same youre not entitled to use much until you marry and you have just sent off one lover would you like me to send you out a sum  i think id like a check book and then i neednt bother people  cartwright nodded barbara was not extravagant very well i expect we can trust you and the money is yours i can probably arrange for a business house to meet your drafts ill see about it when im in the town  he started for las palmas presently and after some inquiries stopped at a spanish hotel where he found shillito the latter frowned when he saw cartwright but went with him to the courtyard and they sat down in the shade  have you bought your ticket for havana cartwright asked  i have not said shillito so far i havent decided to leave las palmas  then i imagine you had better decide now if money is a difficulty i might lend you enough for a secondclass passage but that is all  shillito smiled if you want to get rid of me youll have to go higher i reckon its worth while  i think not said cartwright dryly in fact since i can get rid of you for nothing i doubt if its worth the price of a cheap berth on board the lopez boat however ill risk this in order to save bothering  bluff you can cut it out and get to business  very well your call at the catalina didnt help you much and if you come again you will not be received by miss hyslop but by me i have met and beaten fellows like you before my offers a secondclass berth you had better take it  not at all said shillito before long youll want to raise your bid  cartwright got up and crossed the flags the other frowned and hesitated but let him go when he reached the street cartwright called his tartana and told the driver to take him to the british viceconsuls the viceconsul was a merchant who sometimes supplied the cartwright boats with stores and he gave his visitor a cigar cartwright told him as much about shillito as he thought useful and the viceconsul weighed his remarks  the extradition of a criminal is a long and troublesome business he observed in the meantime the fellow must not be allowed to annoy you and i imagine my duty is to inform the spanish justicia don ramon is tactful and i think will handle the situation discreetly suppose we go to see him  he took cartwright to an old spanish house with the royal arms above the door and a very dignified gentleman received them politely he allowed the viceconsul to tell cartwrights story in castilian and then smiled  señor graham has our thanks for the warning he has brought he said in this island we are sportsmen we have our cockpits and casinos but our aim is to develop our commerce and not make the town a monte carlo then the play at the casinos must be honest our way with cardsharpers is stern  the viceconsuls eyes twinkled he knew don ramon who resumed señor cartwrights duty is to inform the british police no doubt he will do so but until they apply to our justicia in the proper form i cannot put in prison a british subject for a robbery he did not commit on spanish soil perhaps however this is not necessary  on the whole i dont think it is necessary cartwright remarked the fellow is a dangerous scoundrel but i dont know that it is my duty to give you the bother extradition formalities would imply still you may find him a nuisance if he stays long  don ramon smiled i imagine he will not stay long my post gives me power to deal with troublesome foreigners well i thank you and can promise you will not be disturbed again  he let them go and when they went out the viceconsul laughed  you can trust don ramon for one thing he knows i have some claim in this country a merchant finds it pays to acknowledge fair treatment by the men who rule for all that don ramon is just and uses prudently a power we do not give british officials the spanish know the advantages of firm control and i admit their plan works well  shillito did not return to the catalina when he was playing cards for high stakes one evening two guardias civiles entered the gambling house and one touched shillitos arm  you will come with us señor he said politely  shillito pushed back his chair and looked about the man carried a pistol and the civil guards have power to shoot his comrade watched the door  what is your authority for bothering me he asked  it is possible don ramon will tell you he is waiting said the other he took shillito to the house with the coat of arms and don ramon sending off the guards indicated a chair  we have heard something about you and do not think you ought to remain at las palmas he remarked in fact since we understand you meant to go to cuba we expect you to start by the lopez boat  i dont mean to go to cuba shillito rejoined  don ramon shrugged well we do not mind if you sail for another country numerous steamers touch here and the choice is yours so long as you leave las palmas  shillito looked at him hard i am a british subject and stay where i like  you are obstinate señor but i think your statements rash don ramon observed a british subject is governed by british laws but we will not talk about this  he paused and studied shillito who began to look disturbed one would sooner be polite and take the easy line don ramon resumed so far this is possible because you are not on the list sent our government by the british police but we have power to examine foreigners about whom we are not satisfied well i doubt if you could satisfy us that you ought to remain and when we begin to investigate a demand for your extradition might arrive if you forced us to inquire about you a cablegram would soon reach london  shillito saw he was beaten and got up  ill buy my ticket for havana in the morning he replied  the lopez liner was some days late and in the meantime lister haunted the office of the engineering company at length the articles he needed were ready and one afternoon cartwright hired a boat to take him and barbara across the harbor terrier lay with full steam up at the end of the long mole and when her winch began to rattle cartwright told the spanish peons to stop rowing the tugs mooring ropes splashed her propeller throbbed and she swung away from the wall  she was rusty and dingy the screens along her bridge were cracked and burned by the sun the boat at her rail was blackened by soot and when she rolled the weed streamed down from her waterline she looked very small and overloaded by the stack of coal on deck the wash round her stern got whiter ripples ran back from her bows and when she steamed near cartwrights boat her whistle shrieked cartwright stood up and waved learmont on the bridge touched his cap but for a few moments barbara fixed her eyes on terriers deckhouse then she blushed and her heart beat for she saw lister at the door of the engineroom he saw her and smiled  the tugs whistle was drowned by a deeper blast a big liner painted black from waterline to funneltop was coming out and cartwrights boat lay between her and the tug barbara gave the great ship a careless glance and then started for she read the name at the bow this was the havana boat  studying the groups of passengers at the rails she thought she saw a face she knew the face got distinct and when the liners lofty side towered above the boat shillito looking down lifted his cap and bowed with ironical politeness barbara turned her head and tried for calm while she watched the tug  lister had not gone barbara knew he would not go so long as he could see the boat and standing up with her hand on cartwrights shoulder she waved her handkerchief listers hand went to his cap but he was getting indistinct and terrier had begun to plunge on the long swell outside the wall she steered for open sea the big black liner followed the coast and presently cartwright signed the men to pull then he looked at barbara and smiled for he knew she had seen shillito  things do sometimes happen like that he said i think the fellow has gone for good but the other will come back    chapter ix  lister makes good  arcturus holds were empty and a long row of oil puncheons occupied the beach but the men who had dragged the goods from the water were exhausted by heavy toil in the scorching sun and some were sick the divers had bolted on plates to cover the holes in the vessels bilge before one fell ill and his mates nerve went the heat and poisonous vapors from the swamps had broken his health and he got a bad jar one day his airpipe entangled and the pumpgang dragged him unconscious to the top  afterwards for the most part lister undertook the diving but for long his efforts to reach the floor of the engineroom were baffled to crawl across slanted gratings and down weedy ladders while airpipe and signalline trailed about the machinery was horribly dangerous but he kept it up although he got slacker and felt his pluck was breaking then one afternoon he knew he could not go down again and he stayed under water long  brown standing by the airpumps looked at his watch and waited anxiously the bubbles broke the surface above the wreck and the signalline was slack but lister had been down longer than he ought he wars not a diver and the others who knew their job had come up sooner then brown had other grounds for anxiety if lister were beaten their chance of floating the wreck was small  at length the bubbles began to move towards the hulk the ladder shook and a dull red reflection shone through the water then the copper helmet broke the surface rose a few inches and stopped and brown ran to the gangway lister was exhausted and his wornout body could not meet the change of pressure they dragged him on board and took off his helmet and canvas dress for some minutes he lay like a log and then opened his eyes and looked at brown  cartwright was on the track he gasped we can go ahead  the sun was low but the pitch in the seams was liquid and smeared the hot planks and brown pulled lister into the shade for a time he was quiet but by and by he said when the tide falls well start the pump and let her go all night i must get up and tell jones to clean the fire  ill tell him you stay there until we get some food brown replied  the cook served the meal on deck but they had hardly begun when he lighted a stormlamp as soon as the red sun dipped thick vapor floated off from the swamps the water got oily black and dark clouds rolled across the sky flickering lightning illumined the tumbling surf and sandy beach but there was no thunder and the night was calm the hulk and tug were moored at opposite sides of the wreck forward of her engine room and thick wire ropes that ran between them had been dragged back under the vessel for some distance from her bow the ropes however were not yet hauled tight when the cook took away the plates brown made a rough calculation  we have caulked all hatches and gratings forward and stopped the ventilators he said i reckon the water will leave the deck long enough for the pump to give her foreend some buoyancy if she rises with the flood tide well heave the cables aft until we can get a hold that will lift her bow from the ground then you can pump out the fore hold and well make a fresh start aft well soon know if cartwrights notion is correct  we know now ill satisfy you in the morning lister rejoined and his confidence was not exaggerated  a steamers hull below her loadline is pierced in places to admit water for the condensers and ballast tanks lister had found some inlets open but now they were shut  ill own old cartwrights a great man brown said thoughtfully when he takes on a job he studies things all round the salvage folks no doubt reckoned on the possibility that the valves were open but they couldnt get at the controls and didnt know all cartwright knew he paused and added with a laugh i wonder how much the other fellows got for the job but its time we started  lister got up with an effort and went to the pump which presently began to throb the mended engine ran well and the regular splash of water flung out from the big discharge pipe drowned the languid rumble of the surf the hull shook shadowy figures crossed the beam of light from the furnace and vanished in the dark twinkling lamps threw broken reflections on the water that looked like black silk lightning flashed in the background and when the swell broke with phosphorescent sparkles about the wreck lister marked the height the pale illumination crept up her plates she would not lift that tide but the pump was clearing the hold and he hoped much water was not coming in if the leakage was not excessive her bow ought to rise when the next tide flowed  for some hours he kept his watch dragging himself wearily about the engine and pump he had helpers but control was his and to an engineer a machine is not a dead mass of metal lister so to speak felt the pump had individuality and temperament like a spirited horse sometimes it must be humored and sometimes urged it would run faster for a man whose touch was firm but light than for another perhaps he was fanciful and he was certainly overstrung but he imagined the big rattling machine knew his hand  at length when he looked at the gauge glass he found he could not see the line that marked the waterlevel his head swam and his legs shook and calling a fireman to keep watch he sat down in the coal he wanted to get to the awning out of the dew but could not and leaning against the rough blocks he went to sleep  in the morning he knew the fever that bothered him now and then had returned for all that he must hold out and he began his labor in the burning sun when the flood tide rippled about the wreck it was obvious the pump was getting the water down the bows lifted and starting the winches they hauled aft the ropes if they could keep it before long they might heave her from the sand  it was a time of stubborn effort and crushing strain some of the men were sick and all had lost their vigor the fierce sun had not burned but bleached their skin their blood was poisoned by the miasma the land breeze blew off at night for all that cartwrights promise was they should share his reward and somehow they held on  at length in the scorching heat one afternoon when the flood tide began to run they hauled the hulk and tug abaft the wrecks engineroom and made the great ropes fast if listers calculations were accurate the pump had thrown out enough water and the buoyancy of the other craft would lift the wrecks stern if notbut he refused to think about this  the sea breeze had dropped and the smoke of the engine went straight up there was not a line on the glittering lagoon the sea looked like melted silver one felt it give out light and heat the mens eyes ached and the intolerable sun pierced their double hats and dulled their brains when all was ready they waited and watched the sandy water creep up arcturus plates until the ropes stretched and groaned and the hulk began to list on the wrecks other side the tugs mast and funnel slanted  arcturus was not yet afloat and the big wireropes running beneath her bilge held down the helping craft the ends were made fast by hemp lashings and somebody had put an ax beside the post for all that lister did not think brown would give the order to cut he himself would not if they did not float arcturus now she must remain in the sand for good he would hold on until the rising tide flowed across the tug  in the meantime he watched the pump the engine carried a dangerous load and the spouting discharge pipe was swollen throbbing and rattling she fought the water that held arcturus down a greaser touched the crossheadslides with a tallow swab and a panting fireman thrust a bar through the furnace door their skin was blackened by sweat and coal dust soaked singlets tight like gloves clung to their lean bodies nobody else however was actively occupied the negroes lay on the deck and the white men lounged in the shade of the awning they had done all that flesh and blood could do in a climate that breaks the white mans strength and now the tide ought to finish their labor but they did not know and some doubted  the ropes cracked and the hulks list got sharp on one side her deck was very near the water she was broad but if arcturus did not lift it was obvious she must soon capsize lister opened the engine throttle until the valvewheel would not turn the cylinders shook a gland blew steam and the pump clashed and rocked all the same he knew himself ridiculous the extra water the pump lifted would not help much now they had a few minutes and then if nobody cut the ropes the hulk would go down  the massive oak mooringpost groaned and the deckseams opened with the strain the wireropes were rigid one could see no hint of curve the water touched the hulks deck and began to creep up then it stopped the hulk shook and the wrecks long side slowly got upright  shes off said brown hoarsely somebody blew the tugs whistle and one or two shouted but this was all they had won a very stubborn fight but winning had cost them much and lister felt their triumph was strangely flat he smiled and owned he would be satisfied to lie down and sleep  brown gave an order terriers propeller splashed noisily and arcturus began to move somehow it looked impossible but she was moving they took her slowly and cautiously across the lagoon and when the tide was full put her on the sand there was much to do yet and lister wondered whether he could hold out until all was done  in the evening montgomery came off on board a boat pulled by four sturdy kroos he was very thin and haggard but the fever had left him when his boat got near brown frowning savagely went to the rail  what dyou want he asked  let me come on board if we cant agree ill go back in a few minutes montgomery replied and climbing the bulwarks went to the awning and lighted a cigarette  you have floated her but the jobs not finished he said i expect you mean to bring off the cargo you landed and youll need a fresh gang of native boys well i can help  you imply you can bother us if we dont agree brown remarked  something like that i can certainly make things awkward however all i want is to go with you when you open the lazaret where the boxes of gold were stored  ah said brown i expect you see what your wanting to go indicates looks as if you knew something about the wreck  i imagine i do know something montgomery admitted quietly at the beginning i reckoned you would not float her but in order to run no risk i meant to hinder you as much as possible now im beaten im going to be frank  he paused and resumed in a low voice when i was left control of a respected business house i was young and ambitious it was plain the house had weathered a bad storm but our fortunes were mending and i thought they could be built up again well i think i was honest and when one of arcturus crew demanded money i got a jar since my father loaded the ship i expect you see where the fellows threats led  i see the line cartwright might take brown remarked dryly if the boxes dont hold gold he could break you we have found out enough already to give him a strong pull on the boats last owners theyre in his power  he wont use his power cartwright is not that sort besides the company is bankrupt  you are not bankrupt do you know what sort lister and i are  montgomery smiled its not important if there is no gold in the boxes i dont want to carry on the houses business you can do what you like  he stopped for a few moments and lister began to feel some sympathy the man was desperate and had obviously borne much  my staying at the factory was a strain montgomery continued i was ill and when at length i saw you might succeed the suspense was horrible you see i risked the honor of the house my marriage my fortune all i had and cared about  were you to be married lister asked  montgomery signed agreement the wedding was put off while it looked as if my mended fortune was built on fraud and i had known and agreed to the trick i could not marry a highprincipled girl  brown knitted his brows and was quiet for some moments then he said you are now willing to get us the boys we want and help us where you can  that is so montgomery agreed  very well said brown we expect to open the lazaret at daybreak and you can come with us you had better send off your boat and stop on board    chapter x  barbara takes control  the sun was rising and the mist rolled back from the lagoon the tide was low and arcturus rusty side rose high above the smooth green water damp weed hung from the beams in her poop cabin and a dull light came down through the broken glass a sailor kneeling on the slimy planks tried to force a corroded ringbolt from its niche another trimmed a smoky lantern lister brown and montgomery waited in the halflight their faces looked gray and worn the sun had given them a dull pallor and on the west african coast nobody sleeps much  after a few minutes the sailor opened the swollen trapdoor and then went down brown carrying the lantern as a rule a ships lazaret is a small dark strongroom used for stowing liquor and articles of value arcturus was wet and smelt of salt a row of shelves crossed the bulkhead and some water lay in the angle where the slanted floor met the side sheathing a thin jacket and an officers peaked cap were in the water brown indicated the objects  looks as if somebody had stripped before he got to work and then left without bothering about his clothes he said i dont know if i expected this but well examine the thing later he lifted the lantern and the flickering beam touched five or six small thick boxes well theres some of the gold  lister seized a box and tried to lift it up but stopped  it feels like gold he said and signed to a sailor help me get the stuff on deck watson  they carried the boxes up the ladder and brown brought the cap and jacket  secondmates clothes he said indicating the bands round the cuffs and cap the imitation goldlace had gone green but clung to the rotten material  something in the pocket he added and taking out a small wet book put it in the sun well look at this again and now for the first box i may want you to state you saw me break the seals  sitting in the shade of the poop they opened the box which was filled with fine dullyellow grains then lister sent a man to the boat for some things he had brought and when the fellow came back hung a small steel cup from a springbalance  the scales pretty accurate i use it on board he said well i got the specific gravity of gold zinc and copper from my pockettables and made a few experiments with some bearing metals theyre all brasses alloys of copper and zinc with a little lead and tin in some i weighed and measured two or three small ingots and afterwards calculated what theyd weigh if their cubic size was the capacity of the cup ill give you the figures  he did so and then filled the cup with the yellow grains and held up the balance montgomery leaning forward looked over his shoulder  weighs more than your heaviest bearing metal its gold he exclaimed hoarsely  yes said lister its obviously gold perhaps we neednt open the other boxes when we get on board well weigh them against this lot so far as i can reckon after heaving them up the ladder well not find much difference  montgomery sat down as if he were too limp to stand but these are not all the boxes that were shipped  brown went for the pocketbook he had put to dry and took out some papers this thing belonged to gordon herries second officer  mr herries exclaimed the sailor watson the secondmate as was drowned when the surfboat capsized  what do you know about it brown asked  i know something sir said watson but montgomery stopped him and turned to the others  it seems the second mate tried to save the stuff  looks like that brown agreed and signed to the sailor now tell us all you do know  we was lying in forcados river shifting cargo to the lagos boat alongside barret my townie was on board her hed made a run in arcturus and told me about the wreck when she struck mr herries swung out number two surfboat and barret was her bowman he went to the lazaret with herries and they got up some bags of special gum and some heavy boxes barret thought they were gold but hadnt seen them put on board then a big comber hit the poop smashed the skylights and flooded the lazaret they reckoned she was going over and had some bother to get out well they got the surfboat off her side she was pretty full with a load of kroo boys and three or four white men in the surf the steering oar broke she yawed across a sea and turned out the lot some held on to her but she rolled over and barret made for the beach they all landed but mr herries barret thought the boat hit him gum and boxes went down in the surf  very good said brown now get off and send somebody to help heave the boxes on board  montgomery turned his head and leaned against the poop lister saw he trembled as if the reaction from the strain was keen after a few moments he braced himself  its done with i think all the boxes held gold but theyre gone  brown indicated the cloud of spray that tossed above the advancing lines of foam the long rollers had crashed on the bar from the beginning and would never stop  all the surf gets it keeps he said if there is a secret i reckon the secrets safe however we have to talk about something else you can get us some native boys  ill send you a fresh gang if my new agent arrives soon ill go with you as far as sierra leone since youre shorthanded i might perhaps help and ive had enough of the factory  the others agreed and soon afterwards got to work when the negroes montgomery sent arrived all the cargo worth salving was restowed and he bought the hulk for a floating store then one night when the moon and tide were full terrier steamed slowly across the lagoon two massive ropes trailed across her stern and arcturus high dark bow towered above her phosphorescent wake the land breeze blew behind her and the surf had not the fury the sea breeze gives by day but when terrier plunged into the turmoil brown watched the tow ropes with anxious eyes  arcturus rolled and sheered about putting a horrible strain on the hawsers and sometimes for a minute or two it looked as if she went astern flame blew from the tugs funnel lighting the black trail of smoke steam roared at her escapepipe and the engines throbbed hard the ebb tide however was beginning to run and helped her across the shoals the leadsman got deeper water the rollers got smooth and presently the swell was long and regular and the spray cloud melted astern in the morning a faint dark line to starboard was all that indicated the african coast next day brown steered for the land and called montgomery to the bridge  i reckon to make an anchorage before dark he said well give the boys the rest they need and send terrier to sar leone for coal learmont will land you  then youre not going to take arcturus into port montgomery remarked with some surprise  i am not cartwright expects me to save him as much as possible and there are british officers and board of trade rules at sar leone you dont imagine theyd let me start for las palmas surveys reports repairs and sending for another tug might cost two or three thousand pounds then half my crew are sick and some are helpless though i reckon theyll pick up sooner at sea than in an african hospital  its a big risk after all i owe you much and know something about curing malarial fever besides im a yachtsman and can steer and use the lead if youll take me ill go all the way however you ought to send lister off he cant hold out  he claims he can brown said dryly we have argued about his going to grand canary by a mailboat but hes obstinate means to finish the job thats his sort anyhow its possible the trade breeze will brace him up and if he did go the chances of my taking arcturus to liverpool are not good  montgomery stayed on board and when the tug returned with coal they hove anchor and began the long run to las palmas for a time lister kept the engines going and superintended the pump on board the wreck but he could not sleep and in the morning it was hard to drag himself from his bunk and start another laborious day the strain was horrible and he was weakening fast but it would be cooler soon and perhaps he might hold out until they met the invigorating northeast breeze  in the meantime cartwright went back to liverpool mrs cartwright got better and barbara waited for news she had refused lister but to refuse had cost her more than she had thought after a time cartwright wrote and stated that the tug and arcturus had started home no fresh news arrived and barbara tried to hide her suspense until one morning a small african liner steamed into port some passengers landed and when they lunched at the hotel one talked about his going off with the first officer to a ship that signaled for help  it was a moving picture he said the rusty weedcoated steamer rolling on the blue combers and the little battered tug holding her headtosea the breeze was strong and for some days they had not made three knots an hour well i know something about fever but they were all sick the engineer delirious and very weak  barbara sitting near the passenger made an effort for calm her heart beat and her breath came fast nobody remarked her abrupt movement and the other went on  coal food and fresh water were running out their medicine chest was empty everything was foul with soot coaldust and salt i expect it was long since they were able to clean decks the skipper was in a hammock under the bridgeawning and could not get up an african trader montgomery of a liverpool house seemed to have control his skin was yellow like a mulattos  a young american doctor to whom barbara had been talking looked up  jaundice after malaria he remarked i dont know west africa but i was at panama was malaria all the rest had got  it was not the passenger replied meaningly however if you know panama  did you try to tow the ship barbara interrupted  the mate thought it impossible she was big and foul with weed our boat is small and we could not delay much because of the mails we sent a surfboat across with water and food and then steamed on  barbara looked about the table mrs cartwright was at the other end and barbara thought she had not heard she touched the young doctor  will you help me on board the african steamer i must see the captain  why certainly well look for a boat the other replied and they went off  barbara saw the captain and when she stated that the owner of arcturus was her stepfather he sent for the chief mate who narrated his visit to the wreck  you took the ships doctor said barbara is he now on board  the mate said he imagined the doctor had not landed and barbara turned to wheeler  go and find him find out all you can  for some time afterwards she talked to the ships officers and when wheeler returned went back to her boat while the peons rowed them to the mole she asked wheeler for his pocketbook and wrote an address  don luis sarmiento is the best doctor in the town and had something to do with a fever hospital in cuba she said if you tell him i sent you he will help take all the medicine he can give you and then go to leopard trading company and buy whatever you think sick men would need bring me the bills  if i get all that would be useful it will cost you high said wheeler and helped her up the steps at the mole  that is not important get the things  very well but the ship is six hundred miles off how are you going to put the truck on board  im going to see about that next barbara replied and indicated a cloud of dust rolling along the road theres the steam tram dont talk hustle  wheeler lifted his cap and running along the mole jumped on board the tram  when he had gone barbara went to the office of an important english merchant house and asked for the junior partner she was strangely calm although she knew that when the strain was over she would pay in the meantime she needed help and admitted it was lucky young men liked her she had not hesitated to use her charm on the american the junior partner was keen to help and going with her to a coaling office offered to charter a powerful spanish tug the company had recently bought the manager agreed and barbara made a calculation  if you can get the boat ready to sail in the morning ill send you a check when she starts she said  they went out and the merchant gave barbara an approving smile i imagine they havent at the moment much use for the tug which accounts for their being willing to take a moderate sum all the same you handled the situation like a good business man had they known much about your plans before we agreed they would have sent the tug and claimed a large reward for salvage in fact it looks as if you had saved mr cartwright  its possible barbara broke in impatiently still they dont know where arcturus is and that her crew are ill now however we must engage fresh men to relieve the others i dont mind if you pay them something over the usual rate  the merchant engaged the crew of a spanish fishing schooner that was being laid up and barbara returning to the hotel found wheeler in the garden  ive got all the medicine and truck i reckon would be useful he said if the steamboat man didnt exaggerate you want a doctor next  barbara gave him a level glance and smiled if you like you may go a fast tug sails in the morning  why he said id be delighted you can call it fixed i came along for a holiday but soon found that loafing made me tired  thank you said barbara and was gone  the doctor laughed and joining an english friend in the hotel ordered a drink  i reckon ive been rushed he remarked you folks look slow but i allow when you do get started some of you can move since lunch ive been helping an english girl fix some things and she hit a pace that left me out of breath  miss hyslop said the other perhaps if shed had a job for me i might have used an effort to get up speed a charming girl and i think shes resolute  shes surely resolute wheeler agreed miss hyslop sees where she wants to go and gets there by the shortest road  when dusk fell barbara thought all was ready and sitting down by mrs cartwright narrated what she had done after she stopped mrs cartwright put her hand gently on the girls arm  its lucky you came out with me she said i would not have known what to do and i doubt if mortimer  barbara laughed mortimer would have calculated weighed one thing against another and studied his plans for a week mine are rude but in the morning theyll begin to work after all in a sense i have not done much i have sent others when i want to go myself  its impossible my dear said mrs cartwright firmly  well i expect i must be resigned one is forced to pay for breaking rules i have paid but well talk about something else  the tug and supplies have no doubt cost much mrs cartwright remarked you must let me give you a check  no said barbara in a resolute voice i will take no money until mines all gone fathers a dear i owe him much and now i can help im going to help i have sent a cablegram he had better come out but in the meantime he neednt be anxious because i have taken control  mrs cartwright let her go presently and barbara went to her room she had borne a heavy strain but the reaction had begun and throwing herself on a couch she covered her face with her hands and cried    chapter xi  listers reward  signal flags fluttered in the breeze at the top of the isleta and a smoke cloud stained the blue horizon for a few minutes the cloud vanished and then rolled up again thicker than before cartwright studied it carefully and gave the glasses to barbara who stood near him on the catalina mole  is that one trail of smoke he asked  i think i see two sometimes they melt but theyre getting distinct now there are two  ah said cartwright then its arcturus i expect your tug has saved the situation  lister saved arcturus before i meddled barbara declared with a blush however im glad i could help you have often helped me  cartwrights eyes twinkled all i gave i have got back but im not persuaded you didnt mean to help another well perhaps the other deserves your interest browns a useful man but he has some drawbacks and i doubt if he could have carried through the undertaking  if youll wait in the shade ill get a jacket barbara replied theres a fresh breeze the launch splashes and im going with you to meet arcturus  when the first flag blew out from the isleta staff she had called cartwright and they had hurried to the neighboring mole cartwright had arrived two days before and they had watched the signals until the longed for message came steamer in tow from the south  i think youll wait said cartwright quietly you dont know much about fever and the men i sent are not altogether making a triumphant return  the blood came to barbaras skin she had meant to go and hated to be baffled but cartwright gave her a steady glance and she knew there was no use in arguing when he looked like that  did you or your mother tell me mrs seaton arrived by a recent boat he resumed  barbara was surprised but said mrs seaton was at the metropole cartwright looked at the tugs smoke  then i ought to have time to see her before they tow arcturus in some sea is running and they cant steam fast  he started for the catalina and when he stopped by mrs cartwrights chair his face was hot and he trembled hurry and muscular effort upset him but time was valuable  i have not yet asked you for money clara he said  that is so mrs cartwright agreed sometimes i was hurt because you did not you ought to know all thats mine is yours  cartwright smiled you are a good sort and im going to borrow now because i can pay back i want you to telegraph your bank to meet my check  ill write you a check  no said cartwright i think the other plan is better well the sum is rather large  he stated the sum and mrs cartwright said im not very curious but why do you want the money  im going to buy mrs seatons shares  ah said mrs cartwright with a disturbed look she tried to force you to buy before  cartwright knew his placid goodhumored wife hated mrs seaton  youre puzzled he remarked well id have bought the shares long since but i wasnt rich enough and didnt think my borrowing was justified all the same the block she holds gives her a dangerous power and if i can get them ill baffle the opposition at the companys meeting but i must be quick  if you want to baffle ellen seaton you can use all the money i have got mrs cartwright declared tell me what i must telegraph the bank  cartwright did so and made for the metropole as fast as possible because the tugs smoke was not far off when he reached the big square hotel he gave a page his card and frowned while he waited in the glassroofed patio time was valuable and he hoped mrs seaton would not be long on the whole he did not think he was going to be shabby but perhaps shabbiness was justified ellen had not forgotten she had thought him her lover and although it was long since she would not forget she hated his wife and had tried to injure him cartwright imagined she would try again and so long as she kept her shares her antagonism was dangerous  she entered the patio with two young tourists whom she sent off and beckoned cartwright to a bench behind a palm the sun that pierced the glass roof was strong and he reflected with dry amusement that ellen looked better by electric light in the evening although she smiled her glance was keen and not friendly  i arrived some days since and met barbara in the street but she has not been to see me yet she said however now you have come i ought to be satisfied since you were able to get away from the office i expect shipping is languid  cartwright thought she meant to be nasty for one thing barbara had not gone to see her and perhaps had not urged her calling at the hotel ellen did not like the girl but she wanted to know people and mrs cartwright had stopped at las palmas for some time as a rule claras friends were good this however was not important he must buy ellens shares before arcturus arrived and the news of her salvage got about  oh well he said although i think i see signs of improvement things are not very promising yet  if you are not hopeful the outlook must be black mrs seaton remarked meaningly perhaps i ought to sympathize but the efforts too much my investments have all gone wrong and my luck at the grand national was remarkably bad in fact if nobody will buy my shares in your line i may be forced to agree with the people who want to wind up the company  cartwright thought his luck was good ellen was extravagant and a gambler no doubt she needed money but he knew she was willing to hurt him and could do so all the same if she could force him to buy the shares she thought worth nothing her greed would conquer her spitefulness well he was going to indulge her  if you did join my antagonists i might pull through but ill admit it would be awkward he replied in order to avoid the fight ill buy your shares for ten shillings  mrs seaton hesitated she did not want to lose her power but she wanted money nominally the shares were worth a much larger sum but she had found out that nobody else was willing to buy the block for all that cartwright was cunning and she wondered whether he knew something she did not she asked for a higher price but cartwright refused he was cool and humorous although he knew arcturus was steadily nearing the harbor perhaps in a few minutes the lookout on the isleta would read her flags at length he pulled out his watch  i have an engagement but i rather want the shares my getting them would help me at the meeting he said shall we say twelveandsixpence this is the limit  very well said mrs seaton and smiled with a sense of triumph it looks very greedy but when can i have a check you see im nearly bankrupt  now said cartwright and taking out his fountain pen rang a bell send a page for some notepaper and write an undertaking to deliver me the shares  mrs seaton did so and cartwright wrote the check then she signed to one of the young men she had sent off since you are very businesslike you had better have a witness im relieved to get the check particularly since i expected you would be forced to ask clara for the money  cartwright had to smile the sneer was ellens parthian shot she was retiring from the field but he owned that she might have beaten him by a bold attack and he had been afraid  he went to the bar and ordered a drink and then going out saw fresh signals blow from the isleta staff arcturus hull was visible in the tugs thick smoke the lookout on the hill with his big telescope had read her flags and was signaling her name and number to the town cartwright had won by a few minutes and was satisfied although he had given mrs seaton twelveandsixpence for her shares when perhaps he need not this was now about their just value and for old times sake he had not meant to cheat her in the meantime a launch was waiting to take him on board arcturus and he hurried to the mole  barbara saw the launch start with mixed emotions she was something of a rebel and had anybody but cartwright ordered her to stop she would not have obeyed she waited in the shade fixing her eyes on the laboring tugs sometimes she felt a thrill of triumph because lister had conquered sometimes she was tortured by suspense she did not know if he stood at the levers in the engineroom or lay unconscious in his bunk well she would soon know and she shrank  she rubbed the glasses and looked again there were two towropes terrier plunged across the rollers on arcturus starboard bow the spanish tug to port it looked as if the wrecks steeringgear did not work spray blew about the boats and the crested seas broke in foaming turmoil against the towed vessels side until she drew in behind the isleta a few minutes afterwards she swung round the mole and barbara thought the picture moving  the tugs looked very small the halfloaded hull they towed to an anchorage floated high above her proper waterline rolling on the languid swell at the harbor mouth she looked huge her rusty side was like a warehouse wall when she lifted her plates from the water one saw the wet weed shine higher up it clung parched and dry to the red iron although there were clean belts where the stuff was scraped away barbara pictured the exhausted men scraping feebly when the sea was calm and the sun did not touch the vessels side  all the same the men had won a triumph it looked impossible that the handful of bemused ruffians she had seen start at liverpool could have dragged the big vessel from the bottom of the lagoon but the thing was done arcturus battered and rusty with sagging masts and broken funnel was coming into harbor a big pump throbbed on board throwing water down her side she flew a small bright red ensign aft and a new houseflag at the masthead barbara thought the flag flaunted proudly and the thing was significant cartwright had weathered the storm but she had helped  the tugs engines stopped and barbaras heart beat for a yellow flag went up she hated the ominous signal and turning the glasses followed the doctors launch the boat ran alongside terrier a man went on board returned and climbed a ladder to arcturus deck he did not come back for some time and barbara looked for lister but could not see him then the yellow flag was hauled down and arcturus moved slowly up the harbor  a fleet of shoreboats followed and when the anchor dropped crowded about the ship barbara braced herself and waited half the voyage was over and when the engines were cleaned and mended arcturus would steam to england the salvors had won but sometimes victory cost much and barbara knew she might have to pay  a launch with an awning steamed to the mole and vanished behind the wall barbara stopped in the shade somehow she durst not go to the steps cartwright came up but seeing his grave look she let him pass then the american doctor reached the top and called to somebody below three or four men awkwardly lifted a stretcher to the pavement and cartwright signed to the driver of a carriage waiting in the road wheeler stopped him  its not far carrying will be smoother  very well ill see alls ready said cartwright and got into the carriage  then barbara went to the stretcher which was covered by green canvas she thought she knew who lay behind the screens and her look was strained  is mr lister very ill she asked  wheeler gave her a sympathetic glance he is pretty sick he was nearly all in when i boarded the ship now its possible hell get better  barbara turned her head but after a few moments looked up thank you for going where are the others  we have sent some to the spanish hospital landed them at the coaling wharf theyre not very sick the rest are on board  all the rest  three short said the doctor quietly they have made their last voyage but the boys are waiting to get off with the stretcher  barbara let him go and followed he looked very tired and she did not want to talk she saw the stretcher carried up the hotel steps and along a passage and then went to her room a spanish doctor and nurse were waiting and she knew she would be sent away to feel she could not help was hard but she tried to be resigned and stopped in the quiet room listening for steps somebody might bring a message that lister wanted her  the message did not come and she was conscious of some relief although she was tormented by regretful thoughts lister loved her and she had refused him because she was proud perhaps her refusal was justified but she was honest and admitted that she had known he would not let her go and had afterwards wondered how she would reply when he asked her again now she knew the strain had broken her resolution she had indulged her ridiculous pride and saw it might cost her much her lover was very ill wheeler doubted if he would get better  in the evening montgomery joined cartwright in a corner of the smokingroom  i expect captain brown told you about the bother i gave him he remarked  that is so said cartwright he however stated you gave him some help  all the same at the beginning i held up the job when brown could not work your expenses ran on and i feel i ought to pay  its just coming home when my men were sick and brown was in his bunk you undertook the duties of doctor and navigator and wheeler admits your cures were good since you have a counterclaim suppose we say were quits  montgomery felt some relief it looked as if cartwright did not mean to use his advantage the old fellow was generous montgomery hesitated for a moment and then resumed i understand you bought the wreck  i used the shareholders money at all events i used as much as i durst shes the companys ship  but the cargo  the cargos mine that is i get an allowance agreed upon with the underwriters for all i have salved i rather think the sum will be large  then youre satisfied although you didnt get all the gold and lost the valuable gum in the lazaret  cartwrights eyes twinkled ive some grounds for satisfaction and i know when to stop but perhaps id better be as frank as is needful very well i get salvage on some of the gold the rest is under the surf and nobody will open the boxes now the things done with  montgomery was moved but he saw there was no more to be said and asked quietly will you tell me what you think about the prospects of the line  on the whole i imagine the prospects are good we have got a useful boat for a very small sum and the last report was oreana could probably be floated without much damage when the st lawrence ice breaks well i calculate next years trading will earn us a small dividend and since business is improving we ought to prosper before very long  thank you said montgomery i know something about the line and imagine the directors may need support just now i have some money that does not earn much would it help if i bought a number of your shares  i think not said cartwright the plan has drawbacks people are sometimes uncharitable and i have antagonists who might hint at a bribe besides i dont need support my luck has turned and i rather think i can break the opposition he smiled and getting up put his hand on montgomerys arm all the same when i send a boat to africa you can load her up now im going to find the nurse and ask about lister  lister was delirious and for two or three days the doctors doubted his recovery then one morning they said his temperature had fallen and there was hope next morning they admitted that he was slowly making progress barbara did not leave the hotel lest she miss the latest news from the sickroom she was not allowed to go in and when evening came she knew she could not sleep she had not slept much since they carried lister up the steps  when all was quiet and the guests had gone to bed she went to the veranda and leaned against the rails she was highly strung and rebellious lister had sent her a message but she was not allowed to see him yet she wanted to see him and was persuaded that for him to see her would not hurt she knew he wanted her  the moon was bright but the shadow of the hotel stretched across the garden somebody was moving about in the gloom and barbara started when she saw it was the nurse the tired woman had gone out to rest for a few minutes in the cool night air and barbara saw her opportunity  stealing across the veranda she went along a passage and up some stairs the landing at the top was dark but she knew listers door and turning the handle quietly looked in bright moonlight shone through the open window and a curtain moved in the gentle breeze mosquito gauze wavered about the bed where a quiet figure lay barbara stole across the floor and pulled back the guard the rings rattled and lister opened his eyes he smiled and barbara kneeling by the bed put her arm round his neck  my dear you know me  of course i wanted you since i got my senses back ive tried to call you  you called not long since i cheated the nurse and came but if you ought to be quiet i mustnt talk the doctors said  they dont understand said lister now i have seen you im going to get well  barbara lifted her head and studied him his face was pinched his skin was very white and wet her eyes filled and she was moved by tender pity  oh my dear she said it was for my sake you went  lister took her hand and she felt his was thin and hot im paid for all but barbara i think youre logical when im better  she kissed him of course ill marry you when you like in the meantime youre weak and tired and must go to sleep  i am tired he admitted besides the nurse will come  barbara gently touched his wet hair and moved his pillow the nurse is not important but you mustnt talk  she gave him her hand again and he went to sleep some time afterwards the nurse returned and started when she saw the white figure kneeling by the bed then she began to talk angrily in a low voice barbara was getting cramped but without moving her body she looked at the nurse and her eyes sparkled with rebellious fire  be quiet he mustnt wake she said theres no use in arguing i mean to stay
