52961944	underwoods     of all my verse like not a single line but like my title for it is not mine that title from a better man i stole ah how much better had i stoln the whole   dedication   there are men and classes of men that stand above the  common herd the soldier the sailor and the shepherd not  unfrequently the artist rarely rarely still the clergyman  the physician almost as a rule  he is the flower such as it  is of our civilisation and when that stage of man is done  with and only remembered to be marvelled at in history he  will be thought to have shared as little as any in the defects  of the period and most notably exhibited the virtues of the  race  generosity he has such as is possible to those who  practise an art never to those who drive a trade discretion  tested by a hundred secrets tact tried in a thousand  embarrassments and what are more important heraclean  cheerfulness and courage  so it is that he brings air and  cheer into the sickroom and often enough though not so often  as he wishes brings healing  gratitude is but a lame sentiment thanks when they are  expressed are often more embarrassing than welcome and yet i  must set forth mine to a few out of many doctors who have  brought me comfort and help to dr willey of san francisco  whose kindness to a stranger it must be as grateful to him as  it is touching to me to remember to dr karl ruedi of davos  the good genius of the english in his frosty mountains to dr  herbert of paris whom i knew only for a week and to dr  caissot of montpellier whom i knew only for ten days and who  have yet written their names deeply in my memory to dr  brandt of royat to dr wakefield of nice to dr chepmell  whose visits make it a pleasure to be ill to dr horace  dobell so wise in counsel to sir andrew clark so unwearied  in kindness and to that wise youth my uncle dr balfour  i forget as many as i remember and i ask both to pardon  me these for silence those for inadequate speech  but one  name i have kept on purpose to the last because it is a  household word with me and because if i had not received  favours from so many hands and in so many quarters of the  world it should have stood upon this page alone that of my  friend thomas bodley scott of bournemouth  will he accept  this although shared among so many for a dedication to  himself and when next my illfortune which has thus its  pleasant side brings him hurrying to me when he would fain  sit down to meat or lie down to rest will he care to remember  that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool enough to  be ungrateful  r l s  skerryvore bournemouth   note   the human conscience has fled of late the troublesome  domain of conduct for what i should have supposed to be the  less congenial field of art there she may now be said to  rage and with special severity in all that touches dialect  so that in every novel the letters of the alphabet are  tortured and the reader wearied to commemorate shades of  mispronunciation  now spelling is an art of great difficulty  in my eyes and i am inclined to lean upon the printer even  in common practice rather than to venture abroad upon new  quests  and the scots tongue has an orthography of its own  lacking neither authority nor author  yet the temptation is  great to lend a little guidance to the bewildered englishman   some simple phonetic artifice might defend your verses from  barbarous mishandling and yet not injure any vested interest   so it seems at first but there are rocks ahead  thus if i  wish the diphthong ou to have its proper value i may write  oor instead of our many have done so and lived and the  pillars of the universe remained unshaken  but if i did so  and came presently to doun which is the classical scots  spelling of the english down i should begin to feel uneasy  and if i went on a little farther and came to a classical  scots word like stour or dour or clour i should know  precisely where i was  that is to say that i was out of  sight of land on those high seas of spelling reform in which  so many strong swimmers have toiled vainly  to some the  situation is exhilarating as for me i give one bubbling cry  and sink  the compromise at which i have arrived is  indefensible and i have no thought of trying to defend it   as i have stuck for the most part to the proper spelling i  append a table of some common vowel sounds which no one need  consult and just to prove that i belong to my age and have in  me the stuff of a reformer i have used modification marks  throughout  thus i can tell myself not without pride that i  have added a fresh stumblingblock for english readers and to  a page of print in my native tongue have lent a new  uncouthness  sed non nobis  i note again that among our new dialecticians the local  habitat of every dialect is given to the square mile  i could  not emulate this nicety if i desired for i simply wrote my  scots as well as i was able not caring if it hailed from  lauderdale or angus from the mearns or galloway if i had  ever heard a good word i used it without shame and when  scots was lacking or the rhyme jibbed i was glad like my  betters to fall back on english  for all that i own to a  friendly feeling for the tongue of fergusson and of sir  walter both edinburgh men and i confess that burns has  always sounded in my ear like something partly foreign  and  indeed i am from the lothians myself it is there i heard the  language spoken about my childhood and it is in the drawling  lothian voice that i repeat it to myself  let the precisians  call my speech that of the lothians  and if it be not pure  alas what matters it  the day draws near when this  illustrious and malleable tongue shall be quite forgotten and  burns ayrshire and dr macdonalds aberdeenawa and  scotts brave metropolitan utterance will be all equally the  ghosts of speech  till then i would love to have my hour as a  native maker and be read by my own countryfolk in our own  dying language an ambition surely rather of the heart than of  the head so restricted as it is in prospect of endurance so  parochial in bounds of space   book i  in english   i  envoy

in the track o pleasant gauger long since dead i hear you fluting on ahead  you go with me the selfsame way  the selfsame air for me you play for i do think and so do you it is the tune to travel to

floodings of the brook dew frost and mountains fire and seas tumultuary silences winds that in darkness fifed a tune and the highriding virgin moon  and as the berry pale and sharp springs on some

feathered foot faint and fainter sounds the flute rarer songs of gods and still somewhere on the sunny hill or along the winding stream through the willows flits a dream flits but shows a smiling face

stooping pinion flew raking hedgerow trees and wet her wing in silver streams and set shining foot on temple roof now again she flies aloof coasting mountain clouds and kisst by the evenings amethyst

breath of wind but all the quarter sounded like a wood and in the chequered silence and above the hum of city cabs that sought the bois suburban ashes shivered into song a patter and a chatter and a chirp and a long dying hiss  it was as though starched old brocaded dames through all the house had trailed a strident skirt or the whole sky even in a wink had overbrimmed in rain  hark in these shady parlours how it talks of the near autumn how the smitten ash trembles and augurs floods  o not too long in these inconstant latitudes delay o not too late from the unbeloved north trim your

have thrown in air high over arm the trembling reed by ale and kail by till and tweed an equal craft of band you show the pen to guide the fly to throw i count you happy starred for god when he with inkpot and with rod endowed you bade your fortune lead forever by the crooks of tweed forever by the woods of song and lands that to the muse belong or if in peopled streets or in the abhorred pedantic sanhedrim it should be yours to wander still airs of the morn airs of the hill the plovery forest and the seas that break about the hebrides should follow over field and plain and find you at the window pane and you again see hill and peel and the bright springs gush at your heel so went the fiat forth and so garrulous like a brook you go with sound of happy mirth and sheen of daylight  whether by the green you fare that moment or the gray whether you dwell in march or may or whether treat of reels and rods or of the old unhappy gods still like a brook your page has shone and your ink sings of helicon   xv  et tu in arcadia vixisti to r a m s   in ancient tales o friend thy spirit dwelt there from of old thy childhood passed and there high expectation high delights and deeds thy fluttering heart with hope and terror moved and thou hast heard of yore the blatant beast and rolands horn and that warscattering shout of allunarmed achilles aegiscrowned and perilous lands thou sawest sounding shores and seas and forests drear island and dale and mountain dark  for thou with tristram rodst or bedevere in farthest lyonesse  thou hadst a booth in samarcand whereat sidelooking magians trafficked thence by night an afreet snatched thee and with wings upbore beyond the aral mount or hoping gain thou with a jar of money didst embark for balsorah by sea  but chiefly thou in that clear air tookst life in arcady the haunted land of song and by the wells where most the gods frequent  there chiron old in the pelethronian antre taught thee lore the plants he taught and by the shining stars in forests dim to steer  there hast thou seen immortal pan dance secret in a glade and dancing roll his eyes these where they fell shed glee and through the congregated oaks a flying horror winged while all the earth to the gods pregnant footing thrilled within or whiles beside the sobbing stream he breathed in his clutched pipe unformed and wizard strains divine yet brutal which the forest heard and thou with awe and far upon the plain the unthinking ploughman started and gave ear  now things there are that upon him who sees a strong vocation lay and strains there are that whoso hears shall hear for evermore for evermore thou hearst immortal pan and those melodious godheads ever young and ever quiring on the mountains old  what was this earth child of the gods to thee forth from thy dreamland thou a dreamer camst and in thine ears the olden music rang and in thy mind the doings of the dead and those heroic ages long forgot to a so fallen earth alas too late alas in evil days thy steps return to list at noon for nightingales to grow a dweller on the beach till argo come that came long since a lingerer by the pool where that desired angel bathes no more  as when the indian to dakota comes or farthest idaho and where he dwelt he with his clan a humming city finds thereon awhile amazed he stares and then to right and leftward like a questing dog seeks first the ancestral altars then the hearth long cold with rains and where old terror lodged and where the dead  so thee undying hope with all her pack hunts screaming through the years here there thou fleeest but nor here nor there the pleasant gods abide the glory dwells  that that was not apollo not the god this was not venus though she venus seemed a moment  and though fair yon river move she all the way from disenchanted fount to seas unhallowed runs the gods forsook long since her trembling rushes from her plains disconsolate long since adventure fled and now although the inviting river flows and every poplared cape and every bend or willowy islet win upon thy soul and to thy hopeful shallop whisper speed yet hope not thou at all hope is no more and o long since the golden groves are dead the faery cities vanished from the land   xvi  to w e henley   the year runs through her phases rain and sun springtime and summer pass winter succeeds but one pale season rules the house of death cold falls the imprisoned daylight fell disease by each lean pallet squats and pain and sleep toss gaping on the pillows but o thou uprise and take thy pipe  bid music flow strains by good thoughts attended like the spring the swallows follow over land and sea pain sleeps at once at once with open eyes dozing despair awakes  the shepherd sees his flock come bleating home the seaman hears once more the cordage rattle  airs of home youth love and roses blossom the gaunt ward dislimns and disappears and opening out shows brooks and forests and the blue beyond of mountains small the pipe but oh do thou peakfaced and suffering piper blow therein the dirge of heroes dead and to these sick these dying sound the triumph over death behold each greatly breathes each tastes a joy unknown before in dying for each knows a hero dies with him  though unfulfilled yet conquering truly  and not dies in vain  so is pain cheered death comforted the house of sorrow smiles to listen  once again  o thou orpheus and heracles the bard and the deliverer touch the stops again   xvii  henry james   who comes tonight  we ope the doors in vain who comes  my bursting walls can you contain the presences that now together throng your narrow entry as with flowers and song as with the air of life the breath of talk lo how these fair immaculate women walk behind their jocund maker and we see slighted de mauves and that far different she gressie the trivial sphynx and to our feast daisy and barb and chancellor she not least with all their silken all their airy kin do like unbidden angels enter in but he attended by these shining names comes best of all himself  our welcome james   xviii  the mirror speaks   where the bells peal far at sea cunning fingers fashioned me there on palace walls i hung while that consuelo sung but i heard though i listened well never a note never a trill never a beat of the chiming bell there i hung and looked and there in my gray face faces fair shone from under shining hair well i saw the poising head but the lips moved and nothing said and when lights were in the hall silent moved the dancers all  so awhile i glowed and then fell on dusty days and men long i slumbered packed in straw long i none but dealers saw till before my silent eye one that sees came passing by  now with an outlandish grace to the sparkling fire i face in the blue room at skerryvore where i wait until the door open and the prince of men henry james shall come again   xix  katharine   we see you as we see a face that trembles in a forest place upon the mirror of a pool forever quiet clear and cool and in the wayward glass appears to hover between smiles and tears elfin and human airy and true and backed by the reflected blue   xx to f j s   i read dear friend in your dear face your lifes tale told with perfect grace the river of your life i trace up the sunchequered devious bed to the fardistant fountainhead  not one quick beat of your warm heart nor thought that came to you apart pleasure nor pity love nor pain nor sorrow has gone by in vain  but as some lone woodwandering child brings home with him at evening mild the thorns and flowers of all the wild from your whole life o fair and true your flowers and thorns you bring with you   xxi  requiem   under the wide and starry sky dig the grave and let me lie glad did i live and gladly die and i laid me down with a will  this be the verse you grave for me here he lies where he longed to be home is the sailor home from sea and the hunter home from the hill   xxii  the celestial surgeon   if i have faltered more or less in my great task of happiness if i have moved among my race and shown no glorious morning face if beams from happy human eyes have moved me not if morning skies books and my food and summer rain knocked on my sullen heart in vain lord thy most pointed pleasure take and stab my spirit broad awake or lord if too obdurate i choose thou before that spirit die a piercing pain a killing sin and to my dead heart run them in   xxiii  our lady of the snows   out of the sun out of the blast out of the world alone i passed across the moor and through the wood to where the monastery stood there neither lute nor breathing fife nor rumour of the world of life nor confidences low and dear shall strike the meditative ear aloof unhelpful and unkind the prisoners of the iron mind where nothing speaks except the hell the unfraternal brothers dwell  poor passionate men still clothed afresh with agonising folds of flesh whom the clear eyes solicit still to some bold output of the will while fairy fancy far before and musing memoryholdthedoor now to heroic death invite and now uncurtain fresh delight o little boots it thus to dwell on the remote unneighboured hill  o to be up and doing o unfearing and unshamed to go in all the uproar and the press about my human business my undissuaded heart i hear whisper courage in my ear with voiceless calls the ancient earth summons me to a daily birth  thou o my love ye o my friends  the gist of life the end of ends  to laugh to love to live to die ye call me by the ear and eye  forth from the casemate on the plain where honour has the world to gain pour forth and bravely do your part o knights of the unshielded heart forth and forever forward  out from prudent turret and redoubt and in the mellay charge amain to fall but yet to rise again captive ah still to honour bright a captive soldier of the right or free and fighting good with ill unconquering but unconquered still  and ye o brethren what if god when from heavns top he spies abroad and sees on this tormented stage the noble war of mankind rage what if his vivifying eye o monks should pass your corner by for still the lord is lord of might in deeds in deeds he takes delight the plough the spear the laden barks the field the founded city marks he marks the smiler of the streets the singer upon garden seats he sees the climber in the rocks to him the shepherd folds his flocks for those he loves that underprop with daily virtues heavens top and bear the falling sky with ease unfrowning caryatides those he approves that ply the trade that rock the child that wed the maid that with weak virtues weaker hands sow gladness on the peopled lands and still with laughter song and shout spin the great wheel of earth about  but ye  o ye who linger still here in your fortress on the hill with placid face with tranquil breath the unsought volunteers of death our cheerful general on high with careless looks may pass you by   xxiv   not yet my soul these friendly fields desert where thou with grass and rivers and the breeze and the bright face of day thy dalliance hadst where to thine ear first sang the enraptured birds where love and thou that lasting bargain made the ship rides trimmed and from the eternal shore thou hearest airy voices but not yet depart my soul not yet awhile depart  freedom is far rest far  thou art with life too closely woven nerve with nerve intwined service still craving service love for love love for dear love still suppliant with tears alas not yet thy human task is done a bond at birth is forged a debt doth lie immortal on mortality  it grows  by vast rebound it grows unceasing growth gift upon gift alms upon alms upreared from man from god from nature till the soul at that so huge indulgence stands amazed  leave not my soul the unfoughten field nor leave thy debts dishonoured nor thy place desert without due service rendered  for thy life up spirit and defend that fort of clay thy body now beleaguered whether soon or late she fall whether today thy friends bewail thee dead or after years a man grown old in honour and the friend of peace contend my soul for moments and for hours each is with service pregnant each reclaimed is as a kingdom conquered where to reign  as when a captain rallies to the fight his scattered legions and beats ruin back he on the field encamps well pleased in mind yet surely him shall fortune overtake him smite in turn headlong his ensigns drive and that dear land now safe tomorrow fall but he unthinking in the present good solely delights and all the camps rejoice   xxv   it is not yours o mother to complain not mother yours to weep though nevermore your son again shall to your bosom creep though nevermore again you watch your baby sleep  though in the greener paths of earth mother and child no more we wander and no more the birth of me whom once you bore seems still the brave reward that once it seemed of yore  though as all passes day and night the seasons and the years from you o mother this delight this also disappears  some profit yet survives of all your pangs and tears  the child the seed the grain of corn the acorn on the hill each for some separate end is born in season fit and still each must in strength arise to work the almighty will  so from the hearth the children flee by that almighty hand austerely led so one by sea goes forth and one by land nor aught of all mans sons escapes from that command  so from the sally each obeys the unseen almighty nod so till the ending all their ways blindfolded loth have trod nor knew their task at all but were the tools of god  and as the fervent smith of yore beat out the glowing blade nor wielded in the front of war the weapons that he made but in the tower at home still plied his ringing trade  so like a sword the son shall roam on nobler missions sent and as the smith remained at home in peaceful turret pent so sits the while at home the mother well content   xxvi  the sick child   child o mother lay your hand on my brow o mother mother where am i now why is the room so gaunt and great  why am i lying awake so late  mother fear not at all the night is still nothing is here that means you ill  nothing but lamps the whole town through and never a child awake but you  child mother mother speak low in my ear some of the things are so great and near some are so small and far away i have a fear that i cannot say what have i done and what do i fear and why are you crying mother dear  mother out in the city sounds begin thank the kind god the carts come in an hour or two more and god is so kind the day shall be blue in the windowblind then shall my child go sweetly asleep and dream of the birds and the hills of sheep   xxvii  in memoriam f a s   yet o

windy ocean toiled to plant a star for seamen where was then the surfy haunt of seals and cormorants i on the lintel of this cot inscribe the name of a strong tower   xxxv  skerryvore the parallel   here all is sunny and when the truant gull skims the green level of the lawn his wing dispetals roses here the house is framed of kneaded brick and the plumed mountain pine such clay as artists fashion and such wood as the treeclimbing urchin breaks  but there eternal granite hewn from the living isle and dowelled with brute iron rears a tower that from its wet foundation to its crown of glittering glass stands in the sweep of winds immovable immortal eminent   xxxvi   my house i say  but hark to the sunny doves that make my roof the arena of their loves that gyre about the gable all day long and fill the chimneys with their murmurous song our house they say and mine the cat declares and spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs and mine the dog and rises stiff with wrath if any alien foot profane the path so too the buck that trimmed my terraces our whilome gardener called the garden his who now deposed surveys my plain abode and his late kingdom only from the road   xxxvii   my body which my dungeon is and yet my parks and palaces which is so great that there i go all the day long to and fro and when the night begins to fall throw down my bed and sleep while all the building hums with wakefulness  even as a child of savages when evening takes her on her way she having roamed a summers day along the mountainsides and scalp sleeps in an antre of that alp which is so broad and high that there as in the topless fields of air my fancy soars like to a kite  and faints in the blue infinite which is so strong my strongest throes and the rough worlds besieging blows not break it and so weak withal death ebbs and flows in its loose wall as the green sea in fishers nets and tops its topmost parapets which is so wholly mine that i can wield its whole artillery and mine so little that my soul dwells in perpetual control and i but think and speak and do as my dead fathers move me to if this born body of my bones the beggared soul so barely owns what money passed from hand to hand what creeping custom of the land what deed of author or assign can make a house a thing of mine   xxxviii   say not of me that weakly i declined the labours of my sires and fled the sea the towers we founded and the lamps we lit to play at some with paper like a child but rather say in the afternoon of time a strenuous family dusted from its hands the sand of granite and beholding far along the sounding coast its pyramids and tall memorials catch the dying sun smiled well content and to this childish task around the fire addressed its evening hours   book ii  in scots

deeper  note  it may be guessed by some that i had a certain  parish in my eye and this makes it proper i should add a word  of disclamation  in my time there have been two ministers in  that parish  of the first i have a special reason to speak  well even had there been any to think ill  the second i have  often met in private and long in the due phrase sat under  in his church and neither here nor there have i heard an  unkind or ugly word upon his lips  the preacher of the text  had thus no original in that particular parish but when i was  a boy he might have been observed in many others he was then  like the schoolmaster abroad and by recent advices it  would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared   vi  the spaewife   o i wad like to ken  to the beggarwife says i  why chops are
