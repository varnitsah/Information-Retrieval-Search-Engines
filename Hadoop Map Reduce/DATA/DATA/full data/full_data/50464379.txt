50464379	fenimore coopers literary offences  by mark twain              the pathfinder and the deerslayer stand at the head of coopers           novels as artistic creations  there are others of his works           which contain parts as perfect as are to be found in these and           scenes even more thrilling  not one can be compared with           either of them as a finished whole            the defects in both of these tales are comparatively slight           they were pure works of artprof lounsbury             the five tales reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention             one of the very greatest characters in fiction natty           bumppo            the craft of the woodsman the tricks of the trapper all the           delicate art of the forest were familiar to cooper from his           youth upprof brander matthews            cooper is the greatest artist in the domain of romantic fiction           yet produced by americawilkie collins   it seems to me that it was far from right for the professor of english literature in yale the professor of english literature in columbia and wilkie collins to deliver opinions on coopers literature without having read some of it it would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read cooper  coopers art has some defects in one place in deerslayer and in the restricted space of twothirds of a page cooper has scored 114 offences against literary art out of a possible 115 it breaks the record  there are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of romantic fictionsome say twentytwo in deerslayer cooper violated eighteen of them these eighteen require  1 that a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere but the deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air  2 they require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of the tale and shall help to develop it but as the deerslayer tale is not a tale and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere the episodes have no rightful place in the work since there was nothing for them to develop  3 they require that the personages in a tale shall be alive except in the case of corpses and that always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses from the others but this detail has often been overlooked in the deerslayer tale  4 they require that the personages in a tale both dead and alive shall exhibit a sufficient excuse for being there but this detail also has been overlooked in the deerslayer tale  5 they require that when the personages of a tale deal in conversation the talk shall sound like human talk and be talk such as human beings would be likely to talk in the given circumstances and have a discoverable meaning also a discoverable purpose and a show of relevancy and remain in the neighborhood of the subject in hand and be interesting to the reader and help out the tale and stop when the people cannot think of anything more to say but this requirement has been ignored from the beginning of the deerslayer tale to the end of it  6 they require that when the author describes the character of a personage in his tale the conduct and conversation of that personage shall justify said description but this law gets little or no attention in the deerslayer tale as natty bumppos case will amply prove  7 they require that when a personage talks like an illustrated giltedged treecalf handtooled sevendollar friendships offering in the beginning of a paragraph he shall not talk like a negro minstrel in the end of it but this rule is flung down and danced upon in the deerslayer tale  8 they require that crass stupidities shall not be played upon the reader as the craft of the woodsman the delicate art of the forest by either the author or the people in the tale but this rule is persistently violated in the deerslayer tale  9 they require that the personages of a tale shall confine themselves to possibilities and let miracles alone or if they venture a miracle the author must so plausibly set it forth as to make it look possible and reasonable but these rules are not respected in the deerslayer tale  10 they require that the author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate and that he shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad ones but the reader of the deerslayer tale dislikes the good people in it is indifferent to the others and wishes they would all get drowned together  11 they require that the characters in a tale shall be so clearly defined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given emergency but in the deerslayer tale this rule is vacated  in addition to these large rules there are some little ones these require that the author shall  12 say what he is proposing to say not merely come near it  13 use the right word not its second cousin  14 eschew surplusage  15 not omit necessary details  16 avoid slovenliness of form  17 use good grammar  18 employ a simple and straightforward style  even these seven are coldly and persistently violated in the deerslayer tale  coopers gift in the way of invention was not a rich endowment but such as it was he liked to work it he was pleased with the effects and indeed he did some quite sweet things with it in his little box of stage properties he kept six or eight cunning devices tricks artifices for his savages and woodsmen to deceive and circumvent each other with and he was never so happy as when he was working these innocent things and seeing them go a favorite one was to make a moccasined person tread in the tracks of the moccasined enemy and thus hide his own trail cooper wore out barrels and barrels of moccasins in working that trick another stageproperty that he pulled out of his box pretty frequently was his broken twig he prized his broken twig above all the rest of his effects and worked it the hardest it is a restful chapter in any book of his when somebody doesnt step on a dry twig and alarm all the reds and whites for two hundred yards around every time a cooper person is in peril and absolute silence is worth four dollars a minute he is sure to step on a dry twig there may be a hundred handier things to step on but that wouldnt satisfy cooper cooper requires him to turn out and find a dry twig and if he cant do it go and borrow one in fact the leather stocking series ought to have been called the broken twig series  i am sorry there is not room to put in a few dozen instances of the delicate art of the forest as practised by natty bumppo and some of the other cooperian experts perhaps we may venture two or three samples cooper was a sailora naval officer yet he gravely tells us how a vessel driving towards a lee shore in a gale is steered for a particular spot by her skipper because he knows of an undertow there which will hold her back against the gale and save her for just pure woodcraft or sailorcraft or whatever it is isnt that neat for several years cooper was daily in the society of artillery and he ought to have noticed that when a cannonball strikes the ground it either buries itself or skips a hundred feet or so skips again a hundred feet or soand so on till finally it gets tired and rolls now in one place he loses some femalesas he always calls womenin the edge of a wood near a plain at night in a fog on purpose to give bumppo a chance to show off the delicate art of the forest before the reader these mislaid people are hunting for a fort they hear a cannonblast and a cannonball presently comes rolling into the wood and stops at their feet to the females this suggests nothing the case is very different with the admirable bumppo i wish i may never know peace again if he doesnt strike out promptly and follow the track of that cannonball across the plain through the dense fog and find the fort isnt it a daisy if cooper had any real knowledge of natures ways of doing things he had a most delicate art in concealing the fact for instance one of his acute indian experts chingachgook pronounced chicago i think has lost the trail of a person he is tracking through the forest apparently that trail is hopelessly lost neither you nor i could ever have guessed out the way to find it it was very different with chicago chicago was not stumped for long he turned a running stream out of its course and there in the slush in its old bed were that persons moccasintracks the current did not wash them away as it would have done in all other like casesno even the eternal laws of nature have to vacate when cooper wants to put up a delicate job of woodcraft on the reader  we must be a little wary when brander matthews tells us that coopers books reveal an extraordinary fulness of invention as a rule i am quite willing to accept brander matthewss literary judgments and applaud his lucid and graceful phrasing of them but that particular statement needs to be taken with a few tons of salt bless your heart cooper hadnt any more invention than a horse and i dont mean a highclass horse either i mean a clotheshorse it would be very difficult to find a really clever situation in coopers books and still more difficult to find one of any kind which he has failed to render absurd by his handling of it look at the episodes of the caves and at the celebrated scuffle between maqua and those others on the tableland a few days later and at hurry harrys queer watertransit from the castle to the ark and at deerslayers halfhour with his first corpse and at the quarrel between hurry harry and deerslayer later and atbut choose for yourself you cant go amiss  if cooper had been an observer his inventive faculty would have worked better not more interestingly but more rationally more plausibly coopers proudest creations in the way of situations suffer noticeably from the absence of the observers protecting gift coopers eye was splendidly inaccurate cooper seldom saw anything correctly he saw nearly all things as through a glass eye darkly of course a man who cannot see the commonest little everyday matters accurately is working at a disadvantage when he is constructing a situation in the deerslayer tale cooper has a stream which is fifty feet wide where it flows out of a lake it presently narrows to twenty as it meanders along for no given reason and yet when a stream acts like that it ought to be required to explain itself fourteen pages later the width of the brooks outlet from the lake has suddenly shrunk thirty feet and become the narrowest part of the stream this shrinkage is not accounted for the stream has bends in it a sure indication that it has alluvial banks and cuts them yet these bends are only thirty and fifty feet long if cooper had been a nice and punctilious observer he would have noticed that the bends were oftener nine hundred feet long than short of it  cooper made the exit of that stream fifty feet wide in the first place for no particular reason in the second place he narrowed it to less than twenty to accommodate some indians he bends a sapling to the form of an arch over this narrow passage and conceals six indians in its foliage they are laying for a settlers scow or ark which is coming up the stream on its way to the lake it is being hauled against the stiff current by a rope whose stationary end is anchored in the lake its rate of progress cannot be more than a mile an hour cooper describes the ark but pretty obscurely in the matter of dimensions it was little more than a modern canalboat let us guess then that it was about one hundred and forty feet long it was of greater breadth than common let us guess then that it was about sixteen feet wide this leviathan had been prowling down bends which were but a third as long as itself and scraping between banks where it had only two feet of space to spare on each side we cannot too much admire this miracle a lowroofed log dwelling occupies twothirds of the arks lengtha dwelling ninety feet long and sixteen feet wide let us say a kind of vestibule train the dwelling has two roomseach fortyfive feet long and sixteen feet wide let us guess one of them is the bedroom of the hutter girls judith and hetty the other is the parlor in the daytime at night it is papas bedchamber the ark is arriving at the streams exit now whose width has been reduced to less than twenty feet to accommodate the indianssay to eighteen there is a foot to spare on each side of the boat did the indians notice that there was going to be a tight squeeze there did they notice that they could make money by climbing down out of that arched sapling and just stepping aboard when the ark scraped by no other indians would have noticed these things but coopers indians never notice anything cooper thinks they are marvelous creatures for noticing but he was almost always in error about his indians there was seldom a sane one among them  the ark is one hundred and forty feet long the dwelling is ninety feet long the idea of the indians is to drop softly and secretly from the arched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it at the rate of a mile an hour and butcher the family it will take the ark a minute and a half to pass under it will take the ninety foot dwelling a minute to pass under now then what did the six indians do it would take you thirty years to guess and even then you would have to give it up i believe therefore i will tell you what the indians did their chief a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a cooper indian warily watched the canalboat as it squeezed along under him and when he had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade as he judged he let go and dropped and missed the house that is actually what he did he missed the house and landed in the stern of the scow it was not much of a fall yet it knocked him silly he lay there unconscious if the house had been ninetyseven feet long he would have made the trip the fault was coopers not his the error lay in the construction of the house cooper was no architect  there still remained in the roost five indians  the boat has passed under and is now out of their reach let me explain what the five didyou would not be able to reason it out for yourself no 1 jumped for the boat but fell in the water astern of it then no 2 jumped for the boat but fell in the water still farther astern of it then no 3 jumped for the boat and fell a good way astern of it then no 4 jumped for the boat and fell in the water away astern then even no 5 made a jump for the boatfor he was a cooper indian in the matter of intellect the difference between a cooper indian and the indian that stands in front of the cigarshop is not spacious the scow episode is really a sublime burst of invention but it does not thrill because the inaccuracy of the details throws a sort of air of fictitiousness and general improbability over it this comes of coopers inadequacy as an observer  the reader will find some examples of coopers high talent for inaccurate observation in the account of the shootingmatch in the pathfinder            a common wrought nail was driven lightly into the target its           head having been first touched with paint  the color of the paint is not statedan important omission but cooper deals freely in important omissions no after all it was not an important omission for this nailhead is a hundred yards from the marksmen and could not be seen by them at that distance no matter what its color might be  how far can the best eyes see a common housefly a hundred yards it is quite impossible very well eyes that cannot see a housefly that is a hundred yards away cannot see an ordinary nailhead at that distance for the size of the two objects is the same it takes a keen eye to see a fly or a nailhead at fifty yardsone hundred and fifty feet can the reader do it  the nail was lightly driven its head painted and game called then the cooper miracles began the bullet of the first marksman chipped an edge off the nailhead the next mans bullet drove the nail a little way into the targetand removed all the paint havent the miracles gone far enough now not to suit cooper for the purpose of this whole scheme is to show off his prodigy deerslayer hawkeyelongrifleleatherstockingpathfinderbumppo before the ladies            be all ready to clench it boys cried out pathfinder           stepping into his friends tracks the instant they were vacant           never mind a new nail i can see that though the paint is           gone and what i can see i can hit at a hundred yards though           it were only a mosquitos eye  be ready to clench  the rifle cracked the bullet sped its way and the head of the nail was buried in the wood covered by the piece of flattened lead  there you see is a man who could hunt flies with a rifle and command a ducal salary in a wild west show today if we had him back with us  the recorded feat is certainly surprising just as it stands but it is not surprising enough for cooper cooper adds a touch he has made pathfinder do this miracle with another mans rifle and not only that but pathfinder did not have even the advantage of loading it himself he had everything against him and yet he made that impossible shot and not only made it but did it with absolute confidence saying be ready to clench now a person like that would have undertaken that same feat with a brickbat and with cooper to help he would have achieved it too  pathfinder showed off handsomely that day before the ladies his very first feat was a thing which no wild west show can touch he was standing with the group of marksmen observinga hundred yards from the target mind one jasper raised his rifle and drove the centre of the bullseye then the quartermaster fired the target exhibited no result this time there was a laugh its a dead miss said major lundie pathfinder waited an impressive moment or two then said in that calm indifferent knowitall way of his no major he has covered jaspers bullet as will be seen if any one will take the trouble to examine the target  wasnt it remarkable how could he see that little pellet fly through the air and enter that distant bullethole yet that is what he did for nothing is impossible to a cooper person did any of those people have any deepseated doubts about this thing no for that would imply sanity and these were all cooper people            the respect for pathfinders skill and for his quickness and           accuracy of sight the italics  are mine was so           profound and general that the instant he made this declaration           the spectators began to distrust their own opinions and a           dozen rushed to the target in order to ascertain the fact           there sure enough it was found that the quartermasters           bullet had gone through the hole made by jaspers and that           too so accurately as to require a minute examination to be           certain of the circumstance which however was soon clearly           established by discovering one bullet over the other in the           stump against which the target was placed  they made a minute examination but never mind how could they know that there were two bullets in that hole without digging the latest one out for neither probe nor eyesight could prove the presence of any more than one bullet did they dig no as we shall see it is the pathfinders turn now he steps out before the ladies takes aim and fires  but alas here is a disappointment an incredible an unimaginable disappointmentfor the targets aspect is unchanged there is nothing there but that same old bullethole            if one dared to hint at such a thing cried major duncan i           should say that the pathfinder has also missed the target  as nobody had missed it yet the also was not necessary but never mind about that for the pathfinder is going to speak            no no major said he confidently that would be a risky           declaration  i didnt load the piece and cant say what was           in it but if it was lead you will find the bullet driving           down those of the quartermaster and jasper else is not my name           pathfinder            a shout from the target announced the truth of this           assertion  is the miracle sufficient as it stands not for cooper the pathfinder speaks again as he now slowly advances towards the stage occupied by the females            thats not all boys thats not all if you find the target           touched at all ill own to a miss  the quartermaster cut the           wood but youll find no wood cut by that last messenger  the miracle is at last complete he knewdoubtless sawat the distance of a hundred yardsthat his bullet had passed into the hole without fraying the edges there were now three bullets in that one holethree bullets embedded processionally in the body of the stump back of the target everybody knew thissomehow or otherand yet nobody had dug any of them out to make sure cooper is not a close observer but he is interesting he is certainly always that no matter what happens and he is more interesting when he is not noticing what he is about than when he is this is a considerable merit  the conversations in the cooper books have a curious sound in our modern ears to believe that such talk really ever came out of peoples mouths would be to believe that there was a time when time was of no value to a person who thought he had something to say when it was the custom to spread a twominute remark out to ten when a mans mouth was a rollingmill and busied itself all day long in turning fourfoot pigs of thought into thirtyfoot bars of conversational railroad iron by attenuation when subjects were seldom faithfully stuck to but the talk wandered all around and arrived nowhere when conversations consisted mainly of irrelevancies with here and there a relevancy a relevancy with an embarrassed look as not being able to explain how it got there  cooper was certainly not a master in the construction of dialogue inaccurate observation defeated him here as it defeated him in so many other enterprises of his he even failed to notice that the man who talks corrupt english six days in the week must and will talk it on the seventh and cant help himself in the deerslayer story he lets deerslayer talk the showiest kind of booktalk sometimes and at other times the basest of base dialects for instance when some one asks him if he has a sweetheart and if so where she abides this is his majestic answer            shes in the foresthanging from the boughs of the trees in           a soft rainin the dew on the open grassthe clouds that           float about in the blue heavensthe birds that sing in the           woodsthe sweet springs where i slake my thirstand in all           the other glorious gifts that come from gods providence  and he preceded that a little before with this            it consarns me as all things that touches a frind consarns a           frind  and this is another of his remarks            if i was injin born now i might tell of this or carry in           the scalp and boast of the explite afore the whole tribe or           if my inimy had only been a bearand so on  we cannot imagine such a thing as a veteran scotch commanderinchief comporting himself in the field like a windy melodramatic actor but cooper could on one occasion alice and cora were being chased by the french through a fog in the neighborhood of their fathers fort            point de quartier aux coquins cried an eager pursuer who           seemed to direct the operations of the enemy            stand firm and be ready my gallant 60ths suddenly           exclaimed a voice above them wait to see the enemy fire low           and sweep the glacis            father father exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist           it is i  alice thy own elsie spare o save your daughters            hold shouted the former speaker in the awful tones of           parental agony the sound reaching even to the woods and           rolling back in solemn echo  tis she god has restored me my           children throw open the sallyport to the field 60ths to           the field pull not a trigger lest ye kill my lambs  drive           off these dogs of france with your steel  coopers wordsense was singularly dull when a person has a poor ear for music he will flat and sharp right along without knowing it he keeps near the tune but it is not the tune when a person has a poor ear for words the result is a literary flatting and sharping you perceive what he is intending to say but you also perceive that he doesnt say it this is cooper he was not a wordmusician his ear was satisfied with the approximate word i will furnish some circumstantial evidence in support of this charge my instances are gathered from half a dozen pages of the tale called deerslayer he uses verbal for oral precision for facility phenomena for marvels necessary for predetermined unsophisticated for primitive preparation for expectancy rebuked for subdued dependent on for resulting from fact for condition fact for conjecture precaution for caution explain for determine mortified for disappointed meretricious for factitious materially for considerably decreasing for deepening increasing for disappearing embedded for enclosed treacherous for hostile stood for stooped softened for replaced rejoined for remarked situation for condition different for differing insensible for unsentient brevity for celerity distrusted for suspicious mental imbecility for imbecility eyes for sight counteracting for opposing funeral obsequies for obsequies  there have been daring people in the world who claimed that cooper could write english but they are all dead nowall dead but lounsbury i dont remember that lounsbury makes the claim in so many words still he makes it for he says that deerslayer is a pure work of art pure in that connection means faultlessfaultless in all detailsand language is a detail if mr lounsbury had only compared coopers english with the english which he writes himselfbut it is plain that he didnt and so it is likely that he imagines until this day that coopers is as clean and compact as his own now i feel sure deep down in my heart that cooper wrote about the poorest english that exists in our language and that the english of deerslayer is the very worst that even cooper ever wrote  i may be mistaken but it does seem to me that deerslayer is not a work of art in any sense it does seem to me that it is destitute of every detail that goes to the making of a work of art in truth it seems to me that deerslayer is just simply a literary delirium tremens  a work of art it has no invention it has no order system sequence or result it has no lifelikeness no thrill no stir no seeming of reality its characters are confusedly drawn and by their acts and words they prove that they are not the sort of people the author claims that they are its humor is pathetic its pathos is funny its conversations areoh indescribable its lovescenes odious its english a crime against the language  counting these out what is left is art i think we must all admit that
