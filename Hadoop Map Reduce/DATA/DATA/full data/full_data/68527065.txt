theres a woodchuck over on the side hill that is eating my clover said twinkles father who was a farmer  why dont you set a trap for it asked twinkles mother  i believe i will answered the man  so when the midday dinner was over the farmer went to the barn and got a steel trap and carried it over to the cloverfield on the hillside  twinkle wanted very much to go with him but she had to help mamma wash the dishes and put them away and then brush up the diningroom and put it in order but when the work was done and she had all the rest of the afternoon to herself she decided to go over to the woodchucks hole and see how papa had set the trap and also discover if the woodchuck had yet been caught  so the little girl took her blueandwhite sunbonnet and climbed over the garden fence and ran across the cornfield and through the rye until she came to the redclover patch on the hill  she knew perfectly well where the woodchucks hole was for she had looked at it curiously many times so she approached it carefully and found the trap set just in front of the hole if the woodchuck stepped on it when he came out it would grab his leg and hold him fast and there was a chain fastened to the trap and also to a stout post driven into the ground so that when the woodchuck was caught he couldnt run away with the trap  but although the day was bright and sunshiny and just the kind of day woodchucks like the clovereater had not yet walked out of his hole to get caught in the trap  so twinkle lay down in the cloverfield half hidden by a small bank in front of the woodchucks hole and began to watch for the little animal to come out her eyes could see right into the hole which seemed to slant upward into the hill instead of downward but of course she couldnt see very far in because the hole wasnt straight and grew black a little way from the opening  it was somewhat wearisome waiting and watching so long and the warm sun and the soft chirp of the crickets that hopped through the clover made twinkle drowsy she didnt intend to go to sleep because then she might miss the woodchuck but there was no harm in closing her eyes just one little minute so she allowed the long lashes to droop over her pretty pink cheeksjust because they felt so heavy and there was no way to prop them up  then with a start she opened her eyes again and saw the trap and the woodchuck hole just as they were before not quite though come to look carefully the hole seemed to be bigger than at first yes strange as it might seem the hole was growing bigger every minute she watched it with much surprise and then looked at the trap which remained the same size it had always been and when she turned her eyes upon the hole once more it had not only become very big and high but a stone arch appeared over it and a fine polished front door now shut it off from the outside world she could even read a name upon the silver doorplate and the name was this  mister woodchuck    chapter ii mister woodchuck captures a girl  well i declare whispered twinkle to herself how could all that have happened  on each side of the door was a little green bench big enough for two to sit upon and between the benches was a doorstep of white marble with a mat lying on it on one side twinkle saw an electric doorbell  while she gazed at this astonishing sight a sound of rapid footsteps was heard and a large jackrabbit almost as big as herself and dressed in a messengerboys uniform ran up to the woodchucks front door and rang the bell  almost at once the door opened inward and a curious personage stepped out  twinkle saw at a glance that it was the woodchuck himselfbut what a big and queer woodchuck it was  he wore a swallowtailed coat with a waistcoat of white satin and fancy kneebreeches and upon his feet were shoes with silver buckles on his head was perched a tall silk hat that made him look just as high as twinkles father and in one paw he held a goldheaded cane also he wore big spectacles over his eyes which made him look more dignified than any other woodchuck twinkle had ever seen  when this person opened the door and saw the jackrabbit messengerboy he cried out  well what do you mean by ringing my bell so violently i suppose youre half an hour late and trying to make me think youre in a hurry  the jackrabbit took a telegram from its pocket and handed it to the woodchuck without a word in reply at once the woodchuck tore open the envelope and read the telegram carefully  thank you theres no answer he said and in an instant the jackrabbit had whisked away and was gone  well well said the woodchuck as if to himself the foolish farmer has set a trap for me it seems and my friends have sent a telegram to warn me lets seewhere is the thing  he soon discovered the trap and seizing hold of the chain he pulled the peg out of the ground and threw the whole thing far away into the field  i must give that farmer a sound scolding he muttered for hes becoming so impudent lately that soon he will think he owns the whole country  but now his eyes fell upon twinkle who lay in the clover staring up at him and the woodchuck gave a laugh and grabbed her fast by one arm  oh ho he exclaimed youre spying upon me are you  im just waiting to see you get caught in the trap said the girl standing up because the big creature pulled upon her arm she wasnt much frightened strange to say because this woodchuck had a goodhumored way about him that gave her confidence  you would have to wait a long time for that he said with a laugh that was a sort of low chuckle instead of seeing me caught youve got caught yourself thats turning the tables sure enough isnt it  i suppose it is said twinkle regretfully am i a prisoner  you might call it that and then again you mightnt answered the woodchuck to tell you the truth i hardly know what to do with you but come inside and well talk it over we musnt be seen out here in the fields  still holding fast to her arm the woodchuck led her through the door which he carefully closed and locked then they passed through a kind of hallway into which opened several handsomely furnished rooms and out again into a beautiful garden at the back all filled with flowers and brightly colored plants and with a pretty fountain playing in the middle a high stone wall was built around the garden shutting it off from all the rest of the world  the woodchuck led his prisoner to a bench beside the fountain and told her to sit down and make herself comfortable    chapter iii mister woodchuck scolds twinkle  twinkle was much pleased with her surroundings and soon discovered several goldfishes swimming in the water at the foot of the fountain  well how does it strike you asked the woodchuck strutting up and down the gravel walk before her and swinging his goldheaded cane rather gracefully  it seems like a dream said twinkle  to be sure he answered nodding youd no business to fall asleep in the clover  did i she asked rather startled at the suggestion  it stands to reason you did he replied you dont for a moment think this is real do you  it seems real she answered arent you the woodchuck  mister woodchuck if you please address me properly young lady or youll make me angry  well then arent you mister woodchuck  at present i am but when you wake up i wont be he said  then you think im dreaming  you must figure that out for yourself said mister woodchuck  what do you suppose made me dream  i dont know  do you think its something ive eaten she asked anxiously  i hardly think so this isnt any nightmare you know because theres nothing at all horrible about it so far youve probably been reading some of those creepy sensational storybooks  i havent read a book in a long time said twinkle  dreams remarked mister woodchuck thoughtfully are not always to be accounted for but this conversation is all wrong when one is dreaming one doesnt talk about it or even know its a dream so lets speak of something else  its very pleasant in this garden said twinkle i dont mind being here a bit  but you cant stay here replied mister woodchuck and you ought to be very uncomfortable in my presence you see youre one of the deadliest enemies of my race all you human beings live for or think of is how to torture and destroy woodchucks  oh no she answered we have many more important things than that to think of but when a woodchuck gets eating our clover and the vegetables and spoils a lot we just have to do something to stop it thats why my papa set the trap  youre selfish said mister woodchuck and youre cruel to poor little animals that cant help themselves and have to eat what they can find or starve theres enough for all of us growing in the broad fields  twinkle felt a little ashamed  we have to sell the clover and the vegetables to earn our living she explained and if the animals eat them up we cant sell them  we dont eat enough to rob you said the woodchuck and the land belonged to the wild creatures long before you people came here and began to farm and really there is no reason why you should be so cruel it hurts dreadfully to be caught in a trap and an animal captured in that way sometimes has to suffer for many hours before the man comes to kill it we dont mind the killing so much death doesnt last but an instant but every minute of suffering seems to be an hour  thats true said twinkle feeling sorry and repentant ill ask papa never to set another trap  that will be some help returned mister woodchuck more cheerfully and i hope youll not forget the promise when you wake up but that isnt enough to settle the account for all our past sufferings i assure you so i am trying to think of a suitable way to punish you for the past wickedness of your father and of all other men that have set traps  why if you feel that way said the little girl youre just as bad as we are  hows that asked mister woodchuck pausing in his walk to look at her  its as naughty to want revenge as it is to be selfish and cruel she said  i believe you are right about that answered the animal taking off his silk hat and rubbing the fur smooth with his elbow but woodchucks are not perfect any more than men are so youll have to take us as you find us and now ill call my family and exhibit you to them the children especially will enjoy seeing the wild human girl ive had the luck to capture  wild she cried indignantly  if youre not wild now you will be before you wake up he said    chapter iv mrs woodchuck and her family  but mister woodchuck had no need to call his family for just as he spoke a chatter of voices was heard and mrs woodchuck came walking down a path of the garden with several young woodchucks following after her  the lady animal was very fussily dressed with puffs and ruffles and laces all over her silk gown and perched upon her head was a broad white hat with long ostrich plumes she was exceedingly fat even for a woodchuck and her head fitted close to her body without any neck whatever to separate them although it was shady in the garden she held a lace parasol over her head and her walk was so mincing and airy that twinkle almost laughed in her face  the young woodchucks were of several sizes and kinds one little woodchuck girl rolled before her a dolls babycab in which lay a woodchuck doll made of cloth in quite a perfect imitation of a real woodchuck it was stuffed with something soft to make it round and fat and its eyes were two glass beads sewn upon the face a big boy woodchuck wore knickerbockers and a tam o shanter cap and rolled a hoop and there were several smaller boy and girl woodchucks dressed quite as absurdly who followed after their mother in a long train  my dear said mister woodchuck to his wife here is a human creature that i captured just outside our front door  huh sneered the lady woodchuck looking at twinkle in a very haughty way why will you bring such an animal into our garden leander it makes me shiver just to look at the horrid thing  oh mommer yelled one of the children see how skinny the beast is  hasnt any hair on its face at all said another or on its paws  and no sign of a tail cried the little woodchuck girl with the doll  yes its a very strange and remarkable creature said the mother dont touch it my precious darlings it might bite  you neednt worry said twinkle rather provoked at these speeches i wouldnt bite a dirty greasy woodchuck on any account  whoo did you hear what she called us mommer she says were greasy and dirty shouted the children and some of them grabbed pebbles from the path in their paws as if to throw them at twinkle  tut tut dont be cruel said mister woodchuck remember the poor creature is a prisoner and isnt used to good society and besides that shes dreaming  really exclaimed mrs woodchuck looking at the girl curiously  to be sure he answered otherwise she wouldnt see us dressed in such fancy clothes nor would we be bigger than she is the whole thing is unnatural my dear as you must admit  but were not dreaming are we daddy anxiously asked the boy with the hoop  certainly not mister woodchuck answered so this is a fine opportunity for you to study one of those human animals who have always been our worst enemies you will notice they are very curiously made aside from their lack of hair in any place except the top of the head their paws are formed in a strange manner those long slits in them make what are called fingers and their claws are flat and dullnot at all sharp and strong like ours  i think the beast is ugly said mrs woodchuck it would give me the shivers to touch its skinny flesh  im glad of that said twinkle indignantly you wouldnt have all the shivers i can tell you and youre a disagreeable ignrant creature if you had any manners at all youd treat strangers more politely  just listen to the thing said mrs woodchuck in a horrified tone isnt it wild though    chapter v mr woodchuck argues the question  really mister woodchuck said to his wife you should be more considerate of the little humans feelings she is quite intelligent and tame for one of her kind and has a tender heart i am sure  i dont see anything intelligent about her said the girl woodchuck  i guess ive been to school as much as you have said twinkle  school why whats that  dont you know what school is cried twinkle much amused  we dont have school here said mister woodchuck as if proud of the fact  dont you know any geography asked the child  we havent any use for it said mister woodchuck for we never get far from home and dont care a rap what state bounds florida on the south we dont travel much and studying geography would be time wasted  but dont you study arithmetic she asked dont you know how to do sums  why should we he returned the thing that bothers you humans most and thats money is not used by us woodchucks so we dont need to figure and do sums  i dont see how you get along without money said twinkle wonderingly you must have to buy all your fine clothes  you know very well that woodchucks dont wear clothes under ordinary circumstances mister woodchuck replied its only because you are dreaming that you see us dressed in this way  perhaps thats true said twinkle but dont talk to me about not being intelligent or not knowing things if you havent any schools its certain i know more than your whole family put together  about some things perhaps acknowledged mister woodchuck but tell me do you know which kind of red clover is the best to eat  no she said  or how to dig a hole in the ground to live in with different rooms and passages so that it slants up hill and the rain wont come in and drown you  no said twinkle  and could you tell on the second day of february which is woodchuck day you know whether its going to be warm weather or cold during the next six weeks  i dont believe i could replied the girl  then said mister woodchuck there are some things that we know that you dont and although a woodchuck might not be of much account in one of your schoolrooms you must forgive me for saying that i think youd make a mighty poor woodchuck  i think so too said twinkle laughing  and now little human he resumed after looking at his watch its nearly time for you to wake up so if we intend to punish you for all the misery your people has inflicted on the woodchucks we wont have a minute to spare  dont be in a hurry said twinkle i can wait  shes trying to get out of it exclaimed mrs woodchuck scornfully dont you let her leander  certainly not my dear he replied but i havent decided how to punish her  take her to judge stoneyheart said mrs woodchuck he will know what to do with her    chapter vi twinkle is taken to the judge  at this the woodchuck children all hooted with joy crying take her daddy take her to old stoneyheart oh my wont he give it to her though  who is judge stoneyheart asked twinkle a little uneasily  a highly respected and aged woodchuck who is cousin to my wifes grandfather was the reply we consider him the wisest and most intelligent of our race but while he is very just in all things the judge never shows any mercy to evildoers  i havent done anything wrong said the girl  but your father has and much wrong is done us by the other farmers around here they fight my people without mercy and kill every woodchuck they can possibly catch  twinkle was silent for she knew this to be true  for my part continued mister woodchuck im very softhearted and wouldnt even step on an ant if i could help it also i am sure you have a kind disposition but you are a human and i am a woodchuck so i think i will take you to old stoneyheart and let him decide your fate  hooray yelled the young woodchucks and away they ran through the paths of the garden followed slowly by their fat mother who held the lace parasol over her head as if she feared she would be sunstruck  twinkle was glad to see them go she didnt care much for the woodchuck children they were so wild and illmannered and their mother was even more disagreeable than they were as for mister woodchuck she did not object to him so much in fact she rather liked to talk to him for his words were polite and his eyes pleasant and kindly  now my dear he said as we are about to leave this garden where you have been quite secure i must try to prevent your running away when we are outside the wall i hope it wont hurt your feelings to become a real prisoner for a few minutes  then mister woodchuck drew from his pocket a leather collar very much like a dogcollar twinkle thought and proceeded to buckle it around the girls neck to the collar was attached a fine chain about six feet long and the other end of the chain mister woodchuck held in his hand  now then said he please come along quietly and dont make a fuss  he led her to the end of the garden and opened a wooden gate in the wall through which they passed outside the garden the ground was nothing but hard baked earth without any grass or other green thing growing upon it or any tree or shrub to shade it from the hot sun and not far away stood a round mound also of baked earth which twinkle at once decided to be a house because it had a door and some windows in it  there was no living thing in sightnot even a woodchuckand twinkle didnt care much for the bakedclay scenery  mister woodchuck holding fast to the chain led his prisoner across the barren space to the round mound where he paused to rap softly upon the door    chapter vii twinkle is condemned  come in called a voice  mister woodchuck pushed open the door and entered drawing tinkle after him by the chain  in the middle of the room sat a woodchuck whose hair was grizzled with old age he wore big spectacles upon his nose and a round knitted cap with a tassel dangling from the top upon his head his only garment was an old and faded dressinggown  when they entered the old woodchuck was busy playing a game with a number of bakedclay dominoes which he shuffled and arranged upon a bakedmud table nor did he look up for a long time but continued to match the dominoes and to study their arrangement with intense interest  finally however he finished the game and then he raised his head and looked sharply at his visitors  good afternoon judge said mister woodchuck taking off his silk hat and bowing respectfully  the judge did not answer him but continued to stare at twinkle  i have called to ask your advice continued mister woodchuck by good chance i have been able to capture one of those fierce humans that are the greatest enemies of peaceful woodchucks  the judge nodded his gray head wisely but still answered nothing  but now that ive captured the creature i dont know what to do with her went on mister woodchuck although i believe of course she should be punished in some way and made to feel as unhappy as her people have made us feel yet i realize that its a dreadful thing to hurt any living creature and as far as im concerned im quite willing to forgive her with these words he wiped his face with a red silk handkerchief as if really distressed  shes dreaming said the judge in a sharp quick voice  am i asked twinkle  of course you were probably lying on the wrong side when you went to sleep  oh she said i wondered what made it  very disagreeable dream isnt it continued the judge  not so very she answered its interesting to see and hear woodchucks in their own homes and mister woodchuck has shown me how cruel it is for us to set traps for you  good said the judge but some dreams are easily forgotten so ill teach you a lesson youll be likely to remember you shall be caught in a trap yourself  me cried twinkle in dismay  yes you when you find how dreadfully it hurts youll bear the traps in mind forever afterward people dont remember dreams unless the dreams are unusually horrible but i guess youll remember this one  he got up and opened a mud cupboard from which he took a big steel trap twinkle could see that it was just like the trap papa had set to catch the woodchucks only it seemed much bigger and stronger  the judge got a mallet and with it pounded a stake into the mud floor then he fastened the chain of the trap to the stake and afterward opened the iron jaws of the cruellooking thing and set them with a lever so that the slightest touch would spring the trap and make the strong jaws snap together  now little girl said he you must step in the trap and get caught  why it would break my leg cried twinkle  did your father care whether a woodchuck got its leg broken or not asked the judge  no she answered beginning to be greatly frightened  step cried the judge sternly  it will hurt awfully said mister woodchuck but that cant be helped traps are cruel things at the best  twinkle was now trembling with nervousness and fear  step called the judge again  dear me said mister woodchuck just then as he looked earnestly into twinkles face i believe shes going to wake up  thats too bad said the judge  no im glad of it replied mister woodchuck  and just then the girl gave a start and opened her eyes  she was lying in the clover and before her was the opening of the woodchucks hole with the trap still set before it    chapter viii twinkle remembers  papa said twinkle when supper was over and she was nestled snugly in his lap i wish you wouldnt set any more traps for the woodchucks  why not my darling he asked in surprise  theyre cruel she answered it must hurt the poor animals dreadfully to be caught in them  i suppose it does said her father thoughtfully but if i dont trap the woodchucks they eat our clover and vegetables  never mind that said twinkle earnestly lets divide with them god made the woodchucks you know just as he made us and they cant plant and grow things as we do so they have to take what they can get or starve to death and surely papa theres enough to eat in this big and beautiful world for all of gods creatures  papa whistled softly although his face was grave and then he bent down and kissed his little girls forehead  i wont set any more traps dear he said  and that evening after twinkle had been tucked snugly away in bed her father walked slowly through the sweetsmelling fields to the woodchucks hole there lay the trap showing plainly in the bright moonlight he picked it up and carried it back to the barn it was never used again   the end    bandit jim crow    bandit jim crow    list of chapters                                                 page i     jim crow becomes a pet73 ii    jim crow runs away81 iii   jim crow finds a new home86 iv    jim crow becomes a robber97 v     jim crow meets policeman blue jay105 vi    jim crow fools the policeman113 vii   jim crow is punished121 viii  jim crow has time to repent his sins129    chapter i jim crow becomes a pet  one day when twinkles father was in the cornfield he shot his gun at a flock of crows that were busy digging up with their long bills the kernels of corn he had planted but twinkles father didnt aim very straight for the birds screamed at the bang of the gun and quickly flew awayall except one young crow that fluttered its wings but couldnt rise into the air and so began to run along the ground in an effort to escape  the man chased the young crow and caught it and then he found that one of the little lead bullets had broken the right wing although the bird seemed not to be hurt in any other way  it struggled hard and tried to peck the hands that held it but it was too young to hurt any one so twinkles father decided he would carry it home to his little girl  heres a pet for you twinkle he said as he came into the house it cant fly because its wing is broken but dont let it get too near your eyes or it may peck at them its very wild and fierce you know  twinkle was delighted with her pet and at once got her mother to bandage the broken wing so that it would heal quickly  the crow had jet black feathers but there was a pretty purplish and violet gloss or sheen on its back and wings and its eyes were bright and had a knowing look in them they were hazelbrown in color and the bird had a queer way of turning his head on one side to look at twinkle with his right eye and then twisting it the other side that he might see her with his left eye she often wondered if she looked the same to both eyes or if each one made her seem different  she named her pet jim crow because papa said that all crows were called jim although he never could find out the reason but the name seemed to fit her pet as well as any so twinkle never bothered about the reason  having no cage to keep him in and fearing he would run away the girl tied a strong cord around one of jim crows legs and the other end of the cord she fastened to the round of a chairor to the tablelegwhen they were in the house the crow would run all around as far as the string would let him go but he couldnt get away and when they went out of doors twinkle held the end of the cord in her hand as one leads a dog and jim crow would run along in front of her and then stop and wait and when she came near hed run on again screaming caw caw at the top of his shrill little voice  he soon came to know he belonged to twinkle and would often lie in her lap or perch upon her shoulder and whenever she entered the room where he was he would say cawcaw to her in pleading tones until she picked him up or took some notice of him  it was wonderful how quickly a bird that had always lived wild and free seemed to become tame and gentle twinkles father said that was because he was so young and because his broken wing kept him from flying in the air and rejoining his fellows but jim crow wasnt as tame as he seemed and he had a very wicked and ungrateful disposition as you will presently learn  for a few weeks however he was as nice a pet as any little girl could wish for he got into mischief occasionally and caused mamma some annoyance when he waded into a pan of milk or jumped upon the dinner table and ate up papas pumpkin pie before twinkle could stop him but all pets are more or less trouble at times so jim crow escaped with a few severe scoldings from mamma which never seemed to worry him in the least or make him a bit unhappy    chapter ii jim crow runs away  at last jim got so tame that twinkle took the cord off his leg and let him go free wherever he pleased so he wandered all over the house and out into the yard where he chased the ducks and bothered the pigs and made himself generally disliked he had a way of perching upon the back of old tom papas favorite horse and chattering away in toms ear until the horse plunged and pranced in his stall to get rid of his unwelcome visitor  twinkle always kept the bandage on the wounded wing for she didnt know whether it was well yet or not and she thought it was better to be on the safe side but the truth was that jim crows wing had healed long ago and was now as strong as ever and as the weeks passed by and he grew big and fat a great longing came into his wild heart to fly again far far up into the air and away to the lands where there were forests of trees and brooks of running water  he didnt ever expect to rejoin his family again they were far enough away by this time and he didnt care much to associate with other crows all he wanted was to be free and do exactly as he pleased and not have some one cuffing him a dozen times a day because he was doing wrong  so one morning before twinkle was up or even awake jim crow pecked at the bandage on his wing until he got the end unfastened and then it wasnt long before the entire strip of cloth was loosened and fell to the ground  now jim fluttered his feathers and pruned them with his long bill where they had been pressed together and presently he knew that the wing which had been injured was exactly as strong and well as the other one he could fly away whenever he pleased  the crow had been well fed by twinkle and her mamma and was in splendid health but he was not at all grateful with the knowledge of his freedom a fierce cruel joy crept into his heart and he resumed the wild nature that crows are born with and never lay aside as long as they live  having forgotten in an instant that he had ever been tame and the pet of a gentle little girl jim crow had no thought of saying goodbye to twinkle instead he decided he would do something that would make these foolish humans remember him for a long time so he dashed into a group of young chickens that had only been hatched a day or two before and killed seven of them with his strong curved claws and his wicked black beak when the mother hen flew at him he pecked at her eyes and then screaming a defiance to all the world jim crow flew into the air and sailed away to a new life in another part of the world    chapter iii jim crow finds a new home  ill not try to tell you of all the awful things this bad crow did during the next few days on his long journey toward the south  twinkle almost cried when she found her pet gone and she really did cry when she saw the poor murdered chickens but mamma said she was very glad to have jim crow run away and papa scowled angrily and declared he was sorry he had not killed the cruel bird when he shot at it in the cornfield  in the mean time the runaway crow flew through the country and when he was hungry he would stop at a farmhouse and rob a hens nest and eat the eggs it was his knowledge of farmhouses that made him so bold but the farmers shot at the thieving bird once or twice and this frightened jim crow so badly that he decided to keep away from the farms and find a living in some less dangerous way  and one day he came to a fine forest where there were big and little trees of all kinds with several streams of water running through the woods  here said jim crow i will make my home for surely this is the finest place i am ever likely to find  there were plenty of birds in this forest for jim could hear them singing and twittering everywhere among the trees and their nests hung suspended from branches or nestled in a fork made by two limbs in almost every direction he might look and the birds were of many kinds too robins thrushes bullfinches mockingbirds wrens yellowtails and skylarks even tiny hummingbirds fluttered around the wild flowers that grew in the glades and in the waters of the brooks waded longlegged herons while kingfishers sat upon overhanging branches and waited patiently to seize any careless fish that might swim too near them jim crow decided this must be a real paradise for birds because it was far away from the houses of men so he made up his mind to get acquainted with the inhabitants of the forest as soon as possible and let them know who he was and that he must be treated with proper respect  in a big firtree whose branches reached nearly to the ground he saw a large gathering of the birds who sat chattering and gossiping pleasantly together so he flew down and joined them  good morning folks he said and his voice sounded to them like a harsh croak because it had become much deeper in tone since he had grown to his full size  the birds looked at him curiously and one or two fluttered their wings in a timid and nervous way but none of them little or big thought best to make any reply  well said jim crow gruffly whats the matter with you fellows havent you got tongues you seemed to talk fast enough a minute ago  excuse me replied a bullfinch in a dignified voice we havent the honor of your acquaintance you are a stranger  my names jim crow he answered and i wont be a stranger long because im going to live here  they all looked grave at this speech and a little thrush hopped from one branch to another and remarked  we havent any crows here at all if you want to find your own folks you must go to some other place  what do i care about my own folks asked jim with a laugh that made the little thrush shudder i prefer to live alone  havent you a mate asked a robin speaking in a very polite tone  no and i dont want any said jim crow im going to live all by myself theres plenty of room in this forest i guess  certainly replied the bullfinch there is plenty of room for you here if you behave yourself and obey the laws  whos going to make me he asked angrily  any decent person even if hes a crow is bound to respect the law answered the bullfinch calmly  jim crow was a little ashamed for he didnt wish to acknowledge he wasnt decent so he said  what are your laws  the same as those in all other forests you must respect the nests and the property of all other birds and not interfere with them when theyre hunting for food and you must warn your fellowbirds whenever there is danger and assist them to protect their young from prowling beasts if you obey these laws and do not steal from or interfere with your neighbors you have a right to a nest in our forest  to be quite frank with you though said the robin we prefer your room to your company  im going to stay said the crow i guess im as good as the rest of you so you fellows just mind your own business and ill mind mine  with these words he left them and when he had mounted to a position above the trees he saw that one tall slim pine was higher than all the rest and that at its very top was a big deserted nest    chapter iv jim crow becomes a robber  it looked like a crows nest to jim so he flew toward the pine tree and lit upon a branch close by one glance told him that at some time it really must have been the home of birds of his kind who for some reason had abandoned it long ago the nest was large and bulky being made of strong sticks woven together with fine roots and grasses it was rough outside but smooth inside and when jim crow had kicked out the dead leaves and twigs that had fallen into it he decided it was nearly as good as new and plenty good enough for a solitary crow like him to live in so with his bill he made a mark on the nest that every bird might know it belonged to him and felt that at last he had found a home  during the next few days he made several attempts to get acquainted with the other birds but they were cold and distant though very polite to him and none of them seemed to care for his society  no bird ever came near his nest but he often flew down to the lower trees and perched upon one or another of them so gradually the birds of the forest got used to seeing him around and paid very little attention to his actions  one day mrs wren missed two brown eggs from her nest and her little heart was nearly broken with grief it took the mocking bird and the bullfinch a whole afternoon to comfort her while mr wren hopped around in nearly as much distress as his wife no animals had been seen in the forest who would do this evil thing so no one could imagine who the thief might be  such an outrage was almost unknown in this pleasant forest and it made all the birds nervous and fearful a few days later a still greater horror came upon them for the helpless young children of mrs linnet were seized one morning from their nest while their parents were absent in search of food and were carried away bodily mr linnet declared that on his way back to his nest he had seen a big black monster leaving it but had been too frightened to notice just what the creature looked like but the lark who had been up very early that morning stated that he had seen no one near that part of the forest except jim crow who had flown swiftly to his nest in the tall pinetree  this was enough to make all the birds look upon jim crow with grave suspicion and robin redbreast called a secret meeting of all the birds to discuss the question and decide what must be done to preserve their nests from the robber jim crow was so much bigger and fiercer than any of the others that none dared accuse him openly or venture to quarrel with him but they had a good friend living not far away who was not afraid of jim crow or any one else so they finally decided to send for him and ask his assistance  the starling undertook to be the messenger and as soon as the meeting was over he flew away upon his errand  what were all you folks talking about asked the crow flying down and alighting upon a limb near to those who had not yet left the place of meeting  we were talking about you said the thrush boldly and you wouldnt care at all to know what we said mister jim crow  jim looked a trifle guilty and ashamed at hearing this but knowing they were all afraid of him he burst out into a rude laugh  caw caw caw he chuckled hoarsely what do i care what you say about me but dont you get saucy my pretty thrush or your friends will miss you some fine morning and never see you again  this awful threat made them all silent for they remembered the fate of poor mrs linnets children and very few of the birds now had any doubt but that jim crow knew more about the death of those helpless little ones than he cared to tell  finding they would not talk with him the crow flew back to his tree where he sat sullenly perched upon a branch near his nest and they were very glad to get rid of him so easily    chapter v jim crow meets policeman blue jay  next morning jim crow woke up hungry and as he sat lazily in his big nest he remembered that he had seen four pretty brown eggs speckled with white in the nest of the oriole that lived at the edge of the forest  those eggs will taste very good for breakfast he thought ill go at once and get them and if old mammy oriole makes a fuss ill eat her too  he hopped out of his nest and on to a branch and the first thing his sharp eye saw was a big and strange bird sitting upon the tree just opposite him and looking steadily in his direction  never having lived among other birds until now the crow did not know what kind of bird this was but as he faced the newcomer he had a sort of shiver in his heart that warned him to beware an enemy indeed it was none other than the blue jay that had appeared so suddenly and he had arrived that morning because the starling had told him of the thefts that had taken place and the blue jay is well known as the policeman of the forest and a terror to all evildoers  in size he was nearly as big as jim crow himself and he had a large crest of feathers on the top of his head that made him look even more fierceespecially when he ruffled them up his body was purplish blue color on the back and purplish gray below and there was a collar of black feathers running all around his neck but his wings and tail were a beautiful rich blue as delightful in color as the sky on a fine may morning so in personal appearance policeman blue jay was much handsomer than jim crow but it was the sharp stout beak that most alarmed the crow and had jim been wiser he would have known that before him was the most deadly foe of his race and that the greatest pleasure a blue jay finds in life is to fight with and punish a crow  but jim was not very wise and so he imagined after his first terror had passed away that he could bully this bird as he had the others and make it fear him  well what are you doing here he called out in his crossest voice for he was anxious to get away and rob the orioles nest  the blue jay gave a scornful chattering laugh as he answered  thats none of your business jim crow  take care warned the crow youll be sorry if you dont treat me with proper respect  the blue jay winked solemnly in a way that would have been very comical to any observer other than the angry crow  dont hurt meplease dont he said fluttering on the branch as if greatly frightened my mother would feel dreadful bad if anything happened to me  well then behave yourself returned the crow strutting proudly along a limb and flopping his broad wings in an impressive manner for he was foolish enough to think he had made the other afraid  but no sooner had he taken flight and soared into the air than the blue jay darted at him like an arrow from a bow and before jim crow could turn to defend himself the bill of his enemy struck him full in the breast then with a shriek of shrill laughter the policeman darted away and disappeared in the forest leaving the crow to whirl around in the air once or twice and then sink slowly down with some of his own torn feathers floating near him as witnesses to his defeat  the attack had dazed and astonished him beyond measure but he found he was not much hurt after all crows are tougher than most birds jim managed to reach one of the brooks where he bathed his breast in the cool water and soon he felt much refreshed and more like his old self again  but he decided not to go to the orioles nest that morning but to search for grabs and beetles amongst the mosses beneath the oaktrees    chapter vi jim crow fools the policeman  from that time on policeman blue jay made his home in the forest keeping a sharp eye upon the actions of jim crow and one day he flew away to the southward and returned with mrs blue jay who was even more beautiful than her mate together they built a fine nest in a tree that stood near to the crows tall pine and soon after they had settled down to housekeeping mrs blue jay began to lay eggs of a pretty brown color mottled with darker brown specks  had jim crow known what was best for him he would have flown away from this forest and found himself a new home within a short flight were many bits of woodland where a crow might get a good living and not be bothered by blue jays but jim was obstinate and foolish and had made up his mind that he never would again be happy until he had been revenged upon his enemy  he dared no longer rob the nests so boldly as he had before so he became sly and cunning he soon found out that the blue jay could not fly as high as he could nor as fast so if he kept a sharp lookout for the approach of his foe he had no trouble in escaping but if he went near to the nests of the smaller birds there was the blue policeman standing guard and ready and anxious to fight at a moments notice it was really no place for a robber at all unless the robber was clever  one day jim crow discovered a chalkpit among the rocks at the north of the forest just beyond the edge of trees the chalk was soft and in some places crumbled to a fine powder so that when he had rolled himself for a few minutes in the dust all his feathers became as white as snow this fact gave to jim crow a bright idea no longer black but white as a dove he flew away to the forest and passed right by policeman blue jay who only noticed that a big white bird had flown amongst the trees and did not suspect it was the thieving crow in a clever disguise  jim found a robins nest that was not protected both the robin and his wife being away in search of food so he ate up the eggs and kicked the nest to pieces and then flew away again passing the blue jay a second time all unnoticed  when he reached a brook he washed all the chalk away from his feathers and then returned to his nest as black as ever  all the birds were angry and dismayed when they found what had happened but none could imagine who had robbed the robins mrs robin who was not easily discouraged built another nest and laid more eggs in it but the next day a second nest in the forest was robbed and then another and another until the birds complained that policeman blue jay did not protect them at all  i cant understand it in the least said the policeman for i have watched carefully and i know jim crow has never dared to come near to your trees  then some one else is the robber declared the thrush fussily  the only stranger i have noticed around here is a big white bird replied the blue jay and white birds never rob nests or eat eggs as you all know very well  so they were no nearer the truth than before and the thefts continued for each day jim crow would make himself white in the chalkpit fly into the forest and destroy the precious eggs of some innocent little bird and afterward wash himself in some faraway brook and return to his nest chuckling with glee to think he had fooled the blue jay so nicely  but the blue jay although stupid and unsuspecting at first presently began to get a little wisdom he remembered that all this trouble had commenced when the strange white bird first arrived in the forest and although it was doubtless true that white birds never eat eggs and have honest reputations he decided to watch this stranger and make sure that it was innocent of the frightful crimes that had so aroused the dwellers in the forest    chapter vii jim crow is punished  so one day policeman blue jay hid himself in some thick bushes until he saw the big white bird fly by and then he followed quietly after it flitting from tree to tree and keeping out of sight as much as possible until at last he saw the white bird alight near a bullfinchs nest and eat up all the eggs it contained  then ruffling his crest angrily policeman blue jay flew to attack the big white robber and was astonished to find he could not catch it for the white bird flew higher into the air than he could and also flew much faster so that it soon escaped and passed out of sight  it must be a white crow thought the blue jay for only a crow can beat me at flying and some of that race are said to be white although i have never seen one  so he called together all the birds and told them what he had seen and they all agreed to hide themselves the next day and lie in wait for the thief  by this time jim crow thought himself perfectly safe and success had made him as bold as he was wicked therefore he suspected nothing when after rolling himself in the chalk he flew down the next day into the forest to feast upon birds eggs he soon came to a pretty nest and was just about to rob it when a chorus of shrill cries arose on every side of him and hundreds of birdsso many that they quite filled the air flew straight at the white one pecking him with their bills and striking him with their wings for anger had made even the most timid of the little birds fierce and there were so many of them that they gave each other courage  jim crow tried to escape but whichever way he might fly his foes clustered all around him getting in his way so that he could not use his big wings properly and all the time they were pecking at him and fighting him as hard as they could also the chalk was brushed from his feathers by degrees and soon the birds were able to recognize their old enemy the crow and then indeed they became more furious than ever  policeman blue jay was especially angry at the deception practiced upon him and if he could have got at the crow just then he would have killed it instantly but the little birds were all in his way so he was forced to hold aloof  filled with terror and smarting with pain jim crow had only one thought to get to the shelter of his nest in the pinetree in some way he managed to do this and to sink exhausted into the hollow of his nest but many of his enemies followed him and although the thick feathers of his back and wings protected his body jims head and eyes were at the mercy of the sharp bills of the vengeful birds  when at last they left him thinking he had been sufficiently punished jim crow was as nearly dead as a bird could be but crows are tough and this one was unlucky enough to remain alive for when his wounds had healed he had become totally blind and day after day he sat in his nest helpless and alone and dared not leave it    chapter viii jim crow has time to repent his sins  where are you going my dear asked the blue jay of his wife  im going to carry some grubs to jim crow she answered ill be back in a minute  jim crow is a robber and a murderer said the policeman harshly  i know she replied in a sweet voice but he is blind  well fly along said her husband but hurry back again  and the robinredbreast and his wife filled a cupshaped flower with water from the brook and then carried it in their bills to the pinetree without spilling a drop  where are you going asked the oriole as they passed  were just taking some water to jim crow replied mrs robin  hes a thief and a scoundrel cried the oriole indignantly  that is true said mrs robin in a soft pitiful voice but he is blind  let me help you exclaimed the oriole ill carry this side of the cup so it cant tip  so jim crow blind and helpless sat in his nest day after day and week after week while the little birds he had so cruelly wronged brought him food and water and cared for him as generously as they could  and i wonder what his thoughts weredont you    prairiedog town    prariedog town    list of chapters

weenty174 vii        the mayor gives a luncheon181 viii        on top of the earth again189    chapter i the picnic  on the great western prairies of dakota is a little town called edgeley because it is on the edge of civilizationa very big word which means some folks have found a better way to live than other folks the edgeley people have a good way to live for there are almost seventeen wooden houses there and among them is a schoolhouse a church a store and a blacksmithshop if people walked out their front doors they were upon the little street if they walked out the back doors they were on the broad prairies that was why twinkle who was a farmers little girl lived so near the town that she could easily walk to school  she was a pretty rosycheeked little thing with long fluffy hair and big round eyes that everybody smiled into when they saw them it was hard to keep that fluffy hair from getting tangled so mamma used to tie it in the back with a big broad ribbon and twinkle wore calico slips for school days and gingham dresses when she wanted to dress up or look especially nice and to keep the sun from spotting her face with freckles she wore sunbonnets made of the same goods as her dresses  twinkles best chum was a little boy called chubbins who was the only child of the tiredfaced schoolteacher chubbins was about as old as twinkle but he wasnt so tall and slender for his age as she was being short and rather fat the hair on his little round head was cut close and he usually wore a shirtwaist and knickers with a wide straw hat on the back of his head chubbinss face was very solemn he never said many words when grown folks were around but he could talk fast enough when he and twinkle were playing together alone  well one saturday the school had a picnic and twinkle and chubbins both went on the dakota prairies there are no shadetrees at all and very little water except what they they get by boring deep holes in the ground so you may wonder where the people could possibly have a picnic but about three miles from the town a little stream of water which they called a river but we would call only a brook ran slow and muddy across the prairie and where the road crossed it a flat bridge had been built if you climbed down the banks of the river you would find a nice shady place under the wooden bridge and so here it was that the picnics were held  all the village went to the picnic and they started bright and early in the morning with horses and farmwagons and baskets full of good things to eat and soon arrived at the bridge  there was room enough in its shade for all to be comfortable so they unhitched the horses and carried the baskets to the river bank and began to laugh and be as merry as they could  twinkle and chubbins however didnt care much for the shade of the bridge this was a strange place to them so they decided to explore it and see if it was any different from any other part of the prairie without telling anybody where they were going they took hold of hands and trotted across the bridge and away into the plains on the other side  the ground here wasnt flat but had long rolls to it like big waves on the ocean so that as soon as the little girl and boy had climbed over the top of the first wave or hill those by the river lost sight of them  they saw nothing but grass in the first hollow but there was another hill just beyond so they kept going and climbed over that too and now they found lying in the second hollow one of the most curious sights that the western prairies afford  what is it asked chubbins wonderingly  why its a prairiedog town said twinkle    chapter ii prariedog town  lying in every direction and quite filling the little hollow were round mounds of earth each one having a hole in the center the mounds were about two feet high and as big around as a washtub and the edges of the holes were pounded hard and smooth by the pattering feet of the little creatures that lived within  isnt it funny said chubbins staring at the mounds  awful replied twinkle staring too do you know chub there are anmals living in every single one of those holes  what kind asked chubbins  well theyre something like squirrels only they arent squirrels she explained theyre prairiedogs  dont like dogs said the boy looking a bit uneasy  oh theyre not dogs at all said twinkle theyre soft and fluffy and gentle  do they bark he asked  yes but they dont bite  how d you know twink  papa has told me about them lots of times he says theyre so shy that they run into their holes when anybodys around but if you keep quiet and watch theyll stick their heads out in a few minutes  lets watch said chubbins  all right she agreed  very near to some of the mounds was a raised bank covered with soft grass so the children stole softly up to this bank and lay down upon it in such a way that their heads just stuck over the top of it while their bodies were hidden from the eyes of any of the folks of prairiedog town  are you comferble chub asked the little girl  yes  then lie still and dont talk and keep your eyes open and perhaps the anmals will stick their heads up  all right says chubbins  so they kept quiet and waited and it seemed a long time to both the boy and the girl before a soft furry head popped out of a nearby hole and two big gentle brown eyes looked at them curiously    chapter iii mr bowko the mayor  dear me said the prairiedog speaking almost in a whisper here are some of those queer humans from the village  let me see let me see cried two shrill little voices and the wee heads of two small creatures popped out of the hole and fixed their bright eyes upon the heads of twinkle and chubbins  go down at once said the mother prairiedog do you want to get hurt you naughty little things  oh they wont get hurt said another deeper voice and the children turned their eyes toward a second mound on top of which sat a plump prairiedog whose reddish fur was tipped with white on the end of each hair he seemed to be quite old or at least well along in years and he had a wise and thoughtful look on his face  theyre humans said the mother  true enough but theyre only human children and wouldnt hurt your little ones for the world the old one said  thats so called twinkle all we want is to get acquainted  why in that case replied the old prairiedog you are very welcome in our town and were glad to see you  thank you said twinkle gratefully it didnt occur to her just then that it was wonderful to be talking to the little prairiedogs just as if they were people it seemed very natural they should speak with each other and be friendly  as if attracted by the sound of voices little heads began to pop out of the other moundsone here and one thereuntil the town was alive with the pretty creatures all squatting near the edges of their holes and eyeing chubbins and twinkle with grave and curious looks  let me introduce myself said the old one that had first proved friendly my name is bowko and im the mayor and high chief of prairiedog town  dont you have a king asked twinkle  not in this town he answered there seems to be no place for kings in this free united states and a mayor and high chief is just as good as a king any day  i think so too answered the girl  better declared chubbins  the mayor smiled as if pleased  i see youve been properly brought up he continued and now let me introduce to you some of my fellowcitizens this pointing with one little paw to the hole where the mother and her two children were sitting is mrs puffpudgy and her familyteenty and weenty mr puffpudgy i regret to say was recently chased out of town for saying his prayers backwards  how could he asked chubbins much surprised  he was always contrary answered the mayor with a sigh and wouldnt do things the same way that others did his good wife mrs puffpudgy had to scold him all day long so we finally made him leave the town and i dont know where hes gone to  wont he be sorry not to have his little children any more asked twinkle regretfully  i suppose so but if people are contrary and wont behave they must take the consequences this is mr chuckledorf continued the mayor and a very fat prairiedog bowed to them most politely and here is mrs fuzcum and mrs chatterby and mr sneezeley and doctor dosem  all these folks bowed gravely and politely and chubbins and twinkle bobbed their heads in return until their necks ached for it seemed as if the mayor would never get through introducing the hundreds of prairiedogs that were squatting around  ill never be able to tell one from the other whispered the girl cause they all look exactly alike  some of ems fatter observed chubbins but i dont know which    chapter iv presto digi the magician  and now if you like we will be pleased to have you visit some of our houses said mr bowko the mayor in a friendly tone  but we cant exclaimed twinkle were too big and she got up and sat down upon the bank to show him how big she really was when compared with the prairiedogs  oh that doesnt matter in the least the mayor replied ill have presto digi our magician reduce you to our size  can he asked twinkle doubtfully  our magician can do anything declared the mayor then he sat up and put both his front paws to his mouth and made a curious sound that was something like a bark and something like a whistle but not exactly like either one  then everybody waited in silence until a queer old prairiedog slowly put his head out of a big mound near the center of the village  good morning mr presto digi said the mayor  morning answered the magician blinking his eyes as if he had just awakened from sleep  twinkle nearly laughed at this scrawny skinny personage but by good fortune for she didnt wish to offend him she kept her face straight and did not even smile  we have two guests here this morning continued the mayor addressing the magician who are a little too large to get into our houses so as they are invited to stay to luncheon it would please us all if you would kindly reduce them to fit our underground rooms  is that all you want asked mr presto digi bobbing his head at the children  it seems to me a great deal answered twinkle im afraid you never could do it  wow said the magician in a scornful voice that was almost a bark i can do that with one paw come here to me and dont step on any of our mounds while youre so big and clumsy  so twinkle and chubbins got up and walked slowly toward the magician taking great care where they stepped teenty and weenty were frightened and ducked their heads with little squeals as the big children passed their mound but they bobbed up again the next moment being curious to see what would happen  when the boy and girl stopped before mr presto digis mound he began waving one of his thin scraggy paws and at the same time made a gurgling noise that was deep down in his throat and his eyes rolled and twisted around in a very odd way  neither twinkle nor chubbins felt any effect from the magic nor any different from ordinary but they knew they were growing smaller because their eyes were getting closer to the magician  is that enough asked mr presto after a while  just a little more please replied the mayor i dont want them to bump their heads against the doorways  so the magician again waved his paw and chuckled and gurgled and blinked until twinkle suddenly found she had to look up at him as he squatted on his mound  stop she screamed if you keep on we wont be anything at all  youre just about the right size said the mayor looking them over with much pleasure and when the girl turned around she found mr bowko and mrs puffpudgy standing beside her and she could easily see that chubbins was no bigger than they and she was no bigger than chubbins  kindly follow me said mrs puffpudgy for my little darlings are anxious to make your acquaintance and as i was the first to discover you you are to be my guests first of all and afterward go to the mayors to luncheon    chapter v the home of the puffpudgys  so twinkle and chubbins still holding hands trotted along to the puffpudgy mound and it was strange how rough the ground now seemed to their tiny feet they climbed up the slope of the mound rather clumsily and when they came to the hole it seemed to them as big as a well then they saw that it wasnt a deep hole but a sort of tunnel leading down hill into the mound and twinkle knew if they were careful they were not likely to slip or tumble down  mrs puffpudgy popped into the hole like a flash for she was used to it and waited just below the opening to guide them so twinkle slipped down to the floor of the tunnel and chubbins followed close after her and then they began to go downward  its a little dark right here said mrs puffpudgy but ive ordered the maid to light the candles for you so youll see well enough when youre in the rooms  thank you said twinkle walking along the hall and feeling her way by keeping her hand upon the smooth sides of the passage i hope you wont go to any trouble or put on airs just because weve come to visit you  if i do replied mrs puffypudgy its because i know the right way to treat company weve always belonged to the four hundred you know some folks never know what to do or how to do it but that isnt the way with the puffpudgys hi you teenty and weentyget out of here and behave yourselves youll soon have a good look at our visitors  and now they came into a room so comfortable and even splendid that twinkles eyes opened wide with amazement  it was big and of a round shape and on the walls were painted very handsome portraits of different prairiedogs of the puffpudgy family the furniture was made of white clay baked hard in the sun and decorated with paints made from blue clay and red clay and yellow clay this gave it a gorgeous appearance there was a round table in the middle of the room and several comfortable chairs and sofas around the walls were little brackets with candles in them lighting the place very pleasantly  sit down please said mrs puffpudgy youll want to rest a minute before i show you around  so twinkle and chubbins sat upon the pretty clay chairs and teenty and weenty sat opposite them and stared with their mischievous round eyes as hard as they could  what nice furniture exclaimed the girl  yes replied mrs puffpudgy looking up at the picture of a sadfaced prairiedog mr puffpudgy made it all himself he was very handy at such things its a shame he turned out so obstinate  did he build the house too  why he dug it out if thats what you mean but i advised him how to do it so i deserve some credit for it myself next to the mayors its the best house in town which accounts for our high social standing weenty take your paw out of your mouth youre biting your claws again  im not said weenty  and now continued mrs puffpudgy if you are rested ill show you through the rest of our house  so they got up and followed her and she led the children through an archway into the diningroom here was a cupboard full of the cunningest little dishes twinkle had ever seen they were all made of clay baked hard in the sun and were of graceful shapes and nearly as smooth and perfect as our own dishes    chapter vi teenty and weenty  all around the sides of the diningroom were pockets or bins in the wall and these were full of those things the prairiedogs are most fond of eating cloverseeds filled one bin and sweet roots another dried mulberry leavesthat must have come from a long distancewere in another bin and even kernels of yellow field corn were heaped in one place the puffpudgys were surely in no danger of starving for some time to come  teenty put back that grain of wheat commanded the mother in a severe voice  instead of obeying teenty put the wheat in his mouth and ate it as quickly as possible  the little dears are so restless mrs puffpudgy said to twinkle that its hard to manage them  they dont behave remarked chubbins staring hard at the children  no they have a share of their fathers obstinate nature replied mrs puffpudgy excuse me a minute and ill cuff them itll do them good  but before their mother could reach them the children found trouble of their own teenty sprang at weenty and began to fight because his brother had pinched him and weenty fought back with all his might and main they scratched with their claws and bit with their teeth and rolled over and over upon the floor bumping into the wall and upsetting the chairs and snarling and growling all the while like two puppies  mrs puffpudgy sat down and watched them but did not interfere  wont they hurt themselves asked twinkle anxiously  perhaps so said the mother but if they do it will punish them for being so naughty i always let them fight it out because they are so sore for a day or two afterward that they have to keep quiet and then i get a little rest  weenty set up a great howling just then and teenty drew away from his defeated brother and looked at him closely the fur on both of them was badly mussed up and weenty had a long scratch on his nose that must have hurt him or he wouldnt have howled so teentys left eye was closed tight but if it hurt him he bore the pain in silence  mrs puffpudgy now pushed them both into a little room and shut them up saying they must stay there until bedtime and then she led twinkle and chubbins into the kitchen and showed them a pool of clear water in a big clay basin that had been caught during the last rain and saved for drinking purposes the children drank of it and found it cool and refreshing  then they saw the bedrooms and learned that the beds of prairiedogs were nothing more than round hollows made in heaps of clay these animals always curl themselves up when they sleep and the round hollows just fitted their bodies so no doubt they found them very comfortable  there were several bedrooms for the puffpudgy house was really very large it was also very cool and pleasant being all underground and not a bit damp  after they had admired everything in a way that made mrs puffpudgy very proud and happy their hostess took one of the lighted candles from a bracket and said she would now escort them to the house of the honorable mr bowko the mayor    chapter vii the mayor gives a luncheon  dont we have to go upstairs and out of doors asked twinkle  oh no replied the prairiedog we have halls connecting all the different houses of importance just follow me and you cant get lost  they might easily have been lost without their guide the little girl thought after they had gone through several winding passages they turned this way and that in quite a bewildering manner and there were so many underground tunnels going in every direction that it was a wonder mrs puffpudgy knew which way to go  you ought to have signposts said chubbins who had once been in a city  why as for that every one in the town knows which way to go answered their guide and it isnt often we have visitors last week a gray owl stopped with us for a couple of days and we had a fine ball in her honor but you are the first humans that have ever been entertained in our town so its quite an event with us a few minutes later she said here we are at the mayors house and as they passed under a broad archway she blew out her candle because the mayors house was so brilliantly lighted  welcome said mr bowko greeting the children with polite bows you are just in time for luncheon is about ready and my guests are waiting for you  he led them at once into a big diningroom that was so magnificently painted with colored clays that the walls were as bright as a june rainbow  how pretty cried twinkle clapping her hands together in delight  im glad you like it said the mayor much pleased some people who are lacking in good taste think its a little overdone but a mayors house should be gorgeous i think so as to be a credit to the community my grandfather who designed and painted this house was a very fine artist but luncheon is ready so pray be seated  they sat down on little clay chairs that were placed at the round table the mayor sat on one side of twinkle and mrs puffpudgy on the other and chubbins was between the skinny old magician and mr sneezeley also in other chairs sat dr dosem and mrs chatterby and mrs fuzcum and several others it was a large company indeed which showed that the mayor considered this a very important occasion  they were waited upon by several sleek prairiedog maids in white aprons and white caps who looked neat and respectable and were very graceful in their motions  neither twinkle nor chubbins was very hungry but they were curious to know what kind of food the prairiedogs ate so they watched carefully when the different dishes were passed around only grains and vegetables were used for prairiedogs do not eat meat there was a milkweed soup at first and then yellow corn boiled and sliced thin afterward they had a salad of thistle leaves and some bread made of barley the dessert was a dish of the sweet dark honey made by prairiebees and some cakes flavored with sweet and spicy roots that only prairiedogs know how to find  the children tasted of several dishes just to show their politeness but they couldnt eat much chubbins spent most of his time watching mr presto digi who ate up everything that was near him and seemed to be as hungry after the luncheon as he had been before  mrs puffpudgy talked so much about the social standing and dignity of the puffpudgys that she couldnt find time to eat much although she asked for the recipe of the milkweed soup but most of the others present paid strict attention to the meal and ate with very good appetites    chapter viii on top of the earth again  afterward they all went into the big drawingroom where mrs fuzcum sang a song for them in a very shrill voice and mr sneezeley and mrs chatterby danced a graceful minuet that was much admired by all present  we ought to be going home said twinkle after this entertainment was over im afraid our folks will worry about us  we regret to part with you replied the mayor but if you really think you ought to go we will not be so impolite as to urge you to stay  youll find we have excellent manners added mrs puffpudgy  i want to get big again said chubbins  very well please step this way said the mayor  so they all followed him through a long passage until they began to go upward as if climbing a hill and then a gleam of daylight showed just ahead of them and a few more steps brought them to the hole in the middle of the mound  the mayor and mrs puffpudgy jumped up first and then they helped twinkle and chubbins to scramble out the strong sunlight made them blink their eyes for a time but when they were able to look around they found one or more heads of prairiedogs sticking from every mound  now mr presto digi said the mayor when all the party were standing on the ground please enlarge our friends to their natural sizes again  that is very easy said the magician with a sigh i really wish mr mayor that you would find something for me to do that is difficult  i will some time promised the mayor just now this is all i can require of you  so the magician waved his paw and gurgled much in the same way he had done before and twinkle and chubbins began to grow and swell out until they were as large as ever and the prairiedogs again seemed very small beside them  goodbye said the little girl and thank you all very much for your kindness to us  goodbye answered a chorus of small voices and then all the prairiedogs popped into their holes and quickly disappeared  twinkle and chubbins found they were sitting on the green bank again at the edge of prairiedog town  do you think weve been asleep chub asked the girl  course not replied chubbins with a big yawn its easy nough to know that twink cause im sleepy now   the end    prince mudturtle    prince mudturtle   list of chapters

captures the turtle  one hot summer day twinkle went down into the meadow to where the brook ran tinkling over its stones or rushed and whirled around the curves of the banks or floated lazily through the more wide and shallow parts it wasnt much of a brook to tell the facts for there were many places where an active child could leap across it but it was the only brook for miles around and to twinkle it was a neverending source of delight nothing amused or refreshed the little girl more than to go wading on the pebbly bottom and let the little waves wash around her slim ankles  there was one place just below the pasture lot where it was deeper and here there were real fishes swimming about such as horned aces and chubs and shiners and once in a while you could catch a mudturtle under the edges of the flat stones or in hollows beneath the banks the deep part was not very big being merely a pool but twinkle never waded in it because the water would come quite up to her waist and then she would be sure to get her skirts wet which would mean a good scolding from mamma  today she climbed the fence in the lane just where the rickety wooden bridge crossed the brook and at once sat down upon the grassy bank and took off her shoes and stockings then wearing her sunbonnet to shield her face from the sun she stepped softly into the brook and stood watching the cool water rush by her legs  it was very nice and pleasant but twinkle never could stand still for very long so she began to wade slowly down the stream keeping in the middle of the brook and being able to see through the clear water all the best places to put her feet  pretty soon she had to duck her head to pass under the fence that separated the meadow from the pasture lot but she got through all right and then kept on down the stream until she came close to the deep pool she couldnt wade through this as i have explained so she got on dry land and crept on her hands and knees up to the edge of the bank so as not to scare the fishes if any were swimming in the pool  by good luck there were several fishes in the pool today and they didnt seem to notice that twinkle was looking at them so quiet had she been one little fellow shone like silver when the sunshine caught his glossy sides and the little girl watched him wiggling here and there with much delight there was also a big mudcolored fish that lay a long time upon the bottom without moving anything except his fins and the tip of his tail and twinkle also discovered a group of several small fishes not over an inch long that always swam together in a bunch as if they belonged to one family  the girl watched these little creatures long and earnestly the pool was all of the world these simple fishes would ever know they were born here and would die here without ever getting away from the place or even knowing there was a much bigger world outside of it  after a time the child noticed that the water had become a little muddy near the edge of the bank where she lay and as it slowly grew clear again she saw a beautiful turtle lying just under her head and against the side of the bank it was a little bigger around than a silver dollar and instead of its shell being of a dull brown color like that of all other mudturtles she had seen this ones back was streaked with brilliant patches of yellow and red  i must get that lovely turtle thought twinkle and as the water was shallow where it lay she suddenly plunged in her hand grabbed the turtle and flung it out of the water on to the bank where it fell upon its back wiggling its four fat legs desperately in an attempt to turn over    chapter ii twinkle discovers the turtle can talk  at this sudden commotion in their water the fishes darted away and disappeared in a flash but twinkle didnt mind that for all her interest was now centered in the struggling turtle  she knelt upon the grass and bent over to watch it and just then she thought she heard a small voice say  its no use i cant do it and then the turtle drew its head and legs between the shells and remained still  good gracious said twinkle much astonished then addressing the turtle she asked  did you say anything a minute ago  there was no reply the turtle lay as quiet as if it were dead twinkle thought she must have been mistaken so she picked up the turtle and held it in the palm of her hand while she got into the water again and waded slowly back to where she had left her shoes and stockings  when she got home she put the mudturtle in a tub which her papa had made by sawing a barrel in two then she put a little water into the tub and blocked it up by putting a brick under one side so that the turtle could either stay in the water or crawl up the inclined bottom of the tub to where it was dry whichever he pleased she did this because mamma said that turtles sometimes liked to stay in the water and sometimes on land and twinkles turtle could now take his choice he couldnt climb up the steep sides of the tub and so get away and the little girl thoughtfully placed crumbs of bread and fine bits of meat where the turtle could get them whenever he felt hungry  after that twinkle often sat for hours watching the turtle which would crawl around the bottom of the tub and swim in the little pool of water and eat the food placed before him in an eager and amusing way  at times she took him in her hand and examined him closely and then the mudturtle would put out its little head and look at her with its bright eyes as curiously as the girl looked at him  she had owned her turtle just a week when she came to the tub one afternoon and held him in her hand intending to feed her pet some scraps of meat she had brought with her but as soon as the turtle put out its head it said to her in a small but distinct voice  good morning twinkle  she was so surprised that the meat dropped from her hand and she nearly dropped the turtle too but she managed to control her astonishment and asked in a voice that trembled a little  can you talk  to be sure replied the turtle but only on every seventh daywhich of course is every saturday on other days i cannot talk at all  then i really must have heard you speak when i caught you didnt i  i believe you did i was so startled at being captured that i spoke before i thought which is a bad habit to get into but afterward i resolved not to answer when you questioned me for i didnt know you then and feared it would be unwise to trust you with my secret even now i must ask you not to tell any one that you have a turtle that knows how to talk    chapter iii the turtle tells of the corrugated giant  why its wonderful said twinkle who had listened eagerly to the turtles speech  it would be wonderful indeed if i were but a simple turtle was the reply  but arent you a turtle  of course so far as my outward appearance goes im a common little mudturtle it answered and i think you will agree with me that it was rather clever in the corrugated giant to transform me into such a creature  whats a corrulated giant asked twinkle with breathless interest  the corrugated giant is a monster that is full of deep wrinkles because he has no bones inside him to hold his flesh up properly said the turtle i hated this giant who is both wicked and cruel i assure you and this giant hated me in return so when one day i tried to destroy him the monster transformed me into the helpless little being you see before you  but who were you before you were transformed asked the girl  a fairy prince named melga the seventh son of the fairy queen flutterlight who rules all the fairies in the north part of this land  and how long have you been a turtle  fourteen years replied the creature with a deep sigh at least i think it is fourteen years but of course when one is swimming around in brooks and grubbing in the mud for food one is apt to lose all track of time  i should think so indeed said twinkle but according to that youre older than i am  much older declared the turtle i had lived about four hundred years before the corrugated giant turned me into a turtle  was your head gray she asked and did you have white whiskers  no indeed said the turtle fairies are always young and beautiful in appearance no matter how many years they have lived and as they never die theyre bound to get pretty old sometimes as a matter of course  of course agreed twinkle mama has told me about the fairies but must you always be a mudturtle  that will depend on whether you are willing to help me or not was the answer  why it sounds just like a fairy tale in a book cried the little girl  yes replied the turtle these things have been happening ever since there were fairies and you might expect some of our adventures would get into books but are you willing to help me that is the important thing just now  ill do anything i can said twinkle  then said the turtle i may expect to get back to my own form again in a reasonably short time but you must be brave and not shrink from such a little thing as danger  that made twinkle look solemn  of course i dont want to get hurt she said my mama and papa would go distructed if anything happened to me  something will happen sure declared the turtle but nothing that happens will hurt you in the least if you do exactly as i tell you  i wont have to fight that carbolated giant will i twinkle asked doubtfully  he isnt carbolated hes corrugated no you wont have to fight at all when the proper time comes ill do the fighting myself but you may have to come with me to the black mountains in order to set me free  is it far she asked  yes but it wont take us long to go there answered the turtle now ill tell you what to do and if you follow my advice no one will ever know youve been mixed up with fairies and strange adventures  and collerated giants she added  corrugated he corrected it is too late this saturday to start upon our journey so we must wait another week but next saturday morning do you come to me bright and early as soon as youve had breakfast and then ill tell you what to do  all right said twinkle i wont forget  in the mean time do give me a little clean water now and then im a mudturtle sure enough but im also a fairy prince and i must say i prefer clean water  ill attend to it promised the girl  now put me down and run away continued the turtle it will take me all the week to think over my plans and decide exactly what we are to do    chapter iv prince turtle remembers his magic  twinkle was as nervous as she could be during all the week that followed this strange conversation with prince turtle every day as soon as school was out she would run to the tub to see if the turtle was still safefor she worried lest it should run away or disappear in some strange manner and during school hours it was such hard work to keep her mind on her lessons that teacher scolded her more than once  the fairy imprisoned in the turtles form had nothing to say to her during this week because he would not be allowed to talk again until saturday so the most that twinkle could do to show her interest in the prince was to give him the choicest food she could get and supply him with plenty of fresh clean water  at last the day of her adventure arrived and as soon as she could get away from the breakfast table twinkle ran out to the tub there was her fairy turtle safe as could be and as she leaned over the tub he put out his head and called good morning in his small shrill voice  good morning she replied  are you still willing and ready to assist me asked the turtle  to be sure said twinkle  then take me in your hand said he  so she picked him out of the tub and placed him upon her hand and the turtle said  now pay strict attention and do exactly as i tell you and all will be well in the first place we want to get to the black mountains so you must repeat after me these words uller aller iller oller  uller aller iller oller said twinkle  the next minute it seemed as though a gale of wind had struck her it blew so strongly against her eyes that she could not see so she covered her face with one arm while with the other hand she held fast to the turtle her skirts fluttered so wildly that it seemed as if they would tear themselves from her body and her sunbonnet not being properly fastened was gone in a minute  but it didnt last long fortunately after a few moments the wind stopped and she found she could breathe again then she looked around her and drew another long breath for instead of being in the back yard at home she stood on the side of a beautiful mountain and spread before her were the loveliest green valleys she had ever beheld  well were here said the turtle in a voice that sounded as if he were well pleased i thought i hadnt forgotten my fairy wisdom  where are we asked the child  in the black mountains of course was the reply weve come a good way but it didnt take us long to arrive did it  no indeed she answered still gazing down the mountain side at the flowerstrewn grassland of the valleys  this said the turtle sticking his little head out of the shell as far as it would go is the realm of the fairies where i used to dwell those beautiful palaces you see yonder are inhabited by queen flutterlight and my people and that grim castle at your left standing on the side of the mountain is where the corrugated giant lives  i dont see anything exclaimed twinkle that is nothing but the valleys and the flowers and grass  true i had forgotten that these things are invisible to your mortal eyes but it is necessary that you should see all clearly if you are going to rescue me from this terrible form and restore me to my natural shape now put me down upon the ground for i must search for a particular plant whose leaf has a magic virtue  so twinkle put him down and the little turtle began running around here and there looking carefully at the different plants that grew amongst the grass on the mountain side but his legs were so short and his shellcovered body so heavy that he couldnt move very fast so presently he called for her to pick him up again and hold him close to the ground while she walked among the plants she did this and after what seemed a long search the turtle suddenly cried out  stop here it is this is the plant i want  whichthis asked the girl touching a broad green leaf  yes pluck the leaf from the stem and rub your eyelids with it  she obeyed and having rubbed her lids well with the leaf she again opened her eyes and beheld the real fairyland    chapter v twinkle promises to be brave  in the center of the valley was a great cluster of palaces that appeared to be built of crystal and silver and motherofpearl and golden filigreework so dainty and beautiful were these fairy dwellings that twinkle had no doubt for an instant but that she gazed upon fairyland she could almost see from the far mountain upon which she stood the airy gauzewinged forms of the fairies themselves floating gently amidst their pretty palaces and moving gracefully along the jeweled streets  but another sight now attracted her attentiona big gray ugly looking castle standing frowning on the mountain side at her left it overlooked the lovely city of palaces like a dark cloud on the edge of a blue sky and the girl could not help giving a shudder as she saw it all around the castle was a high fence of iron spikes  that fence is enchanted said the turtle as if he knew she was looking at it and no fairy can pass it because the power to prevent it has been given to the giant but a mortal has never been forbidden to pass the fence for no one ever supposed that a mortal would come here or be able to see it that is the reason i have brought you to this place and the reason why you alone are able to help me  gracious cried twinkle must i meet the carbonated giant  hes corrugated said the turtle  i know hes something dreadful she wailed because hes so hard to pronounce  you will surely have to meet him declared the turtle but do not fear i will protect you from all harm  well a corralated giants a mighty big person said the girl doubtfully and a mudturtle isnt much of a fighter i guess ill go home  that is impossible declared the turtle you are too far from home ever to get back without my help so you may as well be good and obedient  what must i do she asked  we will wait until it is nearly noon when the giant will put his pot on the fire to boil his dinner we can tell the right time by watching the smoke come out of his chimney then you must march straight up to the castle and into the kitchen where the giant is at work and throw me quickly into the boiling kettle that is all that you will be required to do  i never could do it declared twinkle  why not  youd be scalded to death and then id be a murderer  nonsense said the turtle peevishly i know what im doing and if you obey me ill not be scalded but an instant for then ill resume my own form remember that im a fairy and fairies cant be killed so easily as you seem to think  wont it hurt you she inquired  only for a moment but the reward will be so great that i wont mind an instants pain will you do this favor for me  ill try replied twinkle gravely  then i will be very grateful said prince turtle and agree to afterward send you home safe and sound and as quickly as you came    chapter vi twinkle meets the corrugated giant  and now while we are waiting continued the fairy turtle i want to find a certain flower that has wonderful powers to protect mortals from any injury not that i fear i shall be unable to take care of you but its just as well to be on the safe side  better said twinkle earnestly wheres the flower  well hunt for it replied the turtle  so holding him in her hand in such a way that he could see all the flowers that grew the girl began wandering over the mountain side and everything was so beautiful around her that she would have been quite contented and happy had not the gray castle been before her to remind her constantly that she must face the terrible giant who lived within it  they found the flower at lasta pretty pink blossom that looked like a double daisy but must have been something else because a daisy has no magic power that i ever heard of and when it was found the turtle told her to pick the flower and pin it fast to the front of her dress which she did  by that time the smoke began to roll out of the giants chimney in big black clouds so the fairy turtle said the giant must be getting dinner and the pot would surely be boiling by the time they got to the castle  twinkle couldnt help being a little afraid to approach the giants stronghold but she tried to be brave and so stepped along briskly until she came to the fence of iron spikes  you must squeeze through between two of the spikes said the turtle  she didnt think it could possibly be done but to her surprise it was quite easy and she managed to squeeze through the fence without even tearing her dress then she walked up a great driveway which was lined with white skulls of many sheep which the giant had eaten to the front door of the castle which stood ajar  go in said the turtle so she boldly entered and passed down a high arched hall toward a room in the rear  this is the kitchen said the turtle enter quickly go straight to the kettle and throw me into the boiling water  twinkle entered quickly enough but then she stopped short with a cry of amazement for there before her stood the ugly giant blowing the fire with an immense pair of bellows    chapter vii prince mudturtle becomes prince melga  the giant was as big around as ten men and as tall as two but having no bones he seemed pushed together so that his skin wrinkled up like the sides of an accordeon or a photograph camera even his face being so wrinkled that his nose stuck out between two folds of flesh and his eyes from between two more in one end of the kitchen was the great fireplace above which hung an iron kettle with a big iron spoon in it and at the other end was a table set for dinner  as the giant was standing between the kettle and twinkle she could not do as the turtle had commanded and throw him into the pot so she hesitated wondering how to obey the fairy just then the giant happened to turn around and see her  by the whiskers of gammarogwho was one of my ancestors that was killed by jack the giantkiller he cried but in a very mild voice for so big a person whom have we here  im twinkle said the girl drawing a long breath  then to pay you for your folly in entering my castle i will make you my slave and some day if youre not good ill feed you to my seventeenheaded dog i never eat little girls myself i prefer mutton  twinkles heart almost stopped beating when she heard these awful words all she could do was to stand still and look imploringly at the giant but she held the fairy mudturtle clasped tight in her hand so that the monster couldnt see it  well what are you staring at shouted the corrugated giant angrily blow up that fire this instant slave  he stood aside for her to pass and twinkle ran at once to the fireplace the pot was now before her and within easy reach and it was bubbling hot  in an instant she reached out her hand and tossed the turtle into the boiling water and then with a cry of horror at her own action she drew back to see what would happen  the turtle was a fairy all right and he had known very well the best way to break the enchantment his enemy had put upon him for no sooner had twinkle tossed him into the boiling pot than a great hissing was heard and a cloud of steam hid for an instant the fireplace then as it cleared away a handsome young prince stepped forward fully armed for the turtle was again a fairy and the kettle had changed into a strong shield which he bore upon his left arm and the iron spoon was now a long and glittering sword    chapter viii twinkle receives a medal  the giant gave a roar like that of a baby bull when he saw prince melga standing before him and in a twinkling he had caught up a big club that stood near and began whirling it over his head but before it could descend the prince ran at him and stuck his sword as far as it would go into the corrugated body of the giant again the monster roared and tried to fight but the sword had hurt him badly and the prince pushed it into the evil creature again and again until the end came and his corrugated enemy rolled over upon the floor quite dead  then the fairy turned to twinkle and kneeling before her he kissed her hand  thank you very much he said in a sweet voice for setting me free you are a very brave little girl  im not so sure about that she answered i was dreadfully scared  now he took her hand and led her from the castle and she didnt have to squeeze through the fence again because the fairy had only to utter a magic word and the gate flew open and when they turned to look back the castle of the corrugated giant with all that it had contained had vanished from sight never to be seen again by either mortal or fairy eyes for that was sure to happen whenever the giant was dead  the prince led twinkle into the valley where the fairy palaces stood and told all his people when they crowded around to welcome him how kind the little girl had been to him and how her courage had enabled him to defeat the giant and to regain his proper form and all the fairies praised twinkle with kind words and the lovely queen flutterlight who seemed altogether too young to be the mother of the handsome prince gave to the child a golden medal with a tiny mudturtle engraved upon one side of it  then after a fine feast had been prepared and the little girl had eaten all she could of the fairy sweetmeats she told prince melga she would like to go home again  very well said he dont forget me twinkle although we probably shall never meet again ill send you home quite as safely as you came but as your eyes have been rubbed with the magic maitaleaf you will doubtless always see many strange sights that are hidden from other mortals  i dont mind said twinkle  then she bade goodbye to the fairies and the prince spoke a magic word there was another rush of wind and when it had passed twinkle found herself once more in the back yard at home  as she sat upon the grass rubbing her eyes and wondering at the strange adventure that had befallen her mamma came out upon the back porch and said  your turtle has crawled out of the tub and run away  yes said twinkle i know and im glad of it  but she kept her secret to herself   the end    twinkles enchantment    twinkles enchantment    list of chapters                             page i     twinkle enters the big gulch261 ii    the rolling stone269 iii   some queer acquaintances277 iv    the dancing bear288 v     the cave of the waterfall298 vi    prince nimble306 vii   the grasshoppers hop312    chapter i twinkle enters the big gulch  one afternoon twinkle decided to go into the big gulch and pick some blueberries for papas supper she had on her blue gingham dress and her blue sunbonnet and there were stout shoes upon her feet so she took her tin pail and started out  be back in time for supper called mamma from the kitchen porch  course said twinkle as she trotted away im not hungry now but ill be hungry nough when suppertime comes course ill be back  the side of the gulch was but a little way from the house it was like a big ditch only the sides were not too steep to crawl down and in the middle of the gulch were rolling hills and deep gullies all covered with wild bushes and vines and a few flowering plantsvery rare in this part of the country  twinkle hadnt lived very long in this section of dakota for her father had just bought the new farm that lay beside the gulch so the big ditch was a great delight to her and she loved to wander through it and pick the berries and flowers that never grew on the plains above  today she crept carefully down the path back of the house and soon reached the bottom of the gulch then she began to search for the berries but all were gone in the places where she had picked them before so she found she must go further along  she sat down to rest for a time and by and by she happened to look up at the other side and saw a big cluster of bushes hanging full of ripe blueberriesjust about half way up the opposite bank  she had never gone so far before but if she wanted the berries for papas supper she knew she must climb up the slope and get them so she rose to her feet and began to walk in that direction it was all new to the little girl and seemed to her like a beautiful fairyland but she had no idea that the gulch was enchanted soon a beetle crawled across her path and as she stopped to let it go by she heard it say  look out for the line of enchantment youll soon cross it if you dont watch out  what line of enchantment asked twinkle  its almost under your nose replied the little creature  i dont see anything at all she said after looking closely  of course you dont said the beetle it isnt a mark you know that any one can see with their eyes but its a line of enchantment just the same and whoever steps over it is sure to see strange things and have strange adventures  i dont mind that said twinkle  well i dont mind if you dont returned the beetle and by that time he had crept across the path and disappeared underneath a big rock  twinkle went on without being at all afraid if the beetle spoke truly and there really was an invisible line that divided the common real world from an enchanted country she was very eager to cross it as any little girl might well be and then it occurred to her that she must have crossed the enchanted line before she met the beetle for otherwise she wouldnt have understood his language or known what he was talking about children dont talk with beetles in the real world as twinkle knew very well and she was walking along soberly thinking this over when suddenly a voice cried out to her  be careful    chapter ii the rolling stone  of course twinkle stopped then and looked around to see who had spoken but no one was anywhere in sight so she started on again  look out or youll step on me cried the voice a second time  she looked at her feet very carefully there was nothing near them but a big round stone that was about the size of her head and a prickly thistle that she never would step on if she could possibly help it  whos talking she asked  why im talking answered the voice who do you suppose it is  i dont know said twinkle i just cant see anybody at all  then you must be blind said the voice im the rolling stone and im about two inches from your left toes  the rolling stone  thats it thats me im the rolling stone that gathers no moss  you cant be said twinkle sitting down in the path and looking carefully at the stone  why not  because you dont roll she said youre a stone of course i can see that all right but youre not rolling  how silly replied the stone i dont have to roll every minute to be a rolling stone do i  of course you do answered twinkle if you dont roll youre just a common still stone  well i declare exclaimed the stone you dont seem to understand anything youre a talking girl are you not  to be sure i am said twinkle  but you dont talk every minute do you  mama says i do she answered  but you dont youre sometimes quiet arent you  course i am  thats the way with me sometimes i roll and so im called the rolling stone sometimes you talk and so youre the talking girl  no im twinkle she said  that doesnt sound like a name remarked the stone  its what papa calls me anyway explained the girl then thinking she had lingered long enough she added  im going up the hill to pick those berries since you can roll suppose you go with me  what up hill exclaimed the stone  why not asked twinkle  who ever heard of a stone rolling up hill its unnatural  any stone can roll down hill said the child if you cant roll up hill youre no better than a common cobblestone  oh i can roll up hill if i have to declared the stone peevishly but its hard work and nearly breaks my back  i cant see that you have any back said twinkle  why im all back replied the stone when your back aches its only a part of you but when my back aches its all of me except the middle  the middle ache is the worst of all said twinkle solemnly well if you dont want to go she added jumping up ill say goodbye  anything to be sociable said the stone sighing deeply ill go along and keep you company but its lots easier to roll down than it is to roll up i assure you  why youre a reglar grumbler exclaimed twinkle  thats because i lead a hard life returned the stone dismally but dont let us quarrel it is so seldom i get a chance to talk with one of my own standing in society  you cant have any standing without feet declared twinkle shaking her head at the stone  one can have understanding at least was the answer and understanding is the best standing any person can have  perhaps that is true said the child thoughtfully but im glad i have legs just the same    chapter iii some queer acquaintances  wait a minute implored a small voice and the girl noticed a yellow butterfly that had just settled down upon the stone arent you the child from the farm  to be sure she answered much amused to hear the butterfly speak  then can you tell me if your mother expects to churn today said the pretty creature slowly folding and unfolding its dainty wings  why do you want to know  if she churns today ill fly over to the house and try to steal some butter but if your mother isnt going to churn ill fly down into the gulch and rob a bees nest i know of  why do you rob and steal inquired twinkle  its the only way i can get my living said the butterfly nobody ever gives me anything and so i have to take what i want  do you like butter  of course i do thats why we are called butterflies you know i prefer butter to anything else and i have heard that in some countries the children always leave a little dish of butter on the windowsill so that we may help ourselves whenever we are hungry i wish i had been born in such a country  mother wont churn until saturday said twinkle i know cause ive got to help her and i just hate buttermaking  then i wont go to the farm today replied the butterfly goodbye little girl if you think of it leave a dish of butter around where i can get at it  all right said twinkle and the butterfly waved its wings and fluttered through the air into the gulch below  then the girl started up the hill and the stone rolled slowly beside her groaning and grumbling because the ground was so rough  presently she noticed running across the path a tiny book not much bigger than a postagestamp it had two slender legs like those of a bumblebee and upon these it ran so fast that all the leaves fluttered wildly the covers being half open  whats that asked twinkle looking after the book in surprise  that is a little learning answered the stone look out for it for they say its a dangerous thing  its gone already said twinkle  let it go nobody wants it that i know of just help me over this bump will you  so she rolled the stone over the little hillock and just as she did so her attention was attracted by a curious noise that sounded like pop pop pop  whats that she inquired hesitating to advance  only a weasel answered the stone stand still a minute and youll see him whenever he thinks hes alone and theres no one to hear pop goes the weasel  sure enough a little animal soon crossed their path making the funny noise at every step but as soon as he saw that twinkle was staring at him he stopped popping and rushed into a bunch of tall grass and hid himself  and now they were almost at the berrybushes and twinkle trotted so fast that the rolling stone had hard work to keep up with her but when she got to the bushes she found a flock of strange birds sitting upon them and eating up the berries as fast as they could the birds were not much bigger than robins and were covered with a soft velvety skin instead of with feathers and they had merry black eyes and long slender beaks curving downward from their noses which gave to their faces a saucy expression the lack of usual feathers might not have surprised twinkle so much had she not noticed upon the tail of each bird one single solitary feather of great length which was certainly a remarkable thing  i know what they are she said nodding her head wisely theyre birds of a feather  at this the birds burst into a chorus of laughter and one of them said  perhaps you think thats why we flock together  well isnt that the reason she asked  not a bit of it declared the bird the reason we flock together is because were too proud to mix with common birds who have feathers all over them  i should think youd be ashamed cause youre so naked she returned  the fact is twinkle said another bird as he pecked at a blueberry and swallowed it the common things in this world dont amount to much there are millions of birds on earth but only a few of us that have but one feather in my opinion if you had but one hair upon your head youd be much prettier  id be more strordnary im sure said twinkle using the biggest word she could think of  theres no accounting for tastes remarked the rolling stone which had just arrived at twinkles side after a hard roll up the path for my part i havent either hair or feathers and im glad of it  the birds laughed again at this and as they had eaten all the berries they cared for they now flew into the air and disappeared    chapter iv the dancing bear  really said twinkle as she began picking the berries and putting them into her pail i didnt know so many things could talk  its because you are in the part of the gulch thats enchanted answered the rolling stone when you get home again youll think this is all a dream  i wonder if it isnt she suddenly cried stopping to look around and then feeling of herself carefully its usually the way in all the fairy stories that papa reads to me i dont remember going to sleep any time but perhaps i did after all  dont let it worry you said the stone making a queer noise that twinkle thought was meant for a laugh if you wake up youll be sorry you didnt dream longer and if you find you havent been asleep this will be a wonderful adventure  thats true enough the girl answered and again began filling her pail with the berries when i tell mama all this she wont believe a word of it and papa will laugh and pinch my cheek and say im like alice in wonderland or dorothy in the land of oz  just then she noticed something big and black coming around the bushes from the other side and her heart beat a good deal faster when she saw before her a great bear standing upon his rear legs beside her  he had a little red cap on his head that was kept in place by a band of rubber elastic his eyes were small but round and sparkling and there seemed to be a smile upon his face for his white teeth showed in two long rows  dont be afraid called out the rolling stone its only the dancing bear  why should the child be afraid asked the bear speaking in a low soft tone that reminded her of the purring of a kitten no one ever heard of a dancing bear hurting anybody were about the most harmless things in the world  are you really a dancing bear asked twinkle curiously  i am my dear he replied bowing low and then folding his arms proudly as he leaned against a big rock that was near i wish there was some one here who could tell you what a fine dancer i am it wouldnt be modest for me to praise myself you know  i spose not said twinkle but if youre a dancing bear why dont you dance  there it is again cried the rolling stone this girl twinkle wants to keep everybody moving she wouldnt believe at first that i was a rolling stone because i was lying quiet just then and now she wont believe youre a dancing bear because you dont eternally keep dancing  well theres some sense in that after all declared the bear im only a dancing bear while im dancing to speak the exact truth and youre only a rolling stone while youre rolling  i beg to disagree with you returned the stone in a cold voice  well dont let us quarrel on any account said the bear i invite you both to come to my cave and see me dance then twinkle will be sure im a dancing bear  i havent filled my pail yet said the little girl and ive got to get enough berries for papas supper  ill help you replied the bear politely and at once he began to pick berries and to put them into twinkles pail his big paws looked very clumsy and awkward but it was astonishing how many blueberries the bear could pick with them twinkle had hard work to keep up with him and almost before she realized how fast they had worked the little pail was full and overflowing with fine plump berries  and now said the bear i will show you the way to my cave  he took her hand in his soft paw and began leading her along the side of the steep hill while the stone rolled busily along just behind them but they had not gone far before twinkles foot slipped and in trying to save herself from falling she pushed hard against the stone and tumbled it from the pathway  now youve done it growled the stone excitedly as it whirled around here i go for ive lost my balance and i cant help myself  even as he spoke the big round stone was flying down the side of the gulch bumping against the hillocks and bits of rocksometimes leaping into the air and then clinging close to the ground but going faster and faster every minute  dear me said twinkle looking after it im afraid the rolling stone will get hurt  no danger of that replied the bear its as hard as a rock and not a thing in the gulch could hurt it a bit but our friend would have to roll a long time to get back here again so we wont wait come along my dear  he held out his paw again and twinkle took it with one of her hands while she carried the pail with the other and so managed to get over the rough ground very easily    chapter v the cave of the waterfall  before long they came to the entrance to the cave and as it looked dark and gloomy from without twinkle drew back and said she guessed she wouldnt go in  but its quite light inside said the bear and theres a pretty waterfall there too dont be afraid twinkle ill take good care of you  so the girl plucked up courage and permitted him to lead her into the cave and then she was glad she had come instead of being a fraidcat for the place was big and roomy and there were many cracks in the roof that admitted plenty of light and air around the side walls were several pairs of big ears which seemed to have been carved out of the rock these astonished the little girl  what are the ears for she asked  dont walls have ears where you live returned the bear as if surprised  ive heard they do she answered but ive never seen any before  at the back of the cave was a little tinkling waterfall that splashed into a pool beneath with a sound that was very like music near this was a square slab of rock a little raised above the level of the floor  kindly take a seat my dear said the bear and ill try to amuse you and at the same time prove that i can dance  so to the music of the waterfall the bear began dancing he climbed upon the flat stone made a graceful bow to twinkle and then balanced himself first upon one foot and then upon the other and swung slowly around in a circle and then back again  how do you like it he asked  i dont care much for it said twinkle i believe i could do better myself  but you are not a bear he answered girls ought to dance better than bears you know but not every bear can dance if i had a handorgan to make the music instead of this waterfall i might do better  then i wish you had one said the girl  the bear began dancing again and this time he moved more rapidly and shuffled his feet in quite a funny manner he almost fell off the slab once or twice so anxious was he to prove he could dance and once he tripped over his own foot which made twinkle laugh  just as he was finishing his dance a strange voice cried out  for bear and a green monkey sprang into the cave and threw a big rock at the performer it knocked the bear off the slab and he fell into the pool of water at the foot of the waterfall and was dripping wet when he scrambled out again  the dancing bear gave a big growl and ran as fast as he could after the monkey finally chasing him out of the cave twinkle picked up her pail of berries and followed and when she got into the sunshine again on the side of the hill she saw the monkey and the bear hugging each other tight and growling and chattering in a way that showed they were angry with each other and not on pleasant terms  you will throw rocks at me will you shouted the bear  i will if i get the chance replied the monkey wasnt that a fine straight shot and didnt you go plump into the water though and he shrieked with laughter  just then they fell over in a heap and began rolling down the hill  let go yelled the bear  let go yourself screamed the monkey  but neither of them did let go so they rolled faster and faster down the hill and the last that twinkle saw of them they were bounding among the bushes at the very bottom of the big gulch    chapter vi prince nimble  good gracious said the little girl looking around her im as good as lost in this strange place and i dont know in what direction to go to get home again  so she sat down on the grass and tried to think which way she had come and which way she ought to return in order to get across the gulch to the farmhouse  if the rolling stone was here he might tell me she said aloud but im all alone  oh no youre not piped a small sweet voice im here and i know much more than the rolling stone does  twinkle looked this way and then that very carefully in order to see who had spoken and at last she discovered a pretty grasshopper perched upon a long blade of grass nearby  did i hear you speak she inquired  yes replied the grasshopper im prince nimble the hoppiest hopper in hoptown  where is that asked the child  why hoptown is near the bottom of the gulch in that thick patch of grass you see yonder its on your way home so id be pleased to have you visit it  wont i step on some of you she asked  not if you are careful replied prince nimble grasshoppers dont often get stepped on were pretty active you know  all right said twinkle id like to see a grasshopper village  then follow me and ill guide you said nimble and at once he leaped from the blade of grass and landed at least six feet away  twinkle got up and followed keeping her eye on the pretty prince who leaped so fast that she had to trot to keep up with him nimble would wait on some clump of grass or bit of rock until the girl came up and then away hed go again  how far is it twinkle once asked him  about a mile and a half was the answer well soon be there for you are as good as a mile and im good for the halfmile  how do you figure that out asked twinkle  why ive always heard that a miss is as good as a mile and youre a miss are you not  not yet she answered im only a little girl but papa will be sure to miss me if i dont get home to supper    chapter vii the grasshoppers hop  twinkle now began to fear she wouldnt get home to supper for the sun started to sink into the big prairie and in the golden glow it left behind the girl beheld most beautiful palaces and castles suspended in the air just above the hollow in which she stood splendid banners floated from the peaks and spires of these magnificent buildings and all the windows seemed of silver and all the roofs of gold  what city is that she asked standing still in amazement  that isnt any city replied the grasshopper they are only castles in the airvery pretty to look at but out of everybodys reach come along my little friend were almost at hoptown  so twinkle walked on and before long prince nimble paused on the stem of a hollyhock and said  now sit down carefully right where you are and you will be able to watch my people it is the night of our regular hopif you listen you can hear the orchestra tuning up  she sat down as he bade her and tried to listen but only heard a low whirr and rattle like the noise of a beetles wings  thats the drummer said prince nimble he is very clever indeed  good gracious its night said twinkle with a start i ought to be at home and in bed this very minute  never mind said the grasshopper you can sleep any time but this is our annual ball and its a great privilege to witness it  suddenly the grass all around them became brilliantly lighted as if from a thousand tiny electric lamps twinkle looked closely and saw that a vast number of fireflies had formed a circle around them and were illuminating the scene of the ball  in the center of the circle were assembled hundreds of grasshoppers of all sizes the small ones were of a delicate green color and the middlesized ones of a deeper green while the biggest ones were a yellowish brown  but the members of the orchestra interested twinkle more than anything else they were seated upon the broad top of a big toadstool at one side and the musicians were all beetles and bigbugs a fat waterbeetle played a bass fiddle as big and fat as himself and two pretty ladybugs played the violins a scarab brightly colored with scarlet and black tooted upon a long horn and a sandbeetle made the sound of a drum with its wings then there was a coleopto making shrill sounds like a fluteonly of course twinkle didnt know the names of these beetles and thought they were all just bugs  when the orchestra began to play the music was more pleasing than you might suppose anyway the grasshoppers liked it for they commenced at once to dance  the antics of the grasshoppers made twinkle laugh more than once for the way they danced was to hop around in a circle and jump over each other and then a lady grasshopper and a gentleman grasshopper would take hold of hands and stand on their long rear legs and swing partners until it made the girl dizzy just to watch them  sometimes two of them would leap at once and knock against each other in the air and then go tumbling to the ground where the other dancers tripped over them she saw prince nimble dancing away with the others and his partner was a lovely green grasshopper with sparkling black eyes and wings that were like velvet they didnt bump into as many of the others as some did and twinkle thought they danced very gracefully indeed  and now while the merriment was at its height and waitergrasshoppers were passing around refreshments that looked like grass seeds covered with thick molasses a big cat suddenly jumped into the circle  at once all the lights went out for the fireflies fled in every direction but in the darkness twinkle thought she could still hear the drone of the big bass fiddle and the flutelike trill of the ladybugs  the next thing twinkle knew some one was shaking her shoulder      wake up dear said her mothers voice its nearly suppertime and papas waiting for you and i see you havent picked a single blueberry  why i picked em all right replied twinkle sitting up and first rubbing her eyes and then looking gravely at her empty tin pail they were all in the pail a few minutes ago i wonder whatever became of them   the end    sugarloaf mountain   sugarloaf mountain   list of chapters i        the golden key325 ii        through the tunnel333 iii        sugarloaf city340 iv        to the kings palace348 v        princess sakareen357 vi        the royal chariot365 vii        twinkle gets thirsty372 viii        after the runaway381    chapter i the golden key  twinkle had come to visit her old friend chubbins whose mother was now teaching school in a little town at the foot of the ozark mountains in arkansas twinkles own home was in dakota so the mountains that now towered around her made her open her eyes in wonder  near byso near in fact that she thought she might almost reach out her arm and touch itwas sugarloaf mountain round and high and big and a little to the south was backbone mountain and still farther along a peak called crystal mountain  the very next day after her arrival twinkle asked chubbins to take her to see the mountain and so the boy who was about her own age got his mother to fill for them a basket of good things to eat and away they started hand in hand to explore the mountainside  it was farther to sugarloaf mountain than twinkle had thought and by the time they reached the foot of the great mound the rocky sides of which were covered with bushes and small trees they were both rather tired by the walk  lets eat something suggested chubbins  im willing said twinkle  so they climbed up a little way to where some big rocks lay flat upon the mountain and sat themselves down upon a slab of rock while they rested and ate some of the sandwiches and cake  why do they call it sugarloaf asked the girl looking far up to the top of the mountain  i dont know replied chubbins  its a queer name said twinkle thoughtfully  thats so agreed the boy they might as well have called it gingerbread or rocksalt or teabiscuit they call mountains funny names dont they  seems as if they do said twinkle  they had been sitting upon the edge of one big flat rock with their feet resting against another that was almost as large these rocks appeared to have been there for agesas if some big giants in olden days had tossed them carelessly down and then gone away and left them yet as the children pushed their feet against this one the heavy mass suddenly began to tremble and then slide downward  look out cried the girl frightened to see the slab of rock move well fall and get hurt  but they clung to the rock upon which they sat and met with no harm whatever nor did the big slab of stone below them move very far from its original position  it merely slid downward a few feet and when they looked at the place where it had been they discovered what seemed to be a small iron door built into the solid stone underneath and now shown to their view by the moving of the upper rock  why its a door exclaimed twinkle  chubbins got down upon his knees and examined the door carefully there was a ring in it that seemed to be a handle and he caught hold of it and pulled as hard as he could but it wouldnt move  its locked twink he said  what do youspose is under it she asked  maybe its a treasure answered chubbins his eyes big with interest  well chub we cant get it anyway said the practical twinkle so lets climb the mountain  she got down from her seat and approached the door and as she did so she struck a small bit of rock with her foot and sent it tumbling down the hill then she stopped short with a cry of wonder for under the stone she had kicked away was a little hole in the rock and within this they saw a small golden key  perhaps she said eagerly as she stooped to pick up the key this will unlock the iron door  lets try it cried the boy    chapter ii through the tunnel  they examined the door carefully and at last found near the center of it a small hole twinkle put the golden key into this and found that it fitted exactly but it took all of chubbinss strength to turn the key in the rusty lock yet finally it did turn and they heard the noise of bolts shooting back so they both took hold of the ring and pulling hard together managed to raise the iron door on its hinges  all they saw was a dark tunnel with stone steps leading down into the mountain  no treasure here said the little girl  praps its farther in replied chubbins shall we go down  wont it be dangerous she asked  dont know said chubbins honestly its been years and years since this door was opened you can see for yourself that rock must have covered it up a long time  there must be something inside she declared or there wouldnt be any door or any steps  thats so answered chubbins ill go down and see you wait  no ill go too said twinkle id be just as scared waiting outside as i would be in and i in bigger than you are chub  youre taller but youre only a month older twink so dont you put on airs and im the strongest  well both go she decided and then if we find the treasure well divide  all right come on  forgetting their basket which they left upon the rocks they crept through the little doorway and down the steps there were only seven steps in all and then came a narrow but level tunnel that led straight into the mountainside it was dark a few feet from the door but the children resolved to go on taking hold of hands so as not to get separated and feeling the sides of the passage to guide them they walked a long way into the black tunnel  twinkle was just about to say theyd better go back when the passage suddenly turned and far ahead of them shone a faint light this encouraged them and they went on faster hoping they would soon come to the treasure  keep it up twink said the boy its no use going home yet  we must be almost in the middle of sugarloaf mountain she answered  oh no its an awful big mountain said he but weve come quite a way havent we  i guess mamad scold if she knew where we are  mamas said chubbins shouldnt know everything cause theyd only worry and if we dont get hurt i cant see as theres any harm done  but we mustnt be naughty chub  the only thing thats naughty he replied is doing what youre told not to do and no one told us not to go into the middle of sugarloaf mountain  just then they came to another curve in their path and saw a bright light ahead it looked to the children just like daylight so they ran along and soon passed through a low arch and came out into  well the scene before them was so strange that it nearly took away their breath and they stood perfectly still and stared as hard as their big eyes could possibly stare    chapter iii sugafloaf city  sugarloaf mountain was hollow inside for the children stood facing a great dome that rose so far above their heads that it seemed almost as high as the sky and underneath this dome lay spread out the loveliest city imaginable there were streets of houses and buildings with round domes and slender delicate spires reaching far up into the air and turrets beautifully ornamented with carvings and all these were white as the driven snow and sparkling in every part like millions of diamondsfor all were built of pure loafsugar the pavements of the streets were also loafsugar and the trees and bushes and flowers were likewise sugar but these last were not all white because all sugar is not white and they showed many bright colors of red sugar and blue sugar and yellow purple and green sugar all contrasting most prettily with the sparkling white buildings and the great white dome overhead  this alone might well astonish the eyes of children from the outside world but it was by no means all that twinkle and chubbins beheld in that first curious look at sugarloaf city for the city was inhabited by many peoplemen women and childrenwho walked along the streets just as briskly as we do only all were made of sugar there were several different kinds of these sugar people some who strutted proudly along were evidently of pure loafsugar and these were of a most respectable appearance others seemed to be made of a light brown sugar and were more humble in their manners and seemed to hurry along as if they had business to attend to then there were some of sugar so dark in color that twinkle suspected it was maplesugar and these folks seemed of less account than any of the others being servants drivers of carriages and beggars and idlers  carts and carriages moved along the streets and were mostly made of brown sugar the horses that drew them were either pressed sugar or maplesugar in fact everything that existed in this wonderful city was made of some kind of sugar  where the light which made all this place so bright and beautiful came from twinkle could not imagine there was no sun nor were there any electric lights that could be seen but it was fully as bright as day and everything showed with great plainness  while the children who stood just inside the archway through which they had entered were looking at the wonders of sugarloaf city a file of sugar soldiers suddenly came around a corner at a swift trot  halt cried the captain he wore a red sugar jacket and a red sugar cap and the soldiers were dressed in the same manner as their captain but without the officers yellow sugar shoulderstraps at the command the sugar soldiers came to a stop and all pointed their sugar muskets at twinkle and chubbins  surrender said the captain to them surrender or illill  he hesitated  what will you do said twinkle  i dont know what but something very dreadful replied the captain but of course youll surrender  i suppose well have to answered the girl  thats right ill just take you to the king and let him decide what to do he added pleasantly  so the soldiers surrounded the two children shouldered arms and marched away down the street twinkle and chubbins walking slowly so the candy folks would not have to run for the tallest soldiers were only as high as their shoulders  this is a great event remarked the captain as he walked beside them with as much dignity as he could muster it was really good of you to come and be arrested for i havent had any excitement in a long time the people here are such good sugar that they seldom do anything wrong    chapter iv to the kings palace  what allow me to ask is your grade of sugar inquired the captain with much politeness you do not seem to be the best loaf but i suppose that of course you are solid  solid what asked chubbins  solid sugar replied the captain  were not sugar at all explained twinkle were just meat  meat and what is that  havent you any meat in your city  no he replied shaking his head well i cant explain exactly what meat is she said but it isnt sugar anyway  at this the captain looked solemn  it isnt any of my business after all he told them the king must decide about you for thats his business but since you are not made of sugar you must excuse me if i decline to converse with you any longer it is beneath my dignity  oh thats all right said twinkle  where we came from said chubbins meat costs more a pound than sugar does so i guess were just as good as you are  but the captain made no reply to this statement and before long they stopped in front of a big sugar building while a crowd of sugar people quickly gathered  stand back cried the captain and the sugar soldiers formed a row between the children and the sugar citizens and kept the crowd from getting too near then the captain led twinkle and chubbins through a high sugar gateway and up a broad sugar walk to the entrance of the building  must be the kings castle said chubbins  the kings palace corrected the captain stiffly  whats the difference asked twinkle  but the sugar officer did not care to explain  brown sugar servants in plumcolored sugar coats stood at the entrance to the palace and their eyes stuck out like lozenges from their sugar faces when they saw the strangers the captain was escorting  but every one bowed low and stood aside for them to pass and they walked through beautiful halls and reception rooms where the sugar was cut into panels and scrolls and carved to represent all kinds of fruit and flowers  isnt it sweet said twinkle  sure it is answered chubbins  and now they were ushered into a magnificent room where a stout little sugar man was sitting near the window playing upon a fiddle while a group of sugar men and women stood before him in respectful attitudes and listened to the music  twinkle knew at once that the fiddler was the king because he had a sugar crown upon his head his majesty was made of very white and sparkling cut loafsugar and his clothing was formed of the same pure material the only color about him was the pink sugar in his cheeks and the brown sugar in his eyes his fiddle was also of white sugar and the strings were of spun sugar and had an excellent tone  when the king saw the strange children enter the room he jumped up and exclaimed  bless my beets what have we here  mortals most granular and solidified majesty answered the captain bowing so low that his forehead touched the floor they came in by the ancient tunnel  well i declare said the king i thought that tunnel had been stopped up for good and all  the stone above the door slipped said twinkle so we came down to see what we could find  you must never do it again said his majesty sternly this is our own kingdom a peaceful and retired nation of extra refined and substantial citizens and we dont wish to mix with mortals or any other folks  well go back pretty soon said twinkle  now thats very nice of you declared the king and i appreciate your kindness are you extra refined my dear  i hope so said the girl a little doubtfully  then theres no harm in our being friendly while youre here and as youve promised to go back to your own world soon i have no objection to showing you around the town youd like to see how we live wouldnt you  very much said twinkle  order my chariot captain brittle said his majesty and the captain again made one of his lowly bows and strutted from the room to execute the command  the king now introduced chubbins and twinkle to the sugar ladies and gentlemen who were present and all of them treated the children very respectfully    chapter v princess sakareen  say play us a tune said chubbins to the king his majesty didnt seem to like being addressed so bluntly but he was very fond of playing the fiddle so he graciously obeyed the request and played a pretty and pathetic ballad upon the spun sugar strings then begging to be excused for a few minutes while the chariot was being made ready the king left them and went into another room  this gave the children a chance to talk freely with the sugar people and chubbins said to one man who looked very smooth on the outside  i spose youre one of the big men of this place arent you  the man looked frightened for a moment and then took the boys arm and led him into a corner of the room  you ask me an embarrassing question he whispered looking around to make sure that no one overheard although i pose as one of the nobility i am as a matter of fact a great fraud  hows that asked chubbins  have you noticed how smooth i am inquired the sugar man  yes replied the boy why is it  why im frosted thats the reason no one here suspects it and im considered very respectable but the truth is im just coated over with frosting and not solid sugar at all  whats inside you asked chubbins  that answered the man i do not know ive never dared to find out for if i broke my frosting to see what im stuffed with every one else would see too and i would be disgraced and ruined  perhaps youre cake suggested the boy  perhaps so answered the man sadly please keep my secret for only those who are solid loafsugar are of any account in this country and at present i am received in the best society as you see  oh i wont tell said chubbins  during this time twinkle had been talking with a sugar lady in another part of the room this lady seemed to be of the purest loafsugar for she sparkled most beautifully and twinkle thought she was quite the prettiest person to look at that she had yet seen  are you related to the king she asked  no indeed answered the sugar lady although im considered one of the very highest quality but ill tell you a secret my dear she took twinkles hand and led her across to a sugar sofa where they both sat down  no one resumed the sugar lady has ever suspected the truth but im only a sham and it worries me dreadfully  i dont understand what you mean said twinkle your sugar seems as pure and sparkling as that of the king  things are not always what they seem sighed the sugar lady what you see of me on the outside is all right but the fact is im hollow  dear me exclaimed twinkle in surprise how do you know it  i can feel it answered the lady impressively if you weighed me youd find im not as heavy as the solid ones and tor a long time i ve realized the bitter truth that im hollow it makes me very unhappy but i dont dare confide my secret to anyone here because it would disgrace me forever  i wouldnt worry said the child theyll never know the difference  not unless i should break replied the sugar lady but if that happened all the world could see that im hollow and instead of being welcomed in good society id become an outcast its even more respectable to be made of brown sugar than to be hollow dont you think so  im a stranger here said twinkle so i cant judge but if i were you i wouldnt worry unless i got broke and you may be wrong after all and as sound as a brick    chapter vi the royal chariot  just then the king came back to the room and said  the chariot is at the door and as there are three seats ill take lord cloy and princess sakareen with us  so the children followed the king to the door of the palace where stood a beautiful white and yellow sugar chariot drawn by six handsome sugar horses with spun sugar tails and manes and driven by a brown sugar coachman in a blue sugar livery  the king got in first and the others followed then the children discovered that lord cloy was the frosted man and princess sakareen was the sugar lady who had told twinkle that she was hollow  there was quite a crowd of sugar people at the gates to watch the departure of the royal party and a few soldiers and policemen were also present to keep order twinkle sat beside the king and chubbins sat on the same seat with the princess sakareen while lord cloy was obliged to sit with the coachman when all were ready the driver cracked a sugar whip but didnt break it and away the chariot dashed over a road paved with blocks of cut loafsugar  the air was cool and pleasant but there was a sweet smell to the breeze that was peculiar to this strange country sugar birds flew here and there singing sweet songs and a few sugar dogs ran out to bark at the kings chariot as it whirled along  havent you any automobiles in your country asked the girl  no answered the king anything that requires heat to make it go is avoided here because heat would melt us and ruin our bodies in a few minutes automobiles would be dangerous in sugarloaf city  theyre dangerous enough anywhere she said what do you feed to your horses  they eat a fine quality of barleysugar that grows in our fields answered the king youll see it presently for we will drive out to my country villa which is near the edge of the dome opposite to where you came in  first however they rode all about the city and the king pointed out the public buildings and the theaters and the churches and a number of small but pretty public parks and there was a high tower near the center that rose halfway to the dome it was so tall  arent you afraid the roof will cave in some time and ruin your city twinkle asked the king  oh no he answered we never think of such a thing isnt there a dome over the place where you live  yes said twinkle but its the sky  do you ever fear it will cave in inquired the king  no indeed she replied with a laugh at the idea  well its the same way with us returned his majesty domes are the strongest things in all the world    chapter vii twinkle gets thirsty  after they had seen the sights of the city the carriage turned into a broad highway that led into the country and soon they began to pass fields of sugar corn and gardens of sugar cabbages and sugar beets and sugar potatoes there were also orchards of sugar plums and sugar apples and vineyards of sugar grapes all the trees were sugar and even the grass was sugar while sugar grasshoppers hopped about in it indeed chubbins decided that not a speck of anything beneath the dome of sugarloaf mountain was anything but pure sugarunless the inside of the frosted man proved to be of a different material  by and by they reached a pretty villa where they all left the carriage and followed the sugar king into the sugar house refreshments had been ordered in advance over the sugar telephone so that the dining table was already laid and all they had to do was to sit in the pretty sugar chairs and be waited upon by maplesugar attendants  there were sandwiches and salads and fruits and many other sugar things to eat served on sugar plates and the children found that some were flavored with wintergreen and raspberry and lemon so that they were almost as good as candies at each plate was a glass made of crystal sugar and filled with thick sugar syrup and this seemed to be the only thing to drink after eating so much sugar the children naturally became thirsty and when the king asked twinkle if she would like anything else she answered promptly  yes id like a drink of water  at once a murmur of horror arose from the sugar people present and the king pushed back his chair as if greatly disturbed  water he exclaimed in amazement  sure replied chubbins i want some too were thirsty  the king shuddered  nothing in the world said he gravely is so dangerous as water it melts sugar in no time and to drink it would destroy you instantly  were not made of sugar said twinkle in our country we drink all the water we want  it may be true returned the king but i am thankful to say there is no drop of water in all this favored country but we have syrup which is much better for your health it fills up the spaces inside you and hardens and makes you solid  it makes me thirstier than ever said the girl but if you have no water we must try to get along until we get home again  when the luncheon was over they entered the carriage again and were driven back towards the city on the way the six sugar horses became restless and pranced around in so lively a manner that the sugar coachman could scarcely hold them in and when they had nearly reached the palace a part of the harness broke and without warning all six horses dashed madly away the chariot smashed against a high wall of sugar and broke into many pieces the sugar people as well as twinkle and chubbins being thrown out and scattered in all directions  the little girl was not at all hurt nor was chubbins who landed on top the wall and had to climb down again but the king had broken one of the points off his crown and sat upon the ground gazing sorrowfully at his wrecked chariot and lord cloy the frosted man had smashed one of his feet and everybody could now see that underneath the frosting was a material very like marshmallowa discovery that was sure to condemn him as unfit for the society of the solid sugarloaf aristocracy of the country  but perhaps the most serious accident of all had befallen princess sakareen whose left leg had broken short off at the knee twinkle ran up to her as soon as she could and found the princess smiling happily and gazing at the part of the broken leg which she had picked up  see here twinkle she cried its as solid as the king himself im not hollow at all it was only my imagination  im glad of that answered twinkle but what will you do with a broken leg  oh thats easily mended said the princess all i must do is to put a little syrup on the broken parts and stick them together and then sit in the breeze until it hardens ill be all right in an hour from now  it pleased twinkle to hear this for she liked the pretty sugar princess    chapter viii after the runaway  now the king came up to them saying i hope you are not injured  we are all right said twinkle but im getting dreadful thirsty so if your majesty has no objection i guess well go home  no objection at all answered the king  chubbins had been calmly filling his pockets with broken spokes and other bits of the wrecked chariot but feeling nearly as thirsty as twinkle he was glad to learn they were about to start for home  they exchanged goodbyes with all their sugar friends and thanked the sugar king for his royal entertainment then captain brittle and his soldiers escorted the children to the archway through which they had entered sugarloaf city  they had little trouble in going back although the tunnel was so dark in places that they had to feel their way but finally daylight could be seen ahead and a few minutes later they scrambled up the stone steps and squeezed through the little doorway  there was their basket just as they had left it and the afternoon sun was shining softly over the familiar worldly landscape which they were both rejoiced to see again  chubbins closed the iron door and as soon as he did so the bolts shot into place locking it securely  wheres the key asked twinkle  i put it into my pocket said chubbins but it must have dropped out when i tumbled from the kings chariot  thats too bad said twinkle for now no one can ever get to the sugar city again the door is locked and the key is on the other side  never mind said the boy weve seen the inside of sugarloaf mountain once and thatll do us all our lives come on twink lets go home and get a drink
