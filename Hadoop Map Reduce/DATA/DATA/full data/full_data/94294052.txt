94294052	oflaherty vc a recruiting pamphlet   by george bernard shaw    it may surprise some people to learn that in 1915 this little play was a recruiting poster in disguise the british officer seldom likes irish soldiers but he always tries to have a certain proportion of them in his battalion because partly from a want of common sense which leads them to value their lives less than englishmen do lives are really less worth living in a poor country and partly because even the most cowardly irishman feels obliged to outdo an englishman in bravery if possible and at least to set a perilous pace for him irish soldiers give impetus to those military operations which require for their spirited execution more devilment than prudence  unfortunately irish recruiting was badly bungled in 1915 the irish were for the most part roman catholics and loyal irishmen which means that from the english point of view they were heretics and rebels but they were willing enough to go soldiering on the side of france and see the world outside ireland which is a dull place to live in it was quite easy to enlist them by approaching them from their own point of view but the war office insisted on approaching them from the point of view of dublin castle they were discouraged and repulsed by refusals to give commissions to roman catholic officers or to allow distinct irish units to be formed to attract them the walls were covered with placards headed remember belgium the folly of asking an irishman to remember anything when you want him to fight for england was apparent to everyone outside the castle forget and forgive would have been more to the point remembering belgium and its broken treaty led irishmen to remember limerick and its broken treaty and the recruiting ended in a rebellion in suppressing which the british artillery quite unnecessarily reduced the centre of dublin to ruins and the british commanders killed their leading prisoners of war in cold blood morning after morning with an effect of longdrawnout ferocity really it was only the usual childish petulance in which john bull does things in a week that disgrace him for a century though he soon recovers his good humor and cannot understand why the survivors of his wrath do not feel as jolly with him as he does with them on the smouldering ruins of dublin the appeals to remember louvain were presently supplemented by a fresh appeal irishmen do you wish to have the horrors of war brought to your own hearths and homes dublin laughed sourly  as for me i addressed myself quite simply to the business of obtaining recruits i knew by personal experience and observation what anyone might have inferred from the records of irish emigration that all an irishmans hopes and ambitions turn on his opportunities of getting out of ireland stimulate his loyalty and he will stay in ireland and die for her for incomprehensible as it seems to an englishman irish patriotism does not take the form of devotion to england and englands king appeal to his discontent his deadly boredom his thwarted curiosity and desire for change and adventure and to escape from ireland he will go abroad to risk his life for france for the papal states for secession in america and even if no better may be for england knowing that the ignorance and insularity of the irishman is a danger to himself and to his neighbors i had no scruple in making that appeal when there was something for him to fight which the whole world had to fight unless it meant to come under the jack boot of the german version of dublin castle  there was another consideration unmentionable by the recruiting sergeants and war orators which must nevertheless have helped them powerfully in procuring soldiers by voluntary enlistment the happy home of the idealist may become common under millennial conditions it is not common at present no one will ever know how many men joined the army in 1914 and 1915 to escape from tyrants and taskmasters termagants and shrews none of whom are any the less irksome when they happen by illluck to be also our fathers our mothers our wives and our children even at their amiablest a holiday from them may be a tempting change for all parties that is why i did not endow oflaherty vc with an ideal irish colleen for his sweetheart and gave him for his mother a volumnia of the potato patch rather than a affectionate parent from whom he could not so easily have torn himself away  i need hardly say that a play thus carefully adapted to its purpose was voted utterly inadmissible and in due course the british government frightened out of its wits for the moment by the rout of the fifth army ordained irish conscription and then did not dare to go through with it i still think my own line was the more businesslike but during the war everyone except the soldiers at the front imagined that nothing but an extreme assertion of our most passionate prejudices without the smallest regard to their effect on others could win the war finally the british blockade won the war but the wonder is that the british blockhead did not lose it i suppose the enemy was no wiser war is not a sharpener of wits and i am afraid i gave great offence by keeping my head in this matter of irish recruiting what can i do but apologize and publish the play now that it can no longer do any good     oflaherty vc  at the door of an irish country house in a park fine summer weather the summer of 1916 the porch painted white projects into the drive but the door is at the side and the front has a window the porch faces east and the door is in the north side of it on the south side is a tree in which a thrush is singing under the window is a garden seat with an iron chair at each end of it  the last four bars of god save the king are heard in the distance followed by three cheers then the band strikes up its a long way to tipperary and recedes until it is out of hearing  private oflaherty vc comes wearily southward along the drive and falls exhausted into the garden seat the thrush utters a note of alarm and flies away the tramp of a horse is heard  a gentlemans voice tim hi tim he is heard dismounting  a laborers voice yes your honor  the gentlemans voice take this horse to the stables will you  a laborers voice right your honor yup there gwan now gwan the horse is led away  general sir pearce madigan an elderly baronet in khaki beaming with enthusiasm arrives oflaherty rises and stands at attention  sir pearce no no oflaherty none of that now youre off duty remember that though i am a general of forty years service that little cross of yours gives you a higher rank in the roll of glory than i can pretend to  oflaherty relaxing im thankful to you sir pearce but i wouldnt have anyone think that the baronet of my native place would let a common soldier like me sit down in his presence without leave  sir pearce well youre not a common soldier oflaherty youre a very uncommon one and im proud to have you for my guest here today  oflaherty sure i know sir you have to put up with a lot from the like of me for the sake of the recruiting all the quality shakes hands with me and says theyre proud to know me just the way the king said when he pinned the cross on me and its as true as im standing here sir the queen said to me i hear you were born on the estate of general madigan she says and the general himself tells me you were always a fine young fellow bedad mam i says to her if the general knew all the rabbits i snared on him and all the salmon i snatched on him and all the cows i milked on him hed think me the finest ornament for the county jail he ever sent there for poaching  sir pearce laughing youre welcome to them all my lad come he makes him sit down again on the garden seat sit down and enjoy your holiday he sits down on one of the iron chairs the one at the doorless side of the porch  oflaherty holiday is it id give five shillings to be back in the trenches for the sake of a little rest and quiet i never knew what hard work was till i took to recruiting what with the standing on my legs all day and the shaking hands and the making speeches andwhats worsethe listening to them and the calling for cheers for king and country and the saluting the flag till im stiff with it and the listening to them playing god save the king and tipperary and the trying to make my eyes look moist like a man in a picture book im that bet that i hardly get a wink of sleep i give you my word sir pearce that i never heard the tune of tipperary in my life till i came back from flanders and already its drove me to that pitch of tiredness of it that when a poor little innocent slip of a boy in the street the other night drew himself up and saluted and began whistling it at me i clouted his head for him god forgive me  sir pearce soothingly yes yes i know i know one does get fed up with it ive been dog tired myself on parade many a time but still you know theres a gratifying side to it too after all he is our king and its our own country isnt it  oflaherty well sir to you that have an estate in it it would feel like your country but the divil a perch of it ever i owned and as to the king god help him my mother would have taken the skin off my back if id ever let on to have any other king than parnell  sir pearce rising painfully shocked your mother what are you dreaming about oflaherty a most loyal woman always most loyal whenever there is an illness in the royal family she asks me every time we meet about the health of the patient as anxiously as if it were yourself her only son  oflaherty well shes my mother and i wont utter a word agen her but im not saying a word of lie when i tell you that that old woman is the biggest kanatt from here to the cross of monasterboice sure shes the wildest fenian and rebel and always has been that ever taught a poor innocent lad like myself to pray night and morning to st patrick to clear the english out of ireland the same as he cleared the snakes youll be surprised at my telling you that now maybe sir pearce  sir pearce unable to keep still walking away from oflaherty surprised im more than surprised oflaherty im overwhelmed turning and facing him are youare you joking  oflaherty if youd been brought up by my mother sir youd know better than to joke about her what im telling you is the truth and i wouldnt tell it to you if i could see my way to get out of the fix ill be in when my mother comes here this day to see her boy in his glory and she after thinking all the time it was against the english i was fighting  sir pearce do you mean to say you told her such a monstrous falsehood as that you were fighting in the german army  oflaherty i never told her one word that wasnt the truth and nothing but the truth i told her i was going to fight for the french and for the russians and sure who ever heard of the french or the russians doing anything to the english but fighting them that was how it was sir and sure the poor woman kissed me and went about the house singing in her old cracky voice that the french was on the sea and theyd be here without delay and the orange will decay says the shan van vocht  sir pearce sitting down again exhausted by his feelings well i never could have believed this never what do you suppose will happen when she finds out  oflaherty she mustnt find out its not that shed half kill me as big as i am and as brave as i am its that im fond of her and cant bring myself to break the heart in her you may think it queer that a man should be fond of his mother sir and she having bet him from the time he could feel to the time she was too slow to ketch him but im fond of her and im not ashamed of it besides didnt she win the cross for me  sir pearce your mother how  oflaherty by bringing me up to be more afraid of running away than of fighting i was timid by nature and when the other boys hurted me id want to run away and cry but she whaled me for disgracing the blood of the oflahertys until id have fought the divil himself sooner than face her after funking a fight that was how i got to know that fighting was easier than it looked and that the others was as much afeard of me as i was of them and that if i only held out long enough theyd lose heart and give rip thats the way i came to be so courageous i tell you sir pearce if the german army had been brought up by my mother the kaiser would be dining in the banqueting hall at buckingham palace this day and king george polishing his jack boots for him in the scullery  sir pearce but i dont like this oflaherty you cant go on deceiving your mother you know its not right  oflaherty cant go on deceiving her cant i its little you know what a sons love can do sir did you ever notice what a ready liar i am  sir pearce well in recruiting a man gets carried away i stretch it a bit occasionally myself after all its for king and country but if you wont mind my saying it oflaherty i think that story about your fighting the kaiser and the twelve giants of the prussian guard singlehanded would be the better for a little toning down i dont ask you to drop it you know for its popular undoubtedly but still the truth is the truth dont you think it would fetch in almost as many recruits if you reduced the number of guardsmen to six  oflaherty youre not used to telling lies like i am sir i got great practice at home with my mother what with saving my skin when i was young and thoughtless and sparing her feelings when i was old enough to understand them ive hardly told my mother the truth twice a year since i was born and would you have me turn round on her and tell it now when shes looking to have some peace and quiet in her old age  sir pearce troubled in his conscience well its not my affair of course oflaherty but hadnt you better talk to father quinlan about it  oflaherty talk to father quinlan is it do you know what father quinlan says to me this very morning  sir pearce oh youve seen him already have you what did he say  oflaherty he says you know dont you he says that its your duty as a christian and a good son of the holy church to love your enemies he says i know its my juty as a soldier to kill them i says thats right dinny he says quite right but says he you can kill them and do them a good turn afterward to show your love for them he says and its your duty to have a mass said for the souls of the hundreds of germans you say you killed says he for many and many of them were bavarians and good catholics he says is it me that must pay for masses for the souls of the boshes i says let the king of england pay for them i says for it was his quarrel and not mine  sir pearce warmly it is the quarrel of every honest man and true patriot oflaherty your mother must see that as clearly as i do after all she is a reasonable well disposed woman quite capable of understanding the right and the wrong of the war why cant you explain to her what the war is about  oflaherty arra sir how the divil do i know what the war is about  sir pearce rising again and standing over him what oflaherty do you know what you are saying you sit there wearing the victoria cross for having killed god knows how many germans and you tell me you dont know why you did it  oflaherty asking your pardon sir pearce i tell you no such thing i know quite well why i kilt them because i was afeard that if i didnt theyd kill me  sir pearce giving it up and sitting down again yes yes of course but have you no knowledge of the causes of the war of the interests at stake of the importancei may almost sayin fact i will saythe sacred right for which we are fighting dont you read the papers  oflaherty i do when i can get them theres not many newsboys crying the evening paper in the trenches they do say sir pearce that we shall never beat the boshes until we make horatio bottomley lord leftnant of england do you think thats true sir  sir pearce rubbish man theres no lord lieutenant in england the king is lord lieutenant its a simple question of patriotism does patriotism mean nothing to you  oflaherty it means different to me than what it would to you sir it means england and englands king to you to me and the like of me it means talking about the english just the way the english papers talk about the boshes and what good has it ever done here in ireland its kept me ignorant because it filled up my mothers mind and she thought it ought to fill up mine too its kept ireland poor because instead of trying to better ourselves we thought we was the fine fellows of patriots when we were speaking evil of englishmen that was as poor as ourselves and maybe as good as ourselves the boshes i kilt was more knowledgable men than me and what better am i now that ive kilt them what better is anybody  sir pearce huffed turning a cold shoulder to him i am sorry the terrible experience of this warthe greatest war ever foughthas taught you no better oflaherty  oflaherty preserving his dignity i dont know about its being a great war sir its a big war but thats not the same thing father quinlans new church is a big church you might take the little old chapel out of the middle of it and not miss it but my mother says there was more true religion in the old chapel and the war has taught me that maybe she was right  sir pearce grunts sulkily  oflaherty respectfully but doggedly and theres another thing its taught me too sir that concerns you and me if i may make bold to tell it to you  sir pearce still sulky i hope its nothing you oughtnt to say to me oflaherty  oflaherty its this sir that im able to sit here now and talk to you without humbugging you and thats what not one of your tenants or your tenants childer ever did to you before in all your long life its a true respect im showing you at last sir maybe youd rather have me humbug you and tell you lies as i used just as the boys here god help them would rather have me tell them how i fought the kaiser that all the world knows i never saw in my life than tell them the truth but i cant take advantage of you the way i used not even if i seem to be wanting in respect to you and cocked up by winning the cross  sir pearce touched not at all oflaherty not at all  oflaherty sure whats the cross to me barring the little pension it carries do you think i dont know that theres hundreds of men as brave as me that never had the luck to get anything for their bravery but a curse from the sergeant and the blame for the faults of them that ought to have been their betters ive learnt more than youd think sir for how would a gentleman like you know what a poor ignorant conceited creature i was when i went from here into the wide world as a soldier what use is all the lying and pretending and humbugging and letting on when the day comes to you that your comrade is killed in the trench beside you and you dont as much as look round at him until you trip over his poor body and then all you say is to ask why the hell the stretcherbearers dont take it out of the way why should i read the papers to be humbugged and lied to by them that had the cunning to stay at home and send me to fight for them dont talk to me or to any soldier of the war being right no war is right and all the holy water that father quinlan ever blessed couldnt make one right there sir now you know what oflaherty vc thinks and youre wiser so than the others that only knows what he done  sir pearce making the best of it and turning goodhumoredly to him again well what you did was brave and manly anyhow  oflaherty god knows whether it was or not better than you nor me general i hope he wont be too hard on me for it anyhow  sir pearce sympathetically oh yes we all have to think seriously sometimes especially when were a little run down im afraid weve been overworking you a bit over these recruiting meetings however we can knock off for the rest of the day and tomorrows sunday ive had about as much as i can stand myself he looks at his watch its teatime i wonder whats keeping your mother  oflaherty its nicely cocked up the old woman will be having tea at the same table as you sir instead of in the kitchen shell be after dressing in the heighth of grandeur and stop she will at every house on the way to show herself off and tell them where shes going and fill the whole parish with spite and envy but sure she shouldnt keep you waiting sir  sir pearce oh thats all right she must be indulged on an occasion like this im sorry my wife is in london shed have been glad to welcome your mother  oflaherty sure i know she would sir she was always a kind friend to the poor little her ladyship knew god help her the depth of divilment that was in us we were like a play to her you see sir she was english that was how it was we was to her what the pathans and senegalese was to me when i first seen them i couldnt think somehow that they were liars and thieves and backbiters and drunkards just like ourselves or any other christians oh her ladyship never knew all that was going on behind her back how would she when i was a weeshy child she gave me the first penny i ever had in my hand and i wanted to pray for her conversion that night the same as my mother made me pray for yours and  sir pearce scandalized do you mean to say that your mother made you pray for my conversion  oflaherty sure and she wouldnt want to see a gentleman like you going to hell after she nursing your own son and bringing up my sister annie on the bottle that was how it was sir shed rob you and shed lie to you and shed call down all the blessings of god on your head when she was selling you your own three geese that you thought had been ate by the fox the day after youd finished fattening them sir and all the time you were like a bit of her own flesh and blood to her often has she said shed live to see you a good catholic yet leading victorious armies against the english and wearing the collar of gold that malachi won from the proud invader oh shes the romantic woman is my mother and no mistake  sir pearce in great perturbation i really cant believe this oflaherty i could have sworn your mother was as honest a woman as ever breathed  oflaherty and so she is sir shes as honest as the day  sir pearce do you call it honest to steal my geese  oflaherty she didnt steal them sir it was me that stole them  sir pearce oh and why the devil did you steal them  oflaherty sure we needed them sir often and often we had to sell our own geese to pay you the rent to satisfy your needs and why shouldnt we sell your geese to satisfy ours  sir pearce well damn me  oflaherty sweetly sure you had to get what you could out of us and we had to get what we could out of you god forgive us both  sir pearce really oflaherty the war seems to have upset you a little  oflaherty its set me thinking sir and im not used to it its like the patriotism of the english they never thought of being patriotic until the war broke out and now the patriotism has took them so sudden and come so strange to them that they run about like frightened chickens uttering all manner of nonsense but please god theyll forget all about it when the wars over theyre getting tired of it already  sir pearce no no it has uplifted us all in a wonderful way the world will never be the same again oflaherty not after a war like this  oflaherty so they all say sir i see no great differ myself its all the fright and the excitement and when that quiets down theyll go back to their natural divilment and be the same as ever its like the vermin itll wash off after a while  sir pearce rising and planting himself firmly behind the garden seat well the long and the short of it is oflaherty i must decline to be a party to any attempt to deceive your mother i thoroughly disapprove of this feeling against the english especially at a moment like the present even if your mothers political sympathies are really what you represent them to be i should think that her gratitude to gladstone ought to cure her of such disloyal prejudices  oflaherty over his shoulder she says gladstone was an irishman sir what call would he have to meddle with ireland as he did if he wasnt  sir pearce what nonsense does she suppose mr asquith is an irishman  oflaherty she wont give him any credit for home rule sir she says redmond made him do it she says you told her so  sir pearce convicted out of his own mouth well i never meant her to take it up in that ridiculous way he moves to the end of the garden seat on oflahertys left ill give her a good talking to when she comes im not going to stand any of her nonsense  oflaherty its not a bit of use sir she says all the english generals is irish she says all the english poets and great men was irish she says the english never knew how to read their own books until we taught them she says were the lost tribes of the house of israel and the chosen people of god she says that the goddess venus that was born out of the foam of the sea came up out of the water in killiney bay off bray head she says that moses built the seven churches and that lazarus was buried in glasnevin  sir pearce bosh how does she know he was did you ever ask her  oflaherty i did sir often  sir pearce and what did she say  oflaherty she asked me how did i know he wasnt and fetched me a clout on the side of my head  sir pearce but have you never mentioned any famous englishman to her and asked her what she had to say about him  oflaherty the only one i could think of was shakespeare sir and she says he was born in cork  sir pearce exhausted well i give it up he throws himself into the nearest chair the woman isoh well no matter  oflaherty sympathetically yes sir shes pigheaded and obstinate theres no doubt about it shes like the english they think theres no one like themselves its the same with the germans though theyre educated and ought to know better youll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race  sir pearce still we  oflaherty whisht sir for gods sake here she is  the general jumps up mrs oflaherty arrives and comes between the two men she is very clean and carefully dressed in the old fashioned peasant costume black silk sunbonnet with a tiara of trimmings and black cloak  oflaherty rising shyly good evening mother  mrs oflaherty severely you hold your whisht and learn behavior while i pay my juty to his honor to sir pearce heartily and how is your honors good self and how is her ladyship and all the young ladies oh its right glad we are to see your honor back again and looking the picture of health  sir pearce forcing a note of extreme geniality thank you mrs oflaherty well you see weve brought you back your son safe and sound i hope youre proud of him  mrs oflaherty and indeed and i am your honor its the brave boy he is and why wouldnt he be brought up on your honors estate and with you before his eyes for a pattern of the finest soldier in ireland come and kiss your old mother dinny darlint oflaherty does so sheepishly thats my own darling boy and look at your fine new uniform stained already with the eggs youve been eating and the porter youve been drinking she takes out her handkerchief spits on it and scrubs his lapel with it oh its the untidy slovenly one you always were there it wont be seen on the khaki its not like the old red coat that would show up everything that dribbled down on it to sir pearce and they tell me down at the lodge that her ladyship is staying in london and that miss agnes is to be married to a fine young nobleman oh its your honor that is the lucky and happy father it will be bad news for many of the young gentlemen of the quality round here sir theres lots thought she was going to marry young master lawless  sir pearce what thatthatthat bosthoon  mrs oflaherty hilariously let your honor alone for finding the right word a big bosthoon he is indeed your honor oh to think of the times and times i have said that miss agnes would be my lady as her mother was before her didnt i dinny  sir pearce and now mrs oflaherty i daresay you have a great deal to say to dennis that doesnt concern me ill just go in and order tea  mrs oflaherty oh why would your honor disturb yourself sure i can take the boy into the yard  sir pearce not at all it wont disturb me in the least and hes too big a boy to be taken into the yard now he has made a front seat for himself eh he goes into the house  mrs oflaherty sure he has that your honor god bless your honor the general being now out of hearing she turns threateningly to her son with one of those sudden irish changes of manner which amaze and scandalize less flexible nations and exclaims and what do you mean you lying young scald by telling me you were going to fight agen the english did you take me for a fool that couldnt find out and the papers all full of you shaking hands with the english king at buckingham palace  oflaherty i didnt shake hands with him he shook hands with me could i turn on the man in his own house before his own wife with his money in my pocket and in yours and throw his civility back in his face  mrs oflaherty you would take the hand of a tyrant red with the blood of ireland  oflaherty arra hold your nonsense mother hes not half the tyrant you are god help him his hand was cleaner than mine that had the blood of his own relations on it maybe  mrs oflaherty threateningly is that a way to speak to your mother you young spalpeen  oflaherty stoutly it is so if you wont talk sense to me its a nice thing for a poor boy to be made much of by kings and queens and shook hands with by the heighth of his countrys nobility in the capital cities of the world and then to come home and be scolded and insulted by his own mother ill fight for who i like and ill shake hands with what kings i like and if your own son is not good enough for you you can go and look for another do you mind me now  mrs oflaherty and was it the belgians learned you such brazen impudence  oflaherty the belgians is good men and the french ought to be more civil to them let alone their being half murdered by the boshes  mrs oflaherty good men is it good men to come over here when they were wounded because it was a catholic country and then to go to the protestant church because it didnt cost them anything and some of them to never go near a church at all thats what you call good men  oflaherty oh youre the mighty fine politician arent you much you know about belgians or foreign parts or the world youre living in god help you  mrs oflaherty why wouldnt i know better than you amment i your mother  oflaherty and if you are itself how can you know what you never seen as well as me that was dug into the continent of europe for six months and was buried in the earth of it three times with the shells bursting on the top of me i tell you i know what im about i have my own reasons for taking part in this great conflict id be ashamed to stay at home and not fight when everybody else is fighting  mrs oflaherty if you wanted to fight why couldnt you fight in the german army  oflaherty because they only get a penny a day  mrs oflaherty well and if they do itself isnt there the french army  oflaherty they only get a hapenny a day  mrs oflaherty much dashed oh murder they must be a mean lot dinny  oflaherty sarcastic maybe youd have me in the turkish army and worship the heathen mahomet that put a corn in his ear and pretended it was a message from the heavens when the pigeon come to pick it out and eat it i went where i could get the biggest allowance for you and little thanks i get for it  mrs oflaherty allowance is it do you know what the thieving blackguards did on me they came to me and they says was your son a big eater they says oh he was that says i ten shillings a week wouldnt keep him sure i thought the more i said the more theyd give me then says they thats ten shillings a week off your allowance they says because you save that by the king feeding him indeed says i i suppose if id six sons youd stop three pound a week from me and make out that i ought to pay you money instead of you paying me theres a fallacy in your argument they says  oflaherty a what  mrs oflaherty a fallacy thats the word he said i says to him its a pharisee im thinking you mean sir but you can keep your dirty money that your king grudges a poor old widow and please god the english will be got yet for the deadly sin of oppressing the poor and with that i shut the door in his face  oflaherty furious do you tell me they knocked ten shillings off you for my keep  mrs oflaherty soothing him no darlint they only knocked off half a crown i put up with it because ive got the old age pension and they know very well im only sixtytwo so ive the better of them by half a crown a week anyhow  oflaherty its a queer way of doing business if theyd tell you straight out what they was going to give you you wouldnt mind but if there was twenty ways of telling the truth and only one way of telling a lie the government would find it out its in the nature of governments to tell lies  teresa driscoll a parlor maid comes from the house  teresa youre to come up to the drawingroom to have your tea mrs oflaherty  mrs oflaherty mind you have a sup of good black tea for me in the kitchen afterwards acushla that washy drawingroom tea will

anyhow i have a neck to put it round and not a hank of wrinkles  at this unfortunate remark mrs oflaherty bounds from her seat and an appalling tempest of wordy wrath breaks out the remonstrances and commands of the general and the protests and menaces of oflaherty only increase the hubbub they are soon all speaking at once at the top of their voices  mrs oflaherty solo you impudent young heifer how dar you say such a thing to me teresa retorts furiously the men interfere and the solo becomes a quartet fortissimo ive a good mind to clout your ears for you to teach you manners be ashamed of yourself do and learn to know who youre speaking to that i maytnt sin but i dont know what the good god was thinking about when he made the like of you let me not see you casting sheeps eyes at my son

that now  teresa is it me you offer such a name to you foumouthed dirtyminded lying sloothering old sow you i wouldnt soil my tongue by calling you in your right name and telling sir pearce whats the common talk of the town about you you and your oflahertys setting yourself up agen the driscolls that would never lower themselves to be seen in conversation with you at the fair you can keep your ugly stingy lump of a son for what is he but a common soldier and god help the girl that gets him say i so the back of my hand to you mrs oflaherty and that the cat may tear your ugly old face  sir pearce silence tessie did you hear me ordering you to go into the house mrs oflaherty louder mrs oflaherty will you just listen to me one moment please furiously do you hear me speaking to you woman are you human beings or are you wild beasts stop that noise immediately do you hear yelling are you going to do what i order you or are you not scandalous disgraceful this comes of being too familiar with you oflaherty shove them into the house out with the whole damned pack of you  oflaherty to the women here now none of that none of that go easy i tell you hold your whisht mother will you or youll be sorry for it after to teresa is that the way for a decent young girl to speak despairingly oh for the lords sake shut up will yous have you no respect for yourselves or your betters peremptorily let me have no more of it i tell you och the divils in the whole crew of you in with you into the house this very minute and tear one anothers eyes out in the kitchen if you like in with you  the two men seize the two women and push them still violently abusing one another into the house sir pearce slams the door upon them savagely immediately a heavenly silence falls on the summer afternoon the two sit down out of breath and for a long time nothing is said sir pearce sits on an iron chair oflaherty sits on the garden seat the thrush begins to sing melodiously oflaherty cocks his ears and looks up at it a smile spreads over his troubled features sir pearce with a long sigh takes out his pipe and begins to fill it  oflaherty idyllically what a discontented sort of an animal a man is sir only a month ago i was in the quiet of the country out at the front with not a sound except the birds and the bellow of a cow in the distance as it might be and the shrapnel making little clouds in the heavens and the shells whistling and maybe a yell or two when one of us was hit and would you believe it sir i complained of the noise and wanted to have a peaceful hour at home well them two has taught me a lesson this morning sir when i was telling the boys here how i was longing to be back taking my part for king and country with the others i was lying as you well knew sir now i can go and say it with a clear conscience some likes wars alarums and some likes home life ive tried both sir and im for wars alarums now i always was a quiet lad by natural disposition  sir pearce strictly between ourselves oflaherty and as one soldier to another oflaherty salutes but without stiffening do you think we should have got an army without conscription if domestic life had been as happy as people say it is  oflaherty well between you and me and the wall sir pearce i think the less we say about that until the wars over the better  he winks at the general the general strikes a match the thrush sings a jay laughs the conversation drops
