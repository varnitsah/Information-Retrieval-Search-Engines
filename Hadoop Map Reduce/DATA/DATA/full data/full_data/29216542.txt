29216542	the lady of the barge  and other stories  by w w jacobs     three at table   the talk in the coffeeroom had been of ghosts and apparitions and nearly everybody present had contributed his mite to the stock of information upon a hazy and somewhat threadbare subject  opinions ranged from rank incredulity to childlike faith one believer going so far as to denounce unbelief as impious with a reference to the witch of endor which was somewhat marred by being complicated in an inexplicable fashion with the story of jonah  talking of jonah he said solemnly with a happy disregard of the fact that he had declined to answer several eager questions put to him on the subject look at the strange tales sailors tell us  i wouldnt advise you to believe all those said a bluff cleanshaven man who had been listening without speaking much  you see when a sailor gets ashore hes expected to have something to tell and his friends would be rather disappointed if he had not  its a wellknown fact interrupted the first speaker firmly that sailors are very prone to see visions  they are said the other dryly they generally see them in pairs and the shock to the nervous system frequently causes headache next morning  you never saw anything yourself  suggested an unbeliever  man and boy said the other ive been at sea thirty years and the only unpleasant incident of that kind occurred in a quiet english countryside  and that  said another man  i was a young man at the time said the narrator drawing at his pipe and glancing goodhumouredly at the company  i had just come back from china and my own people being away i went down into the country to invite myself to stay with an uncle  when i got down to the place i found it closed and the family in the south of france but as they were due back in a couple of days i decided to put up at the royal george a very decent inn and await their return  the first day i passed well enough but in the evening the dulness of the rambling old place in which i was the only visitor began to weigh upon my spirits and the next morning after a late breakfast i set out with the intention of having a brisk days walk  i started off in excellent spirits for the day was bright and frosty with a powdering of snow on the ironbound roads and nipped hedges and the country had to me all the charm of novelty  it was certainly flat but there was plenty of timber and the villages through which i passed were old and picturesque  i lunched luxuriously on bread and cheese and beer in the bar of a small inn and resolved to go a little further before turning back  when at length i found i had gone far enough i turned up a lane at right angles to the road i was passing and resolved to find my way back by another route  it is a long lane that has no turning but this had several each of which had turnings of its own which generally led as i found by trying two or three of them into the open marshes  then tired of lanes i resolved to rely upon the small compass which hung from my watch chain and go across country home  i had got well into the marshes when a white fog which had been for some time hovering round the edge of the ditches began gradually to spread  there was no escaping it but by aid of my compass i was saved from making a circular tour and fell instead into frozen ditches or stumbled over roots in the grass  i kept my course however until at four oclock when night was coming rapidly up to lend a hand to the fog i was fain to confess myself lost  the compass was now no good to me and i wandered about miserably occasionally giving a shout on the chance of being heard by some passing shepherd or farmhand  at length by great good luck i found my feet on a rough road driven through the marshes and by walking slowly and tapping with my stick managed to keep to it  i had followed it for some distance when i heard footsteps approaching me  we stopped as we met and the new arrival a sturdylooking countryman hearing of my plight walked back with me for nearly a mile and putting me on to a road gave me minute instructions how to reach a village some three miles distant  i was so tired that three miles sounded like ten and besides that a little way off from the road i saw dimly a lighted window  i pointed it out but my companion shuddered and looked round him uneasily  you wont get no good there he said hastily  why not i asked  theres a something there sir he replied what tis i dunno but the little un belonging to a gamekeeper as used to live in these parts see it and it was never much good afterward  some say as its a poor mad thing others says as its a kind of animal but whatever it is it aint good to see  well ill keep on then i said  goodnight  he went back whistling cheerily until his footsteps died away in the distance and i followed the road he had indicated until it divided into three any one of which to a stranger might be said to lead straight on i was now cold and tired and having half made up my mind walked slowly back toward the house  at first all i could see of it was the little patch of light at the window i made for that until it disappeared suddenly and i found myself walking into a tall hedge i felt my way round this until i came to a small gate and opening it cautiously walked not without some little nervousness up a long path which led to the door there was no light and no sound from within half repenting of my temerity i shortened my stick and knocked lightly upon the door  i waited a couple of minutes and then knocked again and my stick was still beating the door when it opened suddenly and a tall bony old woman holding a candle confronted me  what do you want she demanded gruffly  ive lost my way i said civilly i want to get to ashville  dont know it said the old woman  she was about to close the door when a man emerged from a room at the side of the hall and came toward us  an old man of great height and breadth of shoulder  ashville is fifteen miles distant he said slowly  if you will direct me to the nearest village i shall be grateful i remarked  he made no reply but exchanged a quick furtive glance with the woman she made a gesture of dissent  the nearest place is three miles off he said turning to me and apparently trying to soften a naturally harsh voice if you will give me the pleasure of your company i will make you as comfortable as i can  i hesitated  they were certainly a queerlooking couple and the gloomy hall with the shadows thrown by the candle looked hardly more inviting than the darkness outside  you are very kind i murmured irresolutely but  come in he said quickly shut the door anne  almost before i knew it i was standing inside and the old woman muttering to herself had closed the door behind me  with a queer sensation of being trapped i followed my host into the room and taking the proffered chair warmed my frozen fingers at the fire  dinner will soon be ready said the old man regarding me closely if you will excuse me  i bowed and he left the room  a minute afterward i heard voices his and the old womans and i fancied a third  before i had finished my inspection of the room he returned and regarded me with the same strange look i had noticed before  there will be three of us at dinner he said at length we two and my son  i bowed again and secretly hoped that that look didnt run in the family  i suppose you dont mind dining in the dark he said abruptly  not at all i replied hiding my surprise as well as i could but really im afraid im intruding if youll allow me  he waved his huge gaunt hands were not going to lose you now weve got you he said with a dry laugh  its seldom we have company and now weve got you well keep you  my sons eyes are bad and he cant stand the light  ah here is anne  as he spoke the old woman entered and eyeing me stealthily began to lay the cloth while my host taking a chair the other side of the hearth sat looking silently into the fire  the table set the old woman brought in a pair of fowls ready carved in a dish and placing three chairs left the room  the old man hesitated a moment and then rising from his chair placed a large screen in front of the fire and slowly extinguished the candles  blind mans holiday he said with clumsy jocosity and groping his way to the door opened it  somebody came back into the room with him and in a slow uncertain fashion took a seat at the table and the strangest voice i have ever heard broke a silence which was fast becoming oppressive  a cold night it said slowly  i replied in the affirmative and light or no light fell to with an appetite which had only been sharpened by the snack in the middle of the day  it was somewhat difficult eating in the dark and it was evident from the behaviour of my invisible companions that they were as unused to dining under such circumstances as i was  we ate in silence until the old woman blundered into the room with some sweets and put them with a crash upon the table  are you a stranger about here inquired the curious voice again  i replied in the affirmative and murmured something about my luck in stumbling upon such a good dinner  stumbling is a very good word for it said the voice grimly  you have forgotten the port father  so i have said the old man rising  its a bottle of the celebrated today i will get it myself  he felt his way to the door and closing it behind him left me alone with my unseen neighbour  there was something so strange about the whole business that i must confess to more than a slight feeling of uneasiness  my host seemed to be absent a long time  i heard the man opposite lay down his fork and spoon and half fancied i could see a pair of wild eyes shining through the gloom like a cats  with a growing sense of uneasiness i pushed my chair back  it caught the hearthrug and in my efforts to disentangle it the screen fell over with a crash and in the flickering light of the fire i saw the face of the creature opposite  with a sharp catch of my breath i left my chair and stood with clenched fists beside it  man or beast which was it the flame leaped up and then went out and in the mere red glow of the fire it looked more devilish than before  for a few moments we regarded each other in silence then the door opened and the old man returned  he stood aghast as he saw the warm firelight and then approaching the table mechanically put down a couple of bottles  i beg your pardon said i reassured by his presence but i have accidentally overturned the screen  allow me to replace it  no said the old man gently let it be  we have had enough of the dark  ill give you a light  he struck a match and slowly lit the candles  theni saw that the man opposite had but the remnant of a face a gaunt wolfish face in which one unquenched eye the sole remaining feature still glittered  i was greatly moved some suspicion of the truth occurring to me  my son was injured some years ago in a burning house said the old man  since then we have lived a very retired life  when you came to the door we his voice trembled that ismy son  i thought said the son simply that it would be better for me not to come to the dinnertable  but it happens to be my birthday and my father would not hear of my dining alone so we hit upon this foolish plan of dining in the dark  im sorry i startled you  i am sorry said i as i reached across the table and gripped his hand that i am such a fool but it was only in the dark that you startled me  from a faint tinge in the old mans cheek and a certain pleasant softening of the poor solitary eye in front of me i secretly congratulated myself upon this last remark  we never see a friend said the old man apologetically and the temptation to have company was too much for us  besides i dont know what else you could have done  nothing else half so good im sure said i  come said my host with almost a sprightly air  now we know each other draw our chairs to the fire and lets keep this birthday in a proper fashion  he drew a small table to the fire for the glasses and produced a box of cigars and placing a chair for the old servant sternly bade her to sit down and drink  if the talk was not sparkling it did not lack for vivacity and we were soon as merry a party as i have ever seen  the night wore on so rapidly that we could hardly believe our ears when in a lull in the conversation a clock in the hall struck twelve  a last toast before we retire said my host pitching the end of his cigar into the fire and turning to the small table  we had drunk several before this but there was something impressive in the old mans manner as he rose and took up his glass  his tall figure seemed to get taller and his voice rang as he gazed proudly at his disfigured son  the health of the children my boy saved he said and drained his glass at a draught
