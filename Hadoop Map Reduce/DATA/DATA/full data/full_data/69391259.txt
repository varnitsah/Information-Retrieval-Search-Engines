69391259	marjories three gifts   by louisa m alcott   author of little women little men an oldfashioned girl etc  boston  1899      marjories three gifts   marjorie sat on the doorstep shelling peas quite unconscious what a pretty picture she made with the roses peeping at her through the lattice work of the porch the wind playing hideandseek in her curly hair while the sunshine with its silent magic changed her faded gingham to a golden gown and shimmered on the bright tin pan as if it were a silver shield old rover lay at her feet the white kitten purred on her shoulder and friendly robins hopped about her in the grass chirping a happy birthday marjorie  but the little maid neither saw nor heard for her eyes were fixed on the green pods and her thoughts were far away she was recalling the fairytale granny told her last night and wishing with all her heart that such things happened nowadays for in this story as a poor girl like herself sat spinning before the door a brownie came by and gave the child a goodluck penny then a fairy passed and left a talisman which would keep her always happy and last of all the prince rolled up in his chariot and took her away to reign with him over a lovely kingdom as a reward for her many kindnesses to others  when marjorie imagined this part of the story it was impossible to help giving one little sigh and for a minute she forgot her work so busy was she thinking what beautiful presents she would give to all the poor children in her realm when they had birthdays five impatient young peas took this opportunity to escape from the halfopen pod in her hand and skip down the steps to be immediately gobbled up by an audacious robin who gave thanks in such a shrill chirp that marjorie woke up laughed and fell to work again she was just finishing when a voice called out from the lane  hi there come here a minute child and looking up she saw a little old man in a queer little carriage drawn by a fat little pony  running down to the gate marjorie dropped a curtsy saying pleasantly  what did you wish sir  just undo that checkrein for me i am lame and jack wants to drink at your brook answered the old man nodding at her till his spectacles danced on his nose  marjorie was rather afraid of the fat pony who tossed his head whisked his tail and stamped his feet as if he was of a peppery temper but she liked to be useful and just then felt as if there were few things she could not do if she tried because it was her birthday so she proudly let down the rein and when jack went splashing into the brook she stood on the bridge waiting to check him up again after he had drunk his fill of the clear cool water  the old gentleman sat in his place looking up at the little girl who was smiling to herself as she watched the blue dragonflies dance among the ferns a blackbird tilt on the alderboughs and listened to the babble of the brook  how old are you child asked the old man as if he rather envied this rosy creature her youth and health  twelve today sir and marjorie stood up straight and tall as if mindful of her years  had any presents asked the old man peering up with an odd smile  one sirhere it is and she pulled out of her pocket a tin savingsbank in the shape of a desirable family mansion painted red with a green door and black chimney proudly displaying it on the rude railing of the bridge she added with a happy face  granny gave it to me and all the money in it is going to be mine  how much have you got asked the old gentleman who appeared to like to sit there in the middle of the brook while jack bathed his feet and leisurely gurgled and sneezed  not a penny yet but im going to earn some answered marjorie patting the little bank with an air of resolution pretty to see  how will you do it continued the inquisitive old man  oh im going to pick berries and dig dandelions and weed and drive cows and do chores it is vacation and i can work all the time and earn ever so much  but vacation is playtimehow about that  why that sort of work is play and i get bits of fun all along i always have a good swing when i go for the cows and pick flowers with the dandelions weeding isnt so nice but berrying is very pleasant and we have good times all together  what shall you do with your money when you get it  oh lots of things buy books and clothes for school and if i get a great deal give some to granny id love to do that for she takes care of me and id be so proud to help her  good little lass said the old gentleman as he put his hand in his pocket would you now he added apparently addressing himself to a large frog who sat upon a stone looking so wise and grandfatherly that it really did seem quite proper to consult him at all events he gave his opinion in the most decided manner for with a loud croak he turned an undignified somersault into the brook splashing up the water at a great rate well perhaps it wouldnt be best on the whole industry is a good teacher and money cannot buy happiness as i know to my sorrow  the old gentleman still seemed to be talking to the frog and as he spoke he took his hand out of his pocket with less in it than he had at first intended  what a very queer person thought marjorie for she had not heard a word and wondered what he was thinking about down there  jack walked out of the brook just then and she ran to check him up not an easy task for little hands as he preferred to nibble the grass on the bank but she did it cleverly smoothed the ruffled mane and dropping another curtsy stood aside to let the little carriage pass  thank you childthank you here is something for your bank and good luck to it  as he spoke the old man laid a bright gold dollar in her hand patted the rosy cheek and vanished in a cloud of dust leaving marjorie so astonished at the grandeur of the gift that she stood looking at it as if it had been a fortune it was to her and visions of pink calico gowns new grammars and fresh hatribbons danced through her head in delightful confusion as her eyes rested on the shining coin in her palm  then with a solemn air she invested her first money by popping it down the chimney of the scarlet mansion and peeping in with one eye to see if it landed safely on the groundfloor this done she took a long breath and looked over the railing to be sure it was not all a dream no the wheel marks were still there the brown water was not yet clear and if a witness was needed there sat the big frog again looking so like the old gentleman with his bottlegreen coat speckled trousers and twinkling eyes that marjorie burst out laughing and clapped her hands saying aloud  ill play he was the brownie and this is the goodluck penny he gave me oh what fun and away she skipped rattling the dear new bank like a castanet  when she had told granny all about it she got knife and basket and went out to dig dandelions for the desire to increase her fortune was so strong she could not rest a minute up and down she went so busily peering and digging that she never lifted up her eyes till something like a great white bird skimmed by so low she could not help seeing it a pleasant laugh sounded behind her as she started up and looking round she nearly sat down again in sheer surprise for there close by was a slender little lady comfortably established under a big umbrella  if there were any fairies id be sure that was one thought marjorie staring with all her might for her mind was still full of the old story and curious things do happen on birthdays as every one knows  it really did seem rather elfish to look up suddenly and see a lovely lady all in white with shining hair and a wand in her hand sitting under what looked very like a large yellow mushroom in the middle of a meadow where till now nothing but cows and grasshoppers had been seen before marjorie could decide the question the pleasant laugh came again and the stranger said pointing to the white thing that was still fluttering over the grass like a little cloud  would you kindly catch my hat for me before it blows quite away  down went basket and knife and away ran marjorie entirely satisfied now that there was no magic about the newcomer for if she had been an elf couldnt she have got her hat without any help from a mortal child presently however it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched for it led the nimblefooted marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder the grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up and every oxeye daisy did its best to catch the runaway but failed entirely for the wind liked a game of romps and had it that day as she ran marjorie heard the lady singing like the princess in the story of the goosegirl      blow breezes blow      let curdkins hat go      blow breezes blow      let him after it go      oer hills dales and rocks           away be it whirled      till the silvery locks           are all combed and curled  this made her laugh so that she tumbled into a cloverbed and lay there a minute to get her breath just then as if the playful wind repented of its frolic the long veil fastened to the hat caught in a blackberryvine near by and held the truant fast till marjorie secured it  now come and see what i am doing said the lady when she had thanked the child  marjorie drew near confidingly and looked down at the widespread book before her she gave a start and laughed out with surprise and delight for there was a lovely picture of her own little home and her own little self on the doorstep all so delicate and beautiful and true it seemed as if done by magic  oh how pretty there is rover and kitty and the robins and me how could you ever do it maam said marjorie with a wondering glance at the long paintbrush which had wrought what seemed a miracle to her childish eyes  ill show you presently but tell me first if it looks quite right and natural to you children sometimes spy out faults that no one else can see answered the lady evidently pleased with the artless praise her work received  it looks just like our house only more beautiful perhaps that is because i know how shabby it really is that moss looks lovely on the shingles but the roof leaks the porch is broken only the roses hide the place and my gown is all faded though it once was as bright as you have made it i wish the house and everything would stay pretty forever as they will in the picture  while marjorie spoke the lady had been adding more color to the sketch and when she looked up something warmer and brighter than sunshine shone in her face as she said so cheerily it was like a birds song to hear her  it cant be summer always dear but we can make fair weather for ourselves if we try the moss the roses and soft shadows show the little house and the little girl at their best and that is what we all should do for it is amazing how lovely common things become if one only knows how to look at them  i wish i did said marjorie half to herself remembering how often she was discontented and how hard it was to get on sometimes  so do i said the lady in her happy voice just believe that there is a sunny side to everything and try to find it and you will be surprised to see how bright the world will seem and how cheerful you will be able to keep your little self  i guess granny has found that out for she never frets i do but im going to stop it because im twelve today and that is too old for such things said marjorie recollecting the good resolutions she had made that morning when she woke  i am twice twelve and not entirely cured yet but i try and dont mean to wear blue spectacles if i can help it answered the lady laughing so blithely that marjorie was sure she would not have to try much longer birthdays were made for presents and i should like to give you one would it please you to have this little picture she added lifting it out of the book  truly my own oh yes indeed cried marjorie coloring with pleasure for she had never owned so beautiful a thing before  then you shall have it dear hang it where you can see it often and when you look remember that it is the sunny side of home and help to keep it so  marjorie had nothing but a kiss to offer by way of thanks as the lovely sketch was put into her hand but the giver seemed quite satisfied for it was a very grateful little kiss then the child took up her basket and went away not dancing and singing now but slowly and silently for this gift made her thoughtful as well as glad as she climbed the wall she looked back to nod goodby to the pretty lady but the meadow was empty and all she saw was the grass blowing in the wind  now deary run out and play for birthdays come but once a year and we must make them as merry as we can said granny as she settled herself for her afternoon nap when the saturday cleaning was all done and the little house as neat as wax  so marjorie put on a white apron in honor of the occasion and taking kitty in her arms went out to enjoy herself three swings on the gate seemed to be a good way of beginning the festivities but she only got two for when the gate creaked back the second time it stayed shut and marjorie hung over the pickets arrested by the sound of music  its soldiers she said as the fife and drum drew nearer and flags were seen waving over the barberrybushes at the corner  no its a picnic she added in a moment for she saw hats with wreaths about them bobbing up and down as a gaylytrimmed haycart full of children came rumbling down the lane  what a nice time they are going to have thought marjorie sadly contrasting that merrymaking with the quiet party she was having all by herself  suddenly her face shone and kitty was waved over her head like a banner as she flew out of the gate crying rapturously  its billy and i know hes come for me  it certainly was billy proudly driving the old horse and beaming at his little friend from the bower of flags and chestnutboughs where he sat in state with a crown of daisies on his sailorhat and a spray of blooming sweetbrier in his hand waving his rustic sceptre he led off the shout of happy birthday marjorie which was set up as the wagon stopped at the gate and the green boughs suddenly blossomed with familiar faces all smiling on the little damsel who stood in the lane quite overpowered with delight  its a sprise party cried one small lad tumbling out behind  we are going up the mountain to have fun added a chorus of voices as a dozen hands beckoned wildly  we got it up on purpose for you so tie your hat and come away said a pretty girl leaning down to kiss marjorie who had dropped kitty and stood ready for any splendid enterprise  a word to granny and away went the happy child sitting up beside billy under the flags that waved over a happier load than any royal chariot ever bore  it would be vain to try and tell all the plays and pleasures of happy children on a saturday afternoon but we may briefly say that marjorie found a mossy stone all ready for her throne and billy crowned her with a garland like his own that a fine banquet was spread and eaten with a relish many a lord mayors feast has lacked then how the whole court danced and played together afterward the lords climbed trees and turned somersaults the ladies gathered flowers and told secrets under the sweetfernbushes the queen lost her shoe jumping over the waterfall and the king paddled into the pool below and rescued it a happy little kingdom full of summer sunshine innocent delights and loyal hearts for love ruled and the only war that disturbed the peaceful land was waged by the mosquitoes as night came on  marjorie stood on her throne watching the sunset while her maids of honor packed up the remains of the banquet and her knights prepared the chariot all the sky was gold and purple all the world bathed in a soft red light and the little girl was very happy as she looked down at the subjects who had served her so faithfully that day  have you had a good time marjy asked king william who stood below with his royal nose on a level with her majestys two dusty little shoes  oh billy it has been just splendid but i dont see why you should all be so kind to me answered marjorie with such a look of innocent wonder that billy laughed to see it  because you are so sweet and good we cant help loving youthats why he said as if this simple fact was reason enough  im going to be the best girl that ever was and love everybody in the world cried the child stretching out her arms as if ready in the fulness of her happy heart to embrace all creation  dont turn into an angel and fly away just yet but come home or granny will never lend you to us any more  with that billy jumped her down and away they ran to ride gayly back through the twilight singing like a flock of nightingales  as she went to bed that night marjorie looked at the red bank the pretty picture and the daisy crown saying to herself  it has been a very nice birthday and i am something like the girl in the story after all for the old man gave me a goodluck penny the kind lady told me how to keep happy and billy came for me like the prince the girl didnt go back to the poor house again but im glad i did for my granny isnt a cross one and my little home is the dearest in the world  then she tied her nightcap said her prayers and fell asleep but the moon looking in to kiss the blooming face upon the pillow knew that three good spirits had come to help little marjorie from that day forth and their names were industry cheerfulness and love      roses and forgetmenots     i roses   it was a cold november storm and everything looked forlorn even the pert sparrows were draggletailed and too much out of spirits to fight for crumbs with the fat pigeons who tripped through the mud with their little red boots as if in haste to get back to their cosy home in the dovecot  but the most forlorn creature out that day was a small errand girl with a bonnetbox on each arm and both hands struggling to hold a big broken umbrella a pair of wornout boots let in the wet upon her tired feet a thin cotton dress and an old shawl poorly protected her from the storm and a faded hood covered her head  the face that looked out from this hood was too pale and anxious for one so young and when a sudden gust turned the old umbrella inside out with a crash despair fell upon poor lizzie and she was so miserable she could have sat down in the rain and cried  but there was no time for tears so dragging the dilapidated umbrella along she spread her shawl over the bonnetboxes and hurried down the broad street eager to hide her misfortunes from a pretty young girl who stood at a window laughing at her  she could not find the number of the house where one of the fine hats was to be left and after hunting all down one side of the street she crossed over and came at last to the very house where the pretty girl lived she was no longer to be seen and with a sigh of relief lizzie rang the bell and was told to wait in the hall while miss belle tried the hat on  glad to rest she warmed her feet righted her umbrella and then sat looking about her with eyes quick to see the beauty and the comfort that made the place so homelike and delightful a small waitingroom opened from the hall and in it stood many blooming plants whose fragrance attracted lizzie as irresistibly as if she had been a butterfly or bee  slipping in she stood enjoying the lovely colors sweet odors and delicate shapes of these household spirits for lizzie loved flowers passionately and just then they possessed a peculiar charm for her  one particularly captivating little rose won her heart and made her long for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong to resist it was so perfect so like a rosy face smiling out from the green leaves that lizzie could not keep her hands off it and having smelt touched and kissed it she suddenly broke the stem and hid it in her pocket then frightened at what she had done she crept back to her place in the hall and sat there burdened with remorse  a servant came just then to lead her upstairs for miss belle wished the hat altered and must give directions with her heart in a flutter and pinker roses in her cheeks than the one in her pocket lizzie followed to a handsome room where a pretty girl stood before a long mirror with the hat in her hand  tell madame tifany that i dont like it at all for she hasnt put in the blue plume mamma ordered and i wont have rosebuds they are so common said the young lady in a dissatisfied tone as she twirled the hat about  yes miss was all lizzie could say for she considered that hat the loveliest thing a girl could possibly own  you had better ask your mamma about it miss belle before you give any orders she will be up in a few moments and the girl can wait put in a maid who was sewing in the anteroom  i suppose i must but i wont have roses answered belle crossly then she glanced at lizzie and said more gently you look very cold come and sit by the fire while you wait  im afraid ill wet the pretty rug miss my feet are sopping said lizzie gratefully but timidly  so they are why didnt you wear rubber boots  i havent got any  ill give you mine then for i hate them and as i never go out in wet weather they are of no earthly use to me marie bring them here i shall be glad to get rid of them and im sure theyll be useful to you  oh thank you miss id like em ever so much for im out in the rain half the time and get bad colds because my boots are old said lizzie smiling brightly at the thought of the welcome gift  i should think your mother would get you warmer things began belle who found something rather interesting in the shabby girl with shy bright eyes and curly hair bursting out of the old hood  i havent got any mother said lizzie with a pathetic glance at her poor clothes  im so sorry have you brothers and sisters asked belle hoping to find something pleasant to talk about for she was a kind little soul  no miss ive got no folks at all  oh dear how sad why who takes care of you cried belle looking quite distressed  no one i take care of myself i work for madame and she pays me a dollar a week i stay with mrs brown and chore round to pay for my keep my dollar dont get many clothes so i cant be as neat as id like and the forlorn look came back to poor lizzies face  belle said nothing but sat among the sofa cushions where she had thrown herself looking soberly at this other girl no older than she was who took care of herself and was all alone in the world it was a new idea to belle who was loved and petted as an only child is apt to be she often saw beggars and pitied them but knew very little about their wants and lives so it was like turning a new page in her happy life to be brought so near to poverty as this chance meeting with the milliners girl  arent you afraid and lonely and unhappy she said slowly trying to understand and put herself in lizzies place  yes but its no use i cant help it and may be things will get better by and by and ill have my wish answered lizzie more hopefully because belles pity warmed her heart and made her troubles seem lighter  what is your wish asked belle hoping mamma wouldnt come just yet for she was getting interested in the stranger  to have a nice little room and make flowers like a french girl i know its such pretty work and she gets lots of money for every one likes her flowers she shows me how sometimes and i can do leaves firstrate but  there lizzie stopped suddenly and the color rushed up to her forehead for she remembered the little rose in her pocket and it weighed upon her conscience like a stone  before belle could ask what was the matter marie came in with a tray of cake and fruit saying  heres your lunch miss belle  put it down please im not ready for it yet  and belle shook her head as she glanced at lizzie who was staring hard at the fire with such a troubled face that belle could not bear to see it  jumping out of her nest of cushions she heaped a plate with good things and going to lizzie offered it saying with a gentle courtesy that made the act doubly sweet  please have some you must be tired of waiting  but lizzie could not take it she could only cover her face and cry for this kindness rent her heart and made the stolen flower a burden too heavy to be borne  oh dont cry so are you sick have i been rude tell me all about it and if i cant do anything mamma can said belle surprised and troubled  no im not sick im bad and i cant bear it when you are so good to me sobbed lizzie quite overcome with penitence and taking out the crumpled rose she confessed her fault with many tears  dont feel so much about such a little thing as that began belle warmly then checked herself and added more soberly it was wrong to take it without leave but its all right now and ill give you as many roses as you want for i know you are a good girl  thank you i didnt want it only because it was pretty but i wanted to copy it i cant get any for myself and so i cant do my makebelieve ones well madame wont even lend me the old ones in the store and estelle has none to spare for me because i cant pay her for teaching me she gives me bits of muslin and wire and things and shows me now and then but i know if i had a real flower i could copy it so shed see i did know something for i try real hard im so tired of slopping round the streets id do anything to earn my living some other way  lizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly and the little story was quite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks the poor clothes and the thin hands that held the stolen rose belle was much touched and in her impetuous way set about mending matters as fast as possible  put on those boots and that pair of dry stockings right away then tuck as much cake and fruit into your pocket as it will hold im going to get you some flowers and see if mamma is too busy to attend to me  with a nod and a smile belle flew about the room a minute then vanished leaving lizzie to her comfortable task feeling as if fairies still haunted the world as in the good old times  when belle came back with a handful of roses she found lizzie absorbed in admiring contemplation of her new boots as she ate spongecake in a blissful sort of wakingdream  mamma cant come but i dont care about the hat it will do very well and isnt worth fussing about there will those be of any use to you and she offered the nosegay with a much happier face than the one lizzie first saw  oh miss theyre just lovely ill copy that pink rose as soon as ever i can and when ive learned how to do em tiptop id like to bring you some if you dont mind answered lizzie smiling all over her face as she buried her nose luxuriously in the fragrant mass  id like it very much for i should think youd have to be very clever to make such pretty things i really quite fancy those rosebuds in my hat now i know that youre going to learn how to make them put an orange in your pocket and the flowers in water as soon as you can so theyll be fresh when you want them goodby bring home our hats every time and tell me how you get on  with kind words like these belle dismissed lizzie who ran downstairs feeling as rich as if she had found a fortune away to the next place she hurried anxious to get her errands done and the precious posy safely into fresh water but mrs turretviile was not at home and the bonnet could not be left till paid for so lizzie turned to go down the high steps glad that she need not wait she stopped one instant to take a delicious sniff at her flowers and that was the last happy moment that poor lizzie knew for many weary months  the new boots were large for her the steps slippery with sleet and down went the little errand girl from top to bottom till she landed in the gutter directly upon mrs turretvilles costly bonnet  ive saved my posies anyway sighed lizzie as she picked herself up bruised wet and faint with pain but oh my heart wont madame scold when she sees that bandbox smashed flat groaned the poor child sitting on the curbstone to get her breath and view the disaster  the rain poured the wind blew the sparrows on the park railing chirped derisively and no one came along to help lizzie out of her troubles slowly she gathered up her burdens painfully she limped away in the big boots and the last the naughty sparrows saw of her was a shabby little figure going round the corner with a pale tearful face held lovingly over the bright bouquet that was her one treasure and her only comfort in the moment which brought to her the great misfortune of her life     ii forgetmenots   oh mamma i am so relieved that the box has come at last if it had not i do believe i should have died of disappointment cried pretty belle five years later on the morning before her eighteenth birthday  it would have been a serious disappointment darling for i had sot my heart on your wearing my gift tomorrow night and when the steamers kept coming in without my trunk from paris i was very anxious i hope you will like it  dear mamma i know i shall like it your taste is so good and you know what suits me so well make haste marie im dying to see it said belle dancing about the great trunk as the maid carefully unfolded tissue papers and muslin wrappers  a young girls first balldress is a grand affairin her eyes at least and belle soon stopped dancing to stand with clasped hands eager eyes and parted lips before the snowy pile of illusion that was at last daintily lifted out upon the bed then as marie displayed its loveliness little cries of delight were heard and when the whole delicate dress was arranged to the best effect she threw herself upon her mothers neck and actually cried with pleasure  mamma it is too lovely i and you are very kind to do so much for me how shall i ever thank you  by putting it right on to see if it fits and when you wear it look your happiest that i may be proud of my pretty daughter  mamma got no further for marie uttered a french shriek wrung her hands and then began to burrow wildly in the trunk and among the papers crying distractedly  great heavens madame the wreath has been forgotten what an affliction mademoiselles enchanting toilette is destroyed without the wreath and nowhere do i find it  in vain they searched in vain marie wailed and belle declared it must be somewhere no wreath appeared it was duly set down in the bill and a fine sum charged for a headdress to match the dainty forgetmenots that looped the fleecy skirts and ornamented the bosom of the dress it had evidently been forgotten and mamma despatched marie at once to try and match the flowers for belle would not hear of any other decoration for her beautiful blonde hair  the dress fitted to a charm and was pronounced by all beholders the loveliest thing ever seen nothing was wanted but the wreath to make it quite perfect and when marie returned after a long search with no forgetmenots belle was in despair  wear natural ones suggested a sympathizing friend  but another hunt among greenhouses was as fruitless as that among the milliners rooms no forgetmenots could be found and marie fell exhausted into a chair desolated at what she felt to be an awful calamity  let me have the carriage and ill ransack the city till i find some cried belle growing more resolute with each failure  marnma was deep in preparations for the ball and could not help her afflicted daughter though she was much disappointed at the mishap so belle drove off resolved to have her flowers whether there were any or not  any one who has ever tried to match a ribbon find a certain fabric or get anything done in a hurry knows what a wearisome task it sometimes is and can imagine belles state of mind after repeated disappointments she was about to give up in despair when some one suggested that perhaps the frenchwoman estelle valnor might make the desired wreath if there was time  away drove belle and on entering the room gave a sigh of satisfaction for a whole boxful of the loveliest forgetmenots stood upon the table as fast as possible she told her tale and demanded the flowers no matter what the price might be imagine her feelings when the frenchwoman with a shrug announced that it was impossible to give mademoiselle a single spray all were engaged to trim a bridesmaids dress and must be sent away at once  it really was too bad and belle lost her temper entirely for no persuasion or bribes would win a spray from estelle the provoking part of it was that the wedding would not come off for several days and there was time enough to make more flowers for that dress since belle only wanted a few for her hair neither would estelle make her any as her hands were full and so small an order was not worth deranging ones self for but observing belles sorrowful face she said affably  mademoiselle may perhaps find the flowers she desires at miss bertons she has been helping me with these garlands and may have some left here is her address  belle took the card with thanks and hurried away with a last hope faintly stirring in her girlish heart for belle had an unusually ardent wish to look her best at this party since somebody was to be there and somebody considered forgetmenots the sweetest flowers in the world mamma knew this and the kiss belle gave her when the dress came had a more tender meaning than gratified vanity or daughterly love  up many stairs she climbed and came at last to a little room very poor but very neat where at the one window sat a young girl with crutches by her side and her lap full of flowerleaves and petals she rose slowly as belle came in and then stood looking at her with such a wistful expression in her shy bright eyes that belles anxious face cleared involuntarily and her voice lost its impatient tone  as she spoke she glanced about the room hoping to see some blue blossoms awaiting her but none appeared and she was about to despond again when the girl said gently  i have none by me now but i may be able to find you some  thank you very much but i have been everywhere in vain still if you do get any please send them to me as soon as possible here is my card  miss berton glanced at it then cast a quick look at the sweet anxious face before her and smiled so brightly that belle smiled also and asked wonderingly  what is it what do you see  i see the dear young lady who was so kind to me long ago you dont remember me and never knew my name but i never have forgotten you all these years i always hoped i could do something to show how grateful i was and now i can for you shall have your flowers if i sit up all night to make them  but belle still shook her head and watched the smiling face before her with wondering eyes till the girl added with sudden color in her cheeks  ah youve done so many kind things in your life you dont remember the little errand girl from madame tifanys who stole a rose in your hall and how you gave her rubber boots and cake and flowers and were so good to her she couldnt forget it if she lived to be a hundred  but you are so changed began belle who did faintly recollect that little incident in her happy life  yes i had a fall and hurt myself so that i shall always be lame  and lizzie went on to tell how madame had dismissed her in a rage how she lay ill till mrs brown sent her to the hospital and how for a year she had suffered much alone in that great house of pain before one of the kind visitors had befriended her  while hearing the story of the five years that had been so full of pleasure ease and love for herself belle forgot her errand and sitting beside lizzie listened with pitying eyes to all she told of her endeavors to support herself by the delicate handiwork she loved  im very happy now ended lizzie looking about the little bare room with a face full of the sweetest content i get nearly work enough to pay my way and estelle sends me some when she has more than she can do ive learned to do it nicely and it is so pleasant to sit here and make flowers instead of trudging about in the wet with other peoples hats though i do sometimes wish i was able to trudge one gets on so slowly with crutches  a little sigh followed the words and belle put her own plump hand on the delicate one that held the crutch saying in her cordial young voice  ill come and take you to drive sometimes for you are too pale and youll get ill sitting here at work day after day please let me id love to for i feel so idle and wicked when i see busy people like you that i reproach myself for neglecting my duty and having more than my share of happiness  lizzie thanked her with a look and then said in a tone of interest that was delightful to hear  tell about the wreath you want i should so love to do it for you if i can  belle had forgotten all about it in listening to this sad little story of a girls life now she felt half ashamed to talk of so frivolous a matter till she remembered that it would help lizzie and resolving to pay for it as never garland was paid for before she entered upon the subject with renewed interest  you shall have the flowers in time for your ball tomorrow night i will engage to make a wreath that will please you only it may take longer than i think dont be troubled if i dont send it till evening it will surely come in time i can work fast and this will be the happiest job i ever did said lizzie beginning to lay out mysterious little tools and bend delicate wires  you are altogether too grateful for the little i have done it makes me feel ashamed to think i did not find you out before and do something better worth thanks  ah it wasnt the boots or the cake or the roses dear miss belle it was the kind looks the gentle words the way it was done that went right to my heart and did me more good than a million of money i never stole a pin after that day for the little rose wouldnt let me forget how you forgave me so sweetly i sometimes think it kept me from greater temptations for i was a poor forlorn child with no one to keep me good  pretty belle looked prettier than ever as she listened and a bright tear stood in either eye like a drop of dew on a blue flower it touched her very much to learn that her little act of childish charity had been so sweet and helpful to this lonely girl and now lived so freshly in her grateful memory it showed her suddenly how precious little deeds of love and sympathy are how strong to bless how easy to perform how comfortable to recall her heart was very full and tender just then and the lesson sunk deep into it never to be forgotten  she sat a long time watching flowers bud and blossom under lizzies skilful fingers and then hurried home to tell all her glad news to mamma  if the next day had not been full of most delightfully exciting events belle might have felt some anxiety about her wreath for hour after hour went by and nothing arrived from lizzie  evening came and all was ready belle was dressed and looked so lovely that mamma declared she needed nothing more but marie insisted that the grand effect would be ruined without the garland among the sunshiny hair belle had time now to be anxious and waited with growing impatience for the finishing touch to her charming toilette  i must be downstairs to receive and cant wait another moment so put in the blue pompon and let me go she said at last with a sigh of disappointment for the desire to look beautiful that night in somebodys eyes had increased fourfold  with a tragic gesture marie was about to adjust the pompon when the quick tap of a crutch came down the hall and lizzie hurried in flushed and breathless but smiling happily as she uncovered the box she carried with a look of proud satisfaction  a general ah of admiration arose as belle mamma and marie surveyed the lovely wreath that lay before them and when it was carefully arranged on the bright head that was to wear it belle blushed with pleasure mamma said it is more beautiful than any paris could have sent us and marie clasped her hands theatrically sighing with her head on one side  truly yes mademoiselle is now adorable  i am so glad you like it i did my very best and worked all night but i had to beg one spray from estelle or with all my haste i could not have finished in time said lizzie refreshing her weary eyes with a long affectionate gaze at the pretty figure before her  a fold of the airy skirt was caught on one of the blue clusters and lizzie knelt down to arrange it as she spoke belle leaned toward her and said softly money alone cant pay you for this kindness so tell me how i can best serve you this is the happiest night of my life and i want to make every one feel glad also  then dont talk of paying me but promise that i may make the flowers you wear on your weddingday whispered lizzie kissing the kind hand held out to help her rise for on it she saw a brilliant ring and in the blooming blushing face bent over her she read the tender little story that somebody had told belle that day  so you shall and ill keep this wreath all my life for your sake dear answered belle as her full heart bubbled over with pitying affection for the poor girl who would never make a bridal garland for herself  belle kept her word even when she was in a happy home of her own for out of the dead roses bloomed a friendship that brightened lizzies life and long after the blue garland was faded belle remembered the helpful little lesson that taught her to read the faces poverty touches with a pathetic eloquence which says to those who look forgetmenot
