10421872	a son of the gods  and  a horseman in the sky    by ambrose bierce   including an introduction by w c morrow   western classics no four   the photogravure frontispiece after a painting by will jenkins      the introduction   brilliant and magnetic as are these two studies by ambrose bierce and especially significant as coming from one who was a boy soldier in the civil war they merely reflect one side of his original and manyfaceted genius poet critic satirist funmaker incomparable writer of fables and masterly prose sketches a seer of startling insight a reasoner mercilessly logical with the delicate wit and keenness of an irving or an addison the dramatic quality of a hugoall of these and still in the prime of his powers yet so restricted has been his output and so little exploited that only the judicious few have been impressed  although an american he formed his bent years ago in london where he was associated with the younger hood on fun there he laid the foundation for that reputation which he today enjoys the distinction of being the last of the scholarly satirists with that training he came to san francisco where in an environment equally as genial his talent grew and mellowed through the years then he was summoned to new york to assist a newspaper fight against a great railroad since the conclusion of which brilliant campaign eastern journalism and magazine work have claimed his attention  two volumes the fiends delight and cobwebs from an empty skull titles that would damn modern bookswere collections published years ago from his work on london fun their appearance made him at once the chief wit and humorist of england and combined with his satirical work on fun led to his engagement by friends of the exiled eug√©nie to conduct a periodical against her enemies who purposed to make her refuge in england untenable by means of newspaper attacks it is easy to imagine the zest with which the chivalrous bierce plunged into preparations for the fight but the struggle never came it was sufficient to learn that bierce would be the richmond the attack upon the stricken exempress was abandoned  when he was urged in san francisco years afterward to write more of the inimitable things that filled those two volumes he said that it was only fun a boys work only fun there has never been such delicious fun since the beginning of literature and there is nothing better than fun yet it held his own peculiar quality which is not that of american funquality of a brilliant intellectuality the keenness of a rapier a teasing subtlety a contempt for pharisaism and squeamishness and above all a fine philosophy while he has never lost his sense of the whimsical the grotesque the unusual heunfortunately perhapscame oftener to give it the form of pure wit rather than of cajoling humor few americans know him as a humorist because his humor is not built on the broad rough lines that are typically american it belongs to an older civilization yet it is jollier than the english and bolder than the french  at all times his incomparable wit and satire has appealed rather to the cultured and even the emotional quality of his fiction is frequently so profound and unusual as to be fully enjoyed only by the intellectually untrammelled his writing was never for those who could only read and feel not think  another factor against his wider acceptance has been the infrequency and fragmentary character of his work particularly his satire no sustained fort in that field has come from him his satire was born largely of a transient stimulus and was evanescent even his short stories are generally but blinding flashes of a moment in a life he laughingly ascribes the meagerness of his output to indolence but there may be a deeper reason of which he is unconscious what is more dampening than a seeming lack of appreciation tales of soldiers and civilians had a disheartening search for an established publisher and finally was brought out by an admiring merchant of san francisco it attracted so much critical attention that its republication was soon undertaken by a regular house  had bierce never produced anything but these prose tales his right to a place high in american letters would nevertheless be secure and of all his work serious or otherwise here is his greatest claim to popular and permanent recognition no stories for which the civil war has furnished such dramatic setting surpass these masterpieces of short fiction either in power of description subtlety of touch or literary finish it is deeply to be regretted that he has not given us more such prose  w c morrow      a son of the gods   a breezy day and a sunny landscape an open country to right and left and forward behind a wood in the edge of this wood facing the open but not venturing into it long lines of troops halted the wood is alive with them and full of confused noises the occasional rattle of wheels as a battery of artillery goes into position to cover the advance the hum and murmur of the soldiers talking a sound of innumerable feet in the dry leaves that strew the interspaces among the trees hoarse commands of officers detached groups of horsemen are well in frontnot altogether exposedmany of them intently regarding the crest of a hill a mile away in the direction of the interrupted advance for this powerful army moving in battle order through a forest has met with a formidable obstaclethe open country the crest of that gentle hill a mile away has a sinister look it says beware along it runs a stone wall extending to left and right a great distance behind the wall is a hedge behind the hedge are seen the tops of trees in rather straggling order among the treeswhat it is necessary to know  yesterday and for many days and nights previously we were fighting somewhere always there was cannonading with occasional keen rattlings of musketry mingled with cheers our own or the enemys we seldom knew attesting some temporary advantage this morning at daybreak the enemy was gone we have moved forward across his earthworks across which we have so often vainly attempted to move before through the debris of his abandoned camps among the graves of his fallen into the woods beyond  how curiously we regarded everything how odd it all seemed nothing appeared quite familiar the most commonplace objectsan old saddle a splintered wheel a forgotten canteen everything related something of the mysterious personality of those strange men who had been killing us the soldier never becomes wholly familiar with the conception of his foes as men like himself he cannot divest himself of the feeling that they are another order of beings differently conditioned in an environment not altogether of the earth the smallest vestiges of them rivet his attention and engage his interest he thinks of them as inaccessible and catching an unexpected glimpse of them they appear farther away and therefore larger than they really arelike objects in a fog he is somewhat in awe of them  from the edge of the wood leading up the acclivity are the tracks of horses and wheelsthe wheels of cannon the yellow grass is beaten down by the feet of infantry clearly they have passed this way in thousands they have not withdrawn by the country roads this is significantit is the difference between retiring and retreating  that group of horsemen is our commander his staff and escort he is facing the distant crest holding his fieldglass against his eyes with both hands his elbows needlessly elevated it is a fashion it seems to dignify the act we are all addicted to it suddenly he lowers the glass and says a few words to those about him two or three aides detach themselves from the group and canter away into the woods along the lines in each direction we did not hear his words but we knew them tell general x to send forward the skirmish line those of us who have been out of place resume our positions the men resting at ease straighten themselves and the ranks are reformed without a command some of us staff officers dismount and look at our saddlegirths those already on the ground remount  galloping rapidly along in the edge of the open ground comes a young officer on a snowwhite horse his saddleblanket is scarlet what a fool no one who has ever been in battle but remembers how naturally every rifle turns toward the man on a white horse no one but has observed how a bit of red enrages the bull of battle that such colors are fashionable in military life must be accepted as the most astonishing of all the phenomena of human vanity they would seem to have been devised to increase the deathrate  this young officer is in full uniform as if on parade he is all agleam with bullion a blueandgold edition of the poetry of war a wave of derisive laughter runs abreast of him all along the line but how handsome he is with what careless grace he sits his horse  he reins up within a respectful distance of the corps commander and salutes the old soldier nods familiarly he evidently knows him a brief colloquy between them is going on the young man seems to be preferring some request which the elder one is indisposed to grant let us ride a little nearer ah too lateit is ended the young officer salutes again wheels his horse and rides straight toward the crest of the hill he is deadly pale  a thin line of skirmishers the men deployed at six paces or so apart now pushes from the wood into the open the commander speaks to his bugler who claps his instrument to his lips tralala tralala the skirmishers halt in their tracks  meantime the young horseman has advanced a hundred yards he is riding at a walk straight up the long slope with never a turn of the head how glorious gods what would we not give to be in his placewith his soul he does not draw his sabre his right hand hangs easily at his side the breeze catches the plume in his hat and flutters it smartly the sunshine rests upon his shoulderstraps lovingly like a visible benediction straight on he rides ten thousand pairs of eyes are fixed upon him with an intensity that he can hardly fail to feel ten thousand hearts keep quick time to the inaudible hoofbeats of his snowy steed he is not alonehe draws all souls after him we are but dead men all but we remember that we laughed on and on straight for the hedgelined wall he rides not a look backward oh if he would but turnif he could but see the love the adoration the atonement  not a word is spoken the populous depths of the forest still murmur with their unseen and unseeing swarm but all along the fringe there is silence absolute the burly commander is an equestrian statue of himself the mounted staff officers their fieldglasses up are motionless all the line of battle in the edge of the wood stands at a new kind of attention each man in the attitude in which he was caught by the consciousness of what is going on all these hardened and impenitent mankillers to whom death in its awfulest forms is a fact familiar to their everyday observation who sleep on hills trembling with the thunder of great guns dine in the midst of streaming missiles and play at cards among the dead faces of their dearest friendsall are watching with suspended breath and beating hearts the outcome of an act involving the life of one man such is the magnetism of courage and devotion  if now you should turn your head you would see a simultaneous movement among the spectators a start as if they had received an electric shockand looking forward again to the now distant horseman you would see that he has in that instant altered his direction and is riding at an angle to his former course the spectators suppose the sudden deflection to be caused by a shot perhaps a wound but take this fieldglass and you will observe that he is riding toward a break in the wall and hedge he means if not killed to ride through and overlook the country beyond  you are not to forget the nature of this mans act it is not permitted to you to think of it as an instance of bravado nor on the other hand a needless sacrifice of self if the enemy has not retreated he is in force on that ridge the investigator will encounter nothing less than a line of battle there is no need of pickets videttes skirmishers to give warning of our approach our attacking lines will be visible conspicuous exposed to an artillery fire that will shave the ground the moment they break from cover and for half the distance to a sheet of rifle bullets in which nothing can live in short if the enemy is there it would be madness to attack him in front he must be maneuvered out by the immemorial plan of threatening his line of communication as necessary to his existence as to the diver at the bottom of the sea his airtube but how ascertain if the enemy is there there is but one way somebody must go and see the natural and customary thing to do is to send forward a line of skirmishers but in this case they will answer in the affirmative with all their lives the enemy crouching in double ranks behind the stone wall and in cover of the hedge will wait until it is possible to count each assailants teeth at the first volley a half of the questioning line will fall the other half before it can accomplish the predestined retreat what a price to pay for gratified curiosity at what a dear rate an army must sometimes purchase knowledge let me pay all says this gallant manthis military christ  there is no hope except the hope against hope that the crest is clear true he might prefer capture to death so long as he advances the line will not firewhy should it he can safely ride into the hostile ranks and become a prisoner of war but this would defeat his object it would not answer our question it is necessary either that he return unharmed or be shot to death before our eyes only so shall we know how to act if capturedwhy that might have been done by a halfdozen stragglers  now begins an extraordinary contest of intellect between a man and an army our horseman now within a quarter of a mile of the crest suddenly wheels to the left and gallops in a direction parallel to it he has caught sight of his antagonist he knows all some slight advantage of ground has enabled him to overlook a part of the line if he were here he could tell us in words but that is now hopeless he must make the best use of the few minutes of life remaining to him by compelling the enemy himself to tell us as much and as plainly as possiblewhich naturally that discreet power is reluctant to do not a rifleman in those crouching ranks not a cannoneer at those masked and shotted guns but knows the needs of the situation the imperative duty of forbearance besides there has been time enough to forbid them all to fire true a single rifleshot might drop him and be no great disclosure but firing is infectiousand see how rapidly he moves with never a pause except as he whirls his horse about to take a new direction never directly backward toward us never directly forward toward his executioners all this is visible through the glass it seems occurring within pistolshot we see all but the enemy whose presence whose thoughts whose motives we infer to the unaided eye there is nothing but a black figure on a white horse tracing slow zigzags against the slope of a distant hillso slowly they seem almost to creep  nowthe glass againhe has tired of his failure or sees his error or has gone mad he is dashing directly forward at the wall as if to take it at a leap hedge and all one moment only and he wheels right about and is speeding like the wind straight down the slopetoward his friends toward his death instantly the wall is topped with a fierce roll of smoke for a distance of hundreds of yards to right and left this is as instantly dissipated by the wind and before the rattle of the rifles reaches us he is down no he recovers his seat he has but pulled his horse upon its haunches they are up and away a tremendous cheer bursts from our ranks relieving the insupportable tension of our feelings and the horse and its rider yes they are up and away away indeedthey are making directly to our left parallel to the now steadily blazing and smoking wall the rattle of the musketry is continuous and every bullets target is that courageous heart  suddenly a great bank of white smoke pushes upward from behind the wall another and anothera dozen roll up before the thunder of the explosions and the humming of the missiles reach our ears and the missiles themselves come bounding through clouds of dust into our covert knocking over here and there a man and causing a temporary distraction a passing thought of self  the dust drifts away incrediblethat enchanted horse and rider have passed a ravine and are climbing another slope to unveil another conspiracy of silence to thwart the will of another armed host another moment and that crest too is in eruption the horse rears and strikes the air with its forefeet they are down at last but look againthe man has detached himself from the dead animal he stands erect motionless holding his sabre in his right hand straight above his head his face is toward us now he lowers his hand to a level with his face and moves it outward the blade of the sabre describing a downward curve it is a sign to us to the world to posterity it is a heros salute to death and history  again the spell is broken our men attempt to cheer they are choking with emotion they utter hoarse discordant cries they clutch their weapons and press tumultuously forward into the open the skirmishers without orders against orders are going forward at a keen run like hounds unleashed our cannon speak and the enemys now open in full chorus to right and left as far as we can see the distant crest seeming now so near erects its towers of cloud and the great shot pitch roaring down among our moving masses flag after flag of ours emerges from the wood line after line sweeps forth catching the sunlight on its burnished arms the rear battalions alone are in obedience they preserve their proper distance from the insurgent front  the commander has not moved he now removes his fieldglass from his eyes and glances to the right and left he sees the human current flowing on either side of him and his huddled escort like tide waves parted by a rock not a sign of feeling in his face he is thinking again he directs his eyes forward they slowly traverse that malign and awful crest he addresses a calm word to his bugler tralala tralala the injunction has an imperiousness which enforces it it is repeated by all the bugles of all the subordinate commanders the sharp metallic notes assert themselves above the hum of the advance and penetrate the sound of the cannon to halt is to withdraw the colors move slowly back the lines face about and sullenly follow bearing their wounded the skirmishers return gathering up the dead  ah those many many needless dead that great soul whose beautiful body is lying over yonder so conspicuous against the sere hillsidecould it not have been spared the bitter consciousness of a vain devotion would one exception have marred too much the pitiless perfection of the divine eternal plan      a horseman in the sky   one sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in a clump of laurel by the side of a road in western virginia he lay at full length upon his stomach his feet resting upon the toes his head upon the left forearm his extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle but for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of the cartridgebox at the back of his belt he might have been thought to be dead he was asleep at his post of duty but if detected he would be dead shortly afterward that being the just and legal penalty of his crime  the clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road which after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned sharply to the west running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards there it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest at the salient of that second angle was a large flat rock jutting out northward overlooking the deep valley from which the road ascended the rock capped a high cliff a stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the tops of the pines the angle where the soldier lay was on another spur of the same cliff had he been awake he would have commanded a view not only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock but of the entire profile of the cliff below it it might well have made him giddy to look  the country was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to the northward where there was a small natural meadow through which flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valleys rim this open ground looked hardly larger than an ordinary dooryard but was really several acres in extent its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing forest away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene and through which the road had some how made its climb to the summit the configuration of the valley indeed was such that from this point of observation it seemed entirely shut in and one could not but have wondered how the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it and whence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow two thousand feet below  no country is so wild and difficult but men will make it a theater of war concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rattrap in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved an army to submission lay five regiments of federal infantry they had marched all the previous day and night and were resting at nightfall they would take to the road again climb to the place where their unfaithful sentinel now slept and descending the other slope of the ridge fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight their hope was to surprise it for the road led to the rear of it in case of failure their position would be perilous in the extreme and fail they surely would should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement  the sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young virginian named carter druse he was the son of wealthy parents an only child and had known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of western virginia his home was but a few miles from where he now lay one morning he had risen from the breakfast table and said quietly but gravely father a union regiment has arrived at grafton i am going to join it  the father lifted his leonine head looked at the son a moment in silence and replied well go sir and whatever may occur do what you conceive to be your duty virginia to which you are a traitor must get on without you should we both live to the end of the war we will speak further of the matter your mother as the physician has informed you is in a most critical condition at the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks but that time is precious it would be better not to disturb her  so carter druse bowing reverently to his father who returned the salute with a stately courtesy which masked a breaking heart left the home of his childhood to go soldiering by conscience and courage by deeds of devotion and daring he soon commended himself to his fellows and his officers and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at the extreme outpost nevertheless fatigue had been stronger than resolution and he had fallen asleep what good or bad angel came in a dream to rouse him from his state of crime who shall say without a movement without a sound in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousnesswhispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever have spoken no human memory ever has recalled he quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the laurels instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his rifle  his first feeling was a keen artistic delight on a colossal pedestal the cliffmotionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and sharply outlined against the skywas an equestrian statue of impressive dignity the figure of the man sat the figure of the horse straight and soldierly but with the repose of a grecian god carted in the marble which limits the suggestion of activity the gray costume harmonized with its aerial background the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by the shadow the animals skin had no points of high light a carbine strikingly foreshortened lay across the pommel of the saddle kept in place by the right hand grasping it at the grip the left hand holding the bridle rein was invisible in silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with the sharpness of a cameo it looked across the heights of air to the confronting cliffs beyond the face of the rider turned slightly away showed only an outline of temple and beard he was looking downward to the bottom of the valley magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldiers testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the group appeared of heroic almost colossal size  for an instant druse had a strange halfdefined feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art reared upon that commanding eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part the feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group the horse without moving its feet had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge the man remained immobile as before broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the situation druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes cocked the piece and glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the horsemans breast a touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with carter druse at that instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his concealed foemanseemed to look into his very face into his eyes into his brave compassionate heart  is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in waran enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of ones self and comradesan enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its numbers carter druse grew pale he shook in every limb turned faint and saw the statuesque group before him as black figures rising falling moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky his hand fell away from his weapon his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he lay this courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from intensity of emotion  it was not for long in another moment his face was raised from earth his hands resumed their places on the rifle his forefinger sought the trigger mind heart and eyes were clear conscience and reason sound he could not hope to capture that enemy to alarm him would but send him dashing to his camp with his fatal news the duty of the soldier was plain the man must be shot dead from ambushwithout warning without a moments spiritual preparation with never so much as an unspoken prayer he must be sent to his account but nothere is a hope he may have discovered nothing perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape if permitted he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he came surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing whether he knows it may well be that his fixity of attentiondruse turned his head and looked through the deeps of air downward as from the surface of the bottom of a translucent sea he saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men and horsessome foolish commander was permitting the soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open in plain view from a hundred summits  druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky and again it was through the sights of his rifle but this time his aim was at the horse in his memory as if they were a divine mandate rang the words of his father at their parting whatever may occur do what you conceive to be your duty he was calm now his teeth were firmly but not rigidly closed his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping babesnot a tremor affected any muscle of his body his breathing until suspended in the act of taking aim was regular and slow duty had conquered the spirit had said to the body peace be still he fired  an officer of the federal force who in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge had left the hidden bivouac in the valley and with aimless feet had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff was considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration further at a distance of a quartermile before him but apparently at a stones throw rose from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock towering to so great a height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp rugged line against the sky at some distance away to his right it presented a clean vertical profile against a background of blue sky to a point half the way down and of distant hills hardly less blue thence to the tops of the trees at its base lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an astonishing sighta man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air  straight upright sat the rider in military fashion with a firm seat in the saddle a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a plunge from his bare head his long hair streamed upward waving like a plume his hands were concealed in the cloud of the horses lifted mane the animals body was as level as if every hoofstroke encountered the resistant earth its motions were those of a wild gallop but even as the officer looked they ceased with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap but this was a flight  filled with amazement and terror by this apparition of a horseman in the skyhalf believing himself the chosen scribe of some new apocalypse the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions his legs failed him and he fell almost at the same instant he heard a crashing sound in the treesa sound that died without an echoand all was still  the officer rose to his feet trembling the familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties pulling himself together he ran obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot thereabout he expected to find his man and thereabout he naturally failed in the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him that the line of march of aerial cavalry is directly downward and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff a halfhour later he returned to camp  this officer was a wise man he knew better than to tell an incredible truth he said nothing of what he had seen but when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he answered  yes sir there is no road leading down into this valley from the southward  the commander knowing better smiled  after firing his shot private carter druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch ten minutes had hardly passed when a federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees druse neither turned his head nor looked at him but lay without motion or sign of recognition  did you fire the sergeant whispered  at what  a horse it was standing on yonder rockpretty far out you see it is no longer there it went over the cliff  the mans face was white but he showed no other sign of emotion having answered he turned away his eyes and said no more the sergeant did not understand  see here druse he said after a moments silence its no use making a mystery i order you to report was there anybody on the horse  yes  well  my father  the sergeant rose to his feet and walked away good god he said    here ends no four of the western classics containing a son of the gods and a horseman in the sky by ambrose bierce with an introduction by
