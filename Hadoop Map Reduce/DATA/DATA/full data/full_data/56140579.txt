56140579	the shadow world  by  hamlin garland  author of the captain of the grayhorse troop money magic etc        new york and london harper  brothers publishers mcmviii  copyright 1908 by hamlin garland copyright 1908 by the ridgway company all rights reserved  published september 1908     foreword   this book is a faithful record so far as i can make it of the most marvellous phenomena which have come under my observation during the last sixteen or seventeen years i have used my notes made immediately after the sittings and also my reports to the american psychical society of which i was at one time a director as the basis of my story for literary purposes i have substituted fictitious names for real names and imaginary characters for the actual individuals concerned but i have not allowed these necessary expedients to interfere with the precise truth of the account  for example miller an imaginary chemist has been put in the place of a scientist much older than thirtyfive in whose library the inexplicable third sitting took place fowler also is not intended to depict an individual the man in whose shoes he stands is one of the most widely read and deeply experienced spiritists i have ever known and i have sincerely tried to present through fowler the argument which his prototype might have used mrs quigg miss brush howard the camerons and most of the others are purely imaginary the places in which the sittings took place are not indicated for the reason that i do not wish to involve any unwilling witnesses  in the case of the psychics they are of course delineated exactly as they appeared to me although i have concealed their real names and places of residence mrs smiley whose admirable patience under investigation makes her an almost ideal subject is the chief figure among my mediums and i have tried to give her attitude toward us and toward her faith as she expressed it in our sittings although the conversation is necessarily a mixture of imagination and memory mrs hartley is a very real and vigorous charactera professional psychic it is true but a woman of intelligence and power those in private life i have guarded with scrupulous care and i am sure that none of them either private or professional will feel that i have wilfully misrepresented what took place my aim throughout has been to deal directly and simply with the facts involved  i have not attempted to be profound or mystical or even scientific but i have tried to present clearly simply and as nearly without bias as possible an account of what i have seen and heard the weight of evidence seems at the moment to be on the side of the biologists but i am willing to reopen the case at any time although i am above all a man of the open air of the plains and the mountains and do not intend to identify myself with any branch of metapsychical research it is probable therefore that this is my one and final contribution to the study of the shadow world                                                  hamlin garland   chicago july 1908     the shadow world     i   a hush fell over the dinnertable and every ear was open and inclined as cameron the host continued no i wouldnt say that there are some things that are pretty well establishedtelepathy for instance  i dont believe even in telepathy asserted mrs quigg a very positive journalist who sat at his right i think even that is mere coincidence  several voices rose in a chorus of protest oh no telepathy is real why ive had experiences  there you go replied mrs quigg still in the heat of her opposition you will all tell the same story your friend was dying in bombay or vienna and his spirit appeared to you à la journal of psychic research with a message at the exact hour computing difference in time which no one ever does and so on i know that kind of thingbut that isnt telepathy  what is telepathy then asked little miss brush who paints miniatures  i cant describe a thing that doesnt exist replied mrs quigg the word means feeling at a distance does it not professor  harris a teacher of english who seldom took a serious view of anything answered i should call it a longdistance touch  do you believe in hypnotism dr miller asked miss brush quietly addressing her neighbor a young scientist whose specialty was chemistry  no replied he i dont believe in a single one of these supernatural forces  you mean you dont believe in anything you have not seen yourself said i  to this miller slowly replied i believe in vienna which i have never seen but i dont believe in a vienna doctor who claims to be able to hypnotize a man so that he can smile while his leg is being taken off  oh thats a fact stated brierly the portraitpainter that happens every day in our hospitals here in new york city  have you ever seen it done asked miller bristling with opposition  no  well asserted miller i wouldnt believe it even if i saw the operation performed  you dont believe in any mystery unless it is familiar said i warming to the contest  i certainly do not believe in these childish mysteries responded miller and it is strange to me that men like sir oliver lodge and sir william crookes should believe in slatewriting and levitation and all the rest of that hocuspocus  nevertheless hypnotism is a fact insisted brierly you must have some faith in the big books on the subject filled with proof think of the tests  i dont call it a test to stick pins into a persons tongue said mrs quigg we newspaper people all know that there are in the hypnotic business what they call horsesthat is to say wretched men and boys women sometimes who have trained themselves so that they can hold hot pennies eat red pepper and do other stuntsweve had their confessions times enough  yes but their confessions are never quite complete retorted young howard when i was in college i had one of these horses appeal to me for help he was out of a job and i told him id blow him to the supper of his life if he would render up the secrets of his trade he took my offer but jarred me by confessing that the professor really could hypnotize him he had to make believe only part of the time his stunts were mostly real  its the same way with mediums said i i have had a good deal of experience with them and ive come to the conclusion that they all even the most untrustworthy of them start with at least some small basis of abnormal power is it not rather suggestive that the number of practising mediums does not materially increase if it were a mere matter of deception would there not be thousands at the trade as a matter of fact there are not fifty advertising mediums in new york at this moment though of course the number is kept down by the feeling that it is a bit disreputable to have these powers  youre too easy on them said howard i never saw one that wasnt a cheap skate  again i protested dont be hasty there are nice ones my own mother had this power in her youth so my father tells me her people were living in wisconsin at the time when this psychic force developed in her and the settlers from many miles around came to see her perform an uncle when a boy of four did automatic writing and one of my aunts recently wrote to me in relation to my book the tyranny of the dark that for two years beginning when she was about seventeen these powers of darkness made her life a hell it wont do to be hasty in condemning the mediums wholesale there are many decent people who are possessed by strange forces but are shy of confessing their abnormalities ask your family physician he will tell you that he always has at least one patient who is troubled by occult powers  medical men call it hysteria said harris  which doesnt explain anything i answered many apparently healthy people possess the more elementary of these powersoften without knowing it  we are all telepathic in some degree declared brierly  perhaps all the socalled messages from the dead come from living minds i suggestedi mean the minds of those about us dr reed a friend of mine once arranged to go with a patient to have a test sitting with a very celebrated psychic who claimed to be able to read sealed letters just before the appointed day reeds patient died suddenly of heartdisease leaving a sealed letter on his desk the doctor fully alive to the singular opportunity put the letter in his pocket and hastened to the medium the magician took it in his hand and pondered at last he said this was written by a man now in the spirit world i cannot sense it there isnt a medium in the world who can read it but if you will send it to any person anywhere on the planet and have it read and resealed i will tell you what is in it i cannot get the words unless some mind in the earthplane has absorbed them  harris spoke first that would seem to prove a sort of universal mind reservoir wouldnt it  that is the way my friend figured it but isnt that a staggering hypothesis i have never had a sealed letter read but the psychic research people seem to have absolutely proved psychometry to be a fact after you read myers you are ready to believe anythingor nothing  the hostess rose suppose we go into the library and have more ghost stories come mr garland we cant leave you men here to talk yourselves out on these interesting subjects you must let us all hear what you have to say  in more or less jocose mood the company trooped out to the library where a fire was glowing in the grate and easychairs abounded the younger people bringing cushions placed themselves beside the hearth while i took a seat near mrs cameron and harris  there said miss brush with a gurgle of delight this is more like the proper light and surroundings for creepy tales please go on mr garland you said youd had a good deal of experiencetell us all about it i always think of you as a trailer a man of the plains how did you happen to get into this shadow world  it came about while i was living in boston it was in 1891 or possibly 1892 a friend the editor of the arena asked me to become a member of the american psychical society which he was helping to form he wished me to go on the board of directors because as he said i was young a keen observer and without emotional biasby which he meant that i had not been bereaved  quite right the loss of a child or a wife weakens even the best of us illogical commented harris no man who is mourning a relative has any business to be calling himself an investigator of spiritualism  well the upshot was i joined the society became a member of the executive board was made a special committee on physical phenomenathat is to say slatewriting levitation and the likeand set to work it was like entering a new vague and mysterious world the first case i investigated brought out one of the most fundamental of these facts which is that this shadow world lies very close to the sunny socalled normal day the secretary of the society had already begun to receive calls for help a mechanic had written from south boston asking us to see his wifes automatic writing and a farmer had come down from concord to tell us of a haunted house and the mysterious rappings on its walls almost in a day i was made aware of the illusory side of life  why illusory asked brierly  let us call it that for the present i answered among those who wrote to us was a woman from lowell whose daughter had developed strange powers her account so straightforward and so precise determined us to investigate the case therefore our secretary a young clergyman and i took the train for lowell one autumn afternoon we found mrs jones living in a small oldfashioned frame house standing hard against the sidewalk and through the parlor windows while we awaited the psychic i watched an endless line of derby hats as the towns mechanics plodded byincessant reminders of the practical hardheaded world that filled the street this was indeed a typical case in half an hour we were all sitting about the table in a dim light while the sweetvoiced mother was talking with charley her poltergeist  what is that please asked mrs quigg  the word means a rollicking spirit who throws things about i did not value what happened at this sitting for the conditions were all the psychics own bytheway she was a large blond strapping girl of twenty or soone of the millhandsnot in the least the sickly morbid creature i had expected to see as i say the conditions were such as to make what took place of no scientific value and i turned in no report upon it but it was all very curious  what happened dont skip bade mrs cameron  oh the table rapped and heaved and slid about a chair crawled to my lap and at last to the top of the table apparently of its own motion a little rockingchair moved to and fro precisely as if some one were sitting in it and so on it was all unconvincing at the time but as i look back upon it now after years of experience i am inclined to think part of it at least was genuine and this brings me to say to mrs quigg and to any other doubter that you have only to step aside into silence and shadow and wait for a momentand the bewildering will happen or you will imagine it to happen i will agree to furnish from this company a medium that will astonish even our materialistic friend miller  there was a loud outcry what do you mean explain yourself  i am perfectly certain that if this company will sit as i direct for twentyone days at the same hour in the same room under the same conditions phenomena will develop which will not merely amaze but scare some of you and as for you mrs quigg you who are so certain that nothing ever happens you will be the first to turn pale with awe  try me i am wild to be shown  harris was not so boastful you mean of course that some of these highly cultured ladies would develop hysteria  i am not naming the condition i only say that i have seen some very hardheaded and selfcontained people cut strange capers the trance and impersonation usually come first  lets do it cried out miss brush it would be such fun  youd be the first to go off said i banteringly  harris agreed she is neuropathic  i propose we start a psychic society here and now said cameron ill be president mrs quigg secretary and garland can be the director of the awful rites miss brush you shall be the mejum  oh no no she cried please let some one else be it  this amused me but i seized upon camerons notion i accept the arrangement provided you do not hold me responsible for any ill effects i said its ticklish business there are many who hold the whole process diabolic  is the house ready for the question asked cameron  ay ay shouted every one present  the society is formed announced cameron as president i suggest a sitting right now how about it garland  certainly i answered for i have an itching in my thumbs that tells me something witching this way comes  the guests rose in a flutter of pleased excitement  how do we go at it asked mrs cameron  the first requisite is a small table  why a table asked mrs quigg  the theory is that it helps to concentrate the minds of the sitters and it will also furnish a convenient place to rest our hands anyhow all the great investigators began this way i replied pacifically we may also require a pencil and a pad  miller was on his dignity i decline to sit at a table in that foolish way i shall look on in lonely grandeur  the others were eager to sit in as young howard called it and soon nine of us were seated about an oblong mahogany table brierly was very serious miss brush ecstatic and mrs harris rather nervous  i was careful to prepare them all for failure this is only a trial sitting you know merely to get our hands in i warned  must we keep still  oh no you may talk if you do so quietly please touch fingers so as to make a complete circuit i dont think it really necessary but it sometimes helps to produce the proper mental state singing softly also tends to harmonize the conditions as the professionals say dont argue and dont be too eager lean back and rest take a passive attitude toward the whole problem i find the whole process very restful harris will you turn down the lights before  there said miller the hocuspocus begins why not perform in the light  subdued light will bring the proper negative and inward condition sooner i replied taking a malicious delight in his disgust now will some one sing annie laurie or any other sweet low song let us get into genial receptive mood miller you and your fellowdoubters please retire to the far end of the room  in a voice that trembled a little mrs harris started the dear old melody and all joined in producing a soft and lulling chorus  at the end of the song i asked matteroffactly are the conditions right are we sitting right  mrs quigg sharply queried whom are you talking to  the guides i answered  the guides she exclaimed do you believe in the guides  i believe in the belief of the guides was my cryptic rejoinder sing again please  i really had no faith in the conditions of the circle but for the joke of it i kept my sitters in place for nearly an hour by dint of pretending to hear creakings and to feel throbbings until at last little miss brush became very deeply concerned i feel them too she declared did some one blow on my hands i felt a cold wave  harris got up abruptly ill join the doubters said he this tomfoolery is too idiotic for me  cameron followed and mrs quigg also rose ill go with you she said decidedly i was willing to quit too but mrs harris and miss brush pleaded with me to continue  close up the circle then probably harris was the hoodoo things will happen now i said briskly though still without any faith in the experiment  hardly had harris left the table when a shudder passed over mrs harris her head lifted and her eyes closed  whats the matter dolly whispered mrs cameron do you feel faint  dont be alarmed mrs harris is only passing into a sleep not a word harris i said warningly please move farther away  in the dusky light the faces of all the women looked suddenly blanched and strange as the entranced woman seized upon the table with her hands shaking it hard from side to side the table seemed to wake to diabolic energy under her palms this was an unexpected development and i was almost as much surprised as the others were  sing again i commanded softly  as they sang mrs harris withdrew her hands from the table and sat rigidly erect yet with a peaceful look upon her face she does it well i thought i didnt think it in the quiet little lady at length one hand lifted and dropped limply upon the table it wants to write said i where is the pad i have a pencil  as i put a pencil under the hand it was seized in a very singular way and almost instantly mrs cameron gasped thats very strange  hush said i wait  holding the pencil clumsily as a crippled person might do the hand crept over the paper and at last after writing several lines stopped and lay laxly open i passed the pad to brierly read it aloud i said  he took it to the light and read        sara be not sceptical believe and you will be happier life is      only the minutest segment of the great circle                                                        martin   my father exclaimed mrs cameron let me see the writing brierly handed the pad to her she stared upon it in awe and wonder it is his exact signatureand dolly held the pen just as he didhe was paralyzed toward the lastand could only write by holding his pen that way  look its moving again i exclaimed  the hand caught up the pencil and holding it between the thumb and forefinger in a peculiar way began moving it in the air brierly who sat opposite translated these movements she is drawing freehand in the air she is sketching the outline of a boat see how she measures and plumbs her lines are you addressing me he asked of mrs harris  the sleeper nodded  cant you write i asked cant you speak  a low gurgle in the throat was the only answer at the moment but after a few trials a husky whisper began to be heard i will try she said and suddenly began to chuckle rolling upon one hip and throwing one foot over the other like a man taking an easy attitude she now held the pencil as if it were a cigarette laughing again with such generous tone that the other women recoiled then she spoke huskily you knowsan remosands came brokenly from her lips  sands queried the painter who is sands  sandssan remoboats  the painter was puzzled i dont remember any sands at san remo it must be some student i knew in paris is that what you mean  mrs harris violently nodded as abruptly as it came this action left her and then slowly imperceptibly her expression changed a look of ineffable maternal sweetness came into her face she seemed to cradle a tiny babe upon her arm at last she sighed oh the pity of it the pity of it  for a minute we sat in silence so compelling were her gestures and her tone at last i asked has any one here lost a little child  mrs cameron spoke hesitatingly yesi lost a little babyyears ago  she is addressing youperhaps  mrs harris did not respond to this suggestion but changed into an impersonation of a rollicking girl of rather common fibre hello sally she cried out and mrs cameron stared at her in blank dismay as she asked are you talking to me  you bet i am you old bag o wool remember geny remember the night on the doorstep ooo but it was cold you were to blame  what is she talking about i asked seeing that mrs cameron was reluctant to answer this challenge  she seems to be impersonating an old classmate of mine at college  thats what broke in the voice  mrs cameron went on her name was eugenia hull  is yet laughed the voice same old sport couldnt find any man good enough you didnt like me but no matter i want to tell you that youre in danger of fire dont play with fire be careful of fire  again a calm blankness fell upon the psychics delicate and sensitive face and the hand once more slowly closed upon the pencil  my father again exclaimed mrs cameron how could dolly have known that he held his pen in just that way she never saw him  do not place too much value on such performances i cautioned she has probably heard you describe it or she might have taken it out of your subconscious mind  the pencil dropped the hand lifted the form of the sleeper expanded with power her face took on benignity and lofty serenity she rose slowly impressively and with her hand upraised in a peculiar gesture laid a blessing upon the head of her hostess there was so much of sweetness and tolerance in her face so much of dignity and power in every movement that i was moved to applaud the actress as we all sat thus deeply impressed by her towering attitude mrs cameron whispered why it is bishop blank that is exactly the way he held his handhis robe  is it the bishop i asked  the psychic bowed and in solemn answer spoke tell james all will yet be well she said and making the sign of blessing once more sank back into her chair  meanwhile the irreverent ribalds in the far end of the room were disturbing the solemnity of all this communion with the shades and at my suggestion we went upstairs to mrs camerons own sittingroom where we could be quiet seizing a moment when mrs harris was free from the influence i woke her and told her what we were about to do she followed mrs cameron readily although she seemed a little dazed and five of us continued the sitting with mrs quigg and cameron looking on with perfectly evident doubt of our psychics sincerity harris was rigidly excluded  in the quiet of this room mrs harris passed almost immediately into tranceor what seemed like a tranceand ran swiftly over all her former impersonations voice succeeded voice almost without pause the sweet mother with the child the painter of san remo the jovial and slangy girl the commanding and majestic figure of the bishopall returned repeatedly in bewildering mixture dropping away one after the other with disappointing suddenness and yet each time the messages grew a little more definite a little more coherent until at last they all cleared up and this in opposition to our thought to our first interpretations it developed that the painter was not named sands but felipi and that he was only trying to tell brierly that to succeed he should paint rocks and sands and old boats at san remo pauline the woman who had seemed to hold a babe was a friend of mrs camerons who had died in childbirth and then swiftly unaccountably all these gentle or genial influences were scattered as if by something hellish something diabolic the face of the sweet little woman became fiendish in line her lips snarled her hands clawed like those of a cat and out of her mouth came a hoarse imprecation ill tear your heart out she snarled ill kill you soul and bodyill rip you limb from limb we all recoiled in amazement and wonder it was as if our friend had suddenly gone insane  i confess to a feeling of profound astonishment i had never met mrs harris before but as she was an intimate friend of mrs cameron and quite evidently a woman of culture i could not think her so practised a joker as to be putting all this on  while still we sat in silence another voice uttered a wail of infinite terror and despair i didnt do it dont kill me it was not my work and then still more horrible to hear a sound like the gurgling of blood came from the psychics lips mixed with babbled frantic incoherent words i had a perfectly definite impression that she was impersonating some one with his throat cut her grimaces were disgusting and terrifying the women shivered with horror a few seconds later and her face changed the hideous mask became white expressing rigid exalted terror her arms were drawn back as if tied at the elbow behind her back her head was uplifted and in a low monotonous hushed voice she prayed lord jesus receive  a gasping gurgling cry cut short her prayer and with tongue protruding from her mouth she presented such a picture of a strangling woman that a sudden clear conception of what it all meant came to me shes impersonating a woman on the scaffold i explained she has shown us a murder and now she is depicting an execution is it mrs r of vermont i asked  she nodded slowly save me she whispered  waken her please dont let her do that any more pleaded mrs cameron in poignant distress  thereupon i called out sharply that is enough wake wake  in answer to my command she ceased to groan her face smoothed out and with a bewildered smile she opened her eyes what are you saying have i been asleep  you have indeed i replied and youve disclosed a deal of dubious family history how do you feel  i feel very funny around my neck she answered wonderingly what have you been doing to me she rubbed her throat my neck feels as if it had a band round it and my tongue seems swollen what have you been about  i held up a warning hand to the others you went off into a quiet little trance thats all i was mistaken either you are a psychic or you should have been an actress  as we stood thus confronting one another mrs cameron came between us saying do you know pauline came and talked with me  at the word pauline the spell seemed to fall again over the bright spirit of mrs harris her eyelids drooped her limbs lost their power and she sank into her chair as before a helpless victim apparently to the hidden forces for a moment i was at a loss i could not believe that she was deceiving us but it was possible that she was deceiving herself in either case she must be brought out of this i decided and putting my hands on her shoulders i said if there is any control here let them stop this we want no more of it stop it  my command was again obeyed and the psychic slowly came back to herself and as she did so i said warningly to mrs cameron do not utter another word of this in mrs harriss presence she seems to be extremely sensitive to hypnotic influence and i think she had better go out into the air at once  in rather subdued mood we went below to rejoin the frankly contemptuous members of the party  well what luck cried howard  you all look rather solemn said harris what about it dolly what have you been doing  mrs cameron described the sitting as wonderful but mrs harris only smiled vaguely and i said your wife seemed to go into a trance and impersonate a number of individuals she shows all the signs of a real sensitive  harris who had been studying his wife with halfhumorous intentness now took command if youve been shamming you need discipline and if you havent you need a doctor i think well go home and have it out he added and shortly after led her away some nice cool air is what we need he said at the door  no sooner were the harrises out of the door than the women of the party fell upon me  what do you think of it mr garland asked mrs cameron  if mrs harris were not your friend and if i had not seen other performances of the same sort i should instantly say that she was having her joke with us but i have seen too much of this sort of thing to take it altogether lightly thats the way this investigating goes one thing corroborates another impersonation in the case of a public medium may mean nothingon the part of a psychic like your friend mrs harris it means a very great deal in support of this let me tell you of a similar case i have a friend a perfectly trustworthy woman and of keen intelligence whose stunt as she laughingly calls it is to impersonate nameless and suffering spirits who have been hurled into outer darkness by reason of their own misdeeds or by some singular chance of their taking off my friend seems to be able in some way to free these poor earthbound souls and send them flying upward to some heaven its all very creepy i added warningly  oh delightful let it be very creepy called mrs quigg  to begin with my friend is as keeneyed as levelheaded as any woman i knowthe last person in the world to be taken for a sensitive i had never suspected it in her but one night she laughingly admitted having been in the work at one time and i begged for a sitting we were dining at her housejack ross a miss wilcox and i all intimate friends of hers and she consented after sitting a few minutes she turned to me and said my guide is here be sure to keep near me dont let me fall she still spoke smilingly but i could see she was in earnest  you see she explained i seem to leave the body and to withdraw a little distance above my chair from this height i survey my material self which seems to be animated by an entirely alien influence sometimes my body is moved by these forces to rise and walk about the room in such cases it is necessary for some friend to follow close behind me for between the going of the spirit and the return of my astral self there lies an appreciable interval when my body is as limp as an empty sack i came very near having a bad fall once  i understand said i ill keep an eye on you  in a few moments a change came over her face she sank into a curious negative state between trance and reverie her lips parted and a soft voice came from them she spoke to miss wilcox who sat opposite her sisteri am very happy i am surrounded by children it is beautiful here in the happy valleywarm and goldenand oh the merry children  miss wilcox was deeply moved by this message and for a moment could not reply at length she recovered her voice and asked are you speaking to me  yes i am worried about mother she is sick go to her she needs help goodbye the smile faded my friends face resumed its impersonal calm  did you recognize the spirit i asked  miss wilcox hesitated but at last said my sister was active in the work of caring for orphan children but that proves nothing anna may have known itthere is no test in this it may be only mindreading  you are quite right i replied but the message concerning your mother can be tested can it not  at this moment the face of the psychic squared and a deep slow voice came pulsing forth why do you wilfully blind your eyes the truth will prevail mystery is all about you why doubt that which would comfort you  who are you i inquired  i am theodore parker the psychics control was the answer  soon after this my friend opened her eyes and smiled do you know what youve said i asked yes i always have a dim notion of what is going on she answered but why i am moved to speak and act as i do i dont know it is just the same when i write automatically i know when i do it but i cant see the connection between my own mind and the writing it is as if one lobe of my brain kept watch over the action of the other  she now passed into another period of immobility and so sat for a long time suddenly her face hardened became coarse common vicious in line flinging out her hand she struck me in the breast what do you want of me she demanded in the voice of a harridan what are you all doing here youre a nice lot of fools  who are you i asked  you know who i am she answered with a hoarse laugh a sweet bunch you are wheres jim  does any one recognize this party i asked ross this must be one of your set  ross laughed and the influence thrusting her face close to his blurted out menacingly dont know me hey well here i am i wanted a show and they let me in what you going to do about it  i reckon you lit in the wrong dooryard i replied nobody knows you here skiddoo  she made an ugly face at me and struck at me with her clawlike hand id like to smash you  goodbye said i get out and she was gone  before a word could be spoken a look of hopeless heartpiercing woe came over my friends face she began to moan and wring her hands most piteously oh where am i she wailed it is so cold so cold so cold and dark wont somebody help me oh help me  i gently asked who are you cant you tell us your name  oh i dont know i cant tell moaned the voice its all so dark and cold and lonely please tell me where i am ive lost my name all is so dark and cold oh pity me let me come in let me feel your light im freezing oh pity me im so lonely its so dark  come in i said we will help you  the hands of the psychic crept timidly up my arm and touched my cheek thank you thank you oh the cheer oh the light she cried ecstatically i see i know goodbye and with a sigh of ecstasy the voice ceased  i can hardly express to you the vivid and yet sombre impression this made upon me it was as if a chilled and weary bird having winged its way from the winters midnight into a warm room had been heartened and invigorated had rushed away confident and swift to the sunlands of the south  one by one other earthbound souls who from one cause or another were unable to find their way upward came into our ken like chilled and desperate bats condemned to whirl in endless outer darkness and silencepoor abortive anomalous shadows whose voices pleaded piteously for release nameless agonized bewildered they clung like moths to the light of our psychic  some of them appeared to be suffering all the terrors of the damned and as they moaned and pleaded for light the lovely face of my friend was convulsed with agony and her hands fluttered about like wounded birds singular conception wonderful power of suggestion  at length with a glad cry the last of these blind souls saw sighed with happiness and seemed to vanish upward as if into some unfathomable fourthdimension heaven then the sweet first spirit the woman with the glad children returned to say to miss wilcox be happygeorge is coming back to you  after she passed my friend opened her eyes as before clearly smilingly and said have you had enough  plenty said i you nearly took my eye out in your dramatic fervor i must say your ghosts are most unhappy creatures  she became very serious please dont think that these spirits are my affinities my work is purely philanthropic so theodore parker used to tell mother it was my duty he said to comfort the cheerless to liberate the earthbound and so i had to have these poor creatures waiting around thats why i gave it up it got to be too dreadful we never could tell what would come next murderers and barnburners and every other accursed spirit seemed to be privileged to come into my poor empty house and abuse it although parker and his band promised to protect me i stopped it i will not sit again she said firmly i dont like it it would be bad enough to be dominated by ones dead friends or the dead friends of ones friends but to be helpless in the hands of all the demons and suicides and miscreants of the other world is intolerable and if i am not dominated by dead people i fear i am acting in response to the minds of vicious living people and i dont like that its a dreadful feelingcant you see it isthis being open to every wandering gust of passion i wouldnt let any one of my children be controlled for the world dont ask me to sit again and please dont let my friends know of my gift  of course we promised but the effect of that sitting i shall not soon forget bytheway miss wilcox phoned and proved the truth of her message her mother really was ill and in need of her  as i closed this story cameron said garland you tell that as if you believed in it  i certainly do believe in my friend its no joke with her she is quite certain that she is controlled by those on the other side and that to submit is to lose so much of her own individuality you may call it hysteria somnambulism hypnotism anything you like but that certain people are moved subconsciously to impersonate the dead i am quite ready to believe however impersonation is the least convincing from my point of view of all the phases of mediumship i have paid very little attention to it in the course of my investigation it has no value as evidence you are still in the tattered fringes of spiritism even when you have seen all that impersonation can show you  well what do you suggest as the proper method for the society  as i told you at beginning i have had a great deal of experience with these elusive facts and it chances that a practised though nonprofessional psychic with whom i have held many baffling sittings is in the city i may be able to induce her to sit for us  oh do do cried mrs cameron and miss brush together  who is she asked miller  ill tell you more about hernext time i said tantalizingly she is very puzzling i assure you when and where shall we meet  here said cameron promptly im getting interested bring on your marvels  yes said miller and his mouth shut like a steel trap bring on your faker it wont take us long to expose her little game  bigger scientific bigots than you have been conquered i retorted all right ill see what i can do well meet one week from today  yes said cameron come for dinner  as i was going out mrs quigg detained me if it had been anybody but nice little mrs harris i should say that you had made this all up between you as it is i guess ill have to admit that there is something in thought transference and hypnotism you were her control  that will serve for one evening i retorted ill make you doubt the existence of matter before we finish this series of sittings and with this we parted     ii   i was a little late at camerons dinnerparty and no sooner had i shown my face inside the door than a chorus of excited inquiry arose  where is the medium demanded cameron  dont tell us you havent got her exclaimed mrs quigg  i havent her in my pocket but she has promised to appear a little later i replied serenely  why didnt you bring her to dinner asked mrs cameron  well she seemed a little shy and besides i was quite sure you would all want to discuss her and so  yes do tell us about her who is she does she perform for a living what kind of a person are we to expect volleyed miss brush  to this i replied she is a native of the middle westohio i believe no she does not do this for a living in fact she makes no charge for her services she is very gentle and ladylike and much interested naturally in converting you to spiritualism for like most psychics she believes in spirits she says her controls have especially urged her to give me sittings i am highly flattered to think the spirit folk should consider me so particularly valuable to their cause seriously i hope you will appreciate the wonderful concessions mrs smiley is making in thus putting herself into our hands with the almost certain result of being discredited by some of us i believe she really is doing it from a sense of duty and is entitled to be treated fairly  has she been in the business long asked mrs quigg with lurking sarcasm  ever since she was about ten years old i believe but she sits only to spread the glad tidings  is she married  yes and has a devoted husband and a nice little american village home i know for she sent me a photograph of it she has two children in the other world please dont think all mediums the ignorant and vicious harpies which the newspapers make them out to be i know several who are very nice seriousminded women  at this point dinner was announced and the diningroom became the field of a hot verbal warfare the members of the society were all present excepting mrs harris who had been greatly upset by her own performance bart brierly the painter was there to defend the mystery of life against our scientific friend miller whose conception of the universe was very definite indeed mrs quigg supported miller young howard was everywhere in the lists and his raillery afforded cameron a great deal of amusement  i contented myself with listening for the first halfhour but at last took occasion to say to miller like all violent opponents of the metapsychical you know very little of the subject you are discussing to sustain this contention let me ask if you have ever read the account of sir william crookess experiments with psychic force  miller confessed that he had not i have avoided doing so for i respect crookes as a chemist he added  i continued crookes began by poohpoohing the whole subject of spiritualism very much as you do miller but after three years of rigid investigation he was forced to announce himself convinced of the truth of many of the socalled spirit phenomena it is instructive to recall that when he was willing to hazard his scientific reputation on a report of this character to the royal society of which he was a member his paper was thrown out the secretary refused even to enter it upon the files of the institution  i know about that replied miller and i consider the secretary justified to his thinking crookes had lost his head  no matter what he thought i replied any paper by a man of crookess standing with his knowledge of chemistry and of life and his long training in exact observation should have been considered the action of the secretary was due simply to prejudice and many of those who voted to ignore that report are today more than half convinced that sir william has been justified each of his experiments has been repeated and his findings verified by scientific men of europe it is a pleasure to add that our own smithsonian institution published two of his speculative papers some years ago so it goesthe heresy of today is the orthodoxy of tomorrow  didnt crookes afterward repudiate that early report asked miller  on the contrary in 1898 upon being elected to the presidency of the british association for the advancement of science he said i think i can recall almost his exact words no incident in my scientific career is more widely known than the part i took in certain psychic researches thirty years have passed since i published an account of experiments tending to show that outside our scientific knowledge there exists a force exercised by intelligences differing from the ordinary intelligence common to mortals this fact in my life is well understood by those who honored me with the invitation to become your president perhaps among my audience some may feel curious as to whether i shall speak out or be silent i elect to speak although briefly i have nothing to retract i adhere to my published statements indeed i might add much thereto and when you realize that this includes his astounding experience with katie king his words become tremendous in their significance  what was the katie king experience asked mrs cameron i never heard of it  it is a long and very interesting story but in substance it is this while in a condition of contemptuous disbelief as to the alleged phenomena of spiritualism sir william chanced to witness a séance wherein a young girl named florence cook was the medium her doings so puzzled and interested him that he went again and again to see her dissatisfied with the conditions under which the wonders took place he asked miss cook to come to his house and sit for him and his friends this she did she was a mere girl at the time about seventeen years of age and yet she baffled this great chemist and all his assistants you sometimes hear people say yes but he was in his dotage he was not he was in his early prime he brought to bear all his thirty years training in exact observation and all the mechanical and electrical appliances he could devise without once detecting anything deceitful  even in the katie king episode asked harris  even katie stood the test but before going into that let me tell you some of his other experiments he says among other amazing things that he has seen a chair move on its own account without contact with a medium he saw daniel homeanother medium with whom he had sittingsraised by invisible power completely from the floor of the room under rigid test condition he writes i have seen a solid selfluminous body the size of an egg float noiselessly about the room but wait i will quote from my notes his exact words here i produced my notebook and read as follows i have seen a luminous cloud floating upward toward a picture under the strictest test conditions i have more than once had a solid selfluminous crystalline body placed in my hand by a hand which did not belong to any person in the room in the light i have seen a luminous cloud hover over a heliotrope on a sidetable break a sprig off and carry it to a lady and on some occasions i have seen a similar luminous cloud condense to the form of a hand and carry small objects about during a séance in full light a beautifully formed small hand rose up from an opening in a diningtable and gave me a flower this occurred in the light in my own room while i was holding the mediums hands and feet i have retained one of these perfectly lifelike and graceful spirit hands in my own firmly resolved not to let it escape but it gradually seemed to resolve itself into vapor and faded in that manner from my grasp  oh come now shouted howard youre joking crookes couldnt have written that  i continued to read under satisfactory test conditions i have seen phantom forms and facesa phantom form came from the corner of the room took an accordion in its hand and glided about the room playing the instrument  as i paused harris said was all that in his report to the royal society  it was  well i dont wonder they thought he was crazy the whole statement is preposterous  but that is not all i hastened to say under rigid conditions scales were depressed without contact and a flower separating itself from a bouquet passed through a solid table  miller made a gesture of angry disgust to save the reputation of a really great scientist dont quote any more of that insane dreaming  i didnt know any one but campers in lily dale could be so bughouse added howard  i went on crookes might have induced his brother scientists at least to listen to his report had he stopped with this but he proceeded to say that he had witnessed the magic birth of a sentient palpable intelligent human being who walked about in his household conversing freely while the medium from whom the spirit form sprang lay in the cabinet like one dead it was his account of this spirit who called herself katie king that caused the whole scientific world to jeer at the great chemist as a man gone mad  we have a right to draw the line between crookes the chemist and crookes the befuddled dupe insisted miller  mrs cameron drew a long breath do you mean to say that this katie king phantom actually talked with the people in the room does sir william crookes say that  yes over and over again he declares that katie king appeared as real as any one else in his house he becomes quite lyrical in description of her beauty she was like a pearl in her purity her flesh seemed a sublimation of ordinary human flesh and the grace of her manner was so extraordinary that lady crookes and all who saw her became deeply enamoured of her she allowed some of them to kiss her and crookes himself was permitted to grasp her hand and walk up and down the room with her  how was she dressed asked mrs brush  there now we are getting at the essentials i exclaimed usually in white with a turban  did she look like the medium  she was utterly unlike miss cook in several physical details she was half a head taller her face was broader her ears had not been pierced and she was free from certain facial scars that miss cook bore and once when miss cook was suffering from a severe cold sir william tested katie kings lungs and found them in perfect health on several occasions he and several of his friends among them eminent scientists saw katie and the medium together and at last succeeded in photographing them both on the same plate although never with miss cooks face exposed because of the danger to one in a trance from the shock of a flashlight  i dont take any stock in that excuse said howard but go on i like this  for months the great chemist brought all his skill to bear on miss cooks mediumship without detecting any fraud or finding any solution of the mystery the sittings which took place in his own library were under his own conditions and he had the assistance of several young and clever physicists and yet he could not convict miss cook of doubledealing the story of the final séance when katie king announced her departure is as affecting as a scene in a play she had said that her real name was annie morgan but that in the spirit world she was known as katie king she came she said to do a certain work and now after three years that work was done and she must return to the spirit world  what was that work  to convince the world of the spirit life i imagine when the time came for katie to take her farewell writes crookes i asked that she would let me see the last of her accordingly when she had called each of the company up to her and had spoken a few words in private she gave some general directions for the future guidance and protection of miss cook from these which were taken down in shorthand i quote the following mr crookes has done very well throughout and i leave florrie the medium with the greatest confidence in his hands having concluded her directions katie invited me into the cabinet with her and allowed me to remain until the end  touching confidence interrupted harris  after closing the curtain she conversed with me for some time and then walked across to where miss cook was lying senseless on the floor stooping over her katie touched her and said wake up florrie wake up i must leave you now  miss cook then woke and tearfully entreated katie to stay a little time longer  my dear i cant my work is done god bless you katie replied and then continued speaking to miss cook for several minutes for several minutes the two were conversing with each other till at last miss cooks tears prevented her speaking following katies instructions i then came forward to support miss cook who was falling onto the floor sobbing hysterically i looked round but the whiterobed katie had gone never to return to the earthplane  i glanced about the table at my silent listeners and added could anything be more dramatic than this sad farewell evidently the fourth dimension is both near and very far  all the women were deeply impressed with this story but to miller it was as idle as the blowing of the wind the man was duped it is absolutely impossible to think that he was not grossly deceived  wait a moment said i i defy you or any man to remain unchanged by it the world is just catching up to this brave pioneer at that time there were very few scientific men in the metapsychical field sir william stood almost alone but public sentiment changed rapidly as the years passed the english society for psychical research was formed and one by one wallace lodge and other scientific men were convinced of the truth of these phenomena in europe as early as 1853 the work was taken up in the true scientific spirit and professor marc thury and the count de gasparin completely demonstrated the fact of telekinesis and at about the same time that the dialectical society was getting into action flammarion the astronomer took up his study of the subject but it was not until 1891 that anything like crookess searching analysis was made of a medium this important sittinga sitting which marks an epoch in sciencetook place in milan and was attended among others by lombroso and richet for the first time so far as is known a flashlight photograph was taken of a table floating in the air  at this moment the bell rang and mrs cameron exclaimed there that may be your wonderworker  i looked at my watch i shouldnt wonder she is a prompt little person     iii   we trooped into the sittingroom where mrs smiley a plain little woman with a sweet mouth and bright black eyes was awaiting us she was perceptibly abashed by the keen glances that the men directed upon her but her manners were those of one natively thoughtful and refined she made an excellent impression on every one  did you bring your magic horn mrs smiley i asked to relieve her embarrassment  oh yes she answered brightly i carry that just as a fiddler carries his fiddleready for a tune at any moment  she brought a large package from the foot of the sofa and gave it to me i took it but turned it over to miller here open this parcel yourself mr scientist i want you to be satisfied as to its character  miller undid the package as cautiously as if it were an infernal machine as the paper opened and fell away a short truncated cone of tin was disclosed with another smaller one loosely held within it the two sections when adjusted made a plain megaphone about twentyfour inches in length and some five inches in diameter at the larger end  what do you do with that asked mrs cameron  in a perfectly matteroffact way mrs smiley replied many of the spirit voices are very faint and cannot be heard without this horn i am what they call a trumpet medium she added in further explanation  do you mean to say spirits speak through that horn  yes that is my phone  the ladies looked at one another and harris said isnt it rather absurd to expect an immaterial mouth to speak through a tin tube like the grocers boy  she smiled composedly i suppose it seems so to you but to me it just happens  i set briskly to work arranging the library for the circle in the middle of the room i placed a plain oaken table which had been procured specially for the sitting on this i stood the tin horn upright on its larger end beside it i laid a pad a pencil and a small slate  mrs smiley you are to sit here i said drawing an armchair to the end of the table nearest the wall she took her seat submissively and looking around upon my fellowmembers with a full knowledge of what was in their minds i remarked if all goes well tonight this little woman alone and unaided except by this megaphone will utterly confound you we have had many sittings we understand each other perfectly i am going to treat her as if she were an unconscious trickster i am going to use every effort to discover how she accomplishes these mysterious results and miller is to be notably remorseless we are going to concede for the present the dim light required i dont like this but mrs smiley is giving us every other condition and as this is but a trial sitting we grant it i turned to miller the theory is that light acts in direct opposition to the psychic force weakening it unaccountably nevertheless darkness is not absolutely essential maxwell secured many convincing movements in the light and no doubt we shall be able to do so later  who is maxwell asked miss brush  dr joseph maxwell deputy attorneygeneral of the court of appeals at bordeaux and doctor of medicine he is a noted experimenter with psychic forces indeed he has the power himself now mrs smiley i wish to begin my tests by tying your wrists to the arms of your chair may i do so  certainly she cheerfully answered you may padlock me or put me in an iron cage if you please i leave it all to you  well there is a certain virtue in knotting a silk thread for the reason that it is almost impossible to untie even in the light and to break it we will agree invalidates the sitting for tonight we will use the thread miller will you watch me  with the greatest pleasure in the world he answered and as a scientist i am going to treat you as a possible confederate  very good let each watch the other  beneath the gaze of the smiling company i took from my pocket a spool of strong silk twist and proceeded to fasten the psychics wrists each arm was tied separately in such wise that she was unable to bring her hands together and could not raise her wrists an inch from the chair next with the aid of mrs cameron i looped a long piece of tape about mrs smileys ankles knotted it to the rungs of the chair at the back and nailed the loose ends to the floor i then drew chalk marks on the floor about the chair legs in order that any movement of the chair no matter how slight might show finally i pushed the table about two feet away from the psychics utmost reach  with this arrangement we ought to be able to detect any considerable movement on your part i said to my prisoner at any rate i think we can keep you from jumping upon the table miller you are to sit at her left i will keep watch and ward at her right the others of the society may take seats as they pleaseonly the tradition is that the sexes should alternate cameron please lock both doors and keep the keys in your pocket  as soon as we were all seated and cameron had locked the doors i asked him to turn down the light which he did grumbling i dont like this part of it  neither do i but at a first sitting we must not expect too much i am sure we shall be able to have more light later on and now while we are all getting into a harmonious frame of mind suppose we ask mrs smiley to tell us a little about herself where were you born mrs smiley  she replied very simply and candidly i was born near cincinnati my father was a spiritualist early in the craze as it was called and i was about nine when i became a medium at first we did not know that i was the psychic demons seemed to take possession of our house and for a few weeks nothing movable was safe after awhile my father became sure that i was the cause of these disturbances because everywhere i went raps were heard the movement of small objects near where i sat made me an object of aversion or of actual terror to my schoolmates so finally my father asked me to sit i didnt want to do so at first but he told me it was my duty they used to tie me in every way and experiment with me it was very wearisome to me but i submitted and i have been devoted to the work ever since after my father and mother died i gave up all opposition to my gift and now it is a great comfort to me for now i get messages from my father and my little daughter almost every day  do they speak to you directly i asked  yes sometimes clairaudiently but generally through this cone when i sit in the dark  what do you mean by speaking asked howard do you mean they sound like actual people  just as real as you or any one she answered  i was waiting to say dont be in haste you will all know from actual experience what she means by voices  have you ever seen these forces at work asked harris  no not the way you mean i had a terrible shock once that cured me of being too curious i was holding an accordion under a table by its bellows end as home used to do and while the playing was going on i just believed if i looked under the table i could see something so i lifted the cover and peeped under i didnt know any more for a long time when i came to my father was bathing my face and rubbing my hands i never tried to peek after that  do you mean that they did this to punish you for your peeping  yes they dont like to have you look directly at them when they are at work  why  i dont know i never was punished again i didnt need it  would they bat me if i were to peek asked howard  they might not but they refuse to work while any one is looking  all that is suspicious  i know it is but that is the way they act  you believe they are spirits  i know they are she repeated if i didnt i would be desolate i have been sitting now for over thirty years and these friendly voices are a part of my life they comfort me more than i can tell  she gave this account of herself with an air of quiet conviction that deeply impressed the circle and at the end of her little speech i added she has agreed to put herself into our hands for a series of experiments and if her health does not fail i think we shall be able to rival the doings of florence cook and daniel home whose mediumships were the basis of crookess report now let each one of you spread his hands or her hands upon the table just touching the little fingers in order that a complete circuit may be established miller and i will make connection with our psychic  it all seems childish folly but well do it said harris  what may we expect to happen first mrs smiley asked mrs cameron after we were in position  i dont know she answered frankly i have very little control over these forces often when i am most anxious nothing happens please dont expect much of anything tonight my first sittings in a new place are seldom very good and so much depends upon those who make up the circle i never sit without a fear that my power has gone never to come back  i helped her out in explanation the honest medium does not advertise to perform regularly for the reason that this force whatever it is seems to lie almost wholly outside the will flammarion says it may be set down as a rule that all professional mediums cheat that is putting it pretty strong but it seems true that the condition which leads to these phenomena is a very subtle physical and mental adjustment and that the slightest distraction or mental unrest defeats everything if the medium is paid for her work she is too eager to serve and everything tempts her to deceive furthermore it has been proved that the psychic is in the very nature of the case extremely liable to suggestion and the combined wills of the sitters focussed on one desired phenomena becomes an almost irresistible force to certain psychics on the other hand the best observers say that the most striking proofs of spiritualism lies in the fact that the most amazing phenomena come in opposition to the will of both the psychic and the sitters we may not secure a single movement tonight and indeed we may have two or three barren sittings but i am confident that in the end you will be satisfied i am going to attempt to put mrs smiley to sleep now and when she is in her trance we can discuss her methods freely  i began to hum a low monotonous tune and one by one the others joined in the refrain soon the psychics breath became labored and in the pauses of the song she moaned at length she drew her hands as far away from millers and mine as the threads would permit thus breaking the circuit  she is in trance i reported now we have nothing to do but wait you may say anything you please or tell stories or sing songs only dont argue we will remain as we are for a while and if the guides are dissatisfied they will order a change generally speaking the controls are very notional and when we get into full communication with them the entire present arrangement may be broken up the theory is that all success is due to the cooperation of those on the other side  it looks to me like a plain case of hypnotism from this side remarked harris  arent there any fixed rules to the game asked howard  after many years exhaustive study of these antic spirits approaching them always from the naturalistic side maxwell deduces certain helpful rules use a small room he says and have it warm medium and sitters must not have cold hands or feet  i can understand the psychic having cold feet now and then interjected harris  maxwell finds dry air and clear weather most favorable rainy and windy weather often cause failures there seems to be some connection with the electrical condition of the atmosphere after proving that a white light deters phenomena he uses green violet or yellow screens for his lamps any kind of a table will do for the raps or for levitation he says but one with a double top seems to give best results his sitters use wooden chairs with cane seats and my own experience is that a bare floor helps he especially directs that the guide be consultedlet the phenomena come as spontaneously as possible he adds  does he find this sandwiching of the sexes helpful  yes he says six or eight people men and women alternating make the best circle take things seriously but not solemnly he advises dont argue address the control and follow his advice avoid confusion by electing a director and asking for only one thing at a time keep the same people in the group for at least six sittings sit in a circle and touch hands be patient and goodtempered a worried irritated sullen medium is a poor instrument finallyand this is most importantdont overwork the medium and with this important statement he ends i am persuaded of the absolute harmlessness of these experiments provided they are properly conducted  i am glad to know that said mrs quigg after seeing mrs harriss trance i was in doubt  maxwells hints are extremely valuable to me i continued for they confirm my own methods some of which i had to learn by tedious experience if i had known for instance the folly of allowing everybody to quiz the psychic i might have been spared many hours of tiresome sitting maxwell is indeed an ideal investigatorhe has made a great advance in methods and his conclusions though tentative are most suggestive no unprejudiced reader can finish his book metapsychical phenomena without feeling that its author is a brave and fearless writer as well as a cautious and sane reasoner his published experience throws a flood of light on mediums and their puzzling peculiarities  but it seems to me those rules give the medium and his guides the free hand said miller discontentedly  by no means i retorted maxwell plainly says where the control is insisting upon something which i do not like i politely resist and end by getting my own way note the politely in short he recognizes that a genuine medium is a very precious instrument and he does not begin by clubbing himor herinto submission for all their wondrous powers the people who possess these powers are very weak they are not allowed to make anything more than a living out of the practise of the magic and they live under the threat of having the power withdrawn they are helpless in the face of a challenge to produce the phenomena and yet the hidden forces are themselves helpless without them  is the table throbbing asked brierly  i dont feel it  have you ever had any convincing evidence of this psychic forcesuch as movement of objects without contact asked harris  yes i have had a table rise at least twenty inches from the floor in the full light with no one present but the medium and myself and while our fingertips alone touched the top it felt as if it were floating in a thick and resilient liquid and when i pressed upon it it oscillated in a curious way as if the power were applied from below and in the centre of the table the psychic was a young girl and i am certain played no trick i could see her feet on the floor and her fingertips were like mine on the top of the table this was the clearest test of levitation i ever had but the lifting of a pencil in independent writing is the same thing in effect  i see you have acquired all the patter remarked miller  oh yes indeed all the patter and some of the guile for instance when i want to use those who have passed on i do so and when i dont i invent means to deceive them  mrs quigg caught me up on that can you deceive them  i dont know that i do really but at any rate they are not always mindreadersthat i have proved very conclusively in all my experience i have never had any satisfactory evidence of the clairvoyance of these manifesting intelligences  i thought they could read ones every thought  i do not find that they can read so much as one of my thoughts and i would not invest a dollar on their recommendations seldom does so much as a familiar name come up in my sittings and no message of any intimate sort has ever come from the shadow world for me the messages are intelligent but below rather than above the average they always seem very fallible very human to me and nothing they do startles me i have no patience with those who make much of the morbid side of this business to me it is neither theism nor diabolism and is neither destruction of an old religion or the basis of a new onebut all this verges on the controversial and is not good for our psychic lets sing some good old tune like suwanee river or lily dale we must keep to the genial side of conversation spread your hands wide on the table and be as comfortable as you can we may have to wait a long time now all on millers account  because he is a sceptic  no because hes belligerent i answered it doesnt matter whether you believe or not if you do not stir up controversy millers suggestion is adverse to the serenity of the psychic thats all the oldtime sleepy backparlor logic has no weight with me maxwell and flammarion are my guides  for four hours we sat thus and nothing happened how i kept them at it i do not now understand but they stayed we sang joked told stories gossiped in desperate effort to kill time and not one rap tap or crackle came to guide us or to give indication of the presence of any unusual power part of the time mrs smiley was awake and sorely grieved at her failure she understood very well the position in which i seemed to stand to miller i was a dupe the victim of a trickster he himself afterward confessed that at the time he almost regretted his preternatural acuteness and was ready to take himself away in order to let the show go on but he didnt and from time to time i encouraged our psychic by saying never mind mrs smiley there are other evenings to come we will not despair  at last she sank into profound sleep and at exactly twelve oclock i heard a faint tapping on top of the piano just behind miller hooray here they are i exclaimed with vast relief what is the matter i asked of the presence arent we sitting right  no was the answer by means of one decided tap  am i right  no answered the taps  i may explain at this point that in the accepted code of signals one tap means no three taps mean yes and two taps dont know will try or any other doubtful state of mind one has of course to guess at the precise meaning but one may confirm ones interpretation by putting it in the form of a question that can be answered by yes or no  shall i change with miller i asked  three brisk taps made affirmative answer  i exchanged places with miller but did not again touch mrs smileys hand immediately thereafter the sound of soft drumming came from the piano at a point entirely out of reach of the psychic and at my request the drummer kept time to my whistling after some minutes of this foolery the force left the piano abruptly as if with a leap and dropped to the middle of the table a light fumbling noise followed and i called out is every hand in the circle accounted for  while the members of the group were in turn assuring me of this a small bell on the table was taken up and rung and the table itself was shoved powerfully toward the circle and away from the psychic i assure you my sitters were profoundly interested now and some of the women were startled a sharp pecking sound came upon the cone i called attention to the fact that this took place at least six feet from the psychic and a moment later with intent to detect her in any movement i leaned far forward so that my head came close to her breast i could not discern the slightest motion i could not even hear her breathe all this while very impressive to me was referred by the others to trickery on mrs smileys part  at my request the drumming on the cone kept time to dixey and yankee doodle and at length i said to the spirit you must have liked topical songs when you were on the earthplane  instantly the cone was swept violently from the table and a deep jovial strong whisper came from the horn to me i do now was the amazing answer  who are you i asked  wilbur thompson  oh it is you is it well i am glad youve found a voice i felt rather helpless up to this moment are we sitting right  all right  what are you going to do for us tonight can you raise the table  ill try he whispered again  are there other spirits here  yes many  cant they write their names on the pad  there was a moments silence and then the sound of writing began in the middle of the table when this had finished i said did you succeed  again the cone rose and another whisper a fainter voice answered yes but the writing is very miserable  the rest of the sitters were silent with amazement till miller said in a tone of disgust that is of no value it is so easy for howard or some one else to break the circle and write or speak through the cone  yes well have to trust one another for tonight i admitted  the psychic now began to twist and moan and struggle choking gasping in such evident suffering that mrs cameron cried out mr garland dont you hear she is ill let me go to her  dont be alarmed i replied this struggle almost always precedes her strongest manifestations it seems cruel to say so but remember mrs smiley has been through these paroxysms hundreds of times it appears very painful and exhausting but she has assured me that they take care of her she suffers almost no ill effects from her trance  miller living up to his character as remorseless scientist remarked id like to control her hands shall i try  not now not till the guides consent to it i replied it is said to be dangerous to the psychic to touch her unexpectedly  i can understand that it might be inconvenient remarked harris with biting brevity  again we sat in expectant silence until several of the group became restless what is she about now asked cameron wearily  she is in dead trance apparently please be patient a little while longer are you still with us wilbur  i was delighted to hear the three taps that answer yes  will you be able to do something more for us  tap tap tapgiven apparently with the pencil  i observed from a strictly scientific standpoint the movement of that pencil provided it can be proved to have taken place without the agency of any known form of force is as important as the fall of a mountain it heralds a new day in science is every hand accounted for each answered yes at this moment there was a rustling at the base of the cone listen they are at work with the horn  the cone rocked slowly on its base and at last leaped over the shoulders of the sitters and fell with a crash to the floor mercy on us gasped mrs cameron  dont touch it dont move i called out everybody clasp hands now here is a chance for a fine test wilbur can you put the cone back on the table  tap tap answered wilbur the two taps were given slowly and i understood them to mean dont know or will try  miller i said impressively unless some one of our circle is betraying us we are having as good a demonstration as we could expect barring the absence of light be watchful wilbur were trusting to you now lets see what you can do  as i spoke the horn with a ringing scrape left the carpet and a moment later bumped down upon mrs quiggs head oh she shrieked it hit me  almost immediately a breathy chuckle came from the horn ha ha that shook you up a little i reckon  the other women were frozen with horror dont let it touch me pleaded miss brush  and mrs quigg much shaken called out frank howard are you doing this  he was highly indignant certainly not are you not holding one hand and miss brush the other i am innocent i swear it  i commented on their dialogue severely see how you all treat an event that is wonderful enough to convulse the national academy of science i do not believe the psychics hands have moved an inch and yet unless some one of you is false to his trust the miraculous has happenedare you there wilbur i queried of the mystic presence  the cone swung toward me and wilbur answered i am old horse  well wilbur there are two bigoted scientific people here tonight and i want you to put them to everlasting rout  ill do it dont you worry replied the voice and the cone dropped with a bang on the table again making everybody jump  that brought the gooseflesh remarked wilbur with humorous satisfaction  i took a malicious delight in the mystification of my fellows go down and shake up young howard at the foot of the table i suggested he is a little in the conjuring line himself  almost instantly howard cried out the blooming thing is touching me on the ear  observe called i in the tone of a man exhibiting some kind of trained animal the cone is now at least six feet from the psychics utmost reach how do you account for that miller  the boy lied said miller curtly  howard was offended ill take that out of you old chap when we meet in the street i am telling the squaretoed truth i am not doing a thing but hold two very scared ladies hands  oh come now i interposed if we are to be so tarnal suspicious of one another we might just as well give up the sitting if each of us must be padlocked proof of any phenomenon is impossible  a firmer hand now seemed to grasp the cone and a deep whisper that was almost a tone came from it you are right this new personality said with measured and precise utterance we come with the best tests of a supremely important revelation we come as scientists from our side of the line and you scoff and take it all as a piece of folly as an entertainment is this just no it is unworthy men of science  you are entirely justified in your indignation i responded but who are you  my name on the earthplane was mitchell  i am glad to make your acquaintance mr mitchell and your rebuke is deserved i for one mean to proceed in this matter seriously what can you do for us tonight  be very patient carry this investigation forward and this psychic will astonish the world do not abuse her do not tax her beyond her strength he spoke with the precise and rather pedantic accent of an old gentleman nurtured on the classics and produced upon me a distinct impression of age and serious demeanor utterly different from the rollicking not too refined wilbur  i will see that she is treated fairly mr mitchell but of course this is not a rigid test will you be able to permit conditions more convincing  yes very much more convincing he replied slowly and ponderously but do not worry the instrument tonight narrow your circle be harmonious and not too eager and you will be abundantly rewarded  wont you tell me who you were on the earthplane  i was a friend of the father of the instrument he answered  the horn returned to the table quietly and young howard was the first to speak that is a fine piece of ventriloquism any way you look at it said he it is a nice trick to give that peculiar tinny sound to a whisper  so far as i can judge so far as my sense of hearing goes and i have kept my ear close to the psychics face mrs smiley has not moved nor uttered a sound what is your verdict mr cocksure scientist  for the first time millers voice indicated some slight hesitation i havent been able to detect any movement on the part of the psychic he replied but of course i cant answer for the rest of the company the performance has no scientific value in the dark deceit is easy harris may be the ventriloquist  why not accuse the archconspirator of us all our director exclaimed mrs quigg  you flatter me i responded if i could produce those voices i would go on the vaudeville stage tomorrow i give you my word i am acting in entire good faith i am quite as eager for the truth as any of youbut hark the cone is on the wing again  the megaphone was indeed moving as if a weak unskilled hand were struggling with it and at last it swung feebly into the air and a whisper that was hardly more than a breath was directed toward mrs quigg daughter  are you speaking to me she asked in a voice that trembled a little  the answer was but a sibilant sigh yes  who are you  mother  the answer was so faint that no one save mrs quigg could distinguish the word almost at the same moment i caught the sound of other moving lips in the air just before me who is it i asked like a little hopeless sigh the answer came jessie this was the name of my younger sister then the cone dropped as though falling from exhausted hands and i had no further message from this spirit  as we waited breathlessly the clear silversweet voice of a little girl was heard by every one at the table goodevening everybody i am maud i came with my mamma i have come to ask you to be very kind to her  i am very glad to hear you maud i answered are there other spirits present  yes many many spirits my grandpa is here he is treating my mamma so that she will not be sick some one is here to see you but is too weak to speak my grandpa says we are trusting you  with astonishing clearness this voice created in my mind not as light would create it the vision of a selfcontained womanly little girl whose voice and accent formed a curious silvery replica of the psychics and yet i could not say that the psychics vocal organs gave out these words at last she said goodbye and the cone was softly laid upon the table  all of this was performed in profound silence there was no sound in the cone except that of the voice no rustle of garments no grasp of fingers on the tin and though i leaned far over and once more placed my ear close to the psychics lips i could not trace the slightest movement connecting her with the movements on the table i had the conviction at the moment that she sat in a deathlike trance at my side  a few moments later the cone was jammed together and thrown upon the floora movement i had learned to know that announced that the sitting was ended  while the sitters still waited i said now cameron you may turn on the gas but do so very slowly mrs smiley seems in deep sleep and we are warned not to startle her  when the light became strong enough to see a form we found our psychic sitting limply her head drooping sidewise her eyes closed her face white and calm the cone was lying not far from her chair separated into two parts the threads that bound her to her seat were to all appearance precisely as at the beginning of the sitting except that they were deeply sunk into the flesh of her wrists her chair had not moved a hairsbreadth from the chalkmarks on the floor  a moment later she opened her eyes and smiling rather wanly asked of me did anything happen  oh yes a great deal wilbur came and maud and mr mitchell  i am very glad she answered with a faint happy smile  mrs cameron bent to her pityingly how do you feel  very numb but ill be all right in a very short time my wrists hurt your thread is very tight my arms always swell please give me a drink of water  as i held the glass to her lips i was consciencesmitten to think that for five hours she had been sitting in this constrained positiona martyr to science but i deferred the moment of her release till miller had examined every bond i used a small pair of scissors to cut the thread out of the deep furrows in her wrist and it took a quarter of an hour of chafing to restore her arms to their normal condition all of which had a convincing effect upon the doubters  miss brush was indignant i think it is a shame the way you have treated your psychic  oh this is nothing responded mrs smiley id be unhappy and uneasy if you didnt tie me im like the old mans chickens youve heard the story he had moved so much that the chickens whenever they saw him put a cover on his wagon would lie down and cross their feet to be tied  after mrs cameron had taken mrs smiley to the diningroom for a cup of tea the rest of us remained staring at one another  now which of us did that i asked  so far as the psychic was concerned i dont see how she could have had any hand in it said miller but then it was all in the dark  i had to admit that this diminished the value of the experiment but now listen i said as we all seem to be suspicious of one another i propose that we resort to a process of elimination i shall take mitchells advice and narrow the circle howard you are a suspect you are ruled out of the next sitting  oh no protested howard that isnt fair i did nothing i swear  you admit being a prestidigitator  yes but i had nothing to do with this performance  nevertheless so far as conclusive proof is concerned your presence in the circle invalidates it now i propose that mrs smiley go to millers house with no one present but mr and mrs cameron and mr and mrs miller if we secure these same phenomena under millers conditions we will then readmit one by one the entire membership of the society  mrs quigg resented being left out and i pretended surprise  i thought from what you had said that these dark shows were of no value  the next one ought to have decided value if professor miller has any share in the test she answered quickly i believe in him  and not in me thats a nice thing to say  i mean in his method he is a cold calm merciless scientist youre a man of imagination  thank you said i my critics would take issue with you there however if we get anywhere in this campaign we must begin with the smallest possible circle and slowly enlarge it we hope also to increase the amount of light  after some further argument cameron settled the matter by saying garland is right and to show my own scientific temper i rule mrs cameron and myself out of the next sitting that will put the whole problem up to miller and garland  miller and i walked away to the club together pondering deeply on the implications of the nights performance  i dont see how it was done miller repeated certainly she did not rise from her chair not for an instant and yet to believe that she did not have a hand in what took place is to admit the impossible you have had other sittings with her havent you you believe in her  yes i think she is sincere but possibly selfdeceived the fact that she is willing to put herself into our hands in this way is most convincing  there is nothing of the trickster about her appearance and yet i wish she had permitted us to hold her hands tonight  miller said i earnestly if youll go with me into this experimentation with an open mind ill convince you that crookes and flammarion are the true scientists it is the fashion to smile at flammarion as a romantic astronomer but i cant see now that he is lacking in patience and caution for all his rather fervid utterances he keeps his head and goes on patiently investigating he has had more experience than even crookes or lombroso for forty years he has been searching the dark for these strange forces and yet he says we create in these séances an imaginary being we speak to it and in its replies it almost always reflects the mentality of the experimenter spirits have taught us nothing they have not led science forward a single step i must say that if there are spirits or beings independent of us in action they know no more than we do about the other worlds and yet as regards the physical facts of mediumship he sustains all the investigators these phenomena exist he says  candidly garland what is your own belief asked miller a few moments later  i evaded him i have seen enough to make me believe in zöllners fourth dimension but i dont my mind is so constructed that such wonders as we have seen tonight produce very little effect on me they are as normal to me now as the popping of corn or the roasting of potatoes as i say i have demonstrated certain of these physical doings but as for beliefwell that is not a matter of the will but of evidence and the evidence is not yet sufficient to bring me to any definite conclusion in fact in the broad day and especially the second day after i have been through one of these astounding experiences i begin to doubt my senses richet speaks of this curious recession of belief and admits his own inability to retain the conviction that at the moment of the phenomenon was complete no sooner is the sitting over than my doubts come swarming back upon me he says the real world which surrounds us with its prejudices its schemes of habitual opinions holds us in so strong a grasp that we can scarcely free ourselves completely certainty does not follow on demonstration but on habit and in that saying you have my own mental limitations admirably put  miller plodded along by my side in silence for a few minutes and then asked abruptly what is the real reason that you keep up the fiction of the guide when you dont believe in him  for the reason that i think mrs smiley honest in her faith and that to be polite to the guides is one of the first requisites of a successful sitting suppose the whole action to be terrestrial suppose each successful sitting to be as flammarion suggests nothing but a subtle adjustment of our collective consciousness to hers cant you see how necessary it is that we should proceed with her full consent after an immense experience following closely crookes de rochas lodge richet duclaux lombroso and ochorowicz maxwell says i believe in these phenomena but i see no need to attribute them to any supernatural intervention i am inclined to think they are produced by some force within ourselves  just what does he mean by that  i cant precisely explain its harder to understand than the spirit hypothesis he himself admits this and goes on to say that while he is certain that we are in the presence of an unknown force he is convinced that the phenomena will ultimately be found orderly like all other facts of nature therefore in the critical state of research the scientific problem it seems to me is not whether spiritism be true or false but whether metapsychical phenomena are real or imaginary some future newton will discover a more complete formula than ours he prophesies every natural fact should be studied and if it be real incorporated in the patrimony of knowledge he then adds with the true scientists humble acknowledgment of the infinite reach of the undiscovered universe our knowledge is very limited and our experience young  that is good talk said miller in reply but the question is does he really experiment in that condition of mind an astronomer with his eye to a telescope is a highly specialized and competent being an astronomer listening to whispers in the dark may be as simple and credulous as a child  i grant all that but i see in it the greater reason why men like yourself should take up the investigation of these illusive and disturbing problems these phenomena as flammarion says introduce us into uncharted seas and we need the most cautious and clearestsighted scientists in this world as pilots will you be one of them  you flatter me as a matter of fact im a very poor sailor he answered with a smile     iv   if there is any one thing true in these manifestations of spirit power it is that the psychic is the agent for their production actively or passively consciously or unconsciously she completes the formulaher odic force is the final chemical which permits precipitation sometimes her will to produce her wish to serve hinders rather than helps often when she is most persistent nothing happens sometimes an aching foot or a disturbing thought cuts off all phenomena for the best results apparently the psychic should be confident easy of mind and not too anxious to please  i approached this sitting at millers house with some fear that it might end in disappointment to him and be a source of chagrin to mrs smiley the house was strange our attitude intensely critical and she was very anxious to succeed it would be remarkable indeed if under these conditions she were able to meet us halfway as we walked up the street together i did my best to reassure her  you may trust me fully mrs smiley said i and miller though an inexorable scientist is a gentleman i am sure he will not insist on any experiment which will injure your health or give you needless pain this is but our second sitting and i for one do not expect you to be at your best  i hope we will have good work she replied earnestly but it is always harder to sit for tests tell me about mrs miller is she nice will i like her  she is very gentle and considerate you will like her at once i am sure she will be a help to you  her voice was very sincere as she said you dont know how anxiously i watch the makeup of my circle it isnt because i am afraid of sceptics i have no fear of those who do not believe but each person brings such diverse influences and these influences conflict and worry me and then nothing takes place i dont want to disappoint you and your friends and that may hinder me  the millers occupied a modest little house far uptown and were suburban almost rural in their manner of living the chemist himself met us at the door and after greeting us cordially ushered us into his library which was a small room at the back of the hall i observed that it had only one door and two windows rather high up in the east wallan excellent place for our sitting  so this is the den of inquisition i began and turning to mrs smiley i added i hope you are not chilled by it  not a bit she answered cheerily  as mrs miller a quiet little woman not so far removed from mrs smileys own type entered the door and greeted us both the psychics face lighted up with pleasure this argued well for our experiment  i could see that miller had made careful preparation along the lines of my suggestion a plain old table was standing lengthwise of the room the windows were hung with shawls and a worn hickory chair stood with arms widespread to seize its victim after surveying the room mrs smiley turned to me with a note of satisfaction in her voice and said i like this room and this furniture i feel the right associations here the air is full of spirit power  i am glad your mind is at ease said i for i am anxious for a very conclusive sitting you tell mitchell that miller is decidedly worth converting i want wilbur to do his best for i intend to tighten the bonds on you tonight  she fearlessly faced me i am in your hands mr garland do as you like mr mitchell told me this morning that he would yet convince you of the reality of the spirit world he is assembling all the forces at his command and will certainly do everything in his power  i am delighted to get that assurance i responded  you are to sit here said miller indicating the hickory chair which he had placed near the north wall  she took her seat meekly placing her hands resignedly on the wings of the chair i like this chair she said with a smile it is so oldfashioned  now said i i am going to ask mrs miller to fasten this long tape about your ankles we mean to take every precaution in order that you may not involuntarily or subconsciously move your limbs  under close scrutiny mrs miller secured each foot in such wise that the knots came in the middle of the tape and to make untying them absolutely impossible i drew the two ends of the long ribbon back under the psychics chair and tacked them securely to the shelf of a bookcase about two feet from the hind legs to loosen them was entirely out of our victims power  miller then unreeled a spool of silk twist and this i tied squarely to the arm of the chair at a point about six feet from the loose end which i intended to hold i knotted the silk about the psychics wrists drawing it to a hard knot each time and gave the spool to miller while retaining the loose end of the thread in my own hands the psychic could neither touch the tips of her fingers together nor lift her arms an inch from the chair she was as secure as if bound with a rope but as an extra precaution i passed the thread beneath the chairarm and pulled it taut this will enable us to feel the lightest movement of her hands i said to miller who had copied my device are you satisfied with the conditions  he answered with some reservation they will do i would like to have light but that i suppose is impossible  no not impossible replied mrs smiley but the work is always weaker in the light the voices are stronger in the dark  mrs miller took her seat exactly opposite mrs smiley i was at her right miller after turning out the gas sat opposite me and at the psychics left  at first the room was black as ink but by degrees i from my position opposite the window was able to perceive a faint glow of light through the curtain mrs smileys back was near a wall of books and the room being narrow millers chair pretty well filled the space between the table and the window behind it the action of a confederate was excluded by reason of the bolted door to enter the room by the window was impossible for the reason that the slightest noise could be heard and the least movement of the curtain would admit the light barring the darkness conditions were all of our own making  however we were hardly settled in place when miller was moved to further precaution mrs smiley i would like to pin over your dress a newspaper so that any slightest movement of your knees or feet could be heard do you object  not at all she instantly replied i am sure my guides will do anything they can to meet your wishes you may nail my dress to the floor if you wish  miller turned on the light and together we pinned a large crisp newspaper over her knees and tacked it securely to the floor in front of her feet the corners where the pins were inserted were well out of the reach of her tethered hands  again the lights were lowered and at my direction miller placed his right hand on the psychics left and touched fingers with mrs miller i did the same thus connecting the circle in this way we sat quietly conversing for some time  i want to make it quite plain to you i said to them all that i am trying to follow crookess advice which is to strip away all romance and all superstitious religious ideas from this subject i am insisting on the normal character of these phenomena whatever happens tonight mrs miller please do not be alarmed there is nothing inherently uncanny or unwholesome in these phenomena no one knows better than your husband the essential mystery of the simplest fact materialization for example is unusual but if it happens it cannot be supernatural nothing is supernatural am i right miller  we explain each mystery by a deeper mystery he replied  all depends upon the point of view i am interested in these obscure phases of human life if they are real they are natural to me the spiritistic demonstrations are intensely human and absorbingly interesting as dramatic material and yet i hope i am sufficiently the scientist to be alive to the significance of these telekinetic happenings and enough of the realist to remain critical in the midst of the wildest carnival of the invisible forces  dont you believe in them asked mrs miller with a note of surprise in her voice  i replied cautiously i am at this moment convinced of the reality of some of these phenomena by reason of my own experiments but leaving one side my personal investigation i must believe that crookes maxwell and flammarion are competent witnesses as to spiritualismwell that is another matter  but where does all this lead to if not to spiritualism asked mrs miller  as to the exact country no one knows i answered but the best of our experimenters are agreed that the gate opens upon a new field of science these powers seem to be in advance of us and not a survival and they may prove of value in the evolution of the race that is why i want to enlist men like your husband in the work mediumship needs just such critical attention as his nothing like maxwell or richets thoroughness of method has ever been used by an american physicist so far as i know on the contrary our leading scientific men seem to have let the subject severely alone  why asked mrs smiley  partly because of inherited prejudice and partly because of their allegiance to opposing theories and finally i suspect because they are connected with institutions that would not sanction such work you can imagine how the physical department of a denominational college would investigate spirit phenomena it was much the same way in england during the early part of last century but they are far in advance of us now the first notable step in the right direction was takenas perhaps you may knowin 1869 by the dialectical society of london which appointed a committee to look into the subject of spiritualism with the expectation no doubt of being able to stop the spread of the delusion  the investigations which followed were under the especial charge of alfred russel wallace cromwell varley chief of electrical engineers and telegraphers and professor morgan president of the mathematical society this committee after careful investigation reported voluminously to this effect the phenomena exist there is a force capable of moving heavy bodies without material contact which force is in some unknown way dependent upon the presence of human beings  which was a long way from saying that spiritism was true remarked miller  it certainly was sufficiently vague you would think to be harmless but several of the committee refused to join in even this cautious report insisting that the conclusions ought to be verified by some other scientist they suggested sir william crookes who was at this time in the early prime of his life and a renowned chemistjust the man for the work this suggestion was acted upon by crookes a little later and his report on this psychic force had a good deal to do with the formation of the now famous society for psychical research  id hate to be held responsible for that said miller with humorous intentof all the collections of hants and witches  on the continent scientific observation had already begun count agénor de gasparin of valleyeres was one of the first to take up this problem of telekinesis in the modern spirit he made a long and complicated study of tabletipping in 1853 and published his conclusions in two large volumes in paris a year later his experiments were careful and searching and drew the line squarely between the supernatural and the natural he said positively the agency is not supernatural it is physical and determined by the will of the sitters and may be called the charles darwin of the subject a year later professor marc thury of geneva added his testimony he also said the phenomena exist and are mainly due to an unknown fluid or force which rushes from the organism of certain people to this force he gave the name psyscode the spirit hypothesis he was inclined to think was not impossible or even absurd he used absurd in the scientific sense of course  it is the most natural thing in the world to me said mrs smiley i would be desolate without it  some ten years later flammarion the renowned french astronomer began his studies of these unknown forces and for a long time fought the battle alone in france as sir william crookes endured the brunt of the assault in england  miller here interposed with a covert sneer in his voice yes but flammarion has always had the reputation of being more of the romancer than of the astronomer  you scientists do him an injustice i answered with some heat just as you have all been ignorantly contemptuous of crookes i confess i used to share in some small degree your estimate of flammarion but if you will read his latest book with attention and with candor you cannot but be impressed with his wide experience and his patient persistent search for the truth i am persuaded that he has been a genuine pioneer all along i cannot see but that he has examined very critically the scores of psychics who have come under his observation and his reports are painstaking and cautious his work must be considered by every student of this subject it wont do to neglect the words of a man who has seen so muchbut here we go along lines of controversy when we should be sitting in quiet harmony let us defer our discussion until after our séance have patience and i believe we can duplicate if not surpass the marvellous doings of even richet and lombroso we may be able some day to take flashlight photographs of the cone while it is floating in the air  has that ever been done asked mrs miller  oh yes flammarion secured photos of a table floating in the air these pictures show conclusively that the psychic had nothing to do with itat least not in any ordinary way richet succeeded in fixing the apparition of a helmeted soldier on several plates crookes photographed katie king and her medium once or twice and fontenay has succeeded in getting clearcut images of the spirit hands which play round the head of paladino but it must be confessed that in crookess pictures there is a lack of finality in the negatives he never succeeded in getting the faces of both katie and miss cook at the same timeand richets photographs have a madeup look  passing abruptly to a low humming song i made the attempt to put our psychic to sleep in a few minutes her hands became cold and began to flutter at last she threw my fingers away as if she found them scorching hot millers hand was similarly repulsed she then seemed to pass into quiet sleep and i said withdraw a little miller but keep your silk thread taut  almost immediately faint raps came upon the table and i asked are you there mitchell  tap tap tapyes  are we sitting right  tap tap tapyes answered the force in a grave and deliberate way  as to these raps i remarked they are easily simulated but they have been absolutely proven by several of our best investigators they have been obtained on a sheet of paper held in the air on pencils on a strip of cloth on an open umbrellaunder every possible condition maxwell secured them by pinching his own ear or by squeezing the arm of his neighbor i have heard them on a mans shirtfront they are the first manifestations of intelligent spirit power and may be regarded in the light of established fact  i wouldnt be hasty about admitting even that remarked miller in the darkor in the lightthese obscure sounds may seem very ghostly and yet be due to purely physical causes  we sat in silence for a few moments and at last i asked is any spirit present  almost immediately a childish voice came from the direction of the psychic apparently issuing from her lips mr mitchell would like to have you tie the threads to the legs of the table  are you maud i asked  yes i am maudie she answered mr mitchell wants to try some experiment he wishes you to tie the threads to the legs of the table  i confess i didnt like the looks of this but as a compromise measure i was willing to grant it if you dont object miller we will do as the guides desire  he hesitated it weakens our test i dont understand the reason for the demand  i suggest we yield the point for the present perhaps they will permit us to resume the thread a little later i have found that by apparently meeting the forces halfway at the beginning we often get concessions later which will be of greater value than the tests we have ourselves devised  accordingly i tied my end of the silk twist to the table leg at a distance of about twentysix inches from the utmost reach of the psychics hands miller did the same with his end we then resumed our seats and waited for over an hour  during this time the psychic was absolutely silent and apparently in deep trance and i was beginning to feel both disappointed and chagrined millers tone was a bit irritating i knew exactly what was in his mind ive fixed her now he was exultantly saying to himself she cant do a thing even her request to have the threads tied to the table does not avail her accustomed to have everything her own way she fails the first time any real restraint is applied to her  i was quite at the end of my confident expectancy when the psychic began to stir uneasily and maudie spoke complaining of the thread on her mothers right wrist its so tight it stops the blood she said please loosen the thread a little you may turn up the light added the little voice  while miller gave me a light i loosened the thread on her right wrist which was very tight but i tied a second thread about her arm in such wise that i would surely know at the end of the sitting if it had been disturbed the table i observed at the time was more than two feet from her fingertips i called millers attention to this and said she cant possibly untie these threads and if she breaks them the sitting is invalidated  soon after the light was turned out maudie requested that we all move away from mrs smiley down to the lower end of the table and although miller thought this permitted too much liberty of action on the part of the medium i urged consent there are other sittings coming i repeated once more  mrs smiley fell again into deep sleep but nothing took place for a long time during this period of waiting i told stories of my experience and the curious folk i had met in search for the true explanation of these singular phenomena  have you ever witnessed any materializations asked mrs miller  yes but none of it was of the sort that i could swear to i mean that it seemed to me to be either downright trickery or subconscious actions on the part of the psychic and yet ive seen some very puzzling phantoms i am persuaded that a great deal of what is called fraud arises from the suggestibility of the psychics lombroso speaks of this fixed idea of the mediums and their persistent almost insane attempt to produce the phenomena desired by the circle you can understand how this would be if there is anything at all in hypnotism sometimes it all seems to belong to the realm of hypnotic visions one medium helps another to build up this unreal world early in my career as an investigator i went to onset bay where in july of each year all the spiritualists and mejums of new england used to gather do yet i believe and i shall never forget the singular assemblage of slatewriters spirit artists spirit photographers palmists and psychometrists whose signs lined the street and pointed along the paths of the camp  in its way it was as dramatic a contrast of light and shade of the real and the unreal as this otherwise prosaic republic can show there under the vivid summer sun beside the glittering sea men and women met to commune on the incommunicable to question the voiceless and to embrace the intangible it was indeed such a revelation of human credulity as might well have overpowered a young novelist from the warm pinescented afternoon air i crept into one of these tiny cabins and sat with my hands upon a closed slate in order to receive a message from lincoln or cæsar i slipped beneath the shelter of a tent to have a sealed letter read by a commonplace person with an indian accent and i sat at night in dark little parlors to watch weak men and weeping women embrace very badly designed effigies of their lost darlings  isnt it incredible can you imagine any reasonable person believing such things asked miller  millions do i replied  please go on entreated mrs miller what happened to you  nothing really worth reporting upon in that day of utter credulity no tests were possible but immediately after my return to boston i had my first entirely satisfactory test of the occult i went with mrs rose one of our members to sit for independent slatewritingthat is to say writing on the inner surfaces of closed slates up to this moment i was profoundly sceptical but i could not doubt the reality of what happened i took my own slatesthe ordinary hinged school slates but whether they were my own or not made no difference really for the final test which i demanded was such that any prepared slates were useless im not going into tiresome detail i only say that while sitting at the table with both mrs roses hands and my own resting upon the slates i dictated certain lines to be drawn upon the inside of the slates  millers voice expressed growing interest and this was done  it was done i had in mind the test which alfred russel wallace had used in a similar case he dictated several words to be written while holding the slates securely in his own hands in this instance i asked for the word constantinople to be written the psychic smiled shrugged her shoulders and replied ill try but i dont believe they can spell it draw a straight line then said i ill be content with a single line an inch long she laughingly retorted its hard to draw a straight line very well draw a crooked line draw a zigzaglike a stroke of lightning draw it in yellow draw a circle she said no more but became silent and we waited without change of position remember that i was holding the slate during all this talk it did not leave my hands  what were the conditions was it light asked miller  it was about two oclock of an afternoon and we sat in the baywindow of the parlor it was perfectly light no one moved the psychic sat opposite us leaning back in a thoughtful pose her hands lay in her lap and she seemed to be merely waiting at last a tapping came upon the slate and she brightened up it is done she called exultingly i opened the slates myself and there drawn in yellow crayon was a small circle with a zigzag yellow line crossing it exactly as i had dictated and under mrs roses hands in the corner of the slate was a gayly colored bunch of pansies there were messages also but i paid very little attention to them the production of that circle under those conditions overshadowed everything else it was a definite and complete answer to my doubt it was in fact a miracle i recall going directly to a meeting of the society and reporting upon this sitting you will find the bald statement of my experiment in the minutes of the secretary  miller was silent for a moment then asked youre sure it was done after you took the slates in hand  i am as certain of it as i am of anything  how do you account for it of course it was a trick  trickery cant account for that yellow line the messages could have been written beforehand but no trick of prepared slates can account for my dictated design i have had other cases of slatewriting which were almost as inexplicable and crookes and wallace and zöllner as you remember were quite convinced by evidence thus secured crookes saw the pencil at work i have never witnessed the writing but i have heard it at work under my hands and i have felt it under my feet i have had writing on ten separate pages in a closed manilapad held between my hands  miller seemed to be impressed by these statements i have always considered slatewriting a cheap trick but i dont quite see how that was donealways providing your memory is not at fault  i would not place much dependence on my present recollection i frankly responded but i reported on the case at once while my mind was most accurate as to details speaking further of these tricks if you choose to call them such i have had several failures where the failure meant as much as a success i have held two slates with a psychic while we were both standing when the creaking and scratching and grinding went on between my hands i give you my word i was convinced at the moment of holding between my palms a sentient force i felt as franklin must have felt when he played with the lightning in the bottle at the tail of his kite once i heard the writing going on in a halfopened slate but i did not see the pencil in motion some of these cases of directwriting are the most convincing of all my experiences people ask me why i didnt talk with the spirits about heaven and angels i was not interested in their religious notions i kept to this one linei wanted to see a particle of matter move from a to b without a known push or pull i paid very little attention to trancemediums like mrs piper and although i saw a great deal of what is called mindreading and thoughttransference i did not permit the cart to get before the horse independent slatewriting interested me for the reason that i could put the clamps on it materialization on the contrary is so staged and arranged for that to prove its genuineness seems impossible at present but slatewriting under your hand is a different matter  id like to have it under my hand said miller grimly  you can have it if youll go after it i retorted and you can have it hard  mrs miller was deeply interested tell us more have you had other messages written in that wonderful way  yes many of them one of the most curious examples of this kind i have ever seen came to me in chicago it was a new one as howard would say old mr macvicker told me one day that there was a woman on the west side who had a trick of producing independent slatewriting beneath the stem of a goblet of water  why under a goblet of water interrupted miller  as a test you see nearly every one who goes to a psychic wants first of all to witness a miracle each seeker demands that his particular message shall come hardthat is to say under conditions impossible to the living his reasoning is like this the dead are free from the limitations of our life therefore they should manifest themselves to us as befits their wider knowledge of the laws of the universe and especially is it their business to outdo the most skilful conjurer hence each man insists on locked slates and sealed letters these the poor psychics are forced to grant to be just to them i must say that i have found most mediums fairly willing to meet any reasonable test in fact many of them seem perfectly confident of the inscrutable and venture upon what seems to be the impossible with amazing imperturbability all they ask is to be treated like human beings they are seldom afraid of results sometimes they bully the forces sadly and make them work when they dont want to  well this particular psychic ushered me into her back parlor which was flooded with sunlight and asked me to be seated at a small table covered with a strip of cloth she was a comfortable plump person evidently from kansas in manner somewhat like the humorous wife of a prosperous village carpenter i remember that we were rather sympathetic on various political questions after some remarks on populism and other weighty matters she filled a goblet with water and placing it upon a slate passed it under the table with her right hand asking me to put my hand beneath hers  there it is said miller with infinite scorn always in the dark or under the table no wonder emerson called it a rathole philosophy  suppose its all the work of an astral who cant abide the light i suggested  i know the theory but i cant allow it  why not you permit the photographer his darkroom  then with malicious delight in his petulance i calmly continued i put my left hand beneath hers and my right upon the table i could see her left hand lying in her lap and as she turned sidewise to the table i was able to keep in view both of her feet we held the slate so that the top of the goblet lightly touched the under side of the stand the psychic was all accounted for except the hand which was resting outspread on the under side of the slate we sat for several minutes in this way while she explained that they would probably take words out of our conversation as a test if i desired it i am here to be shown i replied she laughed at me and on two different occasions brought the slate from beneath the table with writing under the stem of the goblet this was all very well but i said a better test would be to have them write words that i dictate  i will ask them she said she seemed to listen as if to voices inaudible to me and at last said they will try it  again we placed the goblet of water on the clean slate under the table and while holding it as before i said now ask them to write the name william dean howells  almost immediately there was a decided movement of the slateor so it seemed to me a power seemed to wake on the slate not through the psychics hand but independent of it i heard plainly the scratching of a pencil at the same time that the psychics left hand and both of her feet were in full view and at the same time that her hand was outspread apparently motionless upon the under side of the slate in a few moments the scratching paused and the psychic with an embarrassed smile said they dont know how to spell the middle name  that is to say she was the one who could not spell the name said miller  thats what i thought at the time but i helped her out and a moment later a decided tapping on the top of the table announced the completion of the task  as she slowly drew the slate out from under the table i was alert to see what had happened the glass remained in the middle of the slate as before with the water undiminished and under the glass and confining itself to the circle of the stem were the words                               william                                dean                              howells  written as though acknowledging the barrier of the glass where its edge rested upon the slate  wonderful exclaimed mrs miller  are you sure the writing was there as she drew the slate out queried miller  yes i saw the writing as she was removing the goblet and while with her left hand she drew a little circle around the outer edge of the stem i read the words now to say that the psychic wrote this with her fingernail on the bottom of the slate and then turned the slate over is to me absurd the glass of water prevented that and yet she did it in some occult way the transaction remains unexplained to me i am perfectly sure she willed it but how she caused the writingthe physical changeis quite another problem zöllner i believe it was secured the print of feet on the inside of a closed slate and reasoned that only on the theory of a fourth dimension could such phenomena be explained that reminds me of a sitting i once had with a young man wherein to utterly confound us the invisible hands removed his undershirt while his coatsleeves were nailed to the chair  oh come now you dont expect us to believe a miracle like that even on your serious statement remarked miller  i certainly do not i responded readily i wouldnt believe it on any ones statement that is the discouraging thing about this whole business you cant convince any one by any amount of evidence a man will stand out against zöllner crookes lodge and myers discounting all the rest of the great investigators and then crumple up like a caterpillar at the first touch of the invisible hand when it comes to him directly this same young man gave me the most convincing demonstrations of materialized forms i have ever seen in his own little home under the simplest conditions he commanded forth from a little bedroom a figure which was unmistakably not a mechanism a lamp was burning in the room and the young fellow was perfectly visible at the same moment as the phantom which stood and bowed three times  what did it look like  it looked like a mans figure swathed in some white drapery i could not see the face but it was certainly not a dummy but come let us see what the forces can do for us here tonight i think we will need annie laurie to clear the air of debate  mrs miller began the song and we all joined in softly  our newspaper is a trusty watchdog remarked miller significantly  as he spoke the psychic began to toss and writhe and moan pitifully her suffering mounted to a paroxysm at last then silence fell for a minute or twoabsolute stillness and in this hush the table took life rose and slid away toward us as if shoved by a powerful hand  so far as my hearing goes the psychic does not move i said barring the light this is a very good demonstration of movement without control every movement of the table our way removes it farther from the reach of the psychic  i hear nothing from the paper confessed miller and yet the table is certainly moving  i can believe this because i have proved these movements without contact in this case mrs smiley cannot reach the table with her knees and her feet secured by tape nailed to the bookcase you cannot believe she has gotten out of her skin the newspaper is still on guard and has uttered no alarm  it is very perplexing miller admitted but anything can happen in the dark  i admit it is very easy to deceive our senses but the silk thread is not to be fooled  three times the table was urged in the same direction each paroxysm of suffering of moaning of struggle on the part of the psychic being followed a few seconds later by absolute silence it was in these moments of profound sepulchral hush that the heavy table lurched along the floor it was a strange and startling fact  why are you doing this i asked of the forces as a test  yes the raps replied  how do you account for it miller i asked with challenge in my voice my conviction is that we are confronting a case of telekinesisnot as convincing as flammarions but still inexplicable if that table has moved an inch it is the same as if it had moved a foot you should feel rewarded  miller did not reply and even as he pondered the megaphone which had been standing on the top of the table began to rock on its base and a pencil which lay beside it was fumbled as if by a rat or a kitten in our state of strained expectancy this sound was very startling indeed  what about that miller i asked in a tone of exultation whos doing that last time you suspected howard now here you must suspect the psychic the movement of that pencil is of enormous significance how can she possibly reach and handle that cone  she cant unless she has freed her hands he admitted let us touch hands i gave him my left hand and sitting thus with all hands accounted for we entered into communication with the spirit that was busy in the centre of the table  are you present wilbur  tap tap tap  are you moving the table  tap tap tap  to get it out of reach of the psychic  tap tap tap  suddenly with a loud bang something heavy fell upon the table releasing the hands of my fellowinvestigators i felt about for this object and found that a book had been brought and thrown upon the table a shower of others followed till twentyfour were piled about the cone they came whizzing with power yet with such precision that no head was touched and the cone remained undisturbed it was as if some roguish poltergeist had suddenly developed in the room  miller i find this exciting said i after silver fell upon the table suppose we ask wilbur to fetch some small object whose position you know  mrs miller then said there is a box of candy on a shelf back of mrs smiley it is quite out of her reach can you bring that to me wilbur  tap tap tap was the decided answer and almost immediately the box was placed on the top of the table and shoved along toward mrs miller  thats a good demonstration i remarked and wilbur drummed a sharp tattoo of satisfaction  at my request he then wrote his name on a pad while miller waited and listened his mind too busy with surmise to permit of speech he told me afterward that he was perfectly sure the psychic had wrenched free of her tacks and he was wondering how she would contrive to put herself back again  finally i asked are you still with us wilbur  the force tapped smartly on the tin  now just to show you that the psychic is not doing this cant you hold up a book between me and the light i want to see your hand  instantly and to my profound amazement a book rose in the air and i could see two hands in silhouette plainly and vigorously thumbing the volume which was held about three feet above the table and to the psychics left  miller i said excitedly i see hands  i do not he answered but i hear a rustling  swift on the trail i called out now show me your empty hand wilbur i want to see how big it is a moment later i exclaimed in profound excitement i can see a large hand against the window and strangest part of all the spread fingers are pointing toward mrs smiley the wrist is nearest you and at least six feet from the psychic it is a mans hand you are not doing this miller  certainly not he answered curtly  this is astonishing it certainly is a hand and much larger than that of a woman and the wrist is toward you it is still at least four feet from the psychic oh for a flashlight camera now i was perfectly certain that this is not the psychics hand and yet to admit that it is not is to grant the whole theory of materialization  at last the shadow disappeared the book fell with a ringing scrape the cone rose in the air and the voice of wilbur came from it lifelikealmost fulltoned and with a note of humorous exultation running through it i told you id astonish you he said dont get in a hurry theres more coming  for nearly two hours thereafter this spirit voice kept us all interested and busy he was very much alive and we alternately laughed at his quaint conceits or pondered the implications of his casual remarks it was precisely as if a rollicking western or rather southern man were speaking to us over the phone i asked who are you is wilbur your surname  no my middle name my family name is thompson  his characterization was perfect he responded to every question with readiness and perfect aplomb at times he played jokes on us he bumped miller on the head and touched him on the cheek farthest from the psychic at my request he covered mrs millers ear with the large end of the horn then reversed and nuzzled her temple with the small end she said it felt like a caress as if guided by a tender hand she had become clairvoyant also and saw many forms about the room i could see nothing  tell us more about yourself wilbur i asked who are you what did you do on the earth  i was a soldier  in the civil war  yes  on which side  thats a leading question he answered with some hesitation  oh come now the war is over  i was on the southern side i am jeff w thompson i was a brigadiergeneral  where were you killed  i was invalided home to jefferson city and passed out there  how do you happen to be guide to this little woman  he hesitated again i was attracted to her he said and gave no further explanation  mitchell then came and said we are deeply interested in your experiments mr garland and will afford you all the aid in our power it is hard to meet your testshard i mean for our medium but we will assist her to fill the requirements  thank you i dont see how any psychic could be more submissive  mrs miller deeply impressed by all this began to inquire concerning those of the invisible host whose names were familiar to her it was evident that she at least was convinced of their reality  meanwhile the movement of the cone interested miller more than the messages how does she do it he exclaimed several times to touch mrs miller means that the psychic must not only have free use of her hands she must rise from her chair and pass behind me and the wall  the precision of the action is my amazement i replied ive noticed this same thing many times apparently darkness is no barrier to action on the part of these forces that cone you will observe can touch you on the nose eyelid or ear softly without jar or jolt it came to me just now like a sentient thinglike something human such unerring flight is uncanny could any trickster perform in the dark with such precision and gentleness of course this is not conclusive as argument but at the same time it has weight whose is the eye that directs this instrument can you tell us wilbur  a chuckle came through the cone im doing it  how can you see  day and night are all the same to me  miller held up his right hand prove it touch my knuckles he commanded  after a moments silent soaring the cone struck his left hand which was farthest from the psychic and a voice followed it with laughter asking what made you jump  before miller had recovered from the surprise of this the table seemed to be grasped and shaken as if by a man of giant strengthand yet the cone and the books did not shift position hands patted the pillows on a sofa at millers right and one of these cushions was flung against his chair the room seemed to swarm with tricksy pucks at last the cone took flight again and moved about freely among the heap of books and over millers head while a variety of voices came successively from it some of them speaking to mrs miller and some to me several of the names given were known to mrs miller and a few were recognizable by me they all claimed to be spirits of the dead with messages of good cheer for friends on the earthplane but they were all rather vague and stereotyped once i thought i could see the cone passing between me and the window high above the table it seemed to float horizontally as if in water some of the spirits were too weak to raise the coneso wilbur said too weak even to whisper  during all this time the psychic remained in trancedeathly still but between the acts her troubled breathing and low moans could be heard so far as hearing could define she was still at the end of the table where she had been placed at the beginning of the sitting none of these movements occasioned the slightest rustling of the newspaper when the cone was moving no sound was heard the floor was of hardwood and as ones hearing becomes very acute in the darkness i am certain the psychic did not rise from her chair she was for the most part silent as a dead woman  the force expended on the table was very great almost furious and even if the psychic had been able to extend her foot or release a hand she could not have produced such movement and if she had done so we could have detected it intelligent forces were plainly at work on the table and writing was going on so far as i was concerned i was convinced that the psychic had externalized her power in some occult fashion and that it was she who was speaking to us it was as if she were able to will the cone to rise and then to project her voice into it all of which seems impossible the moment it is stated  at length wilbur said goodnight i rose and miller eagerly expectantly turned the light slowly on mrs smiley sat precisely as we had last seen her her eyes were closed her head leaning against the back of her chair her hands were fastened exactly as we had left them and strangest thing of all the table was pushed away from her so that the silk threads were tight  do you see that miller i exclaimed will you tell me how that final movement was made wilbur has given us an unexpected test even if she had freed her hands she could not have tied the threads and returned to her bonds and if she first returned to her bonds how could she then have pushed the table away the two things are mutually exclusive her feet are nailed to the floor and the newspaper still on guard are we not forced to conclude that the table was moved by some supernormal expenditure of force her hands were here the table there does it not seem to you a case of the psychic force such as crookes and richet describe  miller was confounded but concealed it she may have shoved the table with her feet  how your newspaper is unbroken not a tack is disturbed but suppose she did how about the books did she get the books with her feet how about the broad hand which i saw how about the candybox which was moved from a point seven feet away how could she slip from her bonds see these threads actually sunk into her wrists i continued no my conviction is that she has not once moved  i cannot admit that  you mean you dare not  mrs miller was indignant at our delay the poor thing it is a shame unfasten her at once you are torturing her  wait a few moments said miller inexorably i want to make a few notes  meanwhile i took the psychics pulse it was very slow faint and irregular it was indeed only a faint sluggish throb at long intervals and each throb was followed only by a feeble fluttering her skin was cold her arms perfectly inert and numb and she came very slowly back to consciousness i had a conviction at the moment that she had been out of her body  while i rubbed her hands and arms miller took notes and measurements there were more than two dozen books on the table and some of them had come from shelves three feet distant and a little above the psychics shoulders it was true she could have reached them with a free arm but she had no free arm the pad in the middle of the table was scrawled upon wilbur was written there and short messages from mr mitchell and other ghosts therefore it is of no value to say we were collectively hypnotized  as she came to life mrs smiley complained of being numb my arms are like logs she said and so are my feet my guides say that if you will put one palm to my forehead and the tips of your fingers at the base of my brain it will help me to liven up  i did as she requested and was at once conscious of great heat and turmoil in her head it appeared to throb as if in receding excitement i thought of richets observations that in cases of materialization the psychic seemed shrunk and weakened and narrowly scanned the helpless woman she seemed at the moment small and bloodless  were you conscious of groaning and gasping i asked  no i have no recollection of anything i am told i do make a great fuss but i dont know it did anything happen  a very great deal happened i answered  she smiled in quiet satisfaction  im glad mr miller has been good and patient it would have been a shame to disappoint him if you will only keep from being too anxious youll get anything you want  thats what mitchell said  mrs miller patted her hands you must be very tired poor thing  i do feel weak but that will soon pass away what time is it  miller looked at his watch great scott its after one oclock  absorbing business isnt it said i  mrs miller invited mrs smiley to stay the remainder of the night and took her away to bed leaving us to measure and weigh and surmise it seemed absurdlike a dream and yet there lay the visible tangible proofs of the marvel  everything took place within her reach provided she could have freed her hands miller repeated as he sat in her chair and studied the books on the table  miller said i with conviction that woman did not lift her wrists from that chair  i dont see how she did it but to say she did not is to admit the preposterous i wish she had permitted us to hold her hands  i dont know of another psychic in america who would have submitted to the test we put upon mrs smiley tonight but mitchell has assured me he will go further he will let us hold her hands and turn on the light i feel as if the great mystery were almost within our grasp by the ghost of euclid i have the conviction at this moment that we are at the point of proving for ourselves the elongation of the psychics limbs suppose flammarion is right suppose that the psychic can extend her arms beyond their normal proportions you should be ready to give a year ten years to demonstrating a single one of these physical effects if i am any judge of character this little woman is as honest and as wholesome as mrs miller herself it isnt this one performance alone which proves it it is the implication of a dozen other sittings almost as convincing as this that gives me hope of proving something let us have our next sitting at camerons it is only fair to readmit them for we have proven that they had nothing to do with our performance that first night let us ask to be permitted to hold the hands and feet of the psychic and also to take a flashlight picture of the floating cone we may yet see these ghostly hands in the light of the lamp  miller was shaken i could see that he sat like one who has been dealt a stunning blow  i dont believe iti cant believe it he repeated  crookes got some photos of katie king and i fully believe that mrs smiley may be developed further anyhow lets test her now for a word of theory this is the way it all appears to me at this time she seems to enter successively three stages of hypnotic sleep in the first stage the spirits speak through her own throator she impersonates as mrs harris did her second and deeper sleep permits of the movement of the conetelekinesis independent slatewriting etc but in this final deathly trance she has the power of projecting her astral hands whatever that may mean and the production of spirit voices perhaps she has an astral head  i dont believe a word of it it is all impossible monstrous  well how will you explain this performance what about the tacks the threads the tapes that bound her she brought books shook the table touched ushow  i dont know but there must be some perfectly natural way of explaining it there is no place for the supernatural in my world she seems a nice simple little woman and yet this very simplicity may be a means of throwing us off our guard i will give a hundred dollars for permission to hold her hands while the cone is moving  if you do not believe in tacks will you believe in the touch of your fingers  if she permits me to hold her and the cone moves i will surrender  no you wont you think you will but you wont dont deceive yourself ive been all through it you cant believe until some fundamental change takes place in your mind you must struggle just as richet did  anyhow lets turn the screws tighter lets devise some other plan to make ourselves doubly certain of her part in the performance  with this understanding i said goodnight and took my lonely way to my apartment  it was deliciously fresh and weirdly still in the street and as i looked up at the glowing stars and down the long empty street my mind revolted can it be that the good old theory of the permanence of matter is a gross and childish thing do the dead tell tales after all i wish i could believe it perhaps old tontonava was right perhaps if we were all to pray for the happy huntinggrounds at the same moment and in perfect faith the lost paradise would return builded by the simple power of our thought  then richets moving confession came to me it took me twenty years of patient research to arrive at my present conviction nay to make one last confession i am not yet absolutely and irremediably convinced in spite of the astounding phenomena which i have witnessed i have still a trace of doubtdoubt which is weak indeed today but which may perchance be stronger tomorrow yet such doubts if they come will not be due so much to any defect in the actual experiment as to the inexorable strength of prepossession which holds me back from adopting a conclusion which contravenes the habitual and almost unanimous opinion of mankind     v   at this point the sittings which had begun so interestingly suddenly began to fail of results the power unaccountably weakened miller and several others of the circle believed these failures to be due to the increased rigidity of the restraint we had imposed upon the medium the next session was held in fowlers downtown office against the hesitating protest of the psychic who said the atmosphere of the place is not good by which she meant that the associations of the office with the hurry and worry of business were in opposition to the mood necessary for the production of the phenomena  the real reason declared howard is this were now getting down to brass tacks in her business  this was literally true at millers suggestion a strong tape perhaps half an inch wide had been passed about the psychics wrist and tied in a close square knot and finally a long brass tack was driven down through both strands of the tape into the chairarm this was in reality as secure as a handcuff nothing happened this night beyond the movement of the table and some rather weak raps and we all rose from our seats worn and disappointed  when we met the next night in the same place and adjusted the evertightening bands upon the psychic she sat helplessly for three hours i began to lose confidence in her power to do anything beyond the ordinary howard mrs quigg and miss brush dropped out before the sitting was over only brierly and myself met the psychic at the camerons on the following thursday again we sat patiently for long hours with only the movement of the table and a drumming upon the top in response to our requests miller now said i would like to have one more sitting in my library to see if we can duplicate the marvels of our previous séance  we did not the table alone moved but it did this under absolutely test conditions over each of the psychics arms a ladys stocking was drawn and pinned to her dress at the shoulder on each hand a luminous pasteboard star was fastened and her wrists were tied and tacked as before again we nailed her dress to the floor and covered her knees with a newspaper and miller and i held threads which were knotted to her wrists nevertheless under these conditions the table moved while no one touched it but always in a line away from the psychic at the moment of the sliding of the table i closely watched the luminous stars and asserted to the others that her hands did not stir so that this movement though slight was genuinely telekinetic  a very curious incident now cut short our sitting miller who thought the left hand of the psychic was not in place twitched the string which he held and immediately mrs smiley began to twist and sigh and maud complained that her mamma had been injured by the jerking of the thread by professor miller and said that the sitting would have to stop we lighted up and found the psychic apparently suffering keenly from a severe cramp all through her left side and a good deal of rubbing was necessary to restore her to anything like a normal condition  it really seemed like failure for my psychic and i began to wonder whether the books really did fly from millers shelves i could not suspect the gentle little lady of conscious deceit but with a knowledge of the wonderful deceptions of somnambulists and hysterics i began to doubt i urged miller to try one more sitting he consented and we met at brierlys house nothing happened during the first two hours and at ten oclock or thereabouts miller brierly and fowler withdrew leaving me to untie and restore mrs smiley who was still apparently in deep sleep  it was evident that the guides had not released the psychic and maudie soon spoke asking me to put her mamma into a wooden chair and to take the cone apart and put the smaller end upon the table i did as she requested and drew the psychics chair and table together wilbur insisted that i tie the psychic as before but i replied rather dejectedly oh no let things go on as they are  he insisted and with very little faith in the power of the psychic i did as i was told i tied her wrists separately and then together and drawing both ends of the tape into my left hand i passed them under the tip of my forefinger in such wise that i could feel any slightest movement of the psychics hands the guides asked me to fasten her wrists to the chair but i replied i am satisfied  again i was brought face to face with the mystery of mediumship sitting thus with no one present but mrs brierly a woman to be trusted the cone was drummed upon and carried about as if by a human hand it touched my cheek at a distance of two feet from mrs smileys hands and wilburs voicestrong vital humorouscame to me conversing as readily as sensibly as any living fleshandblood person and all the time i held to my tapes carefully noting that no movement beyond a slight tremor took place in the psychics arms just before each movement of the cone she shivered convulsively and sighed but while the cone moved she was deathly still each time as the cone left the table it seemed to rock to and fro as though a hand were trying to grasp it and a moment later it rose with a light spring my impression wasmy belief at the moment wasthat mrs smiley had nothing to do in any ordinary way with the movement of the horn if there is any virtue in a taut tape and my sense of touch her arms lay like marble during the precise time the voice was speaking to me i could detect no connection between herself and the voice  mitchell assured me that he approved of every test we were putting upon the instrument and expressed confidence that she would triumph over miller but the circles have been too often changed he asserted and the places have not been well chosen all must be unhurried and harmonious he added and i replied that i had been discouraged but that this sitting had given me new interest i will be faithful to the end i assured him  wilbur and mitchell were perfectly distinct personalities and appeared to confer and act together i had a sense of nearness to the solution of the mystery that thrilled me here in the circle of my outstretched arms the incredible was happening i held mrs brierlys hands and controlled by means of my tightly stretched tape the movements of the psychic and yet the megaphone was lifted handled used as a mouthpiece by spirits i felt that if at the moment i had been able to turn on a clear light i could have seen my ghostly visitors this final hours experience revived all my confidence in mrs smiley and not even another long series of absolute failures could destroy my faith in her honesty or my belief in her occult powers  my patience was sorely tried by twelve almost perfectly useless sittings during which everybody dropped away but mr and mrs fowler dr towne brierly and myself they were not utterly barren sittings but the phenomena were repetitious or slight and fugitive  mr and mrs fowler were friends of brierly and like him avowed spiritists but they both lent their best efforts to make the tests complete and convincing after trying sittings here and there we finally settled upon a series of afternoon sessions in fowlers own house this was the twentysixth sitting of the series and camerons amateur psychical society was practically a memory i was now going ahead pretty much on my own lines but with an eye to catching miller and the camerons at a successful séance before concluding my search  mrs smiley was in great distress of mind over the failure of her powers i guess im no good any more she said i never sit now without a feeling that perhaps my power is gone forever this eastern climate is so harsh for me and i long for my own california if you will not give up i will keep trying as long as my guides advise it  you have done your part i said with intent to console her  please dont give up she pleaded  i am not giving upon the contrary i am only beginning to fight i assured her paraphrasing general grant or some other obstinate person i recognize the truth of what you complain about but i am sure that at fowlers in a small warm wellaired room you will feel at home and be secure of interruption  mrs fowler a very sensitive thoughtful darkeyed little lady received us at the appointed hour with quiet cordiality and suggested that her own room upstairs would be a comfortable and retired place  to this i agreed and we set to work to prepare it for the sitting fowler and i assumed control of the psychic though brierly insisted that as the house belonged to fowler it would be more convincing if he were not connected with the preparation of the room i dont think we need to consider hairdrawn objections i retorted  as before we placed mrs smiley in an armchair at one end of a small table as before we secured her ankles by looping a long tape about them and nailing the two ends to the floor behind her mrs fowler introduced an innovation by sewing the tape to the sleeves of our psychic this made slipping out of the tape an impossibility but to push security still further i drove a long brass tack down through both tape and doubled sleeve not content even with this fowler put a second tape about each wrist to add further security and to take off the strain in case of any unconscious movement another tape was carried across mrs smileys dress about four inches below her knees and pinned there next the ends were drawn tight and tied to the back rung of her chair by this we intended to prevent any pushing action of the knees as a final precaution we nailed her dress to the floor in front with three tacks the small end of the tin cone was then placed on the table at the request of the psychic and the large end deposited upright on the carpet near fowler some sheets of paper and a pencil were laid upon the table everything movable was entirely out of the psychics reach  it was about three oclock of the afternoon when after darkening the windows we took our seats in a little circle about the table as usual i guarded the psychics right hand while fowler sat at her left brierly and mrs fowler were opposite mrs smiley the room was lighter than at any other of our sittingsboth on account of the infiltering light of day and also because an open grate fire in the north wall sent forth an occasional flicker of red flame  we sat for some time discussing miller and harris and their attitude toward the psychic i remarked  to me our failures some of them at least have been very instructive but the gradual falling away of our members makes evident to me how unlikely it is that any official commission will ever settle the claims of spiritualism as maxwell has said it is a slow process and he who cannot bring himself to plod patiently and to wait uncomplainingly for hours at a time will not go far i confess that the halfheartedness of our members has disappointed me i told them at the outset not to expect entertainment but they did it is tiresome to sit night after night and get nothing for ones pains it seems foolish and vain but any real investigator accepts all these discomforts as part of the game failures are sure to come when the psychic is honest only the juggler can produce the same effects a medium is not a leydenjar nor an edison battery materialization is not precisely a vaudeville stunt  i dont call the last sitting a failure said fowler the conditions were strictly test conditions and yet matter was moved without contact of course the mere movement of a table or even of the trumpet seems rather tame as compared with the doings of katie king but after all a single genuine case of telekinesis should be of the greatest value to the physicist and as for the psychologist the fact of your friend mrs thomas becoming entranced by wilbur was startling enough in all conscience  i dont think miller believed in her trance said i  what happened asked brierly who had not been present at this particular sitting  i answered mrs thomas a friend of mine a very efficient clearbrained person whom bytheway we had asked to come in order to fully preserve the proprieties suddenly felt a twitching in her left hand which was touching mine this convulsive movement spread to her shoulder until her whole arm began to thresh about like a flail in a most alarming way the action became so violent at last that she called upon me for aid i found it exceedingly difficult to subdue her agitation and silence her rebellious limb but i did finally succeed nor was this all a few moments later while helping us in the singing my friend suddenly stopped singing and began to laugh in a deep guttural fashion and presently a voicethe voice of a man apparentlycame from her throat haw haw ive got ye now ive got ye now it sounded like wilbur  this seemed to amuse mrs smiley it was wilbur she said he loves to jump in and seize upon some ones vocal chords that way its a favorite joke with him  what horrible taste mrs fowler shudderingly exclaimed  oh i dont know remarked brierly it is actually no worse than having your hand controlled  to have a spirit inside of ones throat is a little startling even to me i admitted sympathetically but there was more of this business another member of the circlea young manbecame entranced and proceeded to impersonate lost souls earthbound spirits in the manner of our friend mrs harris and wailed and wept and moaned in most grewsome fashion however i think miller considered both of these performances merely cases of hysteria induced by the darkness and the constraint of sitting about the table and perhaps he was correct  anything a doctor doesnt understand he calls hysteria put in brierly i consider these specialists nuisances  well anyhow our amateur spookspotter association seems to have come to an untimely end said i regretfully of the original number only brierly remains wouldnt our deserters be chagrined if we should now proceed to enjoy a really startling session  we will mrs smiley responded i feel the power all about me  good cried fowler that is the way you should feel if you are at ease the spirits will do the rest  sit back and rest i said we have plenty of time youve been too anxious dont worry  in the mean while between the sitting at millers house and this present one i had been reading much on the subject of the trance and of the externalization of the fluidic double of which the continental philosophers have much to say if not convinced i was at least under conviction that the liberation of the astral self was possible if at all only in the deepest trance and i now attempted to discover by interrogation of mrs smiley precisely what her own conception of the process was  you told me once that you are conscious of leaving your body when in trance i said do you always have that sensation  yes i almost always have a feeling of floating in the air she answered it often seems as if i had risen a few feet above and a little to one side of my material self to which i am somehow attached i can see my body and what goes on around it and yet somehow it all seems kind of dim like a dream its hard to tell you just what i mean but i seem to be in both places at once  do you ever have any perception of a physical connection between yourself and the sitters  she seemed to me to answer this a bit reluctantly yes i sometimes feel as though little shining threads went out from me and those in the circle and sometimes these threads meet and twine themselves around the cone or the pencil this means that i draw power from all my sitters  this was in accord with the accounts of a cobwebby feeling which both maxwell and flammarion had drawn from their mediums maxwell makes much of this curious physical sensation which accompanied certain of m meurices phenomena here also seemed to be an unconscious corroboration of albert de rochass experiments in the externalization of motivity as he calls it the cobwebby feeling of the fingers might mean an actual rayingout of some subtle form of matter indeed m meurice maxwells medium declared he could see a sheath of filaments pass from his fingers to the objects of experimentation  tell us about your journeys into the spirit land i suggested you sometimes seem to go far away do you not  her voice became very wistful as she complied yes sometimes i seem to go to a faroff bright world i dont always want to come back but there is a little shining white ribbon that unites my spirit with my body and holds me fast once when i had resolved never to return that little band of light began to tug at me and although it broke my heart to leave my children who were there with me i yielded and came back to life it was very cheerful and lovely in that land and i hated to come back to the cold and cruel earthplane  cant you tell us about it more particularly  no it is so different from this plane that i have no words in which to describe it all i can say is that it seems glorious and happy and very light  something in her gentle accent excited fowlers sympathy mrs smiley you have the blood of the martyrs in you it takes courage to put ones self into the hands of a coldblooded scientist like miller even garland here has no pity hes like a hound on the trail of a fawn its all material for him now i am nothing but a mildmannered editor i have all the facts i require concerning the spirit world i am busied with trying to make people happy here on this earth but these scientific sharps are avid for any fact which sustains the particular theory they happen to hold not one in a hundred will go where the facts lead their investigation is all a process of selfglorification wherein each one thinks he must prove all the others liars or weakminded in order to exalt himself  to this i could only reply im not a scientist though i must say i sympathize with the scientific method and as for my treatment of mrs smiley i am following exactly the advice of her controls they assure me that they will take care of her  and so they will responded the devoted little psychic  by the closest questioning i had never been able to change a single line of her simple faith she was perfectly certain of the spirit world she had daily messages from wilbur and her spirit father partly by voices but mainly by intuition her children hovered over her while she slept mitchell healed her if she were ill maudie comforted her loneliest hours these voices these hands were an integral part of her worldas necessary and as dear to her as those of her friends in the flesh as she talked on i experienced a keen pang of regret why disturb her belief in the spirit world i asked myself why attempt to reduce her manifestations to natural magic to rob her of her conviction that maudie is able to come back to her would leave her poor indeed  however as the scientist cannot permit pity to hinder his purpose i was determined to disassociate the facts of spiritualism from the cult of spiritualism i was not concerned with faith or consolation i returned to a study of the facts as a part of nature i was now observing closely the three levels of sleep into which mrs smiley seemed to lower herself at will or upon the suggestion of those in the circle i had adopted the theory that in the lighter trance she spoke unconsciously and wrote automatically in the second and deeper trance she became the somnambulist possessed of diabolic cleverness when with the higher senses in abeyance she was able to deceive and to elude all detection in the third or deathlike trance i was ready to admit for the sake of argument that she was able as de rochas and maxwell seem to have demonstrated to exert an unknown form of force beyond the periphery of the bodythat is to say to move objects at a distance and to produce voices from the horn  to prove that she actually left the body would do much to explain the phenomena and i was very eager to push toward this demonstration i had now been her chief inquisitor for nearly thirty sittings and had developed apparently the power to throw her into trance almost instantly a few moments of monotonous humming intoned while my hand rested upon hers generally sufficed to bring the first stage of her trance as we had been sitting for half an hour i now proceeded to chant my potent charm with intent to liberate the spirits to their work  in a few moments she responded to my suggestion a nervous tremor now expected and now familiar developed in her hands this was followed by a slight convulsive straining movement of her arms her fingers grew hot and seemed to quiver with electric energy ten minutes later all movement ceased her temperature abruptly fell her breath grew tranquil and at last appeared to fail altogether this was the first stage of her trance take your hand away fowler i said we have nothing to do now but wait the psychic is now in the hands of mitchell  fowler remarked with some humor i can tell by your tone that youre still unconvinced  im like the scotchmanready for convincement but id like to see the man who could do it  after a few minutes silence mrs fowler asked what is the most conclusive phenomenon you have ever witnessed mr garland  thats a little difficult to answer i replied slowly but at the moment i think the playing of a closed piano which i once heard is the most inexplicable of all my experiments  what do you mean by the playing of a closed piano queried brierly  ill tell you about it it happened during the second sitting i ever had with mrs smiley i was lecturing in her home town at the time and after the close of my address and while we were talking together some one who was aware of mrs smileys mediumship suggested lets go somewhere and have a sitting the plan pleased me and after some banter pro and con we made up a party of six or eight people and adjourned to the home of the chairman of the lecture committee a certain miss halsey i want to emphasize the high character of miss halsey as well as the casual way in which we happened to go to her rooms for it puts out of the way all question of collusion there was no premeditation in the act and miss halsey who was the librarian of the city and a pronounced disbeliever in spiritistic theories had never met mrs smiley before  the circle was made up about equally of men and women all of them wellknown residents of the town so far as most of the phenomena resulting from this sitting are concerned they have very little value for they took place in the dark and the medium was not closely guarded it was only toward the end of the sitting which bytheway took place in miss halseys library and musicroom that the unexpected suddenly happened the inexplicable came to pass  we were gathered about a long table with mrs smiley at one end sandwiched between the editor of the local paper and myself behind me and just within reach of my hand stood an upright piano with its cover down but not locked we had heard drumming on the table for some time and writing had apparently taken place on the pads in the middle of the table but all this was inconclusive for the reason that mrs smiley was not fastened as she is now i took it all with a pinch of salt my mental reservations must have reached the minds of the guides for with startling suddenness they left the table and fell upon the top of the piano after drumming for some time the invisible fingers seemed to drop to the strings beneath and a treble note was sounded as if plucked by a strong hand  you are sure the piano was closed  i am coming to that highly delighted by this immediate response to my request i said to the forces cant you demonstrate to us that these sounds are not accidental or caused by the jarring of cars in the street cant you pluck the bass strings instantly and with clangor the lower strings replied thereupon i said cant you play a tune to this only a confused jangle made answer i was unable to secure any orderly succession of notes cant you keep time while i whistle i insisted with intent to show that intelligence guided these sounds the spirits twanged three times in the affirmative and when i began to whistle yankee doodle the invisible musician kept perfect time playing according to my requestnow on the treble now on the bass leaning far back in my chair i placed my hand upon the lid of the closed piano and called out to the others in the circle the lid of the piano is closed my hand is upon it so far as the sense of touch and hearing are concerned we have here an action absolutely unaccounted for by any scientific law  this was at the moment absolutely convincing to me as to the others and i promptly reported the case to the american psychical society in boston since then i may say i have had many experiments quite as convincing but never a repetition of this peculiar phenomenon it is useless to talk about secret wires or a mouse running up and down the strings or any other material explanation of this fact it took place precisely as i relate it and remains a mystery to this day  fowler remained very calm crookes saw in a full light an accordion playing beneath the touch of invisible fingers  yes i retorted in protest but this action of a closed piano happened in my presence under my hand and there is always so much more convincing quality in the miracle which happens in ones own house but seriously that performance on the closed piano remains a profound mystification to me if it had happened in the mediums house or in the home of some one who knew her i might have suspected fraudbut it did not it happened in the study of one of the most respected women in the city a student who did not believe in psychic phenomena furthermore my own hand was on the lid of the piano i was so convinced of mrs smileys possession of some occult force that i at once wrote to the society telling them that a study of her phases would in my judgment be the most important work its directors could engage upon this is one of my crack stories and i wouldnt believe it as related by any one else however you may read my report which i made at the time if that will be of any satisfaction to you  oh i dont need it responded mr fowler i was merely trying to find out what your best experiments had been have they all been on the physical plane  they are all on the physical planethat is to say on one plane for me any spirit manifestation so long as we are what we are must be an agitation of what we call molecules of matter and is to that extent physical i have no patience with those highfilutin teachers who speak of matter as though it were ignoble in some way matter to me is as mysterious as spirit  at this moment a slight movement of the psychic arrested me and as we listened the silvery sweet voice of maudie issued from the darkness saying mr mitchell wants mr garland to change places with mr fowler be very careful as you move about dont joggle mama its very dangerous to her  as i rose to comply maude called out mr mitchell wishes the threads fastened to mamas wrists he wants you and mr fowler to hold them the way you did at mr millers house  turning up the lights we tied a strong silk thread to each wrist and passed the ends under each arm of the chair fowler took one of these ends while i retained the other i then called the attention of brierly to the fact that the table was seventeen inches from the feet of the psychic and that the fastenings were unchanged when his examination was completed the lights were again turned off and the circuit of hands restored  maudie then requested that the pieces of cone be put together and placed on the floor beside the table fowler did this and drew a chalk mark about it numbering it position no 1 immediately after his return to his seat the table was strongly pushed away from the psychic it moved in impulses an inch or two at a time until it was certainly six or eight inches farther from the psychic  it is impossible to conceive how this movement without contact takes place but then what do we know about the action of the magnet on a pile of iron filings how can a thought in the brain of man contract a set of muscles and lift a cannonball at bottom we do not know how the will as we call it crosses the chasm between mind and matterwe dont even know there is a chasm  do you feel any motion in your thread fowler i asked  nothing but a faint quiver he replied  neither do i and yet the table moved  the table is crowding against me called mrs fowler in some excitement  the fact that the table moved toward us and directly away from the psychic was in itself suspicious but as a matter of fact at other sittings we obtained sidewise movements of the tablegenerally to the left the present experiment did not stand alone you must remember also that the table was at this time more than two feet from mrs smileys toes her dress was tacked to the floor and her ankles controlled by a tape whose ends were nailed to the floor four feet behind her chair  so far as matter can testify mrs smiley is not concerned in this movement of the table i said the question is now up to us which of us is doing this  i am not answered brierly  nor i declared fowler  nor i chimed in mrs fowler  at this moment the psychic began to stir again look out i called warningly let every hand be accounted for some new demonstration is preparing these periods of suffering are strangely like the pangs of childbirth i wonder if after all archdeacon colley was not in the right when he asserted that he had seen the miraculous issue of phantoms i confess that when i read it first i smiled with the rest for his description of the process was not very poetic he declared that he saw a white vapor steam from the side of the psychic like vapor from a kettle forming a little cloud and from this nebulous mass various phantasms appeared ranging from a little child to a fullgrown man it is curious how exactly similar all the reports of this process are crookes speaks of a milkywhite vapor which condensed to a form and richet and maxwell describe it as a sort of condensing process i have seen it myself but could not believe in the evidence of my own eyes one can see all kinds of things in the dark  peace had again fallen upon our psychicthe peace of exhaustion as if her struggles being over her fleshfree spirit were at large in the room the silence was profound yet somehow thrilling with potency  in this hush the megaphone was lifted slightly and dropped making us all start it was as if a feeble hand had tried to manipulate it without success let us keep test conditions i urged please do not make a movement now without warning me of your intentions keep the circuit closed here i addressed wilbur lets see if you can handle the cone under strictly test conditions come now lift it lift it i repeated the command with intent to concentrate all willpower of both psychic and sitters upon the thing desired as maxwell was accustomed to do in his experiments with meurice  several times the forces strove to carry out my wishes but could not twice the horn rose from the carpet only to fall back helplessly fowler placed it in position each time marking each new position while i took note of the convulsive tremor which swept from time to time over the psychic it was exactly as if she were a dynamo generating some unknown electrical energy which after accumulating for a time in her organism as in a jar was discharged along the direction of our will and yet i could not detect any marked synchronism of movement between these impulses and the movement of the horn  after each fall of the cone she moaned and writhed but not till the hush of death came over her did the horn move so intense was the silence each time that we could hear the slightest breath the minutest movement of the tin as it scraped along the rug  it is useless to talk of a confederate i remarked it is of no value to refer this action to the hands of the psychic we must look to subtler causes for this phenomenon perhaps maxwells theory that some magnetic power is liberated by the contraction of the larger muscles will account for it but in no other way  at last the megaphone soared into the air passed over our heads and dropped gently upon the table it did not fall with a bang on the contrary it seemed to descend gentlyas if under perfect control of both hand and eye and yet i assert there was nothing to indicate that the psychic shared in these movements she lay as still as a corpse nothing but a minute continuous tremor in the thread told that she was still alive i was enormously impressed by the silence the darkness seemed athrill with mysterynot the mystery of the discarnate soul but the mystery of the xray i felt that we were ourselves involved in a production of each and every one of these movements  there is no use attempting to deny this fact i insisted to the other sitters either the psychic is able to control that cone by the exercise of her will over some unknown invisible force or she has left her body and is now at work a sentient entity in the air about us there is the same precision in all this which lombroso observed it really seems that the medium has the faculty of using her senses at a distance to say that she is handling that cone with her ordinary physical limbs is absurd this single inexplicable moving of a mass of matter from a to b makes the experiments of crookes and maxwell very much more vital to me i shall reread their books with new interest  this result should have awed me but it did not i felt a deep interest of course but no bewilderment my mind was perfectly clear and my senses alert to every sound every ray of light  at this moment the psychic again began to twist and turn as if in pain and at last the little voice of maudie anxiously asked is mr garland going to take a train at seven oclock  this query convinced me that deep in the subconscious mind of the psychic lay the knowledge that i had thought of catching this train and that a sense of my plan was disturbing her and interfering with our experiment to remove the uneasiness i replied no i am going to stay for i think mr mitchell has something very special in store for me tell her not to think of it any more i am in no hurry i have no appointment elsewhere  to this maudie replied mr mitchell says thank you he will do the best he can for you he says go downstairs now and get your supper leave mama just where she is he will take care of her  as we had been sitting for nearly three hours in a dark close room we welcomed this suggestion from our thoughtful guide although it tended to make the sitting less conclusive as i followed my hostess down the stairs i shared her remorseful pity of poor mrs smiley bound and helpless in her inquisitorial seat mitchell did not ask that she be fed only that she be covered with a shawl to keep her warm  if she is doing this for her own entertainment i said she has singular tastes if she is doing it to advance the cause of spiritualism she is a noble creaturethough a mistaken devotee in the eyes of miller  our hostesss uneasiness concerning the psychic made the meal a hurried one none of us felt very much like eating and i could see that fowler was disposed to cut corners well garland what do you intend to do with the facts obtained this afternoon you have plenty of authority behind which to shelter yourself why not admit the truth so far as i am concerned i am willing to swear that mrs smiley had no actual hand in the movement of the cone  to this i replied from one point of view these phenomena are slight but considered in the light of the manifestation of a totally new force they are tremendous in their implication and i must be absolutely sure of them before i assert their truth the most impressive fact of all is that every phenomenon we obtain coheres with those obtained by maxwell crookes and flammarion it will not do to admit the spirit hypothesis or grant the objectivity of phantasms merely because we have proved the movements of a particle of matter from a to b without a known push or a pull for such admission is farreaching if maxwell is right these phenomenaeven the most complicated of themare metapsychical but perfectly normal for example he says a movement without contact was forthcoming this afternoon i placed a table upside down on a linen sheet m meurice and i then put our hands on the sheet some distance away from the table the table turned completely over the movement was performed slowly and gently it was four oclock in the afternoon and the sunlight was streaming in through an open window now here was a perfectly clear case of telekinesis with no one present but dr maxwell and his friend but the turning over of the table does not imply the action of spirit hands  i dont see why not responded mrs fowler if dr maxwell had mediumistic power  it was meurice who had the power but it was a physical power which went out from his organism like heat he was often ill after his experiments and felt nausea and a disturbing weakness in the solar plexus as though his bodily powers had been seriously drawn upon i have felt this myselfor so it seemed perhaps i imagined it  fowler struck in but what will you do with materializations such as dr richet studied at the villa carmen in algiers what will you do with the photographs of the spectre of the helmeted soldier which he obtained under what he declares were test conditions  but were they thats the point  i am willing to trust a man of richets wide knowledge and known skill in experimentation when he says he saw touched and heard the apparition of a man i am ready to believe that he had taken quite as many precautions as his newspaper critics would have done he saw a helmeted soldier leave the séance cabinet and walk about he clasped his hand he affirmed and found it warm and jointed perfectly real and he secured the breath of this phantom in a tube of baryta so unmistakably that the liquid was chemically changed in accordance with his test there are thousands of other wellauthenticated cases of materialization i have seen scores of them myself i am only quoting richet because i know you believe in his methods  i do indeed but he may have been deceived all the same the failure of all his experiments in algiers lay in the fact that he was never able to nail his psychic down as we have done he was the onlooker after allnot the experimenter he should have been and wished to be really his photographs of the spirit b b have not the weight as evidence of the physical manifestation as the phenomena which we have this evening secured  fowler rose i have his report in my library let me get it  he returned in a few minutes with a small blue book in his hand from which he began to read with gusto i saw as it were a white luminous ball floating over the floor then rising straight upward very rapidly as though issuing from a trapdoor appeared b b born so to speak out of the flooring outside the curtain which had not stirred he tries as it seems to me to come among us but he has a limping hesitating gait at one moment he reels as if about to fall limping on one leg then he goes toward the opening of the curtains of the cabinet then without as i believe opening the curtains he sinks down disappears into the floor  what are you reading from i asked  i am reading from the report which richet made to the annals of psychical science he goes on to say it appears to me that this experiment is decisive for the formation of a luminous spot on the ground which then changes into a living and walking being cannot seemingly be produced by any trick on the day after this experiment i minutely examined the flagstones which made up the floor of the séance room and also the coachhouse and stable immediately under that part of the kiosque there was no trapdoor and the cobwebs on the roof of the stable were undisturbed the photographs of the apparition were taken on five different plates simultaneously and the figure is the same on each  yes but those experiments were afterward made of no value by the confession of a coachman who admitted his complicity in the fraud  no that story is not true the experiments stand and richet still defends both himself and the circle against the charge of fraud  but read on i insisted does he not say that in spite of all his proof he will not even hazard an affirmation of the phenomena  yes he does say that admitted fowler but he also says i have thought it my duty to mention these facts in the same way as sir william crookes thought it his duty in more difficult times to report the history of katie king i do not believe i have been deceived i am convinced that i have been present at realities not deceptions certainly i cannot say in what materialization consists i am only ready to maintain that there is something profoundly mysterious in it which will change from top to bottom our ideas on nature and on life  he apparently was profoundly affected by what he saw i assented and i am perfectly willing to grant that the character of his friends in the circle add value to what he saw but after all the fact of materialization is so tremendous in its implications that even to admit its possibility is to admit more than any man of our day who has been trained in scientific ways is willing to be answerable for however the most extraordinary story i have ever read is that of archdeacon colley rector of stockton warwickshire who declared in a public lectureand many times since over his signaturethat he saw the miraculous issue of phantoms born directly from the side of a psychic he declares he saw a winsome little girl emergea laughing goldenhaired creature as alive as any one i confess that this is too much for me and yet if a spanish soldier can be born from a spot of light anything at all that anybody may imagine can happenbut let us return to our own psychics  we found mrs smiley sitting precisely as we left her and picking up our thread fowler and i located the table and the cone and reassumed our positions the table which was quite out of reach of mrs smileys hands now stood with its end toward the three of us sitting in a crescent shape opposite the psychica position which produced so the guides said one pole of a battery  hardly were we seated in our places when the psychic suddenly awoke and spoke in her natural voice and i for one felt that the sitting was over i was perfectly certain that nothing could happen out of the ordinary unless the medium were in either one or the other of her states of trance  i was now both amazed and delighted to find that the cone could be drummed upon and voices delivered through it while mrs smiley mentally normal took part in the conversation my theories were upset i was completely mystified though i said nothing of this to fowler  once or twice mrs fowler declared she heard the sound of lips and at last a voice came to her speaking the name of her father his voice answered some of her questions correctly but could not utter the pet name which her father used to call her this breakdown of the individuality of the phantom voices is very characteristic this ended the sitting the voices had not been as strong as we had hoped for but as we threw on the light we found a number of messages written upon the sheets of paper which fowler had put in the middle of the table these messages were lying with the writing wrong side up so far as the psychic was concerned altogether we felt that the results were both significant and encouraging and we agreed to meet three days later in the same room and under the same conditions  what i want to do now is to hold your arms while the horn is in the air or while the writing is going on i said to mrs smiley  and to this she replied you may make any test you please i feel that in this house my powers will return  that is a real gain i said to encourage her     vi   the next sitting was an almost exact duplication of the last so far as the binding and nailing of the psychic was concerned except that we sewed two bands of tape to her sleeves and four tacks were used at each wrist her feet were tied separately in the middle of a long tape and the ends brought together carried back beneath her chair and tacked to the floor as before we placed the large end of the cone on the floor out of her reach leaving the smaller end on the table which we left just out of her utmost reach on the table we placed some sheets of paper specially marked and dated and took our seats as usual  no one was present at this sitting but mr and mrs fowler and myself even the faithful brierly had been unable to share in this the twentyninth experiment i was delighted to have the circle narrow down for fowler was a good investigator and a man of vast experience in psychic matters outside interference was absolutely excluded whatever happens tonight fowler i said you and i or the spirits must be responsible for it  we began as usual by putting mrs smiley into hypnotic sleep in a few moments the familiar shuddering action took place her palms grew moist she said she found it difficult to submit to our touch she asked us to put our fingers above hers and soon after in the midst of our singing her voice ceased her hands grew heavy as lead and lay perfectly limp and dead in their bonds  again following the guidance of the raps fowler and i moved back and sat opposite her with mrs fowler between us maudie then spoke from the psychics lips asking us to move the table farther away this i did leaving it at least twelve inches from the utmost tips of her fingers maudie then asked us to take up the larger half of the cone and unite it with the smaller part and lay the entire cone flat across the table  we did so marking its position by means of chalk it was nearly three feet from the utmost extension of the psychics hands and yet almost immediately tapping came upon the cone keeping time to our singing later sounds were produced like the beating of a kettledrum a hammering was then carried on as if within the cone and maudie spoke telling us to go down and get supper as before  i regretted this necessity very much for up to this moment all had been clear sailing the tapping on the cone was inexplicable on the basis of any normal action of the psychic but to leave her alone even while so well accounted for weakened the test  i said as much to fowler as we sat at the dinnertable he admitted his own disappointment however he added philosophically we have to take these things as they offer we cant construct them  we discussed the implications of the sittings we had already held it isnt one thing only he reminded me it is because of the larger fact that one phenomenon supports another that one comes to believe thus far tonight we have proved that mrs smiley is not concerned with the drumming on the cone havent we  yes but i want to hold her hands while the drumming takes place i want to hear her voice at the same time with mitchells  well get it he responded confidently and a little later we returned to the room where our psychic was sitting still in deep trance  after some moments of waiting maudie said mr mitchell says take the table away and put the cone in its place  we moved the table a short distance to the left and i put the cone in the centre of the rug where the table had stood and marked the position of the cone the psychic then passed through a period of suffering of effort but nothing took place again maudie spoke asking us to restore the table and cone to their former positions evidently the experiment designed by mitchell has failed i said but these failures instruct us  a convulsive restlessness again seized upon the psychic and maudie asked us to sing i hummed softly in order to hear anything that might take place a minute clicking sound at once developed as though some one were lightly beating the cone with a key these clicks answered our questions it was wilbur once more i asked him if he were going to be able to speak to us and he tapped yes soon after this the cone was swung into the air and wilburs throaty whisper was heard i asked him if the psychic could not be awake and speak while he was present and he answered yes we have planned that  even as he spoke mrs smiley passed into what seemed like a struggle for breath and awoke  are you with us mrs smiley asked fowler  yes what time is it  about halfpast eight how do you feel  very numb and cold she answered plaintively  i dont wonder at that i remarked youve been sitting there for five hours  is anybody present she asked anxiously  i knew what she meant and answered yes wilbur is hereor was a few moments ago are you still with us wilbur  a rapping on the cone made vigorous answer and a few seconds later the cone took flight and wilburs voice resumed general conversation with us it was noticeable to me all through this sitting as at others that neither wilbur nor mitchell nor maud ever addressed the psychic they spoke of her but never to her  i requested further tests wilbur i want the privilege of going to the psychics side i dont like this longdistance experiment i want to get closer to these factsif they are facts  you shall have the privilege was the reassuring answer  shall i go now  there was no reply through the horn but a tapping on the table gave a doubtful yes and i crept slowly forward and took a seat at mrs smileys right hand i am very close to the ultimate mystery mrs smiley i said as i placed my hand upon her wrist proceed wilbur let me hear your voice now  with tense expectation i put my ear close to the psychics lips and listened breathlessly the horn soared into the air and was drummed there as if to show that it was out of the reach of the psychic but no voice came from it this was a disappointment to me as well as to fowler and i banteringly said you know this failure is suspicious wilbur it seems to indicate that mrs smiley is only a wonderful ventriloquist after all cant you prove that she is independent of your voice cant you do something decisive at this moment  no reply came to this but while my hand was firmly pressed upon her wrist both sleeves being nailed to the chair the loose leaves of the paper in the centre of the table were whisked away to the left i could follow their flight and we all heard their deposition on a couch in a corner of the room  fowler i said are you controlling your wifes hands  yes we had nothing to do with that noise  this was another tense moment for the movement of those papers was very ghostly indeed we had demonstrated clearly that their movement was supernormal  may i come forward asked fowler  tapno was the decided answer  i then asked wilbur do you want me to change with fowler and control mrs fowlers hands  an emphatic yes was rapped in reply  they seem as anxious for a conclusive test as we are remarked fowler did you mean you didnt want mrs fowler unaccounted for  a perfect fusillade of raps followed yes yes yes  fowler then came forward to mrs smileys left while i returned to the table taking both of mrs fowlers hands in mine and setting the toes of my shoes upon hers i awaited developments at this moment while fowler was pressing the psychics imprisoned wrists the cone banged about most furiously describing wide circles entirely out of mrs smileys reach this action was another perfectly convincing test of the psychics supernormal powers as the same movement had taken place with each of us in control of the psychic each was absolved from any complicity in the matter but i did not forget my further test mrs smiley i said i want mr fowler to return to his seat and i want to place my hand over your lipsor to muffle you in some way i must prove that you have nothing to do with the production of those voices will you permit this test  certainly she answered with patient sweetness you may gag me in any way you please i am perfectly sure you can secure the proof you want upon this hint i acted taking a large kerchief from my pocket i tied it tightly around her mouth knotting it at the back and then in growing excitement challenged the ghostly voice now wilbur lets hear from you  a moment later the voice came from the cone but apparently very much muffled and blurred you are not articulating well i rather sarcastically observed  instantly the voice came out clearly more sharply than ever before i was fooling you jeered wilbur  we all applauded there thats better i said your voice improved wonderfully  wilbur chuckled with glee ive taken a lozenge he whimsically retorted expressing a very human delight in our mystification  fowler then said now lets consider this a moment garland suppose mrs smiley has been able to loosen the gag how does she handle the cone we will suppose she is a marvellous ventriloquist how does she write on the pads on the table and how does she whisk them away you see it isnt the matter of one thing but of all that has happened  yes i admit that everything points to an exercise of supernormal force it really looks so far as anything in the dark can look like spirits but i prefer to think mrs smiley has the power to project her will in some way  i dont see how we are going to escape the spirit hypothesis replied fowler  mitchell i said addressing the phantom i want to examine that gag and i want to hold both hands of the psychic will you permit that  there was no reply to this and fowler offered an explanation we had that test at a previous sitting  i explained to the invisible ones wilbur it is absolutely essential that you should prove to me that your voice is not dependent upon the vocal chords of the psychic you see the importance of this do you not mrs smiley  indeed i do she earnestly answered her voice sounding very faint and muffled through the kerchief i am anxious for the test  very well then now i want you to sing a song and while you are singing i am going to insist on wilburs speaking will you do that wilbur the cone was drummed upon as if in vigorous promise of success  mrs smiley sang or rather hummed but there was no response on the part of the ghostly voices and a moment later she called faintly the kerchief is slipping down mr garland  i rose and went to her side as i untied the kerchief she said plaintively i am sorry we didnt get the voices i am sure we can if we try again please try again and a vigorous drumming on the cone seemed to second her plea  however it was getting very late and i said i think we will postpone further experiment tonight what are your sensations now  i am almost paralyzed and still deaf too but that often happens my feet are as if they did not exist  but your mind is perfectly normal  yes it seems to be  soon after this i returned to my seat the cone was lifted high into the air silently broken apart and then with the small end jangling inside the larger one was carried over the table and back to the floor it fell with a bang that seemed final and decisive that is goodbye said mrs smiley  upon lighting the gas we found our victim as before sitting absolutely as we had left her the table edge was twentyfour inches from her fingertips the place where the cone lay which we had marked with chalk when it was first drummed upon was thirtysix inches from one hand and forty inches from the other but the most inexplicable of allthe tangible permanent recordwas the seven sheets of paper which were lying upon a couch six feet from mrs smileys left hand they were all written upon legibly and pinned together with a black pin which had been thrust through the writing wilbur had scrawled his name mrs fowlers fathers name was signed to a message and there were other signatures unknown to any of us the pencil was on the carpet forty inches from mrs smileys hand the leaves of paper at the moment when they were grasped and lifted were more than forty inches from her fingertips how this was done i do not know but of this i am absolutely sure the psychic did not remove them from the table by means of her ordinary material limbs barring the failure to disassociate her voice from that of wilbur she had met every demand upon her her powers were truly magical i cannot say i saw the cone move but i have proven that the psychic did not surreptitiously touch it or fraudulently write upon the papers during this sitting i cannot swear that fowler was controlling his wifes hands while the cone was floating and while i held the psychics imprisoned hands but i believe he was in short barring the one sense of sightan allimportant one i admitthese happenings were convincing and fitted in with phenomena which i had secured with other psychics  nevertheless i was not satisfied i wanted brierly or some other fifth person in the room in order that both of the psychics hands could be controlled at the same time that mrs fowlers were secured so long as a single hand was left free the doubter would be warranted in questioning our results  the next two or three sittings were partial failuresso much so that i made no record of them possibly conditions were not strict enough at any rate the final and most conclusive sitting came three days later it was held in fowlers house we followed the conditions of the previous sitting very closelythe same room the same table the same fastenings as before  there was present a friend of fowlers a young man who was possessed of some psychic power we will call him frank fowler and i took entire charge of the psychic and her bonds were even more carefully nailed than before we began the séance as before by putting her to sleep  not long after maudie spoke saying mr mitchell wishes the thread fastened to mamas hands in the way mr garland desires  i fastened a strong thread to each wrist as i had done several times before passing the ends under the chairarm in such wise that any movement of the psychic would be plainly and instantly detected we then returned to our seats and though conditions seemed favorable no marked phenomena took place the cone was lifted it is true but we were used to this now and accepted it as quite commonplace  at six oclock the voice of maudie came please go down to supper mr mitchell says he will be able to give you what you ask for after you return  i did not ask to what he referred but i had in mind the test to prove the voices independent of the psychics vocal organs and at the dinner we discussed methods by which this could be made clear  if they will let me put my hand over her mouth i said to fowler i will be satisfied  do you mean that you will believe in spirits he smilingly challenged me  oh i wont go so far as to promise that but i confess it would help to prove their existence  we may be about to get something more conclusive than that  let us fix our minds on two things first to get the writing or at least movement with every hand controlled and second the voices while one of us covers mrs smileys mouth with a hand  very well acquiesced fowler but the unexpected is what usually happens in these performances  we were gone but twenty minutes so eager were we for our demonstration we found everything quite as when we left the psychic was asleep the fastenings undisturbed fowler and i regained our threads and resumed our places at the sides of the table while frank and mrs fowler sat close together at the end opposite mrs smiley i ask the reader to recall that the psychics ankles were encircled with tape which was nailed to the floor behind her chair two bands of tape after being sewn to her cuffs had been tacked solidly to the chair three strong tacks were driven down through the hem of her dress and finally fowler and i were holding the threads which after encircling the psychics wrists passed under the chairarm  and yet in spite of all these bonds and precautions the cone was almost immediately lifted and mitchell spoke through it in a deep clear welldelivered and decidedly masculine whisper and with stately periods he promised the complete cooperation of the spirit world in the great work to which i was devoting myself he directed his exhortation to me as usual and for the benefit of those who think the spirits are always trivial or foolish i wish to say that mitchells remarks were dignified and very suggestive he produced in my mind the distinct impression of a serious man of seventy ornate of rhetoric but never vague or wandering in his thought and he never went outside the circle of mrs smileys mind  for fully a quarter of an hour he discussed with me the value of the investigation which we were pursuing i and my band he assured me are working as hard from our side as you are from yours equally intent upon opening up channels of communication between the two worlds he solemnly urged me to proceed in this grand work and at last said goodbye for the present and fell silent  the cone was then deposited on the table and maud said if mr garland and mr fowler will go quietly up to mamas side holding all the time tightly to the threads mr mitchell will do what mr garland so much desires please be very careful not to touch mama until i tell you keep as far apart as you can as you go up to her when you reach my mamas side you may put one hand on her head and one on her wrist mr mitchell says please have frank take mrs fowlers hands so that every hand in the circle is accounted for  i was now very eager and very alert i felt that at last after many many requests and many trials i was about to secure a clear complete and satisfying demonstration surely no trickster would permit such rigorous control as that toward which we were now invited i was sorry that miller was not present to share with me the satisfaction of the moment my admiration went out toward this heroic little woman who was enduring so much pain and suspicion for the sake of science she believes in herself i thought if she succeeds all honor to her  slowly we crept to her side being careful to touch nothing until directed by the voice of maud at last the childish voice said mr garland may put his right hand on top of mamas head and his left hand on her wrist mr fowler may place his left hand above mr garlands and his right hand on mamas wrist mr mitchell says he will then see if the voices will not come  i then said aloud my right hand is on the psychics head my left is on her wrist  fowler repeated my left hand is above garlands right which is on the psychics head and my own right hand is on the right wrist of the psychic now wilbur go ahead  our challenge was almost instantly caught up while thus doublesafeguarding the psychic the cone which was resting on the table a full yard away rose with a sharp metallic scraping sound and remained in the air for fully half a minute during which i called out sharply we are absolutely controlling the psychic her hands are motionless mrs fowler be sure you are holding both of franks hands  i have both his hands in mine she answered  as the cone was gently returned to the carpet fowler was moved to say garland that was a supreme test of the psychic she was absolutely not concerned in any known way with that movement save for a curious throbbing wavelike motion in her scalp she did not move if she lifted the horn it was by the exercise of a force unrecognized by science  to this i was forced to agree i here definitely declare that the psychic was not concerned with the flight of the cone in any way known to biology if she produced the voices they too must have been examples of supernormal ventriloquism for they came through the megaphone of that i am as certain as one can be of an auditory impression  a few moments later we returned to our seats while wilbur and mitchell and several other voices spoke to us fowler now that i had admitted telekinesis wanted me to go further is the psychic speaking to us he asked or are these voices independent of her  an investigator is never satisfied i answered i must have the voices through the cone while i am covering the psychics mouth  to this mitchell replied we are doing all we can and we will yet be able to meet every demand you make upon us  i am anxious for conviction i said i want to secure the voice of the psychic and your voice at the same time mr mitchell can you do that for me  he seemed to hesitate and at last said we will try i perceived in his tone a certain doubt and indecision again we were permitted to hold the psychics wrists and as before the cone was lifted and drummed upon as if to show its position high in the air but no voices came hidden forces seemed to be struggling for escape beneath our hands the womans brain seemed a powerful dynamo i could not rid myself of a sense that there was an actual externalization of the psychics nerve force and with this conviction i could well understand why the command had so often been given not to touch her unbidden suppose the poor naked astral body were abroad and a strong light were suddenly turned upon it  now came on a singularly engrossing game of hideandseek convinced that mrs smiley was innocent of any trick in the movement of the horn i tried every expedient to satisfy myself that wilburs voice was independent of her own but i did not succeed mrs smiley spoke almost at the same moment but never precisely synchronous with wilburs whisper she answered all my questions perfectly unconcerned and unexcited lending herself to my experiments all in vain at no time did i succeed in getting wilburs voice at precisely the same moment with her own though the whisper following swiftly on her speech interjected remarks as if echoing her questions there was always an approximate interval between her voice and the spirit whisper  this was to me very significant and strengthened me in my belief that the entire process while inexplicable was after all not the work of spirits  when the gas was lighted we found the cone had been placed on the table a distance of forty inches from the utmost reach of the psychics hands her feet were twentythree inches from the nearest leg of the table we carefully examined the tapes which were sewed to her sleeves they were tied and the doubled ends tacked precisely as described so many times and to remove the tacks we were forced to use a hammer it is useless to talk of a possible release of her arms during the phenomena of the cone  as i was about to leave the house that night mrs smiley said i do not feel able to sit any more for the present mr garland i feel myself growing weaker and mitchell tells me i would better stop for the present i feel that my power belongs to the world and i want to do all i can to convince you of the truth of spiritualism but i feel the strain very greatly  i do not wonder at that i responded and i cannot blame you for demanding a rest no one could have endured more uncomplainingly you have been a model subject and we are deeply in your debt i am sorry miller was not with us tonight he would have been convinced of your supernormal power at least have no fear of my report for while i am not convinced of the spirit hypothesis i have found you honest and patient and very brave i thank you very sincerely for what you have done  and in this spirit we parted1  footnote  1 since these words were written i have seen the cone move in the presence of another medium with no one in the room but myself i held the psychics hands what time the horn circled over my head it shone like a golden rod as it moved i could see the gleam of light along its entire side at last it came softly down and laid itself across my shoulder in order to satisfy myself of its presence i bent and touched it with my forehead the touch seemed to disturb conditions to break the current for it dropped instantly to the floor twice it answered to my request in this manner until my doubts were satisfied it seemed to move with the swiftness of a dragonfly as silent and horizontal it hung in the air about my head     vii   camerons amateur psychic club which had so nearly disintegrated by reason of the long series of barren sittings was drawn together again by the news of my startling success at fowlers house cameron at once decided that the members should hear my report and i was notified to be ready to relate my experiences in full we met as before at camerons table and even before the soupplates were removed the interrogation began and by the time the company was in full possession of the facts the coffee and cigars had appeared  why didnt these wonders take place in our presence asked mrs quigg who had returned to something like her original truculence of doubt why should you and brierly be so favored  in this business everything comes to him who waits i replied a tinge of malice in my voice you obtained a few results miller a few more but fowler and i for our pains reaped the rich reward by remaining long on the watchtower we saw the armies pass harmony and patience are essentials in the production of these marvels with people yawning or shuffling about uneasily results are necessarily unimportant  miller continued firm in his agnosticism although puzzling i cannot grant so much as even one of the phenomena belief in the smallest of those manifestations at my house would be uprooting to all established theories of matternot to mention time and space  were not the notions of galileo and darwin also subverting asked fowler is there anything sacred in error if we are wrong in our theories about the universe lets correct them you do not stand out against wireless telegraphy or the röntgen ray  miller fired at this im not going to take instruction from a tipping table or a flying hairbrush he fiercely retorted  ill take illumination from any source whatsoever responded fowler  here i interposed the only question that concerns me at this stage is does the table tip and the brush really fly no physical fact is trivial for it stands related to mountains and the clouds  fowlers eyes gleamed with contempt thats the way of you socalled scientists you narrow the mighty fund of occult phenomena down to a floating feather as a matter of fact there is a sea of evidence accumulated by the investigations of men quite as scientific as miller testimony that is neither petty nor ignoble it is because you and your associates are so trifling in methods that the tables and the chair play leading parts in your drama  good for you cheered brierly youre quite right when these materialistic investigators get done with trying to prove that independent slatewriting exists theyll begin to give some attention to the fundamental truths of the messages which the slates set forth going after small things they get small things if miller and his like went forth seeking the essentials of the faith they would find them instead of being amazed with foolish tricks of hand  essentials such as what interrupted harris with snappy suddenness  such asasdirect spirit communication a knowledge of the astral the reincarnation of souls andandfaith in the upward progression of the self stammered brierly much disturbed  here again i interposed a quieting word i confess that it begins to look as though the theosophists theory of the astral at which some of us have smiled were in a fair way to be scientifically demonstrated since our last meeting i have been studying the bound volumes of the annals of psychic science and i have found them full of comfort they sustain mrs smiley at every point to my mind the most important event in the history of spiritism is the entrance of eusapia paladino into the clinical laboratory of cesare lombroso nothing since crookess experiments has had such value for the scientist  we have heard of lombroso but who is paladino asked mrs quigg is she a psychic  she is the most renowned now living though only an illiterate peasant woman she has been able for more than twenty years to baffle every scientist who has studied her her organism remains the most potent mystery on this earth  tell us about her who is she where does she live  she was born at minervamurge a mountain village near bari in italy according to lombrosos daughter who has written a sketch of her she is about fiftythree years of age her parents were peasants she is quite uneducated but is intelligent and rather goodlooking her hands are pretty and her feet smallfacts which are of value when studying her manifestations as you will see later on her mother died while eusapia was a babe and her father passed over when she was twelve leaving her at large in the world like a wild animal as she herself says a native family of her village took her to naples and her own story is that she was adopted soon after by some foreigners who wished to make me an educated and learned girl they wanted me to take a bath every day and comb my hair every day she explains with some humor  she didnt like the life nor the people and she soon ran away back to her friends the apulians and it was while she was in their house and at the precise moment when they were planning to put her in a convent that her occult powers were discovered some friends came in to spend the evening and in default of anything better to do formed a circle to make a table tip no sooner were they all seated as she herself relates than the table began to rise the chairs to dance the curtains to swell and the glasses and bottles to walk about till everybody was scared after testing every other person present the host came to the conclusion that the medium was his little ward eusapia this put an end to her going into a convent she was proclaimed a medium much to her disgust and made to sit whole evenings at the table i only did it she says because it was a way of recompensing my hosts whose desire to keep me with them prevented their placing me in a convent finally i took up laundress work thinking i might render myself independent and live as i liked without troubling about spiritualistic séances  it is remarkable how many of these women psychics begin their career when they are ten or twelve years old said miller mrs smiley was about that age wasnt she  yes and so was mrs hartley another psychic of my acquaintance mrs smiley complained of the tedium of sitting she tells me that her father kept her at it steadily just as eusapia was not permitted to escape her fate one day an englishwoman wife of a certain mr damiani came to a séance and was so impressed by what took place that she interested her husband in eusapias performances damiani then took up the young mediums development along the good old wellworn lines of american spiritualism and she acquired all the tricks and all the patter among other notions she picked up the idea of an english control known as john king who declared himself a brother of kate king of crookes fame and from that day eusapia has been a professional mejum  what does she do asked cameron what is her phase as you call it  it must be confessed that most of her phases are of the poltergeist variety but they are astounding she produces the movement of mandolins chairs sofas and small tables without contact at least such is the consensus of opinion of nearly a score of the bestknown scientists of france and italy and also materializes hands and arms there is vastly more than the poltergeist in her that is evident for she has conquered every critic with her miracles take for instance lombrosos conversion a fairly typical case he was not only sceptical of spirit phenomena but up to 1888 was openly contemptuous of those who believed in them however in an article called the influence of civilization upon genius published in 1888 he made this admission twenty or thirty years are enough to make the whole world admire a discovery which was treated as madness at the moment when it was made who knows whether my friends and i who laugh at spiritualism are not in error just like hypnotized persons or like lunatics being in the dark as regards the truth we laugh at those who are not in the same condition  true enough said fowler the man who has made no study of these phenomena is like one colorblind he has never seen a landscape  it was this candid statement by lombroso that moved professor chiaia a friend of eusapias to write the great alienist a letter which was in effect a challenge after recounting a score or two of the wonderful doings of paladino whom he had studied carefully he ended in this amusing fashion now you see my challenge if you have not written the paragraph cited above simply for the fun of writing it if you have the true love for science if you are without prejudicesyou the first alienist of italyplease take the field when you can afford a weeks vacation indicate a place where we can meet four gentlemen will be our seconds you will choose two and i will bring the other two if the experiment does not succeed you will consider me but as a man suffering from hallucination who longs to be cured of his extravagances if success crowns our efforts your loyalty  will attest the reality of these mysterious phenomena and promise to investigate their causes  i hope lombroso was man enough to accept the challenge said cameron nothing could be fairer than the spookmans offer  he did not at once take up the gage it was not in fact till february 1891 that he was able to go to naples to meet eusapia who had begun to interest some of his trusted scientific friends he found the great psychic quite normal in appearance and rather attractive in manner she was of medium size with a broad and rather serious face lit with brilliant dark eyes the most notable thing about her physical self was a depression in her skull caused by a fall in her infancy this scar figures largely in nearly all the reports of her  why asked harris  because they all agree that a singular sort of current of force like a cool breeze seems to come and go through this spot  harris groaned and howard said oh rubbish  rubbish or not they all speak of this scar and its singular effects at the time when lombroso saw her first eusapia was just beginning to be known to scientists but no one of special note had up to this time 1891 reported upon her she was known as the wife of a small shopkeeper in naples and seemed a decent matronly person quite untouched by mysticism although not eager to sit for lombroso and his party of scientists she finally consented among those who took part in these celebrated experiments were professor tamburini an eminent scientist dr bianchi the superintendent of the insane asylum of sales and dr penta a young nephew of lombroso a resident of naples lombroso had charge of the sittings which were held in a room of his own choice and with the medium entirely under his control he was astonished at the prompt response obtained at the first sitting while he and professor tamburini held the psychics hands a bell was carried tinkling through the air and a small table moved as if it were alive many other mysterious movements took place lombroso was very much disturbed by these inexplicable phenomena and could not rest till he sat again at the second séance spectral hands developed profoundly mystifying every sitter and lombroso went away promising to carry forward a study of spiritism in a letter written the following june he manfully said i am filled with confusion and regret that i combated with so much persistence the possibilities of the facts called spiritualistic i say facts for i am opposed to the theory  did lombroso say that asked harris  he wrote it which is still more to the point and it was his acceptance of the main facts of paladinos mediumship that led other groups of scientists to take up her case professor schiaparelli director of the observatory at milan gerosa professor of physics ermacora doctor of natural philosophy aksakof councilor of state to the emperor of russia and charles du prel doctor of philosophy in munich were in the next group which met at milan with intent to settle the claims of this bold charlatan  the sittings took place in the apartment of monsieur finzi at milan and were more rigid and searching than any paladino had ever passed through but she was again triumphant she bewildered them all lombroso himself was present during some of the sittings the results of the series of experiments were very notable and very farreaching for the first time so far as i know a table was photographed while floating in the air  no shouted howard  yes and certain other telekinetic happenings were proved to the stupefaction of most of those in the group one special experiment the success of which confounded the shrewdest was the attempt to secure on a smokeblackened paper the print of one of the spectral hands  did it succeed  yes the impression was made while paladinos hands were imprisoned beyond all question and what was most singular of all the hand that made the print smudged the wrists of one of the experimenters and yet not a particle of black appeared on the fingers of the psychic  that ought to have convinced them of her honesty remarked fowler with a note of amusement in his voice but it didnt these scientific folk are so difficult  no i replied it didnt convince them but it jarred them not a little in their report they admitted this much they said we do not believe we have the right to explain these things by the aid of insulting assumptions by this they meant to acquit the psychic of fraud we think on the contrary that these experiments have to do with phenomena of an unknown nature and we confess that we do not know what the conditions are that are required to produce them  that seems to me like a very mild statement but i suppose they considered it epochmaking remarked fowler  from this time forward learned men in russia france and italy successively sought paladino out and tried to expose her to the world professor wagner of the department of zoölogy at the university of st petersburg made a study of her in 1893 and found her powers real a year later m siemeradski correspondent of the institute experimented with her in rome obtaining among other miracles the plucking of the strings of a closed piano under strictly test conditions  you had that experience did you not asked mrs cameron  yes ive had that  how do you account for a thing of that sort  i dont account for itor if i did give my theory you would laugh at me wait till i tell you what these italians are doing among the most eminent and persuasive of all eusapias investigators was professor charles richet the french physiologist and author eusapia came to revere and trust him and gave him many sittings he too was bowled over he tells the story of his conversion very charmingly in my servile respect for classic tradition he writes i laughed at crookes and his experiments but it must be remembered in my excuse that as a professional physiologist i moved habitually along a road quite other than mystical his attention he goes on to say was first drawn to spiritist phenomena by the word of a friend who had discovered a power that caused a table to move intelligently he was trying to explain this and one or two other little things like telepathy and prophetic vision by the word somnambulism when his friend aksakof a great psychical expert reproached him for not interesting himself more keenly in experiments with mediums well said richet if i were sure that a single true medium existed i would willingly go to the ends of the world to meet him  thats the spirit exclaimed fowler that is the way the scientist should feel what then aksakof told him all he needed to do was to go round the corner didnt he  not exactly two years later aksakof wrote to him you neednt come to the end of the world milan will do so richet went to milan and took part in those very celebrated séances with eusapia when i left milan richet says i was convinced that all was true but no sooner was i back in my accustomed channels of work than my doubts returned i persuaded myself that all had been fraud or illusion  here harris interrupted miller can testify to this inability to retain a conviction he too has slumped into doubt how about it miller  i never professed to believe declared miller  you were pretty well convinced that night in your study werent you i asked  i was puzzled he replied guardedly  there was a general smile of amusement at his manifest evasion and i resumed richet went to rome and together with schrenknötzing the philosophic expert and siemeradski the correspondent of the french institute made other and still more convincing experiments and yet doubt persisted i was not yet satisfied he says further i invited eusapia to my house for three months alone with her and ochorowicz a man of penetrating perspicuity i renewed my experiments in the best possible conditions of solitude and quiet reflection we thus acquired a positive proof of the reality of the facts announced at milan  by george thats going it strong said young howard youve got to believe that a man like richet has seen something after three months experiment in his own house  miller faced them all stubbornly and yet even richet may have been deceived  are you the only one competent to study these facts asked brierly hotly the egotism of you professional physicists is a kind of insanity the moment a man like richet or lombroso admits a knowledge of one of these occult facts you who have no experience in the same phenomena jump on him like so many wolves such bigotry is unworthy a scientist  would you have us accept the word of any one man when that word contradicts the experience of all mankind asked miller  listen to what richet says in confession of his perplexity i called out soothingly he writes it took me twenty years to arrive at my present convictionnay to make one last confession i am not yet absolutely and irremediably convinced in spite of the astounding phenomena which i have witnessed during my sixty experiments with eusapia i have still a trace of doubt certainty does not follow on demonstration it follows on habit so dont blame miller or myself for inability to believe in these theories for our minds are the kind that accept the mystical with sore struggle  go on with eusapias career said harris i am interested in her i want the story of the investigations  her story broadens i resumed her fame spread throughout europe and squad after squad of militant scientists grappled with her each one perfectly sure that he was the one to unmask her to the world she was called before kings and emperors and everywhere she triumphedsave in cambridge where she made a partial failure but she redeemed herself later with both lodge and myers so that it remains true to say that she has gone surely from one success to another and greater triumph  but there have been other such careersslades and homes for instancewhich ended in disaster  true but nothing like her courage has ever been known the crowning wonder of her career came when she consented to enter the special laboratories of the universities of genoa and naples it is in the writings of morselli professor of psychology at genoa and in the reports of bottazzi head of the department of physics at naples that scepticism such as my own is met and conquered i defy miller or any man of open mind to read the detailed story of these marvellous experiments and deny the existence of the basic phenomena produced by eusapia paladino  you speak with warmth said harris  i do i am at this moment fresh from a reading of the reports of bottazzis uptodate experiments and i am compelled to grant that he has not only sustained crookes at every point but has gone beyond him in his ingenuity of test and thoroughness of control he adds the touch of certainty that we all needed to complete our own experience he has given me courage to say what i believe mrs smiley did for us  wont you tell us all about it pleaded mrs cameron please do  it is too long and complicated you must read it for yourself it is too incredible to be told  never mind garland well take it as part of your fiction go ahead  as i looked about me i could detect in the faces of some of my friends an expression of apprehension the coffee had grown cold our icecream had melted with neglect every eye was fixed upon me it was plain that harris and miller considered me on the highroad to spiritualism quite willing to gratify their wish to be startled i proceeded  you will find the latest word on all these matters in a small but valuable review published simultaneously in london and in paris called the annals of psychic science it is edited by césar de vesme in france and by laura i finch in england and is a mine of reliable psychic science its directors are dr dariex and professor charles richet its committee is made up of sir william crookes camille flammarion professor lombroso marcel mangin dr joseph maxwell professor enrico morselli of genoa dr julien ochorowicz head of the general psychologic institute of paris professor porro the astronomer colonel albert de rochas author of the externalization of motivity and others of like character  we dont want the review we want your account said harris dont spare us give us detaillots of it  thank you you shall have it hotshot but ill have to generalize the story for you the most decisive of all the tests have been made during the last eighteen months and the final and most convincing of all within the year under the direction of lombroso morselli and bottazzi it is safe to say that with these experiments and the reports which accompany them a new era has dawned in biology the facts of mediumship are in process of being scientifically observed by a score of the bestqualified men in europe and at last we are about to study mediumship apart from any question of religious tenets  fowler took issue with me here it is absurd to say that no one but these physicists has ever properly studied spiritualistic phenomena spiritists themselves have put the screws on quite as effectively as ever crookes or richet has done some of the best investigators ever known have been spiritists  even if that were true their testimony would lack the convincing power that flames from morsellis book or bottazzis report the essential weakness of the spiritists testimony lies in the fact that for the most part he assumes that the facts of mediumship are somehow and necessarily in opposition to somebodys religion he finds it sustained or opposed by the bible or he fancies it mixed with deviltry or the black art he trembles for fear it will affect the scheme of redemption or assist some theosophical system whereas a man like bottazzi is engaged merely with the facts he lets the inferences fall where they may he is not concerned with whether eusapias manifestations oppose christian theology or not he wants the phenomena he is alert to note their effect on biologic science but he does not shrink from any report of them so far as i am concerned my lot is cast with these men who put the clamps on the fact and wait for larger knowledge before constructing a system of religion on the halfdiscovered  im with you there said miller and if our university officials took the same view we americans would hold higher rank in the worlds thought  bottazzi himself says with reference to his experiments in spite of all the hundreds of those who have observed eusapia it still remained true to say that hitherto she had been free to throw things about as she pleased but all this took a sharp turn when she came into bottazzis laboratory  just who is bottazzi harris asked  hes the head of the physiological institute of the university of naples of his age and general character i am not precisely informed but he writes delightfully of his experiments morselli who preceded him in his study of eusapia is the professor of psychology in the university of genoa foà and herlitzka are of the same university within the last two years eusapia has also been rigorously studied in lombrosos clinical laboratory at turin all honor to her for breaking away from the traditions of mediumship  mrs quigg caught me up on this what do you mean by traditions of mediumship  i mean that for the most part investigators have nearly always been kept at armslength by the fiction that the guide should control everything that the séance is a religious rite that the medium must not be touched nor exposed to the light and so on till the scientist was reduced to the feeble rank of an onlooker in the dark so that no real test was possible these italians did not grant any of these traditions they were scientists not devotees at a new shrine  however i am ready to grant that some of the good old rules were justified as you have seen in my own experiments i have proceeded cautiously for if you suppose mediumship to be a psychodynamic adjustment of the organisms in the circlea subtle physical relationshipthere is all the more reason to be careful i did not find it necessary to mistreat mrs smiley in order to test her powers but eusapia has set a new pace for mediums she has gone into the lions den alone and unarmednot once but a hundred times she entered lombrosos study a room previously unexplored by her and there placed herself before a cabinet that she was not permitted to examinea cabinet filled with machines for dividing the true from the false in morsellis presence she submitted to tests the like of which not even crookes was permitted to apply and all sacred rules and regulations all ideas of religion or questions of morality vanished when she entered the cold clear air of bottazzis physiological laboratory  this begins to sound like the grapple of a cuttlefish and a mermaid was the woman crushed  no she more than sustained her great reputation she conquered the remorseless scientist and performed the impossible  i had the strained attention of my audience now time was forgotten and cries of tell us tell us all arose  it is an exciting story an incredible story  so much the better exclaimed miss brush  i am full of enthusiasm for bottazzi i resumed his was the kind of investigation i should like to put through myself it appeals to me as no spiritualistic performance has ever done in a sense the facts he has demonstrated make all material tests inoperative matter is all we have to cling to when it comes to physical tests a nail driven down through the sleeve of the mediums dress seems to increase our control of her and a metronome or a morse telegraphic sounder does add value to our testimony and yet zöllner seems nearer right than miller matter seems only a condition of force and subject to change at the will of the psychic  up to the beginning of last year bottazzi confesses that he had read little or nothing on the subject and like our friend miller here considered it beneath the dignity of a scientist to be present at spiritualist circles it is highly instructive to note that paladino the most renowned medium of her time was in naples at his very door but that doesnt mattera scientist is blind to what he does not wish to see in this case bottazzis eyes were opened by a young friend professor charles foà of turin who sent him an account of what he and dr herlitzka had witnessed in eusapias presence  they really seem to be taking the phenomena seriously over there said harris  these particular sittings at turin made a great sensation in italy they were under the direction of drs herlitzka foà and aggazzotti assistants to professor mosso of the university of turin dr pio foà professor of pathologic anatomy was also present during one séance the conditions were all of the experimenters own contriving they were young men and had been companion workers in science for many years and were accustomed to laboratory work they all came to this experiment perfectly sure that no mediumistic phenomena could endure the light of science at the end of their three sittings they manfully said now that we are persuaded of the authenticity of the phenomena we feel it our duty to state the fact publicly in our turn and to proclaim that the few pioneers in this branch of biology destined to become one of the most important generally saw and observed correctly we hope that our words may serve to stimulate some of these colleagues to study personally and attentively this group of interesting and obscure phenomena you will note they relate their tests not to theology but to unexplored biology  i like the ring of that declaration of theirs said harris go on come to hecuba  bottazzi was enormously impressed by this account which detailed coldly critically the most amazing experiments with ingenuity that would have seemed satanic to paladino had she known of it foà and aggazzotti had laid their pipes and provided for every trick they were confident that nothing genuine could occur but as a matter of record weird performances began at once bells were rung tables shifted columns of mercury lifted mandolins played and small objects were transported quite in the same fashion as the books were handled during our own sittings at your house millerin fact the doings were much the same in character a small stand was broken to pieces under the very eyes of the learned doctors and hands hit and teeth bit those whom the medium did not like each of the machines for registering movement though utterly out of reach of paladino was operated and some of these movements were systematically recorded  it was this care these scrupulous and coldblooded tests that so profoundly affected bottazzi these men were his friends he knew their levelheaded and remorseless accuracy the fact that they considered the whole investigation biologic in character and that the results of their experiments strengthened their theory of the physiological determinism of the phenomena added to his eagerness to try for himself  wait a moment said cameron what do you mean by physiological determinism  he means that the phenomena began and ended in the psychics organism  do you intend to convey that they considered the medium dishonest  oh no merely that they did not relate the phenomena to the intervention of the spirits of the dead  oh gasped mrs cameron  merely exclaimed harris merely is good in that case  after reading these articles with avidity bottazzis report begins professor galeotti my associate and i looked at each other astounded and the same thoughts in the same words came simultaneously to our lips we too must see must touch with our handsand at oncehere in this laboratory where experiments of the phenomena of life are daily carried on with the impartiality of men whose object is the discovery of scientific truth here in this quiet place where sealed doors will be superfluous everything must be registered will the medium be able to impress a photographic plate will she be able to illuminate a screen treated with platinocyanide of barium will she be able to discharge a goldleaf electroscope without touching it and so we travelled on the wings of imagination always having before us the plummet of the strictest scientific methods  now youre getting into my horizon said miller that is the way i wished to proceed in mrs smileys case did bottazzi get these things done  youre as impatient as miss brush i replied highly amused at his eagerness first you must catch your medium bottazzi succeeded at last in getting paladinos consent but only through the good offices of professor richet whom she deeply loves and reverences submissively she entered into this most crucial series of tests she was no longer afraid of any scientist but it was not precisely a joy to her bottazzi invited his friend galeotti professor of general pathology in the university of naples dr de amicis professor of dermatology dr oscar scarpa professor of electrochemistry at the polytechnic high school of naples luigi lombardi professor of electrotechnology at the same school and dr pansini professor extraordinary of medical semiotics and these gentlemen certainly made up a formidable platoon of investigation the room in which the experiments took place was an isolated one connected with the laboratory of experimental physiology and belonged to that part of the university set aside for bottazzis exclusive use nothing could have been further from the ordinary stuffy back parlor of the materializing medium no women were present and no outsider as you see conditions were as nearly perfect as the ingenuity of bottazzi and his assistants could make them  the members present nestled into their chairs with looks of satisfaction and mrs cameron said dont leave anything out tell it all  it is hardly necessary to say that every precaution was taken photographs of the cabinet were made before the sittings and afterward in order that all displacements might be recorded provision was made for registering the action of john kings spectral hands some of these devices were concealed in an adjoining room and watched by other attendants one little touch early in bottazzis account impressed me deeply a little electric motor was used to furnish power for the lamps and other apparatus and bottazzi in speaking of it says at the moment when the phenomena to be registered began to manifest the circuit was closed and suddenly in the complete silence of the night the feeble murmur of the motor was heard i thrill to the action of that faithful little material watchdog ghosts and hobgoblins could not silence or affright it after all matter is both persistent and bold  but not sovereign defiantly called out brierly the psychic dominates it  we shall see bottazzi declares in italics that paladino neither put her hand into the cabinet nor knew the contents of it rarely has she been surrounded by such an assembly of unprejudiced minds by such strict and attentive intellects he declares and when you consider the absence of women the mystery of the machinery together with the stern character of the sitters the mediums courage becomes marvellous perfect honesty alone can sustain a medium in such an ordeal i am ready to agree that a new era began for spiritism when eusapia entered that room april 17 1907  poor paladino sighed mrs cameron i tremble for her  bottazzi grimly says we began by restraining her inexhaustible mediumistic activity we obliged her to do things she had never done before we limited the field of her manifestations i was convinced that it was much easier for her to drag out of the cabinet a heavy table than to press an electric knob or displace the rod of a metronome and this theory he set himself to prove it was beautiful to see the way he went about it  howard was also impressed i see eusapias finish she wont do a thing the influences will crisscross bottazzis cabinet is her waterloo  observe that bottazzi was not perverse he met the psychic halfway by forming the usual chain about the table placing eusapia before the curtains of the little cabinet which was a recess in the wall bottazzi himself and his assistants had constructed this cabinet and placed everything in position before eusapia entered the room at all and throughout the sitting she was controlled by at least two of the investigators so that she could not so much as put a hand inside the curtains she was very uneasy as though finding the conditions hard nevertheless even at this first sitting everything movable in the cabinet was thrown about the table was violently shaken and the metronome set going bottazzi ends his first report by saying the séance yielded very small results but this is always the case at first séances nevertheless how many knowing people and savans have formed a judgment on phenomena after séances such as this one  thats a slant at you miller remarked harris  yes i agreed its a slant at all commissions and committees who think they can jump in and settle this spiritistic controversy in the course of half an hour bottazzi like lombroso and richet was aware that he had entered upon a long road he knew that a tired or worried medium was helpless he called the same circle together for the 20th willing to try patiently for developments all came but lombardi whose place was taken by m jona an engineer the second sitting was a wonder warned by his first experience bottazzi nailed or screwed every movable thing fast to the walls of the cabinet he was resolute to force john the supposed guide to touch the electric button and press the ball of indiarubber that connected with a mercury manometer he intended to teach the spirit hand to register its actions on a revolving cylinder of smoked tin he wanted graven records so that no wiseacre like harris here could say oh the thing never moved you were all hypnotized in effect he said they tell us that a cold wind blows from the cabinet i will put a selfregistering thermometer in the cabinet and see they say tables weighing forty pounds have been lifted all i ask is that the bulb of a selfregistering manometer be pressed they say a morse telegraphic key has been sounded by spirit hands very well i will arrange a connection so that every pressure of the key will be registered on a sheet of smoked paper so that the fact of the sound of the key shall be recorded by an infallible instrument  did he get the records asked harris  wait and see commanded cameron  these indicate the methods which bottazzi and his assistants brought to bear on the medium no more worship here no awe no hesitation no superstition among other things he put into the cabinet a small table weighing about fifteen pounds and on top of it arranged a hairbrush a hens feather a bottle full of water and a very thick glass these articles and the table were the only objects that could be moved his aim was to limit the spirit hands to a few movablesto see whether they could not be taught to do what was required of them well that little table came out of the cabinet of its own accord in a light that made it perfectly visible at the precise time when three of the inexorable professors were rigidly clasping the psychic but that is not the most remarkable thing the psychics feet were held by the engineer and he observed that at the exact moment when paladino pushed against his knee the table moved each advance of the table corresponded says bottazzi with the most perfect synchronism to the push of eusapias legs against jonas knees in other words she really executed movements identical with those that she would have made had she been pushing the table out of the cabinet with her visible limbs  as i paused for effect fowler said you say that as if you considered it very significant  i do in my judgment it is the most valuable fact developed by these most searching experiments flammarion noted this same significant relation between the movements of the psychic and the spirit hands and so did maxwell maxwell proved it by experiments on his own person and now bottazzi is proving it in a larger way a few moments later he says a glass was flung from the cabinet by these invisible agencies and this fling coincided exactly with a kick which paladino gave to jona as if the same will governed both movements  miller was thinking very hard that certainly is very strange he said but i observed nothing of it in mrs smileys case on the contrary it seemed to me that our strongest manifestations came when she was perfectly still  hasten urged fowler come to the phantoms i perceive his theory but it will all be upset later by the materialized forms  on the contrary bottazzi declares the phantoms also conformed to this same law he was determined upon educating john king and kept insisting that the invisible hands press the rubber ball or lower the registry balance or set the metronome going and eusapia repeatedly moaned i cant find i cant see or i dont know how once she complained that the objects were too far offthat she could not reach themall of which sustained bottazzi in his belief that these activities were absolutely under her psychic control just as the synchronism of movements convinced him that she was the physiologic factor in the case all of this is very exciting to me for i have had the same feeling with regard to the several mediums whose activities i have closely studied bottazzi says with regard to the results of the first two sittings these first séances show that eusapia needed to learn how to make these movements with which her invisible hands were unfamiliar just as she would have had to learn to make them with her visible hands you will all observe that he did not permit awe or superstitious reverence for the medium or her phantoms to balk his experiments a convinced spiritist who attended one of the séances was scandalized by the tone and character of the tests these professors were continually bobbing up to see what was going on disturbing conditions stirring things up as with a spoon to see how it was all going on they broke the chain of hands whenever they wanted to see what the spirits were doing in other words these scientists were students not devotees they were experimenting not communing with the dead  others have tried that said fowler but they succeeded in preventing any manifestations whatsoever  it didnt work out so in this instance bottazzi says that during the first séance professor scarpa irritated eusapia greatly by his impertinent curiosity but bottazzi himself quieted her by saying you see dear eusapia we are not here only to admire the marvellous phenomena you are able to produce but also and chiefly to observe and verify and criticise we do not doubt you or suspect any fraud but we want to see clearly and to follow the development of the phenomena that is why m scarpa surveys the cabinet between the curtains illuminating it occasionally with an electric pocketlamp which do you prefer passive admiration of which you must have had more than enough already or the calm affirmation of physicists who are accustomed to extort from nature secrets which she hides from physical eyes in this way adds the master eusapias irritation was softened she rebelled no further but yielded with docility to the sharp attentive scrutiny of the observer who finally declared himself beaten not having been able to discover at any point a shadow of fraud  hurrah for eusapia shouted howard she must be a wonder  a spiritist would say that her guides were insisting on the most rigid test the account goes on to say that the psychic when entranced was not satisfied with the grasp of two of the spies she frequently asked in a faint voice for a third or even a fourth hand in order that there could be no question of her freedom from connection with the phenomena as in the case of our own psychic mrs smiley cooperated to the utmost with us she never refused to permit any test  miller here remarked i cant but think that our control of mrs smiley was complete and yet i could not under the conditions assert that she was not the author of the acts we witnessed in my library i cannot bring myself to entertain even for an instant the spirit hypothesis but in bottazzis theory i glimpse an alternative  yes bottazzi plainly hints at his conclusions by saying the invisible limbs of the psychic explored the cabinet he repeats i am convinced that these mediumistic limbs are capable of being taught unfamiliar duties like pressing an electric button of squeezing a rubber ball and this he proceeded patiently to exemplify at the third sitting madame bottazzi was present lombardi and jona being absent and the force was much greater and more active than before probably because of the psychics growing confidence a small table floated in the air while we watched it in amazement he says one levitation lasted long enough to count fifty we all had time to observe that the piece of furniture was quite isolated he adds furthermore a big black hand came from the curtain and touched madame bottazzi on the cheek and frightened her from her place beside the medium  i can understand that said mrs cameron think of being touched by even ones own dead  professor de amicis was not only touched on the arm but forcibly pulled as if by an invisible hand the curtain of the cabinet then enveloped him as if to embrace him and he felt the contact of another face against his and a mouth kissing him  the women cried out at the thought but i hurried on to make bottazzis point at the same time eusapias lips moved as if to kiss and she made the sound of kissing which we all distinctly heard here again you see is that astounding synchronism which maxwell and morselli observed between the movement of objects and the contraction of the muscles in the mediums arms and legs bottazzi pauses to generalize whatever may be the mediumistic phenomena produced there is almost always at the same time movement of one or several parts of the mediums body  what does he mean does he mean that eusapia performed all these movements with her astral hands asked mrs quigg  that is precisely his inference mysterious hands bottazzi calls them  but how will he account for the difference in size between eusapias hands and the large black hand that she saw and felt asked fowler  bottazzi himself remarks upon this discrepancy to whom does this hand belong he askedthis hand a half a yard away from the mediums head seen while her visible hands are rigorously controlled by her two neighbors is it the hand of a monstrous long arm which liberates itself from the mediums body then dissolves to afterward materialize afresh is it something analogous to the pteropod of an amoeba which projects itself from the body then retreats into it only to reappear in another place mystery but this is not the most grewsome sight one of the professors stealing a glance behind the medium saw remnants of legs and arms lying about the cabinet  horrible exclaimed mrs cameron id rather believe in spirits what does he mean to infer  apparently he would have us believe that materialization is a process due to the mediumor at least dependent on her willand that these partially completed forms represent fragmentary impulses but im not so much concerned just now with that as with the course of schooling through which he drove eusapia he stuck to his plan he put into his cabinet each time certain sounders markers and lamps which could be moved ticked or lighted only by hands in the cabinet and he kept the same rigid control of his medium outside the cabinet for the most part she was in the light by means of a series of lamps the séanceroom could be lighted dimly or brightly at a touch and while many of the phenomena in the cabinet were being performed by john eusapias hands could be plainly seen in the grasp of her inquisitors after seeing a mandolin move and play of itself after having the metronome set in motion stopped and set going again after having the registrations he most desired bottazzi concludes his third sitting by saying an invisible hand or foot must therefore have forced down the disk must have leaned on the membrane of the receivingdrum of my apparatus because i assured myself next day that to obtain the highest lines registered the disk had to be pressed to the extreme point this was no ordinary case of pushing or pulling the mysterious hand had to push the disk and push it in a certain way in short the spirit hand was becoming educated to its task  miller asked did these performances take place as in the case of mrs smiley within the reach of her ordinary limbs  yes many of them took place within a yard of her head but some of them and the most marvellous of them not merely took place out of her reach but under conditions of unexampled rigor eusapias mediumistic limbs penetrated into the cabinet says bottazzi i begged my friends not to distract the mediums attention by requests for touches apparitions etc but to concentrate their desires and their wills on the things i asked for what he wanted her to do was very simple but conclusive he wished the spirit hand to press an electric button and light a red lamp within the cabinet the coil and the switch had been dragged out of the cabinet and thrown on the table bottazzi begged them all not to touch it no one but scarpa galeotti and bottazzi knew what it was for at a certain moment eusapia took hold of the first finger of my right hand and squeezed it with her fingers a ray of light from the interior of the cabinet lit up the roomshe had pressed the contactbreaker with her invisible fingers at the precise time when she had squeezed with her visible hand the forefinger of bottazzi she repeatedly did this if one of us be it observed had lit the lamp she would have screamed with pain and indignation  was this the climax of his series is this all he is willing to affirm queried harris with ironic inflection  oh no indeed the greatest is yet to come at the fourth sitting a new person professor cardarelli was introduced and this new sitter disturbed conditions nevertheless the inexplicable took place small twirling violet flames were seen to drift across the cabinet curtains and hands and closed fists appeared over paladinos head these have been photographed bytheway some of them were of ordinary size and others at least three times larger than the psychics hand and fist these flames interest me very much for i have seen them on several occasions but could not believe in them even though crookes spoke of handling them i must admit their objective reality now it is absurd to suppose they were fraudulently produced in this laboratory  a stethoscope was taken from cardarellis pocket and put togethera movement requiring the action of two hands the noise of fingers running over the keys of a typewriter in the cabinet was plainly heard although no writing came at the fifth sitting the mandolin again moved as if alive no one touching it in a light that made all its movements observable and as it did so eusapias hand tightly controlled by bottazzi made little movements as if to help the instrument to move each movement though it ended in the air seemed to affect the mandolin bottazzi says it would be necessary to have paladinos fingers in the palm of ones hand as i had that evening in order to be convinced that the evolutions twangings of the strings etc all synchronized with the very delicate movements of her fingers i cannot describe the sensation one experiences when seeing an inanimate object moved not for a moment merely but for many minutes in succession by a mysterious force  we observed no such synchronism repeated fowler we not only controlled mrs smileys hands but nailed her to her chair in a way our test was more rigid than those you are describing our results were not so dramatic but they were produced under test conditions and their significance is as great as that of bottazzis lamplighting  but we did not have as much light on the medium and bytheway miller the spectral hands that i saw in your study each larger than mrs smileys hands were as real to me as those scarpa studied and the books deposited on your table form as good a record in their way as the marks on his smokedglass cylinder  furthermore we had writing added fowler all of which bottazzi would explain by his theory of an astral arm  yes but he secured something still more marvellous he obtained the print of human hands in clay and also on smoked glass he demonstrated that the invisible limbs of the psychic cannot only move objects at a distance but that they can feel at a distance eusapias attitude was that of a blindfolded person exploring space with her hands to find a lost object he exclaims at one point eusapia opened my right hand stretched out my three middle fingers and bending them on the table tips downward said in a whisper how hard it is what is it i did not understand says bottazzi she continued there on the chair it is the clay i said quickly will you make the impression of a face no she replied it is too hard take it away some one broke the chain to carry out her desire he looked at the desk and saw the imprint of three fingers  what i would like to know at this point harris quickly interposed is this were the fingermarks lined like bottazzis or like the mediums  he does not say in this case but as i recall it they found in other instances that the lines on the impressions made by eusapias invisible fingers were precisely like those of her material fingers and yet no mark of flour or lampblack remained attaching to her hands in one case a perfumed clay was used and although the impressions secured resembled eusapias face grown old no scent of the wax could be detected on her cheeks bottazzi gives much space to these mediumistic explorations of the cabinet he could follow these blind mysterious gropings of the invisible eusapia by closely controlling the real eusapia presently she asked what is that round object i feel something round this was in fact the rubber ball which connected with a tubethe tube in its turn passing through the wall into another room where it operated a manometer she pressed this ball with her invisible limbs and the column rose and registered the pressure this was entirely satisfactory to bottazzi who then says i desire again to affirm that with her invisible limbs eusapia feels the forms of objects and their consistency feels heat and cold hardness and softness dampness and dryness neither more nor less than if she were touching and feeling with the hands imprisoned in ours she feels with other hands but perceives with the same brain with which she uses to talk with us  the most astonishing physical phenomena came when the contactbreaker was thrown on the table and eusapia called out see how it moves we all directed our gaze toward the small object says bottazzi and we saw that it oscillated and vibrated at an elevation of an inch or two above the surface of the table as if seized with internal shiveringeusapias hands held by m galeotti and myself being more than a foot from the contactbreaker  my auditors were now in the thrall of bottazzis story and the silence was eloquent at last cameron said it certainly seems like a clear case of astral i begin to believe in our first sitting with mrs smiley what do you want us to doannounce ourselves converted  certainly not i replied we must not relax our vigilance even though bottazzi morselli and their fellows seem to have proved the genuineness of the phenomena at the same time i admit it is a source of satisfaction to me to know that these italian scientists with conditions all their own are willing to affirm that eusapia feels with her invisible limbs and explores a cabinet while sitting under rigid control more than a yard away from the objects moved my experiences point to this how else could the cone be handled with such precision as was shown at your house miller lombroso observed that chairs and vases moved as if guided by hands and eyes and that the psychic could see as well behind her as in front mrs smiley has always been able to direct me exactly to the point where the cone or pencil had been flung how can letters within closed slates be formed so beautifully and so precisely without some form of seeing  fowler was ready with an answer at the final analysis all perception is due to some form of vibration to be clairaudient is simply to be able to lay hold upon a different set of pulsations in the ether and to be clairvoyant is to perceive directly without the aid of the eye which is only a little camera after all  all this is merely a kind of prelude i resumed for bottazzi apparently proved that the invisible hand of eusapias invisible arm could not penetrate a cage of wire mesh that covered the telegraphic key in the cabinet how then can we consider it to be a spirit handan immaterial handwhen a wirenetting can stop it he very pertinently inquires  thats what troubles me said miller if a phantom hand can bring a real book and thumb its leaves or drum with a real pencil or write why isnt it for all practicable purposes a real hand  what is a real hand retorted fowler isnt the latest word of science to the effect that matter like the human body is only a temporary condition of force  precisely so and every advance along the line of these experiments goes to prove the power of mind to transform matter it almost seems to me at times as though these psychic minds were able to reduce matter to its primal atom and reshape it in bottazzis seventh sitting under the same rigorous restraint of eusapia a vase of flowers was transported a rose was set in a ladys hair a small drum was seized and beaten rhythmically an enormous black fist came out from behind the curtain and an open hand seized bottazzi gently by the neck now listen to his own words letting go my hold of professor posos hand he says i felt for this ghostly hand and clasped it it was a left hand neither hot nor cold with rough bony fingers which dissolved under pressure it did not retire by producing a sensation of withdrawalit dissolved dematerialized melted  i paused to say remember this is not the tale of a perfervid spiritist on the contrary it is the scientific account of a laboratory experiment by a physiologist of high rank the incident is not a part of a séance in the home of a medium in a dark parlor full of sidedoors and trick windows it is a registered phenomenon in the physiological department of a great university occurring under scientific test conditions i confess it gives verity to many a doubtful thing i have myself seen  it certainly staggers me said cameron how does the scientific gentleman explain it  he goes on to say another time later on the same hand was placed on my right forearmi saw a human hand of natural color and i felt with mine the back of a lukewarm hand rough and nervous the hand dissolved i saw it with my own eyes and retreated as if into madame paladinos body describing a curve if all the observed phenomena of these seven séances were to disappear from my memory this one i could never forget  fowler was smiling with calm disdain let him go on with his psychodynamic theories he will be confounded yet these are only the first stages of the game  but all this happened while the hands of the psychic were merely held protested miller he says he controlled her hands rigorously why didnt he handcuff her or nail her down the facts he claims to have established are too subversive to accept on his word alone  this amused me there you go again not satisfied with wonders you want miracles happily you may be satisfied in the eighth sitting which took place in the same room of the physiological laboratory with bottazzi madame bottazzi professor galeotti doctors jappelli and derrico present eusapia submitted to the most rigorous restraint of her life two iron rings were fastened to the floor and by means of strong cords which were sealed with lead seals like those used in fastening a railway car her wrists were rigidly confined she was in fact bound like a criminal and yet the spectral hands and fists came and went jugs of water floated about and as a final stupendous climax while galeotti was controlling eusapias right arm which was also manacled he saw the duplications of her left arm look he exclaimed i see two left arms identical in appearance one is on the little table the other seems to come out of the mediums shoulder touch madame bottazzi and then return to eusapias body again this is not an hallucination i am conscious of two simultaneous visual sensations when madame bottazzi says she has been touched  for a moment the entire company sat in silence as though stunned by the force of my blow then all turned to miller as though to ask what do you think of that  he slowly replied to grant the possible putting forth of a supernumerary arm and hand would make physiological science foolish it is easier to imagine these gentlemen suffering a collective hallucination  ah bottazzi provided against all that he called in the aid of selfregistering contrivances it wont do millerhe proved the objective reality of spirit phenomena he lifted the whole performance to the plane of the testtube the electric light and the barometer his experiments his deductions came as a splendid sequence to an almost equally searching series by crookes zöllner wallace thury flammarion maxwell lombroso richet foà and morselli his laboratory was the crucible wherein came the final touch of heat which fuses all the discordant facts into a solid ingot of truth  but to me he is misreading the facts objected fowler i maintain that he is as prejudiced in his way as the spiritist he says the mediumistic limbs explored the cabinet a spiritist would say john king explored the cabinet the synchronism he speaks of might exist and only be a proof of what the spiritist admitsthat the presence and activity of the materializing spirit are closely circumscribed by the medium  bottazzi proved the relationship to be something more intimate than that he demonstrated that the movement of the hands in the cabinet and of those outside had a common originnamely the will and brain of eusapia he proved that these invisible hands were after all material and limited in their powers he proved that the spirits shared all eusapias likes and dislikes and knew no more of chloride of iron or ferrocyanide of potassium than she herself possessedin short while admitting the mystery of the process he reduces all these phenomena to human terrestrial level and relates them wholly and simply to the brain and will of the psychic perhaps his state of mind is best expressed at the close of his statement concerning the registration of the movements of the spirit hand he says in effect these tracings demonstrate irrefutably that the keys were repeatedly pressed with perfect synchronism the outside key with eusapias left hand the one inside the cabinet by another which a convinced spiritist would call that of a materialized spirit and which i believe to be neither the one nor the other although i am not able to explain what it was  oh lame and impotent conclusion exclaimed brierly after that superb test why didnt he frankly say the discarnate had been proved  because his proof his knowledge was not yet sufficient besides it requires heroic courage to admit our ignorance i dont know he says and that is the attitude of morselli dr foà believes the phenomena to come within the domain of natural law and to result from a transmutation of energy accumulated in the medium he calls this vital energy or psychic energy and adds if these phenomena appear strange by virtue of their comparative rarity they are not really more marvellous than the biological phenomena which we witness every day  according to this theory then said miller mrs smiley has remained as you believe motionless in her chair but has been able to energize at a distance  more than that she has been able to emit supernumerary etheric limbs perhaps a complete material double of herself which is able to move with lightning speed and perfect precision it is this actual externalization of both matter and sense that makes darkness so essential to the medium vivid light forces this effluvia this mysterious double back into its originating body with disrupting haste witness the several times when mrs smiley was convulsed merely by being touched at the wrong moment  there is a different interpretation to be put upon the psychics hatred of light remarked howard  bytheway yet bearing on this very subject i read in the annals of psychic science the account of a singular experiment in the matter of independent writing a certain dr encausse in giving a lecture before the society for psychical research at nancy said that in 1889 having heard that a professional magnetizer named robert was able to put a subject into such a state of hypnosis that he could project lines of writing on paper without use of pen or pencil he was curious to see the performance together with a colleague dr gibier encausse hastened to witness this marvel one of the subjects was a girl of seventeen the magnetizer put her to sleep and during this séance says dr encausse we were able to obtain in full light on a sheet of paper signed by twenty witnesses the precipitation of a whole page of written verses signed corneille i examined under the microscope the substance that formed the writing and i was led to the conclusion that it consisted of globules of human blood some scattered as if calcined others quite distinct i thus verified the theory of the occultists of 1850 that the nervous energy as well as the physical force of a medium the material of which he is constituted such as his blood could exteriorize itself and reconstruct itself at a distance  what a stunning experiment exclaimed cameron  important if true sneered harris  what do you know about this learned doctor asked miller  nothing but you will see that these later experiments of the italian scientists are sustaining de rochas and aksakof in their claim that the medium is in a sense dematerialized to build up the phantasms dr encausse goes on to say moreover the medium who had produced this phenomenon was preparing for the stage and had been studying corneille during the whole of the preceding day i was thus able to discover the origin of the substance of the materialization of the writing and also its psychic origin in other words he claims that the message was not from the shade of the great dramatist but was a precipitation of the blood of the psychic and an exercise of her subconscious mind all of which accords with bottazzis theory  now then said i in the tone of one about to conclude in the light of these experiments my own sitting at millers and especially those that i held at fowlers house take on the greatest significance miller mrs smileys visible limbs did not handle the booksof that i am positiveand yet i am equally certain that she governed every movement  but what about the voices asked fowler does this theory cover the whispering personalities we heard what about wilbur and maudie  thats easy retorted howard once you explain the manipulation of the cone the rest is merely clever ventriloquism  there is nothing easy about any of these phenomena i answered as richet says they are absurd but they are observed facts it would not be fair to the spiritists to end the account of these sittings without frankly stating that there were many other phenomena very difficult to explain by bottazzis theory there came a time as he admits when a mysterious entity behind the curtain among us almost in contact with us was felt all the time this entity was supposed to be john king the psychics control this being invisible for the most part gave roses to those he liked conversed freely and in one case threw a bunch of flowers in the face of one of the sitters to whom eusapia had taken a dislike a little later john presented a small drum from behind the curtain and when galeotti tried to take it john pulled it out of his hands again he offered it and galeotti seized it and the two fought for its possession with such violence that the drum was nearly torn to pieces  where was paladino meanwhile asked miller  seated quietly in the grasp of bottazzi and madame bottazzi galeotti then raised the drum in his hand high above his head and against the curtain and requested john to beat it john pushed a hand against the drum and beat a muffled tattoo all this was utterly out of the psychics reach the strife over the drum would seem to argue a complete and powerful figure behind the curtain  in other words a spirit said brierly  not so fast put in miller i am content to plod with these italian scientists let us establish one supernormal fact and then reach for another you fellows with your reincarnations and the spiritist with his foolish messages from cleopatra raphael and shakespeare have confused the situation we must begin all over again if all that garland is detailing is truei have not read these reports he speaks ofthen it is our duty to take up the scrutiny of these facts as a part of biologic science  fowler clapped his hands bravo that is all we ask of you to study frogs and mosquitoes to peer close into the constitution of the blood or the brain of man is useful but to my mind the questions raised by these continental experimentalists are the most vital now clamoring for answer  bottazzi says with regard to his eighth and final sitting the results of this séance were very favorable because they eliminated the slightest trace of suspicion or uncertainty relative to the genuineness of the phenomena we obtained the same kind of assurance as that which we have concerning physical chemical or physiological phenomena henceforth sceptics can only deny the facts by accusing us of fraud and charlatanism i should be very much surprised if any one were bold enough to bring the charge against us but it would not disturb our minds in the least from this time forward the medium who wishes to prove the truth of her phenomena will be obliged to permit the same kind of experimentation which eusapia so adequately sustained  well now said cameron the practical question is this are we to go on with our investigation  i am ready said miller promptly garland will you purvey another psychic and conduct the pursuit  yes provided you all come in with spirits attuned ready to wait patiently and observe silently the law of these materializations seems to be this the forces of the psychic are proportional to the harmoniousness of the circle and in inverse proportion to the light accepting this law as proved by our illustrious fellowexperimenters abroad are you ready to try again along the lines they have marked out  as with one voice all agreed  very well said i i will see what i can do for you in the way of a new psychic and new phenomena we will now experiment with design to prove the identity of the reappearing dead of this i am fully persuaded men will be discovering new laws of nature ten thousand years from now just as they are today it is inconceivable that the secrets of the universe should ever be entirely made plain the world of mystery retires before the dawn nothing is really explainedwhat we call familiar facts are at bottom inexplicable mysteries and must ever remain so  then why go on why not stop now and save ourselves the trouble of investigation  because there is joy in the pursuitbecause it is in the nature of man to pursue this quest who knows but the conclusions of venzano and morselli of bottazzi and foà have opened new vistas in human nature these supernormal powers may chance to be of immense value to the race quite aside from their bearing upon the problem of death furthermore these reports come at a time when a hardandfast literalism of interpretation is the fashion among scientists like miller perhaps they and the art of the day will alike be offered new inspiration by these mystifying enlargements of human faculty i for one feel profoundly indebted to these brave and clearbrained italian scientists i should like to see the physicists of our own universities busying themselves with this most absorbing and vital problem  but they dont retorted fowler they will not even read bottazzis reports  and i fear he is justified in his belief        as i am reading proof on this page a fat letter from a friend in      naples comes to my desk filled with the several corroborative      accounts of a special sitting with paladino which professor      bottazzi kindly arranged for them my correspondent is a new york      editor and in his party of six was the associate professor of      chemistry in a big eastern college after detailing the many      marvellous phenomena which took place in his presence professor      m says in view of the phenomena with which i am habitually      concerned i did not want to believe in paladinos supernormal      powers but i had to accept what i saw these reports bring      bottazzis experiments closer to the dead i hope they will bring      them a little nearer to my readers bottazzi has no slightest      doubt of the phenomena is the concluding line of my friends      letter     viii   camerons society never came together again in formal session and i was not able to carry out my plan for developing a psychic along the line of proving the identity of the spirits manifesting however between the final sitting of the club and my next meeting with fowler and miller i passed through a series of very interesting experiences more or less corroborative of the phenomena which the members had witnessed either individually or as a body these additional experiments i proceeded at once to lay before my friends as we met at the club one quiet afternoon a couple of weeks later  we havent heard of any new psychic miller began at once as we settled into easychairs in a retired corner  no i replied ive been unable to get the consent of any other psychic to undergo just the inquisition i know youd like to give but ive had some extremely suggestive sittings recently with a young professional man who does a little mediumistic work on the side  a male psychic thats amusing i thought they were all female  no there are men psychics replied fowler but theyre scarce one of the most wonderful i have ever known is a big burly fellow of most aggressive manner the reason why there are so few men in the business i take to be this men are less subjective less passive than women and the psychics rôle seems to be a negative one men are aggressive and impatient engaged in some kind of struggle with material things or they are intolerant of the process of developing their psychic gifts if garland has found a male psychic he is in luck  so i thought the young fellow whom we will call peters is only about twentyfour a boyish professional man of refined habits he comes of good family and being ambitious in his profession is careful not to permit a knowledge of his psychical powers to reach the ears of his employers i heard of him through a friend who is deeply interested in these matters and who procured for me an invitation to be present at a sitting in the home of a certain dr towne on the east side  we met at dinner and during the meal dr towne told us all he knew of mr peters which was little and turning to me said we expect you to take charge of the circle mr garland its all new to us  the first thing to do i answered is to put the young fellow at his ease it is a mighty good sign when a medium is willing to come into a strange house to perform for a circle as critical and as unfriendly as this oh not unfriendly said dr towne well i said i wouldnt call three practising physicians who have never seen a psychic at close range a friendly group  were there three doctors present asked fowler  yes and my friend was a notably keeneyed man himself i really had no faith that the young fellow could do anything remarkable for us but i didnt say so  we were still at the table when our young psychic was announced and with a knowledge of how necessary it was that he should be in a comfortable frame of mind i went out to the library to meet him and make his acquaintance i wished to put him at his easeso far as i was concerned at least  i found him to be but a pale stripling with slender limbs and brilliant eyes he was plainly nervous and a little dogmatic in manner he told me that he was twentyfour years of age but he did not look to be nineteen he said he had been aware of his power about four years and that his grandfather and a man named evans were those who most frequently spoke i have no guides he said rather contemptuously  the place for the sitting was not especially favorable it was a receptionroom midway between the doctors office and the diningroom and was rather large and difficult to close off from the rest of the house after the windows had been darkened in the usual manner peters arranged the chairs so that his seat came between dr towne and mrs towne dr merriam came next to towne this brought me two places away from peters and next to a stout german woman whose name as i understood it was mrs steinert on mrs townes right sat dr paul and professor franks my friend within the circle towne had set a small table on which were placed pencils and paper the chain was formed by locking our little fingers tightly if we may depend on the word of those present this chain of hands remained unbroken for two hours the room at first was perfectly dark  for half an hour we sat at ease talking a little now and then but leaving the direction of the whole affair to peters he hinted to usand this i wish to particularly emphasizethat he went out of his body he said when i think toward any one or toward a thing i am there i am all around it if i think toward a person i am thereall around himinside of him in pursuit of this idea i then asked are you conscious of your body which you have left behind are you conscious of being in the upper part of the room for instance and do you see your body below you  no said he i am conscious of being in a certain place but i am not conscious of being in two places at the same time he told us of his development which came about through attendance on a circle with another psychic he said he had been experimenting for about four years i asked him if it had affected his health in any way and he replied no it does not weary me any more than prolonged study might do i am very fond of playing chess and i find that i do not play so well after a sittingthats all he said the only sign of the special condition which produced these phenomena was a nervous tremor in his limbs  the first evidence of the force came in steady tappings upon mrs townes chair the young man said this is my friend evans and thereupon i began to direct the sitting through evans in answer to my questions he said that he would do what he could do for us i asked him if he would write and he answered by tapping that he would try  shortly after this promise sounds as of hands were heard about the table sheets of paper were plainly being written upon and torn off the pad one of these was flourished in my face while the linked fingers of the psychic were firmly held by dr towne and his wife all of those in the circle excepting mrs steinert and myself were new to this business and much impressed  at the precise moment when these hands were at work writing and a little later while they patted mrs townes cheek and tapped on the doctors shirtfront i asked are you controlling his hands  yes responded the doctor who bytheway is a vigorous young scientist and had never before experimented with these forces his reply was echoed by mrs towne who remained perfectly calm and clearheaded throughout the entire sitting  thus far the phenomena were precisely similar to those we have had with mrs smiley but we were soon to have proofs of greater power while the chain of hands continued unbroken mysterious fingers clutched dr townes arm and drummed upon his shirtfront at length the same mystic fingers began to take off his tie and while i warningly called out be sure of your psychics hands the doctors collar was taken away and put around his wifes neck his tie was then added to the collar mrs towne announced that while holding firmly to the psychic she felt the touch of two hands about her face and a few moments thereafter dr merriam seated next to dr towne said he felt a strong pressure upon his arm as if some one were leaning upon it  a little later these hands began to unbutton dr townes shirtfront and several pencils were stuffed inside hands patted and touched those who sat within a radius of about a yard of the psychic apparently the forces could not reach to where i sat i complained of this and almost immediately the psychic said there was some one for me and in answer to my question is there some one present for me the pencil rapped three times upon the table in the affirmative at my request this spirit wrote his name upon a piece of paper tore it off and threw it in my lap a moment later something hard and crackling came over the table my cuffs have been removed the psychic called out  having in mind one of the extraordinary experiments of zöllner i then asked evans to remove dr townes vest i said if we can get that it will be in effect a confirmation of zöllners theory of the fourth dimension  for a few moments hands touched and patted dr towne as if with intent to make this experiment but gave it up and peters announced that they were at work around him it could not have been more than a minute later when i felt something soft thrown in my lap i did not know what this was and did not care to break the circle at the moment to find out and the information was volunteered by the psychic that the spirits had removed his vest and this we afterward found to be the case for at the close of the sitting his vest was lying at my feet  oh come now said miller you dont intend to convey  i am telling exactly what took place i replied  peters then said to dr towne think of some signature not your own that you know very well and i will reproduce it after a little silence the sound of writing could be heard and the tap of a pencil announced that its task was done the sheet of paper was then ripped from the pad a very definite action as you may believe and the sound of the sheet being folded was plainly heard  that would require a thumb and finger and afterward two hands remarked miller  precisely and they were there notwithstanding the hands of the psychic could be felt so dr towne and mrs towne both said with no movement but a convulsive quivering  i then asked evans if he could not lift the table for us and he replied by tapping that he would try and a few moments later the psychic whose hands and feet began to pass through a period of tremor warningly called out now please be very quiet and dont break the circle i could hear him take a deep breath and a moment later the table rose and passed over mrs townes head so closely that she was obliged to lean to the right to avoid it and we all heard it gently deposited not far from the psychics right hand while this was done both dr towne and mrs towne affirmed that their fingers were locked with those of the psychic  here again was a phenomenon inconclusive in itself from the fact that we could not see the table move and yet which coheres with an immense body of inexplicable similar movements in the reports of flammarion and lombroso it was impossible for the medium to lift this weight over mrs townes head even if his right arm had been completely free for the stand though small was heavy i regarded this at the moment as an authentic case of telekinesis and my further experience with this psychic has not weakened that conviction  shortly after this the psychic broke up the circle saying that as conditions were favorable he would try to produce materialized forms  taking the chair which was occupied by mrs steinert he withdrew into the passageway leading to the diningroom requesting that the circle resolve itself into a halfcircle facing the cabinet you will remember that we were in a private house and that all question of collusion is barred out shortly after he took his seat in this little recess two or three brilliant lights like the twisting flame of a small candlea curious glowing yet not radiant violet flamedeveloped high up on the outside of the portières which formed the cabinet and drifted across and up toward the ceiling where they silently vanished i think there must have been three of these which were followed by a broad glowing mass of what looked like whitehot metala singular light unlike anything i had ever seen it made me think of the substance described by sir william crookes and other experimenters abroad at the moment this appearedor possibly a little before ita wild whoop was heardvery startling indeed as if a door had suddenly been opened by a roguish boy and closed again this practically ended the séance  as we lighted up i had first interest for the object which had been thrown across to me it proved to be a vest which the psychic said was his it was a soft gray vest and matched his suit and was without any trick seamsso far as i could seebeing whole and uninjured in the inside pocket a folded leaf of the paper from the pad was stuffed and on this was the signature alfred towne which dr towne said was an exact reproduction of his brothers autograph on the sheet of paper which had been thrown to me was the simple word taft this was taken by the circle to be a prophecy on the election but as my wifes family name is taft i put a different interpretation upon it on the whole the sitting made a profound impression upon me it was not so much one thing as many things all cohering with what i already knew of telekinetic phenomena it was not a test sitting as peters acknowledged but it was by no means easy to deceive under the control we exercised  there were many things of interest aside from the physical happenings the young man did not go into a trance but remained perfectly normal he took part in the conversation answered all questions and lent himself perfectly to the experiment he said that if we would sit with him again he was sure we could have more light i dont care to be known as a medium he declared i like the study of law and i want to be a lawyernot a sensitive in the first place the law pays better and in the second place it isnt considered a nice thing to be a medium however i will sit again for you if you want me to and i am sure you will get many other things in the light and he added to me later we can get all these phenomena with no one present but ourselves come down to my home some evening and we will try again  did you accept his invitation asked miller  yes but before i did so we had another sitting at dr townes house which gave me a closer view of all that went on for i was permitted to sit at his left and grip his little finger the circle was slightly changed the next time and on his right sat a young lady whom we will call miss brown she was a wideawake and very unexcitable person and i believe kept close hold on the psychics right hand in addition to our linked fingers the psychics hands were tied to ours with dental floss  there was considerable light in the room this time and as the nervous tremor developed in the psychics hands and legs i imagined i could see a grayish vapor form just between and a little above our clasped hands suddenly i saw a shadowy arm dart forth from the cloud and i felt the clasp of a firm hand on my wrist it was a right hand are you controlling the psychics hand i demanded of miss brown yes she replied alertly even as i spoke i saw the mysterious limb dart out and seize upon a pencil which lay upon the table again and again i saw this apparition emerge from that vaporous cloud and handle the pad in the middle of the table i could see three fingers on the underside of the pad as it was held before the psychics face and these facts i announced to the other members of the circle who could not see as plainly as i could sometimes the arm seemed white sometimes black and always it appeared to be a right hand  that is to say your control was more vigorous than that of miss brown remarked miller  a doubter might say so and yet the thread which bound us had some value one of the most extraordinary performances was the lifting of a glass of water which set in the centre of the table i could see the glass plainly as it rose to the psychics lips it seemed to be sustained by a broad beam of vapor or it may have been a slim arm clothed in white  probably the psychics  possibly but i dont see how it could have been however i do not place very much value upon it as standing alone but considered in connection with the performances of eusapia it becomes a little more nearly credible  but all this is very far from being an evidence of anything like intelligence protested fowler it seems very trivial to me  it does not seem trivial to me i answered but i will admit that is has nothing like the value of a series of sittings i held last spring with a psychic in a midwestern city     ix   the reader will have observed that up to the present moment i have not emphasized in any way the question of the identity of the intelligences that have manifested themselves the reason for this lies in the fact that i was still seeking evidence concerning the processes of mediumship however being convinced by reason of my own experiments supported by those of lombroso morselli and bottazzi that the facts of mediumship exist it is my purpose to take up definitely the question of identity which is the final and most elusive part of the problemit may turn out to be the insoluble part of the problem  if you ask why it should be insoluble i reply because it concerns the mystery of death and it may be that it is not well for us to penetrate the ultimate shadow among all the men of the highest rank who admit the reality of apparitions and voices there are but few as yet who are willing to assert that the dead manifest themselves by this i mean that though some of them like crookes for example believe in the intervention of discarnate intelligences they are not ready to grant that these intelligences are their grandfathers returning to the scene of their earthly labors  i said something like this to miller and fowler when we met at the club one afternoon not long after the final meeting of camerons amateur psychical society and i added i must confess that most of the spirits i have met seem to me merely parasitic or secondary personalities to use maxwells term drawn from the psychic or from myself nearly every one of the mediums i have studied has had at least one guide whose voice and habit of thought were perilously similar to her own this in some cases has been laughable as when rolling thunder a sioux chief indians are all chiefs in the spirit world appears and says goot efening friends id iss a nice night alretty and yet i have seen a whole roomful of people receive communications from a spirit of this kind with solemn awe i burn with shame for the sitters and psychic when this kind of thing is going on  you visit the wrong mediums said fowler such psychics are on a low plane i never go to those who associate with indians  but mediums are all alike in this respect i dont suppose mrs smiley realizes that maudie would be called by a doubter a falsetto disguise of her own voice and wilbur a shrewd and humorous personification of her subconscious self or if she does she probably ascribes it to the process of materialization which takes from the medium never but once have i had the sensation of being in the presence of a real spirit personality and that happened to me only a few days ago  it must have been an extraordinary experience to have made so deep an impression upon you said fowler  yes it was extraordinary it had the personal element in it to a much greater degree than any case i had hitherto studied and seemed a direct attempt at identification on the part of a powerful and original individuality but recently passed out it came about in this way  i met not long ago at the home of a friend in a western city a woman who was said to be able to produce whispers independent of her own organs of speech i was assured by those in whom i had confidence that these voices could be heard in the broad light of day in the open air anywhere the psychic happened to be and that her work was of an exceptionally high character i was keenly interested as you may imagine and asked for a sitting mrs hartley as we will call her fixed a day and hour in her own house for the trial and i went to the sitting a few days later with high expectations of her phase i found her living in a small frame house on a pleasant street with nothing to indicate that it was a meetingplace of mortals and their spirit guides  mrs hartley was quite evidently a woman of power and native intelligence after a few minutes of general conversation she took me up to her study on the second floor a sunny little den on the east side of the house which was not in the least suggestive of hocuspocus a broad mission table two bookcases a few flowers and a curious battered old black walnut table completed the furnishing of the room which indicated something rather studious and thoughtful in the owner  mrs hartley asked me to be seated and added please write on a sheet of paper the names of such friends as you would like to communicate with she then left the room on some household errand and while she was gone i wrote the name of her guide dr cooke out of compliment and added that of a musical friend whom i will call ernest alexander i also wrote the names jessie and david folded the sheet once and retained it under my hand upon her return the psychic seated herself at the battered oval table and taking up a pair of hinged school slates began to clean them with a cloth i am not going to detail my precautions you must take my detective work for granted moreover in this case i was awaiting the voices the slatewriting was gratuitous she took the slates between which i had dropped my slip of paper and putting them beneath the table asked me to hold one corner  i wish they wouldnt do that protested fowler it isnt necessary ive had messages on slates held in my own hands six feet from the psychic  as we sat thus she told me that she had never been in a trance and that she never permitted the dark i force my guides to work in the light she said she declared that the whispers which i was presently to hear came to her under all conditions and that her spirit friends talked to her familiarly as she went about her household duties she assured me that they were a great help and comfort to her dr cooke was her everpresent guide and counsellor and her father and brother were always near  it was plain that she did not stand in awe of them for after half an hours wait she grew impatient and called out in an imperious tone come dear i want you come anybody two or three times she spoke loudly clearly as if calling to some one through a thick wall this interested me exceedingly generally psychics are very humble and patient with their guides a few moments later the slates began to slam about so violently beneath the table that her arm was bruised and she protested sharply dont do that you will break the slates and the table both thereupon the forces quieted down till only a peculiar quiver remained in them i could hear writing going on steadily  at last a tap came to announce that the messages were written the psychic withdrew the slates and handed them across the table to me i opened them and took out my paper on one slate was a message from dr cooke the guide on the other were these words written in slatepencil i would that you could see me as i am now still occupied and happy to be busy this was followed by four lines and three little marks evidently intended to symbolize a bar of music and the whole was signed e alexander the writing was firm and manly but i did not recognize it as that of my friend  the second trial resulted in this vague communication my dear friend dont overdo earth is but one life many i recall i tried to give expression to my one talent this was signed ernest alexander both these replies as you see were very general in phraseology but the third message came closer to the individual i was so tired and not myself i am well and in the world of progress ernest alexander the bar of music again appeared this time much more developed  miller stopped me here all this is quite simple mrs hartley opened and read your note and following up the clew simply did some neat trickwriting beneath the table  it is not so simple as all that i answered she was interrupted about this time by the doorbell and while she was gone i wrote on another piece of paper ernest give me a test of your identity write a bar from the  sonata this note i folded close and put in an inside pocket  in answer to this request when the medium returned i got these pertinent words i was not a disappointment to myself but i was at a point where nerve force failed me this was signed ernest and was accompanied by another sketchy bar of music it all looked like a real attempt to give me what i had asked for and yet it was the kind of reply that might have been made by the medium had she known the history of my musical friend or had she been able to take it out of my mind  even that is a violent assumption to me remarked miller  so it is to me i answered i cant really believe in thought transmission and yet i then asked for the signature of the staff and a small c was written in the bar above and another bar was added now on the slates there came with every evidence of eager haste intimate questions concerning alexanders family is my wife cared for and the like to these i replied orally i must tell you that all along the whisper spoke of alexanders wife as mary which was wrong although it was close to the actual name also after i began to speak of him as e a the messages were all signed in that manner all of which would seem to argue a little confusion in the psychics mind  a little later while i held the slate myself the mysterious force wrote i thank you for what you have done i have been told my mind is clear which was particularly full of meaning to me for the reason that my friends mind was clouded toward the close of his life  all of which proves nothing insisted miller your friend if i conjecture rightly was a wellknown man and the psychic could have read and probably did read all about his illness in the public press  it may be so about this time i began to hear a faint whisper which seemed to come from a point a little to the right of and a foot or two above the psychics lips this she informed me was the voice of dr cooke her guide i could catch only a few of the whispered words and mrs hartley was forced to repeat them dr cooke thus interpreted said your friend alexander is present and overjoyed to talk with you the conversation went on with both dr cooke and the psychic standing between the alleged spirit and myself but even then i must admit that alexanders queries and answers were to the point  under what seemed like test conditions i got two more bars of music both much more definitive in form than the others and these the whisper declared were from the third movement of the  sonata this message was accompanied by a curious little device like the letter c with a line drawn through it and i said to myself if this should prove to be a mark which ernest used in signing his manuscript something like whistlers butterfly i shall have a fine test of thought transmission  i now secured under excellent tests the writing of a singular word which was plainly spelled but meant nothing to me it looked like isinghere in answer to oral questioning the whisper said that these bars of music were part of an unpublished manuscript a fragment which the composer had meant to call isinghere  what about the process asked miller did the writing appear to be supernormal  yes and so did the whispering i could detect no connection between the lips of the psychic and the voice in one way or another i varied the conditions so that i was at last quite convinced of the psychics supernormal power but that was not my quest i was seeking proof of the identity of my friend e a  seeing that the chief means of identification might be in the music i persuaded my friend blake who is a fairly competent musician to sit with me and decipher the score which e a persisted in setting down i was now eager to secure a complete phrase of the music i saw myself establishing at the least the most beautiful case of mindtapping on record if we can secure the score of an unpublished manuscript of alexanders composition we shall have worked a miracle i said to blake  our first sitting which took place in the home of a common friend was mixed as to results but the second which we held in mrs hartleys study one bright morning was very fruitful the powers started in at once as if to confound us both blake received a message written on a slate under his foot and i got the name jessie with the word sister written beneath it and then suddenly the whispers changed in character the words became swift impetuous imperious line off all the leaves of a slate the voice commanded i understood at once for in the previous sitting e a had seemingly found it difficult to draw a long line  we had brought some silicon slates of the book variety and blake now proceeded to rule one of them with the lines of a musical staff and on these slates held as before beneath the table we began to get bars of music of a character quite outside the knowledge of the psychic and myself and more remarkable still the whispers so the psychic informed us were no longer from dr cooke e a she declared was there in person and directing the work  furthermore the requests that we now received were entirely different in character from cookes impersonal remarks the whispers were quick and masterful wonderfully like alexander in content he was humorous he acknowledged mistakes in the score calling them slips of the pen he became highly technical in his conversation with blake talking of musical matters that were greek to me and i venture to say coptic to the psychic he corrected the notations himself sometimes when blake held the slate sometimes when i held it part of the time he indicated the corrections orally he asked blake to try the air  at last he broke off and imperiously said take the table to the piano this seemed to surprise the psychic but she acquiesced and we moved the small stand and our slates down to the little parlor and there with blake now holding the slate beneath the table and now playing the notes upon the piano the score grew into a weird little melody with bass accompaniment which seemed to me at the moment exactly like a message from my friend alexander the first bar went through me like the sound of his voice  now you are getting into the upper air of spiritualism exulted fowler you are now receiving a message that has dignity and meaning  so it seemed at the moment both to blake and to myself the music was manifestly not the kind of thing that mrs hartley could conceive it was absolutely not commonplace it was elliptical touched with technical subtlety although simple in appearance at last a complete phrase was written out and partly harmonized this e a said was the beginning of a little piece that he had intended to call unghere or hungarie nothing in all my long experience with psychics ever moved me like the first phrase of that sweet sad melody it seemed like the touch of identification i had been seeking  but your friend blake was a musician interrupted miller and how about your own subconscious self you are musical and your mind is filled with your friend alexanders music  that is true and i had that reservation all along e a may have been made up of our combined subconscious selves i admit all that but no matter it was still very marvellous even on its material side for some of this music was written in while the slates were in blakes entire control at times he not merely inserted them himself but withdrew themthe psychic merely clutched one corner of them furthermore throughout all this composition ernest was master of the situation dr cooke was superseded there was neither feebleness nor hesitation in the voice i could now distinguish most of the words and the dialogue went forward exactly as if a master musician were dictating to an intelligent amanuensis a new and subtle sketch  did the medium look at the music asked miller  yes now and then however most of the corrections were put in upside down as regards her position and during the last sitting she appeared to be no more than a mere onlooker once as we sat holding the slate ernest whispered to me blake is a fine fellow i met him twice  can you tell me where asked blake  it was in new york city was the reply then after a moments hesitation it was at dinnerboth times you are right said blake much impressed can you tell me the places once was on fifth avenue the other wasi cant tell the location exactly but it was where we went down a short flight of steps that is correct also said blake how many persons were there five quite right can you tell me who they were well mary was there and you of course but i cant be sure of the others  blake looked at me in astonishment and our minds flashed along the same line suppose the whisper were only a bit of clever ventriloquism how did the psychic secure the information conveyed in this dialogue it was given as i write it with only a bit of hesitation once or twice and yet it may have been merely thought transference  merely thought transference exclaimed miller i consider thought transference quite as absurd as slatewriting  fowler interposed i consider this a simple case of spirit communication you should be grateful for such a beautiful response  this significant fact is not to be overlooked i resumed the psychic secured almost nothing else that concerned either blakes affairs or my own mainly the whispers had to do with e a which of course bears out millers notion that the psychic could deal only with what was public property and yet this little colloquy about the dinners in new york is very convincing so far as mindreading goes  during the third sitting blake again being present e a took control as before from the start and carried forward the recording of the musical fragment i want you to fill in the treble blake he said its nothing but the bare melody now blake protested im not up to this and the whisper came swiftly youre too modest blake and a moment later it said i hope youre not bored garland if all this was a little play of the psychics devising it was very clever for after a few minutes of close attention to blake e a turned toward me and asked with anxious haste wheres garland i am here i answered dont go away he entreated it was as if for the moment he had lost sight of me by reason of fixing his attention upon blake  that is singular exclaimed fowler their field of vision is evidently much more restricted than we thought  it must be very small indeed for blake and i sat touching elbows two or three times the whispering voice called is garland here and once it asked what is garland doing i see his hand moving i explained that i was making notes dont do it was the agitated request  a very neat little touch remarked miller  we worked for a long time over this music directed by the voice both in the notation and in the execution of it the lines were drawn for both bass and treble lengthwise of the slate and blake found the little piece difficult to play partly because the staves were on different leaves of the slate and partly because the notes especially some of those put in at the beginning by the composer were becoming blurred it was marvellous to see how exactly these dim notes were touched up by the mysterious pencil beneath the table but our progress was slow e a was very patient though now and then he plumply opposed his will to blakes once especially blake exclaimed that cant be right  yes it is right insisted e a  but it is very unusual to construct a measure in that way for there was a seeming confusion of threefour time with sixeight time  it is a liberty i permit myself was the swift reply  in the last bar which did not appear to be filled satisfactorily the composer directed the insertion of a figure 2 this meant as became clear through a subsequent reference to his printed scores the playing of two quarternotes in the time of three eighth notes but was not understood at the moment by blake  never mind said e a pleasantly i will write it differently the figure 2 was cancelled and the measure was completed by a rest this is only one of many astonishing passages in this dialogue  in all this work e a carried himself like the creative master he held to a plane apparently far above the psychics musical knowledge and often above that of his amanuensis he was highly technical throughout in both the composition and the playing and blake followed his will for the most part as if the whispers came from alexander himself and yet i repeat the music and all may have come from a union of blakes mind with that of the psychic with now and then a mixture of my own subconscious self  what was the psychic doing all this time asked miller  she was listening to the voice and repeating the words which blake could not hear she seemed merely the somewhat bored interpreter of words which she did not fully understand it was precisely as if she were catching by wireless telephone the whispered instructions of my friend e a i cant believe she consciously deceived us but it is possible that these ventriloquistic voices have become a subconscious habit  one other very curious event i must note once when blake was asking for a correction the whisper exclaimed i cant see it blake  cover it with your hand interjected the control blake did so and e a spoke gratefully i see it now  seeing cannot mean the same with them that it does with us exclaimed fowler you remember crookes put his finger on the print of a newspaper behind his back and the spirit spoke the word that was under his fingertip they apprehend by means of some form of etheric vibration not known to us  i resumed let me stop here for a moment to emphasize a very curious contradiction between my first séance with mrs hartley and this our third attempt to secure the music i had held two sittings in the home of a friend mrs hartley had come to the house about ten oclock in the morning bringing nothing with her except a few tips of soft slatepencil during the sitting i had secured in the middle of a manila pad a pad which the psychic had never seen and which i had taken from my friends desk these words have schumanne a this writing i had taken to mean that ernest wanted to hear some of schumanns music and in that understanding i had called blake in to play this had seemed at the moment perfectly conclusive and entirely satisfactory yet now in this final sitting e a suddenly reverted to this message and whispered garland there is a certain étude which i took to schumann i want you to regain it and take it to smart mary will know about it i meant to take it away but did i i was so badly off mentally that i dont know whether i did or not whereupon blake said do you mean schumann the publisher yes e a replied and i said and you want the manuscript recalled from schumann and given to smart yes was his very definite answer  very well i will attend to it i replied what do you want done with this fragment isinghere i pursued shall i publish it that is what it is for he answered curtly  how many bars are in it asked blake forty more returned the whisper  blake made the mistake of again suggesting an answer as many as sixty  yes sixty or seventy was the answer like an echo here blakes thought governed but it was evident that the psychic had no clear conception of what this reference to schumann meant in the first instance for e a was unable to complete his sentence which should have read have schumann return a certain étude which i tooke a furthermore the psychic evidently believed in the truth of the message or she would not have gone into it with such particularity she would have been lacking in caution to have given me such definite and detailed information knowing that it was all false  so far as my own mind is concerned i had no knowledge of such a music publisher as schumann smart i had met blake however knew of both firms the entire message and the method of its communication were deeply exciting at the time and completed what seemed like a highly intellectual test of identity and we both left the house of the psychic with a feeling of having been very near to our dead friend  to identify one of these bars of music would be a good test said blake but to find that étude at schumanns would be a triumph  to find the manuscript fragment would be still more convincing was my answer  imagine my disappointment when in answer to my inquiry schumann replied that no such étude had ever been in his hands and alexanders family reported that no fragment called unghere could be found among the composers manuscripts  fowler shared my regret what about the other messages were they all disappointing  no some of them were not the most intimate were true and a signature which came on the slate under test conditions and which i valued very little at the moment turned out to be almost the exact duplicate of alexanders signature as he used to write it when a youth twenty years ago as a matter of fact it closely resembled the signature appended to a framed letter which used to hang upon the wall of his study but even so its reproduction under these conditions is sufficiently puzzling  what was blakes conclusion did he put the same value upon it all that you did  yes i think he was quite as deeply impressed as i he said the music seemed like alexanders music somehow distorted by the medium through which it came it was like seeing alexander through a pane of crinkly glass he put it and he added i had the sense of being in longdistance contact with the composer himself he had no doubt of the supernormal means through which our writing came but he remains doubtful of the value of the music as evidence of ernests return from the world of shadows  have you tried to secure more of the music fowler asked  no not specifically but ive had one further inconclusive sitting since then with mrs hartley almost immediately ernest whispered a greeting and said i want to go on with that music garland i want to put b and d and a into the first barits only a bare sketch as it stands  to this i replied i cant do it ernest its beyond me wait till i can get blake again  this ended his attempt although he was terribly anxious so the psychic said i am going to try for the completion of this score through another psychic if i can get that eighth bar taken up and carried on by ernest through another psychic the case will become complicated  i have gone into detail in my account of this experiment for the reason that it illustrates very aptly the inextricable tangle of truth and error which most spirit communications present it typifies in little the elusive problem of spirit identification which many a veteran investigator is still at work upon after years of study maxwell gives a case of longcontinued unintentional and unconscious deception of the general kind which went far to prevent his acceptance of the spirit hypothesis  i dont think the failure to find the musical fragment invalidates this beautiful communication declared fowler you admit that many of the messages were to the point and that some of them were very intimate and personal  yes speaking generally i would say that e a might have uttered all the words and dictated all the messages except those that related to the publishing matter but there is the final test schumann declares that no such manuscript has ever been in his hands  he may be mistaken or e a may have misspoken himselffor as william james infers the spirits find themselves tremendously hampered in their attempts to manifest themselves furthermore you say you could not hear all that e a spokeyou or the psychic may have misunderstood him in any case it all seems to me a fine attempt at identification  i wish i could put the same value on it now that i did when blake played the first bar of that thrilling little melody but i cant as it recedes it loses its power over me  what did alexanders family think of the music  they thought it more like a cheyenne or omaha lovesong than like a melody of ernests own composition  but that only adds to the mystery of the mental process objected miller that supposes it to have come out of your mind  i cant believe that i had any hand in the musical part of it and i cant persuade myself that my dead friend was present  suppose you had been able to find that musical fragment would it have converted you this was millers challenge  no for even then some living person might have known of itmust have known of it and if a knowledge of it lay in some other mind no matter where and no matter how deeply buried in the subconscious that knowledge according to myers and hudson would have been accessible to the supernormal perception of the psychic  fowler interrogated me but suppose a phantom form resembling e a had spoken these things to you face to facewhat then  i would not have believed even then  why  well for one reason belief is not a matter of the will it is not even dependent upon evidence  miller interrupted me i am interested in the writing how do you account for the writing as i understand it the psychic did not in some instances touch the slate while the writing was going on are you sure of blake  blake is as much to be trusted as i am no i am forced to a practical acceptance of the theory of the fluidic arm and yet this is a most astounding admission we must suppose that the psychic was able to read our minds and write down our mingled and confused musical conceptions by means of a supernumerary hand it happens that i have since seen these etheric hands in action which makes it easier for me to conceive of such a process i have seen them dart forth from another medium precisely as described by scarpa i have seen them lift a glass of water and i have had them touch my knees beneath a table while slatewriting was going onso that given the power to read my mind there is nothing impossible having regard to bottazzis definite experiments in the idea of the etheric hands setting down the music and reproducing the signature of e a in fact at a recent sitting in a private house with a young male psychic we had this precise feat performed said the psychic to our host dr towne think hard of a signature that is very familiar to you and dr towne fixed his mind upon the signature of his brother and immediately while the young mans material hands were controlled his etheric hand seized a pencil in the middle of the table and reproduced the signature  could you see this hand miller asked  not in this case but at a sitting which followed this during such time as i sat beside the psychic and controlled one hand i plainly saw the supernumerary arm and hand dart forth and seize a pencil i saw a hand very plainly cross my knee and grasp me by the forearm all of this has its bearing upon this very curious phenomenon of the reproduction of e as youthful signature which remained very puzzling to us all  but did you not say that e a at times represented an opposing will questioned fowlerthat he disputed certain passages with blake and that he finally carried his point in opposition to every mind in the circle  yes that happened several times and was all very convincing at the time and yet this opposition may have been more apparent than real it may have concerned our conscious wills only our subconscious selves may have been in accord working together as one  fowler was a bit irritated if you are disposed to make the subconscious will allpowerful and omniscient nothing can be proved it seems to me an evasion however let me ask how you would explain away a spirit form carrying the voice the features and the musical genius of e a  well there is the teleplastic theory of albert de rochas he claims to have been able not merely to cause a hypnotized subject to exteriorize her astral self but to mould this vapory substance as a sculptor models wax so i can imagine that a momentary radiant apparition might have been created in the image of my sister or david or e a  to my thinking that is more complicated and incredible than the spirit hypothesis objected fowler  nothing can be more incredible to me than the spirit hypothesis i replied but then everything is incredible in the last analysis i am the more disposed to believe in the teleplastic theory for the reason that i have recently had an opportunity to witness a particularly incredible thing the materialization of a complete human form outside the cabinet and beside the psychica phenomenon which has a special bearing upon the matter of identity which we are discussing the sitting took place in a small private house here in the city the psychic in the case was a young business man who is careful not to advertise his power for four years he has been holding secret developing circles whereto a few of his friends only are invited i was present last sunday and shared in the marvels the place of the séance was the parlor of his apartment his young wife and little daughter being present there was in addition an elderly lady motherinlaw of the psychic and a polish student whom i will call jacob i am quite sure that no one else entered or left the room during the evening mrs pratt the motherinlaw occupied a seat between me and jacob the little girl sat at the window and was under my eye all the time the wife spent most of the evening at the piano on my right the room was fairly dark though the light of a faraway street lamp shone in at the window  the psychic retired into a little alcove bedroom which served as cabinet and the curtain had hardly fallen between him and our group when the spirit voices began the first one to speak was evan the guide and i remarked that his voice was precisely like a falsetto disguise of the psychics own  soon evan and other spirits appeared at the opening of the curtain the wife called them each by name but i could see only certain curious fluctuating cloudlike forms like puffs of firelit steam the effect was not that of illuminated gauze but more like illuminated vapor at length came one that spoke in a deep voice using a foreign language jacob the young pole sprang up in joyous excitement saying that he had sat many times in this little circle but that this was the first time a spirit had spoken to him in his own tongue as they conversed together i detected a close similarity of accent and of tone in their speech it certainly sounded like the polish language but i could not rid myself of the impression that the pole was talking to himself  what do you mean by that  i mean that the accent inflection and quality of the ghosts voice were identical with that of the living man and this became still more striking when a little later jacob returned to his seat and the count his visitor called for the polish national hymn jacob then sang and the phantom sang with him now this seemed like a clear case of identification and was perfectly satisfactory to jacob but i had observed this fact the pole was an indifferent singerhaving hard work to keep the keyand the count was troubled in the same way his deep almost toneless singing struck me as a dead flat wooden echo of jacobs voice in short it was as if the psychic had built up a personality partly out of himself but mainly out of his polish sitter and as if this etheric duplication were singing in unison with its progenitor  what nonsense exclaimed fowler  did he manufacture a double out of you queried miller  no one spoke to me from the shadow except the guide although i was hoping for some new word from ernest and kept him uppermost in my mind a form came out into the centre of the room which the wife said was evan and requested me to shake his hand this i did the hand felt as if it were covered with some gauzy veiling my belief is that it was the psychic himself who stood before me probably in trance i could see nothing however i do not remember that i could detect any shadow even but the hand was real and the voice and manner of speech were precisely those of the psychic himself  i repeat that this does not necessarily imply fraud for the mind and vocal organs of the psychic are often used in that way fowler argued  i grant that up to this point i had been able to see nothing but dim outlines but toward the end of the evening the psychic advanced from the cabinet and in a dazed way ordered the lamp to be lit this was done he then asked that it be turned low this was also done thereupon directing his gaze toward the curtain he called twice in a tone of command come out  i could place every one in the room at the moment i could see the psychic distinctly i could discern the color of his coat and the expression of his face he stood at least six feet from the opening in the curtain at his second cry in which i detected a note of entreaty i saw a luminous form taller than himself suddenly appear before the curtain and stand bowing in silence i could perceive neither face eyes nor feet but i could make out the arms under the shining robe the shape of the head and the shoulders and as he bowed i could see the bending of his neck it certainly was not a clotheshorse the covering was not so much a robe as a swathing and we had time to discuss it briefly  however my eyes were mainly busy with the psychic whose actions impressed me deeply he had the air of an anxious man undergoing a dangerous ordeal his right hand was stretched stiffly toward the phantom his left was held near his heart his knees seemed to tremble and his body appeared to be irresistibly drawn toward the cabinet slowly watchfully fearfully he approached the phantom the figure turned toward him and a moment later they metthey clung together they appeared to coalesce and the psychic fell through the curtain to the floor of the cabinet like a man smitten with death  what do you wish to imply asked miller do you mean that the man and the ghost were united in some way  precisely so the spirit seemed drawn by some magnetic force toward the psychic and the psychic seemed under an immense strain to keep the apparition exterior to himself when they met the spectre vanished and the psychics fall seemed inevitablea collapse from utter exhaustion i was at the moment convinced that i had seen a vaporous entity born of the medium it seemed a clear case of projection of the astral body in the pause which followed the psychics fall the young wife turned to me and said sometimes if my husband does not reach the spirit form in time he falls outside the curtain she did not seem especially alarmed  the young psychic himself however told me afterward that he was undergoing a tremendous strain as he stood there commanding the spirit to appear i had a fierce pain in the centre of my forehead he said i couldnt get my breath i felt as if all my substance my strength was being drawn out of me my legs seemed about to give way it is always hard to produce a form so far away from me when i am on the outside of the cabinet in the light the greater the distance the greater the strain i asked him what happened when he and the form rushed together and he answered as soon as i touched it it reentered my body2  i wonder why the spirits are always clothed in that luminous gauze queried miller  they are not replied fowler more often they come in the clothing which was their habitual wear  i asked this young psychic if drapery were used out of respect to us mortals and he replied no the forms are swathed not from sense of propriety so much as to protect the body which is often incomplete at the extremities the wife and jacob told me that at one of their meetings a naked hercules suddenly appeared before the curtain the pole declared he was of giant size and strength i felt of his muscles he was clothed only in a loincloth and i closely studied his tremendous arms and shoulders the medium as you know is a small thin man we called this figure the man from mars he was at least six feet high and strong as a lion he rushed back into the cabinet and came out holding the medium above his head on his upraised palms it was very wonderful  you didnt see anything like that did you asked miller  no i replied but i did see the development of a figure apparently from the floor between me and the curtain of the cabinet my attention was called to something wavering shimmering and fluctuating about a foot above the carpet it was neither steam nor flame it seemed compounded of both luminous vapor and puffing clouds of drapery it rose and fell in quivering impulses expanding and contracting but continuing to grow until at last it towered to the height of a tall man and i could dimly discern through dark draperies edged with light a mans figure  this the young wife said is judge white the grandfather of the psychic and she conversed with him but only for a few moments he soon dwindled and faded and melted away in the same fashion as he had come recalling to my mind richets description of the birth and disappearance of b b in algiers i know this sounds like the veriest dreaming but you must remember that materializations much more wonderful have been seen and analyzed in the clinical laboratories of turin and naples morselli bottazzi lombroso porro and foà have been confronted by similar apparitions they saw sinister faces and were repelled by satanic hands agile and prompt in cabinets of their own construction surrounded by their own registering machinery and richet photographed just such figures as this i have described  the question with me is not do these forms exist but what produces them i am describing this sitting to explain what i mean by the ideoplastic or teleplastic theory if for example this psychic had known me well enough to have had a very definite picture of e a he might have been able to model from the mindstuff that he or the circle had thrown off a luminous image of my friend and aided by my subconscious self might have united the presence and the musical thought of ernest alexander  it wont do exclaimed miller its all too destructive too preposterous  i insist that the spirit hypothesis is simpler repeated fowler  it isnt a question of simplicity i retorted its a question of fact if the observations of scientific experimentalists are of any value the teleplastic theory is on the point of winning acceptance  i will not admit that rejoined fowler for even if you throw out all the enormous mass of evidence accumulated by spiritistic investigators you still have the conversion of wallace lodge and lombroso not to speak of de vesme venzano and other wellknown men of science to account for even crookes himself admits that nothing but some form of spirit hypothesis is capable of explaining all the phenomena and in a recent issue of the annals of psychic science lombroso writes a paper making several very strong points against the biologic theory one of these is the simultaneous occurrence of phenomena can the subconscious self act in several places at once he asks a second objection lies in the fact that movements occur in opposition to the will of the psychicas for example when eusapia was transported in her chair can a man lift himself by his bootstraps is the question the centre of gravity of a body cannot be altered in space unless acted upon by an external force therefore the phenomena of levitation cannot be considered to be produced by energy emanating from the medium  i dont think that follows i argued force may be exerted unconsciously and invisibly because the psychic does not consciously will to do a certain thing is no proof that the action does not originate in the deeps of her personality we know very little of this obscure region of our minds  fowler was ready with his answer but let us take the case that lombroso cites of the beautiful woman spirit whose hand twice dashed the photographic plates from the grasp of those who wished to secure her picture here was plainly an opposing will for the psychic was lending herself to the experiment and the spectators were eager for its success notwithstanding which cooperation this phantom bitterly opposed the wishes of every one present and it was afterward learned that there was a special reason why she did not wish to leave positive proofs of her identity it is evident therefore concludes lombroso that a third will can intervene in spiritistic phenomena  furthermore dr venzano as well as de vesme have taken up the same body of facts upon which foà and morselli base their theory and arrive at a totally different conclusion they call attention to a dozen events that can be explained only on the theory of discarnate intelligences venzano observed that the forms occurred in several places at once that they appeared in many shapes and many guises some were like children some had curly hair some had beards in one case identification was made by introducing the finger of one of the sitters within the phantom mouth to prove the loss of a molar tooth sometimes the hair of these heads was plaited like that of a girl some of the hands were large and black others fair and pinklike a childs in short he argues that the medium could not have determined the size shape or color of the phantoms  all that does not really militate against the ideoplastic theory i retorted it is as easy to produce a phantom with hair plaited as it is to produce one with hair in curls if it is a case of the modelling of the etheric vapor by the mind of the psychic these differences would be produced naturally enough the forcible handling of the medium by the invisible ones is a much more difficult thing for me to explain for to imagine the psychic emitting a form of force which afterward proceeds to raise the psychic herself against her willas mrs smiley testifies happened again and again in her youthis to do violence to all that we know of natural law and yet it may be that the etheric double is able to take on part of the forces resident in the circle of sitters and so become immensely more potent than the psychic himself as in the case of the man from marsthe hercules i have just been telling you about then as to the content of these messages they may be impulses hints fragments of sentences caught from the air as one wireless operator intercepts communications meant for other stations than his own so that my interview with e a may have been a compounding of the psychic blake and myself and fugitive natures afloat in the ether in fact i am not as near a belief in the return of the dead as i was when i began this last series of experiments these italian scientific observers i confess have profoundly affected my thought  your idea is then said miller that these apparitions are emanations of the mediums physical substance moulded by his will and colored by the minds of his sitters  that is the uptodate theory and everything that i have experienced seems capable of a biologic interpretation against it  fowler hastened to weaken the force of this statement spiritists all admit that the forms of spirits are made uppartly at leastof the psychics material self but that does not prove that the mind of the ghost is not a separate entity from that of the psychic i grant that the only difference between the psychodynamic theory and the spiritualistic theory lies in the question of the origin of the intelligences that direct the manifestation foà would say they spring from the subconscious self of the psychic we say they come from the spirit world and there we stand  millers words were keen and without emotion until all phenomena are explained there will be obscure happenings and things to be explained by some one who can but it is no final explanation to say a man did it or an intelligence did it i have often been told that things cannot move in certain ways or certain things cannot be done except by intelligent action or guidance but it may be remembered that kepler thought guiding spirits were needful for making the planets move in their elliptical orbits  your scientists are feeding millions of people stones exclaimed fowler they ask for bread and you give them slices of granite  better granite than slime said miller i am with the biologists in this campaign let us have the truth no matter how unpalatable it may be if these phenomena exist they are in the domain of natural law and can be weighed and measured if they are imaginary they should be swept away like other dreams of superstition and ignorance  fowler was not to be silenced i predict that you and your like will yet be forced like lombroso to take your place with aksakof lodge wallace du prel and crookes who have come to admit the intervention of discarnate intelligences lombroso says we find as i already foresaw some years ago that these materialized bodies belong to the radiant state of matter which has now a sure foothold in science this is the only hypothesis that can reconcile the ancient and universal belief in the persistence of some manifestation of life after death with the results of science he adds these beings or remnants of beings would not be able to obtain complete consistency to incarnate themselves if they did not temporarily borrow a part of the medium but to borrow force from the medium is not the same thing as to be identical with the medium  well said i of this i am certain we cannot afford to ignore such experiments as those of morselli and bottazzi i am aware that many investigators discountenance such experiments but i believe with venzano that the physical phenomena of mediumship cannot be and ought not to be considered trivial it was the spasmodic movement of a decapitated frog that resulted in the discovery of the voltaic pile furthermore i intend to try every other conceivable hypothesis before accepting that of the spiritists  what is your reason for that asked fowler  because i am a scientist in my sympathies i believe in the methods of the chemist and the electrician i prefer the experimenter to the theorist i like the calm clear concise statements of these european savans who approach the subject not as bereaved persons but as biologists i am ready to go wherever science leads and i should be very glad to know that our life here is but a link in the chain of existence others may have more convincing knowledge than i but at this present moment the weight of evidence seems to me to be on the side of the theory that mediumship is after all a question of unexplored human biology  i dont see it that way rejoined fowler calmly suppose your biologists prove that the psychic can put forth a supernumerary arm or maintain for a short time a complete double of herself would that necessarily make the spiritist theory untenable is it not fair to conclude that if the soul or astral or etheric double can act outside the living body it can live and think and manifest after the dissolution of its material shell does not the experimental work of bottazzi morselli and de rochas all make for a spiritual interpretation of life rather than for the position of the materialist i consider that they have strengthened rather than weakened the mystic side of the universe they are bringing the wonder of the world back to the positivist let them go on they will yet demonstrate in spite of themselves the immortality of the soul  i hope they will i replied it would be glorious at this time when tradition begins to fail of power to have a demonstration of immortality come through the methods of experimental science certainly i would welcome a physical proof that my mother still thinks and lives and that ernest and other of my dearest friends are at work on other planes and surrounded by other conditions no matter how different from the conventional idea of paradise these environments might be but the proof must be ample and very definite  miller put in a last word of warning because a phenomenon has not been explained and no one knows how to explain it is no reason for supposing there is anything extraphysical about it no one has explained the first cause of the development of an embryo no one knows what goes on in an active nerve or why atoms are selective in their associates ignorance is not a proper basis for speculation and if one must have a theory let it be one having some obvious continuity with our best physical knowledge  and at that point our argument rested we separated and each went his way to be met by questions of business and politics and to be once more blended to the allenveloping mystery of life  footnote  2 since this conversation i have had a letter from another wellauthenticated psychic a man making his living by honest labor as a carpenter who gives very definitely his experience on emitting an etheric double he says one evening while sitting at the table i began to feel as if i were swelling up my thumb felt as big as my arm and my arm as big as my leg while i was perfectly aware that i was at the dinnertable i also felt myself in the hall trying to enter the diningroom i found the knob i opened the door the others saw me traverse the room toward myself my dual body came close beside me and vanished with a snap     addendum        a corroborative and technical account of psychical phenomena      involving the production of a musical score on a slate secured by      blake3   this record was secured during three sittings which took place on the forenoon and afternoon of friday march 13th and on the forenoon of saturday march 14 1908 these sittings were held in a dwellinghouse on a quiet street of ordinary character they began in a secondstory front room and were transferred to a parlor just below where there was a piano the room in either case was fairly light now and then the windowshades were lowered but reading and writing were easy at all times three persons were present the psychic a robust alert intelligent woman of thirtyfive hamlin garland and the writer who combined the functions of amanuensis and editor  the psychic was not in a trance and stated that she had never gone into one she conversed throughout in ordinary voice and manner save when with a certain emphasis she undertook to hasten the pace of her lagging controls the three sittings were attended by little noise pounding or violence there was no breaking or crumpling up of slates as had been the case during an earlier sitting on thursday  the psychics principal controlto be known here as dr cookespoke in whispers and his words were repeated aloud by the psychic herself these whisperings were only occasionally audible to the writer but they were plainly heard by mr garland it may be added that on at least two occasions however the writer heard and understood replies which the psychic declared had not been audible to her during the latter portion of these sittings especially that of saturday the control seemed to withdraw altogether and for two or three hours the circle was in apparent communicationdirect rapid uninterruptedwith an intelligence that may conveniently be termed the composer  the paraphernalia for these sittings comprised the following  1 a small light walnut centretable which mr garland himself had assisted in repairing before the proceedings began  2 a silicon bookslate eight inches by five inches there were six pagesthe insides of the covers and a double leaf these leaves lay close and flat like those of a book  3 a few bits of slatepencil from onequarter of an inch to threeeighths of an inch in length also a longer slatepencil used by the writer  4 a small writingpad and leadpencil for general memoranda and notations  5 certain fruits and flowers such as roses sweetpeas pineapples and grapefruit these met the psychics needs or fancies and were brought into close relation with pad or slate when the forces seemed inclined to weaken  6 the piano  shortly after the opening of the fridaymorning sitting the composer requested that the whole slate be ruled with staves for writing music throughout the preceding wednesday and thursday attempts at the writing of music had been of constant occurrence they had come on slates on writingpads and on the leaves of closed books these bits of musical notation had been very fragmentary and obscure often they had consisted of less than half a dozen notes placed upon staves consisting of but three or four lines instead of five the most successful of these earlier efforts had been produced on a double schoolslate with a wooden listbound frame two measures on a treble staff had been sprinkled with vague indications of musical script no attempts had yet been made to bring even the best of these various writings to order and intelligibility we were soon to learn that a scrap of music set down within three or four minutes was to require as many hours for revision emendation elucidationfor editing in brief it is but fair however to state that some of this time was taken up by the registering of irrelevant messages from other quarters and by digressions toward the composers own private concerns  the staff drawn on the woodenframed slate had been ruled crosswise the composer now directed that the new staves to be drawn on the silicon slate should run lengthwise and should cover every page of it this was done by the editor provision was asked for seven measures to which an eighth was added later  during the three minutes or so required for writing on the six pages of the slate the position of the slate in reference to the editor was as follows after considerable moving about beneath the top of the table during which time it was principally in the hands of the psychic it approached the writer and remained with him the under cover of the slate with a bit of slatepencil tightly enclosed rested on his knee the upper cover was pressed against the frame of the table the editors thumb rested rather lightly on the middle of the nearer half of the upper cover and his fingers assisted in supporting the nearer half of the under cover the psychic herself had surrendered the control of the slate to the editor and could have had no contact with it beyond touching the edge farthest from him on the second day saturday during which the bass for the last four measures was produced the slate was in the exclusive control of the editor the psychic not touching it at all the progress of the musical writing was both felt and heard it was a combination of light and rapid scratching pecking and twitching with an occasional slight waving motion up and down  the score as first revealed consisted of openheaded notes with curved stems they gave no indications of varying values it was impossible to distinguish quarternotes from eighthnotes sixteenthnotes or gracenotes and no rests were set down the notes were placed but approximately as regarded lines and spaces no stems save in one or two instances united the chords the notes of which were written more or less above one another yet detached a few unsatisfactory attempts were made by the composer to place the bars these were mostly put in by the editorsometimes by the direction or with the acquiescence of the composerand when they were drawn in advance of the writing their presence was always properly observed  as the revision became more close and careful the composer directed that the work be continued downstairs beside the piano here every bar of the treble was played separately as soon as edited to be pronounced satisfactory by the composer or to be modified under his direction the treble on its completioneight measureswas then played over in its entirety and pronounced by the composer to be correct he made one or two further emendations however on the following day the eight bars of the bass were gone over in the same fashion the attempt to play the entire composition treble and bass was not satisfactory partly owing to mechanical difficulties occasioned by the distribution of the matter on the slate and the multiplicity of corrections and partly from lack of skill in the performer however two or three very brief passages were given by both hands and pronounced correct by the composer who showed surprise that anything so simpleas he characterized itshould give so much trouble in one instance he noted that while the two parts treble and bass were correct separately they were not played in correct time together the composer throughout was most patient persevering courteous and encouraging though toward the endin the closing measures of the basshe showed some confusion and uncertainty wait a moment he would say and once the whisper asked that as an aid to sight the editors hand be spread over that leaf of the slate on which work was in progress the composer had thought earlierand so saidthat a trained musician could easily supply the bass from the melody his amanuensis was obliged to acknowledge frankly an inability to cope successfully with so complicated and unusual a matter the psychic herself though expressing a fondness for the opera disclaimed any knowledge of musical notation and added that never before had she performed such a function as at present  as the work of correction progressed the composer several times asked for opportunity to make the changes himself whereupon the penciltip would be enclosed in the slate and satisfactory emendations be forthcoming in cases where corrections were made by the writer the composer often watched the progress of the slatepencil a longer one than that which was used between the leaves and gave directions not there yes here and the like and he would often acknowledge a correction with a thank you or meet a suggestion with a yes if you please on these occasions the slate was some four feet distant from the psychic and practically out of her sight  repeated attempts were made on both sides to get down the name of the composition various related versions of the word appeared none of them quite satisfactory the composer seemed to acquiesce in our attempts to relate his title to different slavic and italian words for gypsy but no importance can be attached of course to such a piece of direct suggestion  the final version of this brief but laborious score has been preserved and all the stages in its progress have been abundantly annotated to follow it through in detail however would be but weariness all the salient points in its production fall under one of three heads there are first the passages that seem to have been produced in cooperation with the sitters there are second the passages that seem to have been produced in independence of the sitters and there are third the passages that seem to have been produced in direct opposition to the sitters examples of all three classes follow perhaps only those of the third and last class are really important  1 the composer in cooperation the piece in three sharps opened on the tonic yet the very first note in the bass was a gsharp the following colloquy ensued editor does the piece begin with the tonic chord of a composer yes editor is the gsharp then to be regarded as a suspension composer of course that makes it right how could it be correct otherwise  another example in the second bar a note which the editor had taken for an eighthnote was explained by the composer as being a gracenote the editor pointed out that this left only five eighthnotes to fill a sixeight measure the composer directed the insertion of an eighthrest at the beginning of the bar  in the fourth bar there was a partial chord eba fifth the composers attention was drawn to this blemish he requested the insertion of a gsharp between thus completing his triad  but the above examples and others which might be related are not without resemblances to thought transference  2 the composer in independence under this head may be placed his various instructions relative to tempo expression and the like the signature three sharps was set down by the editor as the result of an answer to his inquiry but the timesixeightwas written in on the editors request by the composer himself it was a distinct and separate effort for which the pencil was put in the slate and the slate placed beneath the table the time was set down before the notes themselves were secured the sixeight sign was clearly and neatly written on the proper staff in correct relation to the gclef and to the signature and the two figures were also in correct relation to each other the word moderato was written in by the composers direction without any request from the editor later the words with feeling and the mark of expression pp were obtained in the same way ties gracenotes and staccatomarks were insisted upon here and there with great vigor and earnestness  two further examples of the composers independence will perhaps suffice in the sixth measure there was a run of three eighthnotes in the treble exactly above a corresponding run of three eighthnotes in the bass in making his revision the composer directed that each of these three pairs of notes should be joined by stems this took the treble notes down to the bass and left the last half of the treble bar emptya fact unnoticed by the editor and beyond the purview of the psychic the composer however observed the hiatus and directed the insertion of two rests  one other instance the bar at the end of the first measure as originally drawn by the composer cut off two notes on legerlines and gave them to the succeeding measure another little colloquy editor shall i draw the bar where it belongs composer yes if you please editor here composer no editor there composer yes thank you  3 the composer in opposition numerous interesting cases of crosspurposes between the composer and the circle developed during these two days a number of salient examples follow  on the first opening of the slate the seventh measure of the treble contained but two notes which the composer presently declared to be quarternotes this left the first third of the measure vacant and the composer interrogated directed the insertion of a quarterrest the editor objected that this gave the measure a threequarter look instead of the proper sixeighth look that is a liberty i take came the answer like a flash  at one stage the composer requested that a certain note should have a dot added the editor placed the dot to the right of the note thus lengthening its value by onehalf no no objected the composer put it on top above the staff his intention had been once more to make a note staccato and he had been misunderstood  the editor in setting down the signature of sharps on the second page of the slate intentionally placed the last sharp a third below its proper position he was at once brought to book by dr cooke the control we are being fair by you and you must be fair by us  in the eighth and last measure which did not appear to be satisfactorily completed the composer called for the insertion of a figure 2 this meant as became clear enough through a subsequent reference to his published scores that he wished two quarternotes to receive the value of three eighthnotes but was not understood at the time by his helper never mind said the composer graciously i will write it differently he cancelled the figure 2 and completed the measure with a rest  a similar instance occurred in the fifth measure where the composer called insistently for a double sharp × the editor ventured to object and the passage was tried on the piano at the composers request the double sharp was felt by him to be unsatisfactory and was sacrificed it wont make much difference anyway was his whispered comment  a curious point to finish with on the first day the editor inquired about doubtful notes by name as a csharp and the like while the composer indicated their position by specifying lines and spacesas third space second line and so on the next day when the editor made his inquiries on the basis of lines and spaces the composer oftenest named the notes by letter  toward the end of the last sitting dr cooke once again came to the fore and hinted that the result of our endeavors might perhaps be not a reproduction of one of the composers manuscripts but of a mental picture in the composers mind the picture as secured by us was not it must be admitted without distortion the composer himself used the word scattered in such a way as to imply that he had sketched out his ideas in life on various detached bits of paper he added that a certain member of his family would know the hopes raised by this declaration have not been realized  no more music today whispered dr cooke and the sittingthe sittingsended   the end  footnote  3 blake is my friend henry b fuller who had never before sat for psychic phenomena and to whom i turned for help in securing the musical notation
