40808883	the garotters  by william d howells     part first     scene i  mrs roberts then mr roberts    at the window of her apartment in hotel bellingham mrs roberts stands looking out into the early nightfall  a heavy snow is driving without and from time to time the rush of the wind and the sweep of the flakes against the panes are heard  at the sound of hurried steps in the anteroom mrs roberts turns from the window and runs to the portiere through which she puts her head  mrs roberts  is that you edward  so dark here  we ought really to keep the gas turned up all the time  mr roberts in a muffled voice from without  yes its i  mrs roberts  well hurry in to the fire do  ugh what a storm do you suppose anybody will come  you must be half frozen you poor thing  come quick or youll certainly perish  she flies from the portiere to the fire burning on the hearth pokes it flings on a log jumps back brushes from her dress with a light shriek the sparks driven out upon it and continues talking incessantly in a voice lifted for her husband to hear in the anteroom  if id dreamed it was any such storm as this i should never have let you go out in it in the world  it wasnt at all necessary to have the flowers  i could have got on perfectly well and i believe now the table would look better without them  the chrysanthemums would have been quite enough and i know youve taken more cold  i could tell it by your voice as soon as you spoke and just as quick as theyre gone tonight im going to have you bathe your feet in mustard and hot water and take eight of aconite and go straight to bed  and i dont want you to eat very much at dinner dear and you must be sure not to drink any coffee or the aconite wont be of the least use  she turns and encounters her husband who enters through the portiere his face pale his eyes wild his white necktie pulled out of knot and his shirt front rumpled  why edward what in the world is the matter  what has happened  roberts sinking into a chair  get me a glass of water agnes winewhiskybrandy  mrs roberts bustling wildly about  yes yes  but whatbella bridget  maggyoh ill go for it myself and i wont stop to listen  onlyonly dont die  while roberts remains with his eyes shut and his head sunk on his breast in token of extreme exhaustion she disappears and reappears through the door leading to her chamber and then through the portiere cutting off the dining room  she finally descends upon her husband with a flagon of cologne in one hand a small decanter of brandy in the other and a wineglass held in the hollow of her arm against her breast  she contrives to set the glass down on the mantel and fill it from the flagon then she turns with the decanter in her hand and while she presses the glass to her husbands lips begins to pour the brandy on his head  here this will revive you and itll refresh you to have this cologne on your head  roberts rejecting a mouthful of the cologne with a furious sputter and springing to his feet  why youve given me the cologne to drink agnes  what are you about  do you want to poison me  isnt it enough to be robbed at six oclock on the common without having your head soaked in brandy and your whole system scented up like a barbers shop when you get home  mrs roberts  robbed  she drops the wineglass puts the decanter down on the hearth and carefully bestowing the flagon of cologne in the woodbox abandons herself to justice  then let them come for me at once edward  if i could have the heart to send you out in such a night as this for a few wretched rosebuds im quite equal to poisoning you  oh edward who robbed you  roberts  thats what i dont know  he continues to wipe his head with his handkerchief and to sputter a little from time to time all i know is that when i gotphewto that dark spot by the frog pond just byphewthat little group ofphewevergreens you knowphew  mrs roberts  yes yes go on  i can bear it edward  roberts  a man brushed heavily against me and then hurried on in the other direction  i had unbuttoned my coat to look at my watch under the lamppost and after he struck against me i clapped my hand to my waistcoat andphew  mrs roberts  waistcoat  yes  roberts  found my watch gone  mrs roberts  what  your watch  the watch willis gave you  made out of the gold that he mined himself when he first went out to california  dont ask me to believe it edward  but im only too glad that you escaped with your life  let them have the watch and welcome  oh nay dear dear husband  she approaches him with extended arms and then suddenly arrests herself  but youve got it on  roberts with as much returning dignity as can comport with his dishevelled appearance  yes i took it from him  at his wifes speechless astonishment  i went after him and took it from him he sits down and continues with resolute calm while his wife remains standing before him motionless  agnes i dont know how i came to do it  i wouldnt have believed i could do it  ive never thought that i had much couragephysical courage but when i felt my watch was gone a sort of frenzy came over me  i wasnt hurt and for the first time in my life i realised what an abominable outrage theft was  the thought that at six oclock in the evening in the very heart of a great city like boston an inoffensive citizen could be assaulted and robbed made me furious  i didnt call out  i simply buttoned my coat tight round me and turned and ran after the fellow  mrs roberts  edward  roberts  yes i did  he hadnt got halfadozen rods awayit all took place in a flashand i could easily run him down  he was considerably larger than i  mrs roberts  oh  roberts  and he looked young and very athletic but these things didnt seem to make any impression on me  mrs roberts  oh i wonder that you live to tell the tale edward  roberts  well i wonder a little at myself  i dont set up for a great deal of  mrs roberts  but i always knew you had it  go on  oh when i tell willis of this  had the robber any accomplices  were there many of them  roberts  i only saw one  and i saw that my only chance was to take him at a disadvantage  i sprang upon him and pulled him over on his back  i merely said ill trouble you for that watch of mine if you please jerked open his coat snatched the watch from his pocketi broke the chain i seeand then left him and ran again  he didnt make the slightest resistance nor utter a word of course it wouldnt do for him to make any noise about it and i dare say he was glad to get off so easily  with affected nonchalance  im pretty badly rumpled i see  he fell against me and a scuffle like that doesnt improve ones appearance  mrs roberts very solemnly  edward  i dont know what to say of course it makes my blood run cold to realise what you have been through and to think what might have happened but i think you behaved splendidly  why i never heard of such perfect heroism you neednt tell me that he made no resistance  there was a deadly struggleyour necktie and everything about you shows it  and you neednt think there was only one of them  roberts modestly  i dont believe there was more  mrs roberts  nonsense  there are always two  ive read the accounts of those garottings  and to think you not only got out of their clutches alive but got your property backwilliss watch oh what will willis say  but i know how proud of you hell be oh i wish i could scream it from the housetops  why didnt you call the police  roberts  i didnt thinki hadnt time to think  mrs roberts  no matter  im glad you have all the glory of it i dont believe you half realise what youve been through now  and perhaps this was the robbers first attempt and it will be a lesson to them  oh yes  im glad you let them escape edward  they may have families  if every one behaved as youve done there would soon be an end of garotting  but oh  i cant bear to think of the danger youve run  and i want you to promise me never never to undertake such a thing again  roberts  well i dont know  mrs roberts  yes yes you must  suppose you had got killed in that awful struggle with those reckless wretches tugging to get away from you  think of the children  why you might have burst a bloodvessel  will you promise edward  promise this instant on your bended knees just as if you were in a court of justice  mrs robertss excitement mounts and she flings herself at her husbands feet and pulls his face down to hers with the arm she has thrown about his neck  will you promise    scene ii  mrs crashaw mr and mrs roberts    mrs crashaw entering unobserved  promise you what agnes  the man doesnt smoke now  what more can you ask  she starts back from the spectacle of robertss disordered dress  why whats happened to you edward  mrs roberts springing to her feet  oh you may well ask that aunt mary  happened  you ought to fall down and worship him  and you will when you know what hes been through  hes been robbed  mrs crashaw  robbed  what nonsense  who robbed him  where was he robbed  mrs roberts  he was attacked by two garotters  roberts  no no  mrs roberts  dont speak edward  i know there were two  on the common  not half an hour ago  as he was going to get me some rosebuds  in the midst of this terrible storm  mrs crashaw  is this true edward  mrs roberts  dont answer edward  one of the band threw his arm round edwards neckso  she illustrates by garotting mrs crashaw who disengages herself with difficulty  mrs crashaw  mercy child  what are you doing to my lace  mrs roberts  and the other one snatched his watch and ran as fast as he could  mrs crashaw  williss watch  why hes got it on  mrs roberts with proud delight  exactly what i said when he told me  then very solemnly  and do you know why hes got it on sh edward  i will tell  because he ran after them and took it back again  mrs crashaw  why they might have killed him  mrs roberts  of course they might  but edward didnt care  the idea of being robbed at six oclock on the common made him so furious that he scorned to cry out for help or call the police or anything but he just ran after them  roberts  agnes  agnes  there was only one  mrs roberts  nonsense edward  how could you tell so excited as you wereand caught hold of the largest of the wretchesa perfect young giant  roberts  no no not a giant my dear  mrs roberts  well he was young anywayand flung him on the ground  she advances upon mrs crashaw in her enthusiasm  mrs crashaw  dont you fling me on the ground agnes  i wont have it  mrs roberts  and tore his coat open while all the rest were tugging at him and snatched his watch and thenand then just walked coolly away  roberts  no my dear i ran as fast as i could  mrs roberts  well ran  its quite the same thing and im just as proud of you as if you had walked  of course you were not going to throw your life away  mrs crashaw  i think he did a very silly thing in going after them at all  roberts  why of course if id thought twice about it i shouldnt have done it  mrs roberts  of course you wouldnt dear  and thats what i want him to promise aunt mary  never to do it again no matter how much hes provoked  i want him to promise it right here in your presence aunt mary  mrs crashaw  i think its much more important he should put on another collar andshirt if hes going to see company  mrs roberts  yes go right off at once edward  how you do think of things aunt mary  i really suppose i should have gone on all night and never noticed his looks  run edward and do it dear butkiss me first  oh it dont seem as if you could be alive and well after it all  are you sure youre not hurt  roberts embracing her  no im all right  mrs roberts  and youre not injured internally  sometimes theyre injured internallyarent they aunt maryand it doesnt show till months afterwards  are you sure  roberts making a cursory examination of his ribs with his hands yes i think so  mrs roberts  and you dont feel any bad effects from the cologne now  just think aunt mary i gave him cologne to drink and poured the brandy on his head when he came in  but i was determined to keep calm whatever i did  and if ive poisoned him im quite willing to die for itoh quite  i would gladly take the blame of it before the whole world  mrs crashaw  well for pitys sake let the man go and make himself decent  theres your bell now  mrs roberts  yes do go edward  butkiss me  mrs crashaw  he did kiss you agnes  dont be a simpleton  mrs roberts  did he  well kiss me again then edward  and now do go dear  mmmm  the inarticulate endearments represented by these signs terminate in a wild embrace protracted halfway across the room in the height of which mr willis campbell enters    scene iii  mr campbell mrs crashaw mr and mrs roberts    willis pausing in contemplation  hello  whats the matter whats she trying to get out of you roberts  dont you do it anyway old fellow  mrs roberts in an ecstasy of satisfaction  willis  oh youve come in time to see him just as he is  look at him willis  in the excess of her emotion she twitches her husband about and with his arm fast in her clutch presents him in the disadvantageous effect of having just been taken into custody  under these circumstances robertss attempt at an expression of diffident heroism fails he looks sneaking he looks guilty and his eyes fall under the astonished regard of his brotherinlaw  willis  whats the matter with him  whats he been doing  mrs roberts  sh edward  whats he been doing  what does he look as if he had been doing  mrs crashaw  agnes  willis  he looks as if he had been signing the pledge  and he smells like it  mrs roberts  for shame willis  i should think youd sink through the floor  edward not a word  i am ashamed of him if he is my brother  willis  why what in the worlds up agnes  mrs roberts  up  hes been robbedrobbed on the common not five minutes ago  a whole gang of garotters surrounded him under the old elmor just where it used to beand took his watch away and he ran after them and knocked the largest of the gang down and took it back again  he wasnt hurt but were afraid hes been injured internally he may be bleeding internally nowoh do you think he is willis  dont you think we ought to send for a physicianthat and the cologne i gave him to drink  its the brandy i poured on his head makes him smell so  and he all so exhausted he couldnt speak and i didnt know what i was doing either but hes promisedoh yes hes promisednever never to do it again  she again flings her arms about her husband and then turns proudly to her brother  willis  do you know what it means aunt mary  mrs crashaw  not in the least  but ive no doubt that edward can explain after hes changed his linen  mrs roberts  oh yes do go edward  not but what i should be proud and happy to have you appear just as you are before the whole world if it was only to put willis down with his jokes about your absentmindedness and his boasts about those california desperadoes of his  roberts  come come agnes  i must protest against your  mrs roberts  oh i know it doesnt become me to praise your courage darling  but i should like to know what willis would have done with all his california experience if a garotter had taken his watch  willis  i should have let him keep it and pay five dollars a quarter himself for getting it cleaned and spoiled  anybody but a literary man would  how many of them were there roberts  roberts  i only saw one  mrs roberts  but of course there were more  how could he tell in the dark and excitement  and the one he did see was a perfect giant so you can imagine what the rest must have been like  willis  did you really knock him down  mrs roberts  knock him down  of course he did  mrs crashaw  agnes will you hold your tongue and let the men alone  mrs roberts whimpering  i cant aunt mary  and you couldnt if it was yours  roberts  i pulled him over backwards  mrs roberts  there willis  willis  and grabbed your watch from him  roberts  i was in quite a frenzy i really hardly knew what i was doing  mrs roberts  and he didnt call for the police or anything  willis  ah that showed presence of mind  he knew it wouldnt have been any use  mrs roberts  and when he had got his watch away from them he just let them go because they had families dependent on them  willis  i should have let them go in the first place but you behaved handsomely in the end roberts theres no denying that and when you came in she gave you cologne to drink and poured brandy on your head  it must have revived you  i should think it would wake the dead  mrs roberts  i was all excitement willis  willis  no i should think from the fact that you had set the decanter here on the hearth and put your cologne into the woodbox you were perfectly calm agnes  he takes them up and hands them to her  quite as calm as usual  the doorbell rings  mrs crashaw  willis will you let that ridiculous man go away and make himself presentable before people begin to come  the bell rings violently peal upon peal  mrs roberts  oh my goodness whats that  its the garottersi know it is and we shall all be murdered in our beds  mrs crashaw  what in the world can it  willis  why dont your girl answer the bell agnes  or ill go myself  the bell rings violently again  mrs roberts  no willis you shant  dont leave me edward aunt maryoh if we must die let us all die together  oh my poor children  ugh  whats that  the servantmaid opens the outer door and uttering a shriek rushes in through the drawing room portiere  bella the maid  oh my goodness  mrs roberts its mr bemis  mrs roberts  which mr bemis  roberts  whats the matter with him  mrs crashaw  why doesnt she show him in  willis  has he been garotting somebody too    scene iv  mr bemis mr campbell mr and mrs roberts    bemis appearing through the portiere  ii beg your pardon mrs roberts  i oughtnt to present myself in this statei but i thought id better stop on my way home and report so that my son neednt be alarmed at my absence when he comes  i  he stops exhausted and regards the others with a wild stare while they stand taking note of his disordered coat his torn vest and his tumbled hat  ive just been robbed  mrs roberts  robbed  why edward has been robbed too  bemis  coming through the common  mrs roberts  yes edward was coming through the common  bemis  of my watch  mrs roberts in rapturous admiration of the coincidence  oh and it was edwards watch they took  willis  its a parallel case agnes  pour him out a glass of cologne to drink and rub his head with brandy  and you might let him sit down and rest while youre enjoying the excitement  mrs roberts in hospitable remorse  oh what am i thinking of here edwardor no youre too weak you mustnt  willis you help me to help him to the sofa  mrs crashaw  i think youd better help him off with his overcoat and his arctics  to the maid  here bella if you havent quite taken leave of your wits undo his shoes  roberts  ill help him off with his coat  bemis  careful careful  i may be injured internally  mrs roberts  oh if you only were mr bemis perhaps i could persuade edward that he was too  i know he is  edward dont exert yourself  aunt mary will you stop him or do you all wish to see me go distracted here before your eyes  willis examining the overcoat which roberts has removed  well you wont have much trouble buttoning and unbuttoning this coat for the present  bemis  they tore it open and tore my watch from my vest pocket  willis looking at the vest  i see  pretty lively work  were there many of them  bemis  there must have been two at least  mrs roberts  there were half a dozen in the gang that attacked edward  bemis  one of them pulled me violently over on my back  mrs roberts  edwards put his arm round his neck and choked him  mrs crashaw  agnes  mrs roberts  i know he did aunt mary  bemis  and the other tore my watch out of my pocket  mrs roberts  edwards  mrs crashaw  agnes im thoroughly ashamed of you  will you stop interrupting  bemis  and left me lying in the snow  mrs roberts  and then he ran after them and snatched his watch away again in spite of them all and he didnt call for the police or anything because it was their first offence and he couldnt bear to think of their suffering families  bemis with a stare of profound astonishment  who  mrs roberts  edward  didnt i say edward all the time  bemis  i thought you meant me  i didnt think of pursuing them but you may be very sure that if there had been a policeman within callof course there wasnt one within cannonshoti should have handed the scoundrels over without the slightest remorse  roberts  oh  he sinks into a chair with a slight groan  willis  what is it  roberts  sh  dont say anything  butstay here  i want to speak with you willis  bemis with mounting wrath  i should not have hesitated an instant to give the rascal in charge no matter who was dependent upon him no matter if he were my dearest friend my own brother  roberts under his breath  gracious powers  bemis  and while i am very sorry to disagree with mr roberts i cant help feeling that he made a great mistake in allowing the ruffians to escape  mrs crashaw with severity  i think you are quite right mr bemis  bemis  probably it was the same gang attacked us both  after escaping from mr roberts they fell upon me  mrs crashaw  i havent a doubt of it  roberts sotto voce to his brotherinlaw  i think ill ask you to go with me to my room willis  dont alarm agnes please  ii feel quite faint  mrs roberts crestfallen  i cant feel that edward was to blame edoh i suppose hes gone off to make himself presentable  but williswheres willis aunt mary  mrs crashaw  probably gone with him to help him  mrs roberts  oh he saw how unstrung poor edward was  mr bemis i think youre quite prejudiced  how could edward help their escaping  i think it was quite enough for him singlehanded to get his watch back  a ring at the door and then a number of voices in the anteroom  i do believe theyre all there  ill just run out and prepare your son  he would be dreadfully shocked if he came right in upon you  she runs into the anteroom and is heard without  oh dr lawton  oh lou dear  oh mr bemis  how can i ever tell you  your poor father  no no i cant tell you  you mustnt ask me  its too hideous  and you wouldnt believe me if i did  chorus of anguished voices  what what what  mrs roberts  theyve been robbed  garotted on the common  and oh dr lawton im so glad youve come  theyre both injured internally but i wish youd look at edward first  bemis  good heavens  is that mrs robertss idea of preparing my son  and his poor young wife  he addresses his demand to mrs crashaw who lifts the hands of impotent despair     part second     scene i  mr roberts mr campbell    in mr robertss dressingroom that gentleman is discovered tragically confronting mr willis campbell with a watch uplifted in either hand  willis  well  roberts gasping  mymy watch  willis  yes  how comes there to be two of it  roberts  dont you understand  when i went out ididnt take my watchwith me  i left it here on my bureau  willis  well  roberts  oh merciful heavens dont you see  then i couldnt have been robbed  willis  well but whose watch did you take from the fellow that didnt rob you then  roberts  his own  he abandons himself powerlessly upon a chair yes i left my own watch here and when that person brushed against me in the common i missed it for the first time  i supposed he had robbed me and ran after him and  willis  robbed him  roberts  yes  willis  ah ha ha ha  i hi hi hi  o ho ho ho  he yields to a series of these gusts and paroxysms bowing up and down and stamping to and fro and finally sits down exhausted and wipes the tears from his cheeks  really this thing will kill me  what are you going to do about it roberts  roberts with profound dejection and abysmal solemnity  i dont know willis  dont you see that it must have beenthat i must have robbedmr bemis  willis  bemis  after a moment for tasting the fact  why so it was  oh lord oh lord  and was poor old bemis that burly ruffian that bloodthirsty gang of giants thatthatoh lord oh lord  he bows his head upon his chairback in complete exhaustion demanding feebly as he gets breath for the successive questions what are you going to dooo  what shall you saaay  how can you explaaain it  roberts  i can do nothing  i can say nothing  i can never explain it  i must go to mr bemis and make a clean breast of it but think of the absurditythe ridicule  willis after a thoughtful silence  oh it isnt that youve got to think of  youve got to think of the old gentlemans sense of injury and outrage  didnt you hear what he saidthat he would have handed over his dearest friend his own brother to the police  roberts  but that was in the supposition that his dearest friend his own brother had intentionally robbed him  you cant imagine willis  willis  oh i can imagine a great many things  its all well enough for you to say that the robbery was a mistake but it was a genuine case of garotting as far as the assault and taking the watch go  hes a very pudgicky old gentleman  roberts  he is  willis  and i dont see how youre going to satisfy him that it was all a joke  joke  it wasnt a joke  it was a real assault and a bona fide robbery and bemis can prove it  roberts  but he would never insist  willis  oh i dont know about that  hes pretty queer bemis is you cant say what an old gentleman like that will or wont do  if he should choose to carry it into court  roberts  court  willis  it might be embarrassing  and anyway it would have a very strange look in the papers  roberts  the papers  good gracious  willis  ten years from now a man that heard you mentioned would forget all about the acquittal and say  roberts  oh yes  wasnt he the one they sent to the house of correction for garotting an old friend of his on the common  you see it wouldnt do to go and make a clean breast of it to bemis  roberts  i see  willis  what will you do  roberts  i must never say anything to him about it  just let it go  willis  and keep his watch  i dont see how you could manage that  what would you do with the watch  you might sell it of course  roberts  oh no i couldnt do that  willis  you might give it away to some deserving person but if it got him into trouble  roberts  no no that wouldnt do either  willis  and you cant have it lying around agnes would be sure to find it sooner or later  roberts  yes  willis  besides theres your conscience  your conscience wouldnt let you keep bemiss watch away from him  and if it would what do you suppose agness conscience would do when she came to find it out  agnes hasnt got much of a headthe want of it seems to grow upon her but shes got a conscience as big as the side of a house  roberts  oh i see i see  willis coming up and standing over him with his hands in his pockets  i tell you what roberts youre in a box  roberts abjectly  i know it willis i know it  what do you suggest  you must know some way out of it  willis  it isnt a simple matter like telling them to start the elevator down when they couldnt start her up  ive got to think it over  he walks to and fro robertss eyes helplessly following his movements  how would it do tono that wouldnt do either  roberts  what wouldnt  willis  nothing  i was just thinkingi say you mightor no you couldnt  roberts  couldnt what  willis  nothing  but if you were tono up a stump that way too  roberts  which way  for mercys sake my dear fellow dont seem to get a clew if you havent it  its more than i can bear  he rises and desperately confronts willis in his promenade  if you see any hope at all  willis stopping  why if you were a different sort of fellow roberts the thing would be perfectly easy  roberts  very well then  what sort of fellow do you want me to be  ill be any sort of fellow you like  willis  oh but you couldnt  with that face of yours and that confounded conscience of yours behind it you would give away the whitest lie that was ever told  roberts  do you wish me to lie  very well then i will lie what is the lie  willis  ah now youre talking like a man  i can soon think up a lie if youre game for it  suppose it wasnt so very whitesay a delicate blonde  roberts  i shouldnt care if it were as black as the ace of spades  willis  roberts i honour you  it isnt everybody who could steal an old gentlemans watch and then be so ready to lie out of it well you have got courageboth kindsmoral and physical  roberts  thank you willis  of course i dont pretend that i should be willing to lie under ordinary circumstances but for the sake of agnes and the childreni dont want any awkwardness about the matter it would be the death of me  well what do you wish me to say  be quick i dont believe i could hold out for a great while  i dont suppose but what mr bemis would be reasonable even if i  willis  im afraid we couldnt trust him  the only way is for you to take the bull by the horns  roberts  yes  willis  you will not only have to lie roberts but you will have to wear an air of innocent candour at the same time  roberts  iim afraid i couldnt manage that  what is your idea  willis  oh just come into the room with a laugh when we go back and say in an offhand way by the way agnes willis and i made a remarkable discovery in my dressingroom we found my watch there on the bureau  ha ha ha  do you think you could do it  roberts  ii dont know  willis  try the laugh now  roberts  id rather notnow  willis  well try it anyway  roberts  ha ha ha  willis  once more  roberts  ha ha ha  willis  pretty ghastly but i guess you can come it  roberts  ill try  and then what  willis  and then you say i hadnt put it on when i went out and when i got after that fellow and took it back i was simply getting somebody elses watch  then you hold out both watches to her and laugh again  everybody laughs and crowds round you to examine the watches and you make fun and crack jokes at your own expense all the time and pretty soon old bemis says why this is my watch now and you laugh more than ever  roberts  im afraid i couldnt laugh when he said that  i dont believe i could laugh  it would make my blood run cold  willis  oh no it wouldnt  youd be in the spirit of it by that time  roberts  do you think so  well  willis  and then you say well this is the most remarkable coincidence i ever heard of  i didnt get my own watch from the fellow but i got yours mr bemis and then you hand it over to him and say sorry i had to break the chain in getting it from him and then everybody laughs again andand that ends it  roberts with a profound sigh  do you think that would end it  willis  why certainly  itll put old bemis in the wrong dont you see  itll show that instead of letting the fellow escape to go and rob him you attacked him and took bemiss property back from him yourself  bemis wouldnt have a word to say  all youve got to do is to keep up a light confident manner  roberts  but what if it shouldnt put bemis in the wrong  what if he shouldnt say or do anything that weve counted upon but something altogether different  willis  well then you must trust to inspiration and adapt yourself to circumstances  roberts  wouldnt it be rather more of a joke to come out with the facts at once  willis  on you it would and a year from nowsay next christmas you could get the laugh on bemis that way  but if you were to risk it now theres no telling how hed take it  hes so indignant he might insist upon leaving the house  but with this plan of mine  roberts in despair  i couldnt willis  i dont feel light and i dont feel confident and i couldnt act it  if it were a simple lie  willis  oh lies are never simple they require the exercise of all your ingenuity  if you want something simple you must stick to the truth and throw yourself on bemiss mercy  roberts walking up and down in great distress  i cant do it i cant do it  its very kind of you to think it all out for me butstruck by a sudden ideawillis why shouldnt you do it  willis  i  roberts  you are good at those things  you have so much aplomb you know  you could carry it off you know firstrate  willis as if finding a certain fascination in the idea  well i dont know  roberts  and i could chime in on the laugh  i think i could do that if somebody else was doing the rest  willis after a moment of silent reflection  i should like to do it  i should like to see how old bemis would look when i played it on him  roberts i will do it  not a word  i should like to do it  now you go on and hurry up your toilet old fellow you neednt mind me here  ill be rehearsing  mrs roberts knocking at the door outside  edward are you never coming  roberts  yes yes ill be there in a minute my dear  willis  yes hell be there  run along back and keep it going till we come  roberts i wouldnt take a thousand dollars for this chance  roberts  im glad you like it  willis  like it  of course i do  or no  hold on  wait  it wont do  no you must take the leading part and ill support you and ill come in strong if you break down  thats the way we have got to work it  you must make the start  roberts  couldnt you make it better willis  its your idea  willis  no theyd be sure to suspect me and they cant suspect you of anythingyoure so innocent  the illusion will be complete  roberts very doubtfully  do you think so  willis  yes  hurry up  let me unbutton that collar for you     part third     scene i  mrs roberts dr lawton mrs crashaw mr bemis young mr and mrs bemis    mrs roberts surrounded by her guests and confronting from her sofa mr bemis who still remains sunken in his armchair has apparently closed an exhaustive recital of the events which have ended in his presence there  she looks round with a mixed air of selfdenial and selfsatisfaction to read the admiration of her listeners in their sympathetic countenances  dr lawton with an ironical sigh of profound impression  well mrs roberts you are certainly the most lavishly hospitable of hostesses  every one knows what delightful dinners you give but these little dramatic episodes which you offer your guests by way of appetizer are certainly unique  last year an elevator stuck in the shaft with half the company in it and this year a highway robbery its daring punishment and its reckless repetitionwhat the newspapers will call a triple mystery when it gets to themand both victims among our commensals  really i dont know what more we could ask of you unless it were the footpadded footpad himself as a commensal  if this sort of thing should become de rigueur in society generally i dont know whats to become of people who havent your invention  mrs roberts  oh its all very well to make fun now dr lawton but if you had been here when they first came in  young mrs bemis  yes indeed i think so too mrs roberts  if mr bemisalfred i meanand papa hadnt been with me when you came out there to prepare us i dont know what i should have done i should certainly have died or gone through the floor  she looks fondly up into the face of her husband for approval where he stands behind her chair and furtively gives him her hand for pressure  young mr bemis  somebody ought to write to the curwensmrs curwen that isabout it  mrs bemis taking away her hand  oh yes papa do write  lawton  i will my dear  even mrs curwen dazzling away in another spherehemisphereand surrounded by cardinals and all the other celestial lights there at rome will be proud to exploit this new evidence of american enterprise  i can fancy the effect she will produce with it  mrs roberts  and the millerswhat a shame they couldnt come how excited they would have beenthat is mrs miller  is their baby very bad doctor  lawton  well vaccination is always a very serious thingwith a first child  i should say from the way mrs miller feels about it that miller wouldnt be able to be out for a week to come yet  mrs roberts  oh how ridiculous you are doctor  bemis rising feebly from his chair  well now that its all explained mrs roberts i think id better go home and if youll kindly have them telephone for a carriage  mrs roberts  no indeed mr bemis  we shall not let you go why the idea  you must stay and take dinner with us just the same  bemis  but in this state  mrs roberts  oh never mind the state  you look perfectly well and if you insist upon going i shall know that you bear a grudge against edward for not arresting him  wait  we can put you in perfect order in just a second  she flies out of the room and then comes swooping back with a needle and thread a fresh white necktie a handkerchief and a hairbrush  there  i cant let you go to edwards dressingroom because hes there himself and the children are in mine and weve had to put the new maid in the guestchamberyou are rather cramped in flats thats true thats the worst of thembut if you dont mind having your toilet made in public like the king of france  bemis entering into the spirit of it  not the least but  he laughs and drops back into his chair  mrs roberts distributing the brush to young mr bemis and the tie to his wife and dropping upon her knees before mr bemis  now mrs lou you just whip off that crumpled tie and whip on the fresh one and mister lou you give his hair a touch and ill have this torn buttonhole mended before you can think  she seizes it and begins to sew vigorously upon it  mrs crashaw  agnes you are the most ridiculously sensible woman in the country  lawton standing before the group with his arms folded and his feet well apart in an attitude of easy admiration  the wounded adonis attended by the loves and graces  familiar pompeiian fresco  mrs roberts looking around at him  i dont see a great many loves  lawton  she ignores us mrs crashaw  and after what youve just said  mrs roberts  then why dont you do something  lawton  the loves never do anythingin frescoes  they stand round and sympathise  besides we are waiting to administer an anaesthetic  but what i admire in this subject even more than the activity of the graces is the serene dignity of the adonis  i have seen my old friend in many trying positions but i never realised till now all the simpering absurdity the flattered silliness the senile coquettishness of which his benign countenance was capable  mrs roberts  dont mind him a bit mr bemis its nothing but  lawton  pure envy  i own it  bemis  all right lawton  wait till  mrs roberts making a final stitch snapping off the thread and springing to her feet all in one  there have you finished mr and mrs lou  well then take this lace handkerchief and draw it down from his neck and pin it in his waistcoat and you have  lawton as mr bemis rises to his feet  a gentleman of the old school  bemis you look like a miniature of yourself by malbone rather flattered butrecognisable  bemis with perfectly recovered gaiety  go on go on lawton  i can understand your envy  i can pity it  lawton  could you forgive roberts for not capturing the garotter  bemis  yes i could  i could give the garotter his liberty and present him with an admission to the provident woodyard where he could earn an honest living for his family  lawton compassionately  you are pretty far gone bemis  really i think somebody ought to go for roberts  mrs roberts innocently  yes indeed  why what in the world can be keeping him  a nursemaid enters and beckons mrs roberts to the door with a glance  she runs to her they whisper and then mrs roberts over her shoulder  that ridiculous great boy of mine says he cant go to sleep unless i come and kiss him goodnight  lawton  which ridiculous great boy i wonderroberts or campbell  but i didnt know they had gone to bed  mrs bemis  you are too bad papa  you know its little neddy  mrs roberts vanishing  oh i dont mind his nonsense lou  ill fetch them both back with me  lawton after making a melodramatic search for concealed listeners at the doors  now friends i have a revelation to make in mrs robertss absence  i have found out the garotterthe assassin  all the others  what  lawton  he has been secured  mrs crashaw severely  well im very glad of it  young bemis  by the police  mrs bemis incredulously  papa  bemis  but there were several of them  have they all been arrested  lawton  there was only one and none of him has been arrested  mrs crashaw  where is he then  lawton  in this house  mrs crashaw  now dr lawton you and i are old friendsi shouldnt like to say how oldbut if you dont instantly be serious iill carry my rheumatism to somebody else  lawton  my dear mrs crashaw you know how much i prize that rheumatism of yours  i will be seriousi will be only too serious the garotter is mr roberts himself  all horrorstruck  oh  lawton  he went out without his watch  he thought he was robbed but he wasnt  he ran after the supposed thief our poor friend bemis here and took bemiss watch away and brought it home for his own  young bemis  yes but  mrs bemis  but papa  bemis  how do you know it  i can see how such a thing might happen buthow do you know it did  lawton  i divined it  mrs crashaw  nonsense  lawton  very well then i read of just such a ease in the advertiser a year ago  it occurs annuallyin the newspapers  and ill tell you what mrs crashawroberts found out his mistake as soon as he went to his dressingroom and that ingenious nephew of yours whos closeted with him there has been trying to put him up to somethingto some game  mrs crashaw  willis has too much sense  he would know that edward couldnt carry out any sort of game  lawton  well then hes getting roberts to let him carry out the game  mrs crashaw  edward couldnt do that either  lawton  very well then just wait till they come back  will you leave me to deal with campbell  mrs crashaw  what are you going to do  young bemis  you mustnt forget that he got us out of the elevator sir  mrs bemis  we might have been there yet if it hadnt been for him papa  mrs crashaw  i shouldnt want willis mortified  bemis  nor mr roberts annoyed  were fellowsufferers in this business  lawton  oh leave it to me leave it to me  ill spare their feelings  dont be afraid  ah there they come  now dont say anything  ill just step into the anteroom here    scene ii  mr roberts mr campbell and the others    roberts entering the room before campbell and shaking hands with his guests  ah mr bemis mrs bemis aunt mary  youve heard of our comical little coincidenceourmr bemis and my  he halts confused and looks around for the moral support of willis who follows hilariously  willis  greatest joke on record  but i wont spoil it for you roberts  go on  in a low voice to roberts  and dont look so confoundedly down in the mouth  they wont think its a joke at all  roberts with galvanic lightness  yes yessuch a joke  well you seeyou see  mrs crashaw  see what edward  do get it out  willis jollily  ah ha ha  roberts lugubriously  ah

you know that i had been robbed andand  willis  go on go on  roberts whispering  i cant do it  willis whispering  youve got to  youre the beaver that clomb the tree  laugh naturally now  roberts with a staccato groan which he tries to make pass for a laugh  and then i ran after the man he stops and regards mr bemis with a ghastly stare  mrs crashaw  what is the matter with you edward  are you sick  willis  sick  no  cant you see that he cant get over the joke of the thing  its killing him  to roberts  brace up old man youre doing it splendidly  roberts hopelessly  and then the other manthe man that had robbed methe man that i had pursuedugh  willis  well it is too much for him  i shall have to tell it myself i see  roberts making a wild effort to command himself  and sosothis manmanma  willis  oh good lord  dr lawton suddenly appears from the anteroom and confronts him  oh the devil  lawton folding his arms and fixing his eyes upon him  which means that you forgot i was coming  willis  doctor you read a mans symptoms at a glance  lawton  yes and i can see that you are in a bad way mr campbell  willis  why dont you advertise doctor  patients need only enclose a lock of their hair and the colour of their eyes with one dollar to pay the cost of materials which will be sent with full directions for treatment by return mail  seventh son of a seventh son  lawton  ah dont try to jest it away my poor friend  this is one of those obscure diseases of the heartinduration of the pericardiumwhich if not taken in time result in deceitfulness above all things and desperate wickedness  willis  look here dr lawton what are you up to  lawton  look here mr campbell what is your little game  willis  i dont know what youre up to  he shrugs his shoulders and walks up the room  lawton shrugging his shoulders and walking up the room abreast of campbell  i dont know what your little game is  they return together and stop confronting each other  willis  but if you think im going to give myself away  lawton  if you suppose im going to take you at your own figure they walk up the room together and return as before  willis  mrs bemis what is this unnatural parent of yours after  mrs bemis tittering  oh im sure i cant tell  willis  aunt mary you used to be a friend of mine  cant you give me some sort of clue  mrs crashaw  i should be ashamed of you willis if you accepted anybodys help  willis sighing  well this is pretty hard on an orphan  here i come to join a company of friends at the fireside of a burgled brotherinlaw and i find myself in a nest of conspirators suddenly after a moment  oh i understand  why i ought to have seen at once  but no matterits just as well  im sure that we shall hear dr lawton leniently and make allowance for his well known foible  roberts is bound by the laws of hospitality and mr bemis is the fatherinlaw of his daughter  mrs bemis in serious dismay  why mr campbell what do you mean  willis  simply that the mystery is solvedthe double garotter is discovered  im sorry for you mrs bemis and no one will wish to deal harshly with your father when he confesses that it was he who robbed mr roberts and mr bemis  all that they ask is to have their watches back  go on doctor  how will that do aunt mary for a little flyer  mrs crashaw  willis i declare i never saw anybody like you she embraces him with joyous pride  roberts coming forward anxiously  but my dear willis  willis clapping his hand over his mouth and leading him back to his place  we cant let you talk now  ive no doubt youll be considerate and all that but dr lawton has the floor  go on doctor  free your mind  dont be afraid of telling the whole truth  it will be better for you in the end  he rubs his hands gleefully and then thrusting the points of them into his waistcoat pockets stands beaming triumphantly upon lawton  lawton  do you think so  with wellaffected trepidation well friends if i must confess thisthis  willis  highhanded outrage  go on  lawton  i suppose i must  i shall not expect mercy for myself perhaps youll say that as an old and hardened offender i dont deserve it  but i had an accomplicea young man very respectably connected and who whatever his previous life may have been had managed to keep a good reputation a young man a little apt to be misled by overweening vanity and the illadvised flattery of his friends but i hope that neither of you gentlemen will be hard upon him but will consider his youth and perhaps his congenital moral and intellectual deficiencies even when you find your watcheson mr campbells person  he leans forward rubbing his hands and smiling upon campbell how will that do mr campbell for a flyer  willis turning to mrs crashaw  one ahead aunt mary  lawton clasping him by the hand  no generous youtheven  they shake hands clapping each other on the back with their lefts and joining in the general laugh  bemis coming forward jovially  well now i gladly forgive you bothor whoever did rob meif youll only give me back my watch  willis  i havent got your watch  lawton  nor i  roberts rather faintly and coming reluctantly forward  ii have it mr bemis  he produces it from one waistcoat pocket and hands it to bemis  then visiting the other  and whats worse i have my own  i dont know how i can ever explain it or atone to you for my extraordinary behaviour  willis thought you might finally see it as a joke and ive done my best to pass it off lightly  willis  and you succeeded  you had all the lightness of a sick hippopotamus  roberts  im afraid so  ill have the chain mended of course but when i went out this evening i left my watch on my dressing table and when you struck against me in the common i missed it and supposed i had been robbed and i ran after you and took yours  willis  being a man of the most violent temper and the most desperate courage  roberts  but i hope my dear sir that i didnt hurt you seriously  bemis  not at allnot the least  shaking him cordially by both hands  im all right  mrs roberts has healed all my wounds with her skilful needle ive got on one of your best neckties and this lace handkerchief of your wifes which im going to keep for a souvenir of the most extraordinary adventure of my life  lawton  oh its an old newspaper story bemis i tell you  willis  well aunt mary i wish agnes were here now to see roberts in his character of moral hero  he done it with his little hatchet but he waited to make sure that bushrod was all right before he owned up  mrs roberts appearing  who willis  willis  a very great and good mangeorge washington  mrs roberts  i thought you meant edward  willis  well i dont suppose there is much difference  mrs crashaw  the robber has been caught agnes  mrs roberts  caught  nonsense  you dont mean it  how can you trifle with such a subject  i know you are joking  who is it  young bemis  you never could guess  mrs bemis  never in the world  mrs roberts  i dont wish to  but oh mr bemis ive just come from my own children and you must be merciful to his family  bemis  for your sake dear lady i will  bella between the portieres  dinner is ready mrs roberts  mrs roberts passing her hand through mr bemiss arm  oh then you must go in with me and tell me all about it
