19262206	daisy miller a study  in two parts  the text is that of the first american appearance in book form 1879      part i   at the little town of vevey in switzerland there is a particularly comfortable hotel there are indeed many hotels for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place which as many travelers will remember is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lakea lake that it behooves every tourist to visit the shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order of every category from the grand hotel of the newest fashion with a chalkwhite front a hundred balconies and a dozen flags flying from its roof to the little swiss pension of an elder day with its name inscribed in germanlooking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden one of the hotels at vevey however is famous even classical being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity in this region in the month of june american travelers are extremely numerous it may be said indeed that vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an american watering place there are sights and sounds which evoke a vision an echo of newport and saratoga there is a flitting hither and thither of stylish young girls a rustling of muslin flounces a rattle of dance music in the morning hours a sound of highpitched voices at all times you receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the trois couronnes and are transported in fancy to the ocean house or to congress hall but at the trois couronnes it must be added there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions neat german waiters who look like secretaries of legation russian princesses sitting in the garden little polish boys walking about held by the hand with their governors a view of the sunny crest of the dent du midi and the picturesque towers of the castle of chillon  i hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young american who two or three years ago sat in the garden of the trois couronnes looking about him rather idly at some of the graceful objects i have mentioned it was a beautiful summer morning and in whatever fashion the young american looked at things they must have seemed to him charming he had come from geneva the day before by the little steamer to see his aunt who was staying at the hotelgeneva having been for a long time his place of residence but his aunt had a headachehis aunt had almost always a headacheand now she was shut up in her room smelling camphor so that he was at liberty to wander about he was some sevenandtwenty years of age when his friends spoke of him they usually said that he was at geneva studying when his enemies spoke of him they saidbut after all he had no enemies he was an extremely amiable fellow and universally liked what i should say is simply that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived therea foreign ladya person older than himself very few americansindeed i think nonehad ever seen this lady about whom there were some singular stories but winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of calvinism he had been put to school there as a boy and he had afterward gone to college therecircumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships many of these he had kept and they were a source of great satisfaction to him  after knocking at his aunts door and learning that she was indisposed he had taken a walk about the town and then he had come in to his breakfast he had now finished his breakfast but he was drinking a small cup of coffee which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache at last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette presently a small boy came walking along the pathan urchin of nine or ten the child who was diminutive for his years had an aged expression of countenance a pale complexion and sharp little features he was dressed in knickerbockers with red stockings which displayed his poor little spindleshanks he also wore a brilliant red cravat he carried in his hand a long alpenstock the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approachedthe flowerbeds the garden benches the trains of the ladies dresses in front of winterbourne he paused looking at him with a pair of bright penetrating little eyes  will you give me a lump of sugar he asked in a sharp hard little voicea voice immature and yet somehow not young  winterbourne glanced at the small table near him on which his coffee service rested and saw that several morsels of sugar remained yes you may take one he answered but i dont think sugar is good for little boys  this little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers depositing the other as promptly in another place he poked his alpenstock lancefashion into winterbournes bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth  oh blazes its harrd he exclaimed pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner  winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman take care you dont hurt your teeth he said paternally  i havent got any teeth to hurt they have all come out i have only got seven teeth my mother counted them last night and one came out right afterward she said shed slap me if any more came out i cant help it its this old europe its the climate that makes them come out in america they didnt come out its these hotels  winterbourne was much amused if you eat three lumps of sugar your mother will certainly slap you he said  shes got to give me some candy then rejoined his young interlocutor i cant get any candy hereany american candy american candys the best candy  and are american little boys the best little boys asked winterbourne  i dont know im an american boy said the child  i see you are one of the best laughed winterbourne  are you an american man pursued this vivacious infant and then on winterbournes affirmative replyamerican men are the best he declared  his companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to europe at about this age  here comes my sister cried the child in a moment shes an american girl  winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing american girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion  my sister aint the best the child declared shes always blowing at me  i imagine that is your fault not hers said winterbourne the young lady meanwhile had drawn near she was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of palecolored ribbon she was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty how pretty they are thought winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise  the young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake the little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little  randolph said the young lady what are you doing  im going up the alps replied randolph this is the way and he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about winterbournes ears  thats the way they come down said winterbourne  hes an american man cried randolph in his little hard voice  the young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother well i guess you had better be quiet she simply observed  it seemed to winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented he got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette this little boy and i have made acquaintance he said with great civility in geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at vevey what conditions could be better than thesea pretty american girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden this pretty american girl however on hearing winterbournes observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains he wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat while he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again  i should like to know where you got that pole she said  i bought it responded randolph  you dont mean to say youre going to take it to italy  yes i am going to take it to italy the child declared  the young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again well i guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment  are you going to italy winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect  the young lady glanced at him again yes sir she replied and she said nothing more  are youagoing over the simplon winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed  i dont know she said i suppose its some mountain randolph what mountain are we going over  going where the child demanded  to italy winterbourne explained  i dont know said randolph i dont want to go to italy i want to go to america  oh italy is a beautiful place rejoined the young man  can you get candy there randolph loudly inquired  i hope not said his sister i guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too  i havent had any for ever so longfor a hundred weeks cried the boy still jumping about  the young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view he was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself there had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered if she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking it was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girls eyes were singularly honest and fresh they were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywomans various featuresher complexion her nose her ears her teeth he had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young ladys face he made several observations it was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate winterbourne mentally accused itvery forgivinglyof a want of finish he thought it very possible that master randolphs sister was a coquette he was sure she had a spirit of her own but in her bright sweet superficial little visage there was no mockery no irony before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation she told him that they were going to rome for the wintershe and her mother and randolph she asked him if he was a real american she shouldnt have taken him for one he seemed more like a germanthis was said after a little hesitationespecially when he spoke winterbourne laughing answered that he had met germans who spoke like americans but that he had not so far as he remembered met an american who spoke like a german then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted she answered that she liked standing up and walking about but she presently sat down she told him she was from new york stateif you know where that is winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side  tell me your name my boy he said  randolph c miller said the boy sharply and ill tell you her name and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister  you had better wait till you are asked said this young lady calmly  i should like very much to know your name said winterbourne  her name is daisy miller cried the child but that isnt her real name that isnt her name on her cards  its a pity you havent got one of my cards said miss miller  her real name is annie p miller the boy went on  ask him his name said his sister indicating winterbourne  but on this point randolph seemed perfectly indifferent he continued to supply information with regard to his own family my fathers name is ezra b miller he announced my father aint in europe my fathers in a better place than europe  winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that mr miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward but randolph immediately added my fathers in schenectady hes got a big business my fathers rich you bet  well ejaculated miss miller lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border winterbourne presently released the child who departed dragging his alpenstock along the path he doesnt like europe said the young girl he wants to go back  to schenectady you mean  yes he wants to go right home he hasnt got any boys here there is one boy here but he always goes round with a teacher they wont let him play  and your brother hasnt any teacher winterbourne inquired  mother thought of getting him one to travel round with us there was a lady told her of a very good teacher an american ladyperhaps you know hermrs sanders i think she came from boston she told her of this teacher and we thought of getting him to travel round with us but randolph said he didnt want a teacher traveling round with us he said he wouldnt have lessons when he was in the cars and we are in the cars about half the time there was an english lady we met in the carsi think her name was miss featherstone perhaps you know her she wanted to know why i didnt give randolph lessonsgive him instruction she called it i guess he could give me more instruction than i could give him hes very smart  yes said winterbourne he seems very smart  mothers going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to italy can you get good teachers in italy  very good i should think said winterbourne  or else shes going to find some school he ought to learn some more hes only nine hes going to college and in this way miss miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics she sat there with her extremely pretty hands ornamented with very brilliant rings folded in her lap and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of winterbourne now wandering over the garden the people who passed by and the beautiful view she talked to winterbourne as if she had known him a long time he found it very pleasant it was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much it might have been said of this unknown young lady who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench that she chattered she was very quiet she sat in a charming tranquil attitude but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving she had a soft slender agreeable voice and her tone was decidedly sociable she gave winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother in europe and enumerated in particular the various hotels at which they had stopped that english lady in the cars she saidmiss featherstoneasked me if we didnt all live in hotels in america i told her i had never been in so many hotels in my life as since i came to europe i have never seen so manyits nothing but hotels but miss miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent she appeared to be in the best humor with everything she declared that the hotels were very good when once you got used to their ways and that europe was perfectly sweet she was not disappointednot a bit perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before she had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times and then she had had ever so many dresses and things from paris whenever she put on a paris dress she felt as if she were in europe  it was a kind of a wishing cap said winterbourne  yes said miss miller without examining this analogy it always made me wish i was here but i neednt have done that for dresses i am sure they send all the pretty ones to america you see the most frightful things here the only thing i dont like she proceeded is the society there isnt any society or if there is i dont know where it keeps itself do you i suppose there is some society somewhere but i havent seen anything of it im very fond of society and i have always had a great deal of it i dont mean only in schenectady but in new york i used to go to new york every winter in new york i had lots of society last winter i had seventeen dinners given me and three of them were by gentlemen added daisy miller i have more friends in new york than in schenectadymore gentleman friends and more young lady friends too she resumed in a moment she paused again for an instant she was looking at winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light slightly monotonous smile i have always had she said a great deal of gentlemens society  poor winterbourne was amused perplexed and decidedly charmed he had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion never at least save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment and yet was he to accuse miss daisy miller of actual or potential inconduite as they said at geneva he felt that he had lived at geneva so long that he had lost a good deal he had become dishabituated to the american tone never indeed since he had grown old enough to appreciate things had he encountered a young american girl of so pronounced a type as this certainly she was very charming but how deucedly sociable was she simply a pretty girl from new york state were they all like that the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemens society or was she also a designing an audacious an unscrupulous young person winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter and his reason could not help him miss daisy miller looked extremely innocent some people had told him that after all american girls were exceedingly innocent and others had told him that after all they were not he was inclined to think miss daisy miller was a flirta pretty american flirt he had never as yet had any relations with young ladies of this category he had known here in europe two or three womenpersons older than miss daisy miller and provided for respectabilitys sake with husbandswho were great coquettesdangerous terrible women with whom ones relations were liable to take a serious turn but this young girl was not a coquette in that sense she was very unsophisticated she was only a pretty american flirt winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to miss daisy miller he leaned back in his seat he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of ones intercourse with a pretty american flirt it presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn  have you been to that old castle asked the young girl pointing with her parasol to the fargleaming walls of the chateau de chillon  yes formerly more than once said winterbourne you too i suppose have seen it  no we havent been there i want to go there dreadfully of course i mean to go there i wouldnt go away from here without having seen that old castle  its a very pretty excursion said winterbourne and very easy to make you can drive you know or you can go by the little steamer  you can go in the cars said miss miller  yes you can go in the cars winterbourne assented  our courier says they take you right up to the castle the young girl continued we were going last week but my mother gave out she suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia she said she couldnt go randolph wouldnt go either he says he doesnt think much of old castles but i guess well go this week if we can get randolph  your brother is not interested in ancient monuments winterbourne inquired smiling  he says he dont care much about old castles hes only nine he wants to stay at the hotel mothers afraid to leave him alone and the courier wont stay with him so we havent been to many places but it will be too bad if we dont go up there and miss miller pointed again at the chateau de chillon  i should think it might be arranged said winterbourne couldnt you get some one to stay for the afternoon with randolph  miss miller looked at him a moment and then very placidly i wish you would stay with him she said  winterbourne hesitated a moment i should much rather go to chillon with you  with me asked the young girl with the same placidity  she didnt rise blushing as a young girl at geneva would have done and yet winterbourne conscious that he had been very bold thought it possible she was offended with your mother he answered very respectfully  but it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller i guess my mother wont go after all she said she dont like to ride round in the afternoon but did you really mean what you said just nowthat you would like to go up there  most earnestly winterbourne declared  then we may arrange it if mother will stay with randolph i guess eugenio will  eugenio the young man inquired  eugenios our courier he doesnt like to stay with randolph hes the most fastidious man i ever saw but hes a splendid courier i guess hell stay at home with randolph if mother does and then we can go to the castle  winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possiblewe could only mean miss daisy miller and himself this program seemed almost too agreeable for credence he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladys hand possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project but at this moment another person presumably eugenio appeared a tall handsome man with superb whiskers wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain approached miss miller looking sharply at her companion oh eugenio said miss miller with the friendliest accent  eugenio had looked at winterbourne from head to foot he now bowed gravely to the young lady i have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table  miss miller slowly rose see here eugenio she said im going to that old castle anyway  to the chateau de chillon mademoiselle the courier inquired mademoiselle has made arrangements he added in a tone which struck winterbourne as very impertinent  eugenios tone apparently threw even to miss millers own apprehension a slightly ironical light upon the young girls situation she turned to winterbourne blushing a littlea very little you wont back out she said  i shall not be happy till we go he protested  and you are staying in this hotel she went on and you are really an american  the courier stood looking at winterbourne offensively the young man at least thought his manner of looking an offense to miss miller it conveyed an imputation that she picked up acquaintances i shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me he said smiling and referring to his aunt  oh well well go some day said miss miller and she gave him a smile and turned away she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio winterbourne stood looking after her and as she moved away drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess  he had however engaged to do more than proved feasible in promising to present his aunt mrs costello to miss daisy miller as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache he waited upon her in her apartment and after the proper inquiries in regard to her health he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an american familya mamma a daughter and a little boy  and a courier said mrs costello oh yes i have observed them seen themheard themand kept out of their way mrs costello was a widow with a fortune a person of much distinction who frequently intimated that if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time she had a long pale face a high nose and a great deal of very striking white hair which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head she had two sons married in new york and another who was now in europe this young man was amusing himself at hamburg and though he was on his travels was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there her nephew who had come up to vevey expressly to see her was therefore more attentive than those who as she said were nearer to her he had imbibed at geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to ones aunt mrs costello had not seen him for many years and she was greatly pleased with him manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which as she gave him to understand she exerted in the american capital she admitted that she was very exclusive but if he were acquainted with new york he would see that one had to be and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city which she presented to him in many different lights was to winterbournes imagination almost oppressively striking  he immediately perceived from her tone that miss daisy millers place in the social scale was low i am afraid you dont approve of them he said  they are very common mrs costello declared they are the sort of americans that one does ones duty by notnot accepting  ah you dont accept them said the young man  i cant my dear frederick i would if i could but i cant  the young girl is very pretty said winterbourne in a moment  of course shes pretty but she is very common  i see what you mean of course said winterbourne after another pause  she has that charming look that they all have his aunt resumed i cant think where they pick it up and she dresses in perfectionno you dont know how well she dresses i cant think where they get their taste  but my dear aunt she is not after all a comanche savage  she is a young lady said mrs costello who has an intimacy with her mammas courier  an intimacy with the courier the young man demanded  oh the mother is just as bad they treat the courier like a familiar friendlike a gentleman i shouldnt wonder if he dines with them very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners such fine clothes so like a gentleman he probably corresponds to the young ladys idea of a count he sits with them in the garden in the evening i think he smokes  winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures they helped him to make up his mind about miss daisy evidently she was rather wild well he said i am not a courier and yet she was very charming to me  you had better have said at first said mrs costello with dignity that you had made her acquaintance  we simply met in the garden and we talked a bit  tout bonnement and pray what did you say  i said i should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt  i am much obliged to you  it was to guarantee my respectability said winterbourne  and pray who is to guarantee hers  ah you are cruel said the young man shes a very nice young girl  you dont say that as if you believed it mrs costello observed  she is completely uncultivated winterbourne went on but she is wonderfully pretty and in short she is very nice to prove that i believe it i am going to take her to the chateau de chillon  you two are going off there together i should say it proved just the contrary how long had you known her may i ask when this interesting project was formed you havent been twentyfour hours in the house  i have known her half an hour said winterbourne smiling  dear me cried mrs costello what a dreadful girl  her nephew was silent for some moments you really think then he began earnestly and with a desire for trustworthy informationyou really think that but he paused again  think what sir said his aunt  that she is the sort of young lady who expects a man sooner or later to carry her off  i havent the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do but i really think that you had better not meddle with little american girls that are uncultivated as you call them you have lived too long out of the country you will be sure to make some great mistake you are too innocent  my dear aunt i am not so innocent said winterbourne smiling and curling his mustache  you are guilty too then  winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively you wont let the poor girl know you then he asked at last  is it literally true that she is going to the chateau de chillon with you  i think that she fully intends it  then my dear frederick said mrs costello i must decline the honor of her acquaintance i am an old woman but i am not too old thank heaven to be shocked  but dont they all do these thingsthe young girls in america winterbourne inquired  mrs costello stared a moment i should like to see my granddaughters do them she declared grimly  this seemed to throw some light upon the matter for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were tremendous flirts if therefore miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies it was probable that anything might be expected of her winterbourne was impatient to see her again and he was vexed with himself that by instinct he should not appreciate her justly  though he was impatient to see her he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunts refusal to become acquainted with her but he discovered promptly enough that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe he found her that evening in the garden wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld it was ten oclock he had dined with his aunt had been sitting with her since dinner and had just taken leave of her till the morrow miss daisy miller seemed very glad to see him she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed  have you been all alone he asked  i have been walking round with mother but mother gets tired walking round she answered  has she gone to bed  no she doesnt like to go to bed said the young girl she doesnt sleepnot three hours she says she doesnt know how she lives shes dreadfully nervous i guess she sleeps more than she thinks shes gone somewhere after randolph she wants to try to get him to go to bed he doesnt like to go to bed  let us hope she will persuade him observed winterbourne  she will talk to him all she can but he doesnt like her to talk to him said miss daisy opening her fan shes going to try to get eugenio to talk to him but he isnt afraid of eugenio eugenios a splendid courier but he cant make much impression on randolph i dont believe hell go to bed before eleven it appeared that randolphs vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged for winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother i have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to his companion resumed shes your aunt then on winterbournes admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it she said she had heard all about mrs costello from the chambermaid she was very quiet and very comme il faut she wore white puffs she spoke to no one and she never dined at the table dhote every two days she had a headache i think thats a lovely description headache and all said miss daisy chattering along in her thin gay voice i want to know her ever so much i know just what your aunt would be i know i should like her she would be very exclusive i like a lady to be exclusive im dying to be exclusive myself well we are exclusive mother and i we dont speak to everyoneor they dont speak to us i suppose its about the same thing anyway i shall be ever so glad to know your aunt  winterbourne was embarrassed she would be most happy he said but i am afraid those headaches will interfere  the young girl looked at him through the dusk but i suppose she doesnt have a headache every day she said sympathetically  winterbourne was silent a moment she tells me she does he answered at last not knowing what to say  miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him her prettiness was still visible in the darkness she was opening and closing her enormous fan she doesnt want to know me she said suddenly why dont you say so you neednt be afraid im not afraid and she gave a little laugh  winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice he was touched shocked mortified by it my dear young lady he protested she knows no one its her wretched health  the young girl walked on a few steps laughing still you neednt be afraid she repeated why should she want to know me then she paused again she was close to the parapet of the garden and in front of her was the starlit lake there was a vague sheen upon its surface and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh gracious she is exclusive she said winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes he felt then for the instant quite ready to sacrifice his aunt conversationally to admit that she was a proud rude woman and to declare that they neednt mind her but before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety the young lady resuming her walk gave an exclamation in quite another tone well heres mother i guess she hasnt got randolph to go to bed the figure of a lady appeared at a distance very indistinct in the darkness and advancing with a slow and wavering movement suddenly it seemed to pause  are you sure it is your mother can you distinguish her in this thick dusk winterbourne asked  well cried miss daisy miller with a laugh i guess i know my own mother and when she has got on my shawl too she is always wearing my things  the lady in question ceasing to advance hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps  i am afraid your mother doesnt see you said winterbourne or perhaps he added thinking with miss miller the joke permissibleperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl  oh its a fearful old thing the young girl replied serenely i told her she could wear it she wont come here because she sees you  ah then said winterbourne i had better leave you  oh no come on urged miss daisy miller  im afraid your mother doesnt approve of my walking with you  miss miller gave him a serious glance it isnt for me its for youthat is its for her well i dont know who its for but mother doesnt like any of my gentlemen friends shes right down timid she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman but i do introduce themalmost always if i didnt introduce my gentlemen friends to mother the young girl added in her little soft flat monotone i shouldnt think i was natural  to introduce me said winterbourne you must know my name and he proceeded to pronounce it  oh dear i cant say all that said his companion with a laugh but by this time they had come up to mrs miller who as they drew near walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them mother said the young girl in a tone of decision upon this the elder lady turned round mr winterbourne said miss daisy miller introducing the young man very frankly and prettily common she was as mrs costello had pronounced her yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that with her commonness she had a singularly delicate grace  her mother was a small spare light person with a wandering eye a very exiguous nose and a large forehead decorated with a certain amount of thin much frizzled hair like her daughter mrs miller was dressed with extreme elegance she had enormous diamonds in her ears so far as winterbourne could observe she gave him no greetingshe certainly was not looking at him daisy was near her pulling her shawl straight what are you doing poking round here this young lady inquired but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply  i dont know said her mother turning toward the lake again  i shouldnt think youd want that shawl daisy exclaimed  well i do her mother answered with a little laugh  did you get randolph to go to bed asked the young girl  no i couldnt induce him said mrs miller very gently he wants to talk to the waiter he likes to talk to that waiter  i was telling mr winterbourne the young girl went on and to the young mans ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life  oh yes said winterbourne i have the pleasure of knowing your son  randolphs mamma was silent she turned her attention to the lake but at last she spoke well i dont see how he lives  anyhow it isnt so bad as it was at dover said daisy miller  and what occurred at dover winterbourne asked  he wouldnt go to bed at all i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor he wasnt in bed at twelve oclock i know that  it was halfpast twelve declared mrs miller with mild emphasis  does he sleep much during the day winterbourne demanded  i guess he doesnt sleep much daisy rejoined  i wish he would said her mother it seems as if he couldnt  i think hes real tiresome daisy pursued  then for some moments there was silence well daisy miller said the elder lady presently i shouldnt think youd want to talk against your own brother  well he is tiresome mother said daisy quite without the asperity of a retort  hes only nine urged mrs miller  well he wouldnt go to that castle said the young girl im going there with mr winterbourne  to this announcement very placidly made daisys mamma offered no response winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion but he said to himself that she was a simple easily managed person and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure yes he began your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide  mrs millers wandering eyes attached themselves with a sort of appealing air to daisy who however strolled a few steps farther gently humming to herself i presume you will go in the cars said her mother  yes or in the boat said winterbourne  well of course i dont know mrs miller rejoined i have never been to that castle  it is a pity you shouldnt go said winterbourne beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition and yet he was quite prepared to find that as a matter of course she meant to accompany her daughter  weve been thinking ever so much about going she pursued but it seems as if we couldnt of course daisyshe wants to go round but theres a lady herei dont know her nameshe says she shouldnt think wed want to go to see castles here she should think wed want to wait till we got to italy it seems as if there would be so many there continued mrs miller with an air of increasing confidence of course we only want to see the principal ones we visited several in england she presently added  ah yes in england there are beautiful castles said winterbourne but chillon here is very well worth seeing  well if daisy feels up to it said mrs miller in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise it seems as if there was nothing she wouldnt undertake  oh i think shell enjoy it winterbourne declared and he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a teteatete with the young lady who was still strolling along in front of them softly vocalizing you are not disposed madam he inquired to undertake it yourself  daisys mother looked at him an instant askance and then walked forward in silence theni guess she had better go alone she said simply winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake but his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by mrs millers unprotected daughter  mr winterbourne murmured daisy  mademoiselle said the young man  dont you want to take me out in a boat  at present he asked  of course said daisy  well annie miller exclaimed her mother  i beg you madam to let her go said winterbourne ardently for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl  i shouldnt think shed want to said her mother i should think shed rather go indoors  im sure mr winterbourne wants to take me daisy declared hes so awfully devoted  i will row you over to chillon in the starlight  i dont believe it said daisy  well ejaculated the elder lady again  you havent spoken to me for half an hour her daughter went on  i have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother said winterbourne  well i want you to take me out in a boat daisy repeated they had all stopped and she had turned round and was looking at winterbourne her face wore a charming smile her pretty eyes were gleaming she was swinging her great fan about no its impossible to be prettier than that thought winterbourne  there are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place he said pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake if you will do me the honor to accept my arm we will go and select one of them  daisy stood there smiling she threw back her head and gave a little light laugh i like a gentleman to be formal she declared  i assure you its a formal offer  i was bound i would make you say something daisy went on  you see its not very difficult said winterbourne but i am afraid you are chaffing me  i think not sir remarked mrs miller very gently  do then let me give you a row he said to the young girl  its quite lovely the way you say that cried daisy  it will be still more lovely to do it  yes it would be lovely said daisy but she made no movement to accompany him she only stood there laughing  i should think you had better find out what time it is interposed her mother  it is eleven oclock madam said a voice with a foreign accent out of the neighboring darkness and winterbourne turning perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies he had apparently just approached  oh eugenio said daisy i am going out in a boat  eugenio bowed at eleven oclock mademoiselle  i am going with mr winterbournethis very minute  do tell her she cant said mrs miller to the courier  i think you had better not go out in a boat mademoiselle eugenio declared  winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier but he said nothing  i suppose you dont think its proper daisy exclaimed eugenio doesnt think anythings proper  i am at your service said winterbourne  does mademoiselle propose to go alone asked eugenio of mrs miller  oh no with this gentleman answered daisys mamma  the courier looked for a moment at winterbournethe latter thought he was smilingand then solemnly with a bow as mademoiselle pleases he said  oh i hoped you would make a fuss said daisy i dont care to go now  i myself shall make a fuss if you dont go said winterbourne  thats all i wanta little fuss and the young girl began to laugh again  mr randolph has gone to bed the courier announced frigidly  oh daisy now we can go said mrs miller  daisy turned away from winterbourne looking at him smiling and fanning herself good night she said i hope you are disappointed or disgusted or something  he looked at her taking the hand she offered him i am puzzled he answered  well i hope it wont keep you awake she said very smartly and under the escort of the privileged eugenio the two ladies passed toward the house  winterbourne stood looking after them he was indeed puzzled he lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour turning over the mystery of the young girls sudden familiarities and caprices but the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly going off with her somewhere  two days afterward he went off with her to the castle of chillon he waited for her in the large hall of the hotel where the couriers the servants the foreign tourists were lounging about and staring it was not the place he should have chosen but she had appointed it she came tripping downstairs buttoning her long gloves squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume winterbourne was a man of imagination and as our ancestors used to say sensibility as he looked at her dress and on the great staircase her little rapid confiding step he felt as if there were something romantic going forward he could have believed he was going to elope with her he passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there they were all looking at her very hard she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him winterbournes preference had been that they should be conveyed to chillon in a carriage but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer she declared that she had a passion for steamboats there was always such a lovely breeze upon the water and you saw such lots of people the sail was not long but winterbournes companion found time to say a great many things to the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapadean adventurethat even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way but it must be confessed that in this particular he was disappointed daisy miller was extremely animated she was in charming spirits but she was apparently not at all excited she was not fluttered she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her people continued to look at her a great deal and winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companions distinguished air he had been a little afraid that she would talk loud laugh overmuch and even perhaps desire to move about the boat a good deal but he quite forgot his fears he sat smiling with his eyes upon her face while without moving from her place she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections it was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard he had assented to the idea that she was common but was she so after all or was he simply getting used to her commonness her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast but every now and then it took a subjective turn  what on earth are you so grave about she suddenly demanded fixing her agreeable eyes upon winterbournes  am i grave he asked i had an idea i was grinning from ear to ear  you look as if you were taking me to a funeral if thats a grin your ears are very near together  should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck  pray do and ill carry round your hat it will pay the expenses of our journey  i never was better pleased in my life murmured winterbourne  she looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh i like to make you say those things youre a queer mixture  in the castle after they had landed the subjective element decidedly prevailed daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes and turned a singularly wellshaped ear to everything that winterbourne told her about the place but he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of chillon made but a slight impression upon her they had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian and winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurriedthat they should linger and pause wherever they chose the custodian interpreted the bargain generouslywinterbourne on his side had been generousand ended by leaving them quite to themselves miss millers observations were not remarkable for logical consistency for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext she found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of chillon for asking winterbourne sudden questions about himselfhis family his previous history his tastes his habits his intentionsand for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality of her own tastes habits and intentions miss miller was prepared to give the most definite and indeed the most favorable account  well i hope you know enough she said to her companion after he had told her the history of the unhappy bonivard i never saw a man that knew so much the history of bonivard had evidently as they say gone into one ear and out of the other but daisy went on to say that she wished winterbourne would travel with them and go round with them they might know something in that case dont you want to come and teach randolph she asked winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much but that he had unfortunately other occupations other occupations i dont believe it said miss daisy what do you mean you are not in business the young man admitted that he was not in business but he had engagements which even within a day or two would force him to go back to geneva oh bother she said i dont believe it and she began to talk about something else but a few moments later when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace she broke out irrelevantly you dont mean to say you are going back to geneva  it is a melancholy fact that i shall have to return to geneva tomorrow  well mr winterbourne said daisy i think youre horrid  oh dont say such dreadful things said winterbournejust at the last  the last cried the young girl i call it the first i have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements his companion after this ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of chillon or the beauties of the lake she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see how did miss daisy miller know that there was a charmer in geneva winterbourne who denied the existence of such a person was quite unable to discover and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage she seemed to him in all this an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity does she never allow you more than three days at a time asked daisy ironically doesnt she give you a vacation in summer theres no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season i suppose if you stay another day shell come after you in the boat do wait over till friday and i will go down to the landing to see her arrive winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked if he had missed the personal accent the personal accent was now making its appearance it sounded very distinctly at last in her telling him she would stop teasing him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to rome in the winter  thats not a difficult promise to make said winterbourne my aunt has taken an apartment in rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her  i dont want you to come for your aunt said daisy i want you to come for me and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman he declared that at any rate he would certainly come after this daisy stopped teasing winterbourne took a carriage and they drove back to vevey in the dusk the young girl was very quiet  in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller  the americansof the courier asked this lady  ah happily said winterbourne the courier stayed at home  she went with you all alone  all alone  mrs costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle and that she exclaimed is the young person whom you wanted me to know      part ii   winterbourne who had returned to geneva the day after his excursion to chillon went to rome toward the end of january his aunt had been established there for several weeks and he had received a couple of letters from her those people you were so devoted to last summer at vevey have turned up here courier and all she wrote they seem to have made several acquaintances but the courier continues to be the most intime the young lady however is also very intimate with some thirdrate italians with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk bring me that pretty novel of cherbuliezspaule mereand dont come later than the 23rd  in the natural course of events winterbourne on arriving in rome would presently have ascertained mrs millers address at the american bankers and have gone to pay his compliments to miss daisy after what happened at vevey i think i may certainly call upon them he said to mrs costello  if after what happensat vevey and everywhereyou desire to keep up the acquaintance you are very welcome of course a man may know everyone men are welcome to the privilege  pray what is it that happenshere for instance winterbourne demanded  the girl goes about alone with her foreigners as to what happens further you must apply elsewhere for information she has picked up half a dozen of the regular roman fortune hunters and she takes them about to peoples houses when she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache  and where is the mother  i havent the least idea they are very dreadful people  winterbourne meditated a moment they are very ignorantvery innocent only depend upon it they are not bad  they are hopelessly vulgar said mrs costello whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians they are bad enough to dislike at any rate and for this short life that is quite enough  the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbournes impulse to go straightway to see her he had perhaps not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old roman window and asking herself urgently when mr winterbourne would arrive if however he determined to wait a little before reminding miss miller of his claims to her consideration he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends one of these friends was an american lady who had spent several winters at geneva where she had placed her children at school she was a very accomplished woman and she lived in the via gregoriana winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor the room was filled with southern sunshine he had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in announcing madame mila this announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little randolph miller who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at winterbourne an instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold and then after a considerable interval mrs miller slowly advanced  i know you said randolph  im sure you know a great many things exclaimed winterbourne taking him by the hand how is your education coming on  daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess but when she heard winterbournes voice she quickly turned her head well i declare she said  i told you i should come you know winterbourne rejoined smiling  well i didnt believe it said miss daisy  i am much obliged to you laughed the young man  you might have come to see me said daisy  i arrived only yesterday  i dont believe that the young girl declared  winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother but this lady evaded his glance and seating herself fixed her eyes upon her son weve got a bigger place than this said randolph its all gold on the walls  mrs miller turned uneasily in her chair i told you if i were to bring you you would say something she murmured  i told you randolph exclaimed i tell you sir he added jocosely giving winterbourne a thump on the knee it is bigger too  daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother i hope you have been well since we parted at vevey he said  mrs miller now certainly looked at himat his chin not very well sir she answered  shes got the dyspepsia said randolph ive got it too fathers got it ive got it most  this announcement instead of embarrassing mrs miller seemed to relieve her i suffer from the liver she said i think its this climate its less bracing than schenectady especially in the winter season i dont know whether you know we reside at schenectady i was saying to daisy that i certainly hadnt found any one like dr davis and i didnt believe i should oh at schenectady he stands first they think everything of him he has so much to do and yet there was nothing he wouldnt do for me he said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia but he was bound to cure it im sure there was nothing he wouldnt try he was just going to try something new when we came off mr miller wanted daisy to see europe for herself but i wrote to mr miller that it seems as if i couldnt get on without dr davis at schenectady he stands at the very top and theres a great deal of sickness there too it affects my sleep  winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with dr daviss patient during which daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion the young man asked mrs miller how she was pleased with rome well i must say i am disappointed she answered we had heard so much about it i suppose we had heard too much but we couldnt help that we had been led to expect something different  ah wait a little and you will become very fond of it said winterbourne  i hate it worse and worse every day cried randolph  you are like the infant hannibal said winterbourne  no i aint randolph declared at a venture  you are not much like an infant said his mother but we have seen places she resumed that i should put a long way before rome and in reply to winterbournes interrogation theres zurich she concluded i think zurich is lovely and we hadnt heard half so much about it  the best place weve seen is the city of richmond said randolph  he means the ship his mother explained we crossed in that ship randolph had a good time on the city of richmond  its the best place ive seen the child repeated only it was turned the wrong way  well weve got to turn the right way some time said mrs miller with a little laugh winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in rome and she declared that daisy was quite carried away its on account of the societythe societys splendid she goes round everywhere she has made a great number of acquaintances of course she goes round more than i do i must say they have been very sociable they have taken her right in and then she knows a great many gentlemen oh she thinks theres nothing like rome of course its a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen  by this time daisy had turned her attention again to winterbourne ive been telling mrs walker how mean you were the young girl announced  and what is the evidence you have offered asked winterbourne rather annoyed at miss millers want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to rome had stopped neither at bologna nor at florence simply because of a certain sentimental impatience he remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that american womenthe pretty ones and this gave a largeness to the axiomwere at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness  why you were awfully mean at vevey said daisy you wouldnt do anything you wouldnt stay there when i asked you  my dearest young lady cried winterbourne with eloquence have i come all the way to rome to encounter your reproaches  just hear him say that said daisy to her hostess giving a twist to a bow on this ladys dress did you ever hear anything so quaint  so quaint my dear murmured mrs walker in the tone of a partisan of winterbourne  well i dont know said daisy fingering mrs walkers ribbons mrs walker i want to tell you something  motherr interposed randolph with his rough ends to his words i tell you youve got to go eugenioll raisesomething  im not afraid of eugenio said daisy with a toss of her head look here mrs walker she went on you know im coming to your party  i am delighted to hear it  ive got a lovely dress  i am very sure of that  but i want to ask a favorpermission to bring a friend  i shall be happy to see any of your friends said mrs walker turning with a smile to mrs miller  oh they are not my friends answered daisys mamma smiling shyly in her own fashion i never spoke to them  its an intimate friend of minemr giovanelli said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face  mrs walker was silent a moment she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne i shall be glad to see mr giovanelli she then said  hes an italian daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity hes a great friend of mine hes the handsomest man in the worldexcept mr winterbourne he knows plenty of italians but he wants to know some americans he thinks ever so much of americans hes tremendously clever hes perfectly lovely  it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs walkers party and then mrs miller prepared to take her leave i guess well go back to the hotel she said  you may go back to the hotel mother but im going to take a walk said daisy  shes going to walk with mr giovanelli randolph proclaimed  i am going to the pincio said daisy smiling  alone my dearat this hour mrs walker asked the afternoon was drawing to a closeit was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians i dont think its safe my dear said mrs walker  neither do i subjoined mrs miller youll get the fever as sure as you live remember what dr davis told you  give her some medicine before she goes said randolph  the company had risen to its feet daisy still showing her pretty teeth bent over and kissed her hostess mrs walker you are too perfect she said im not going alone i am going to meet a friend  your friend wont keep you from getting the fever mrs miller observed  is it mr giovanelli asked the hostess  winterbourne was watching the young girl at this question his attention quickened she stood there smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons she glanced at winterbourne then while she glanced and smiled she answered without a shade of hesitation mr giovanellithe beautiful giovanelli  my dear young friend said mrs walker taking her hand pleadingly dont walk off to the pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful italian  well he speaks english said mrs miller  gracious me daisy exclaimed i dont to do anything improper theres an easy way to settle it she continued to glance at winterbourne the pincio is only a hundred yards distant and if mr winterbourne were as polite as he pretends he would offer to walk with me  winterbournes politeness hastened to affirm itself and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her they passed downstairs before her mother and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs millers carriage drawn up with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at vevey seated within goodbye eugenio cried daisy im going to take a walk the distance from the via gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the pincian hill is in fact rapidly traversed as the day was splendid however and the concourse of vehicles walkers and loungers numerous the young americans found their progress much delayed this fact was highly agreeable to winterbourne in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation the slowmoving idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm and he wondered what on earth had been in daisys mind when she proposed to expose herself unattended to its appreciation his own mission to her sense apparently was to consign her to the hands of mr giovanelli but winterbourne at once annoyed and gratified resolved that he would do no such thing  why havent you been to see me asked daisy you cant get out of that  i have had the honor of telling you that i have only just stepped out of the train  you must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped cried the young girl with her little laugh i suppose you were asleep you have had time to go to see mrs walker  i knew mrs walker winterbourne began to explain  i know where you knew her you knew her at geneva she told me so well you knew me at vevey thats just as good so you ought to have come she asked him no other question than this she began to prattle about her own affairs weve got splendid rooms at the hotel eugenio says theyre the best rooms in rome we are going to stay all winter if we dont die of the fever and i guess well stay then its a great deal nicer than i thought i thought it would be fearfully quiet i was sure it would be awfully poky i was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things but we only had about a week of that and now im enjoying myself i know ever so many people and they are all so charming the societys extremely select there are all kindsenglish and germans and italians i think i like the english best i like their style of conversation but there are some lovely americans i never saw anything so hospitable theres something or other every day theres not much dancing but i must say i never thought dancing was everything i was always fond of conversation i guess i shall have plenty at mrs walkers her rooms are so small when they had passed the gate of the pincian gardens miss miller began to wonder where mr giovanelli might be we had better go straight to that place in front she said where you look at the view  i certainly shall not help you to find him winterbourne declared  then i shall find him without you cried miss daisy  you certainly wont leave me cried winterbourne  she burst into her little laugh are you afraid youll get lostor run over but theres giovanelli leaning against that tree hes staring at the women in the carriages did you ever see anything so cool  winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane he had a handsome face an artfully poised hat a glass in one eye and a nosegay in his buttonhole winterbourne looked at him a moment and then said do you mean to speak to that man  do i mean to speak to him why you dont suppose i mean to communicate by signs  pray understand then said winterbourne that i intend to remain with you  daisy stopped and looked at him without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples well shes a cool one thought the young man  i dont like the way you say that said daisy its too imperious  i beg your pardon if i say it wrong the main point is to give you an idea of my meaning  the young girl looked at him more gravely but with eyes that were prettier than ever i have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me or to interfere with anything i do  i think you have made a mistake said winterbourne you should sometimes listen to a gentlemanthe right one  daisy began to laugh again i do nothing but listen to gentlemen she exclaimed tell me if mr giovanelli is the right one  the gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity he bowed to winterbourne as well as to the latters companion he had a brilliant smile an intelligent eye winterbourne thought him not a badlooking fellow but he nevertheless said to daisy no hes not the right one  daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other she strolled alone with one of them on each side of her mr giovanelli who spoke english very cleverlywinterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many american heiressesaddressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense he was extremely urbane and the young american who said nothing reflected upon that profundity of italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed giovanelli of course had counted upon something more intimate he had not bargained for a party of three but he kept his temper in a manner which suggested farstretching intentions winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure he is not a gentleman said the young american he is only a clever imitation of one he is a music master or a pennyaliner or a thirdrate artist dn his good looks mr giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face but winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywomans not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable it was true that if he was an imitation the imitation was brilliant nevertheless winterbourne said to himself a nice girl ought to know and then he came back to the question whether this was in fact a nice girl would a nice girl even allowing for her being a little american flirt make a rendezvous with a presumably lowlived foreigner the rendezvous in this case indeed had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of rome but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism singular though it may seem winterbourne was vexed that the young girl in joining her amoroso should not appear more impatient of his own company and he was vexed because of his inclination it was impossible to regard her as a perfectly wellconducted young lady she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy it would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers lawless passions that she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing but daisy on this occasion continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence  she had been walking some quarter of an hour attended by her two cavaliers and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety as it seemed to winterbourne to the pretty speeches of mr giovanelli when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs walkerthe lady whose house he had lately leftwas seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him leaving miss millers side he hastened to obey her summons mrs walker was flushed she wore an excited air it is really too dreadful she said that girl must not do this sort of thing she must not walk here with you two men fifty people have noticed her  winterbourne raised his eyebrows i think its a pity to make too much fuss about it  its a pity to let the girl ruin herself  she is very innocent said winterbourne  shes very crazy cried mrs walker did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother after you had all left me just now i could not sit still for thinking of it it seemed too pitiful not even to attempt to save her i ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet and came here as quickly as possible thank heaven i have found you  what do you propose to do with us asked winterbourne smiling  to ask her to get in to drive her about here for half an hour so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild and then to take her safely home  i dont think its a very happy thought said winterbourne but you can try  mrs walker tried the young man went in pursuit of miss miller who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion daisy on learning that mrs walker wished to speak to her retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mr giovanelli at her side she declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to mrs walker she immediately achieved the introduction and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as mrs walkers carriage rug  i am glad you admire it said this lady smiling sweetly will you get in and let me put it over you  oh no thank you said daisy i shall admire it much more as i see you driving round with it  do get in and drive with me said mrs walker  that would be charming but its so enchanting just as i am and daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her  it may be enchanting dear child but it is not the custom here urged mrs walker leaning forward in her victoria with her hands devoutly clasped  well it ought to be then said daisy if i didnt walk i should expire  you should walk with your mother dear cried the lady from geneva losing patience  with my mother dear exclaimed the young girl winterbourne saw that she scented interference my mother never walked ten steps in her life and then you know she added with a laugh i am more than five years old  you are old enough to be more reasonable you are old enough dear miss miller to be talked about  daisy looked at mrs walker smiling intensely talked about what do you mean  come into my carriage and i will tell you  daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other mr giovanelli was bowing to and fro rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene i dont think i want to know what you mean said daisy presently i dont think i should like it  winterbourne wished that mrs walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away but this lady did not enjoy being defied as she afterward told him should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl she demanded  gracious exclaimed daisy she looked again at mr giovanelli then she turned to winterbourne there was a little pink flush in her cheek she was tremendously pretty does mr winterbourne think she asked slowly smiling throwing back her head and glancing at him from head to foot that to save my reputation i ought to get into the carriage  winterbourne colored for an instant he hesitated greatly it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her reputation but he himself in fact must speak in accordance with gallantry the finest gallantry here was simply to tell her the truth and the truth for winterbourne as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader was that daisy miller should take mrs walkers advice he looked at her exquisite prettiness and then he said very gently i think you should get into the carriage  daisy gave a violent laugh i never heard anything so stiff if this is improper mrs walker she pursued then i am all improper and you must give me up goodbye i hope youll have a lovely ride and with mr giovanelli who made a triumphantly obsequious salute she turned away  mrs walker sat looking after her and there were tears in mrs walkers eyes get in here sir she said to winterbourne indicating the place beside her the young man answered that he felt bound to accompany miss miller whereupon mrs walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again she was evidently in earnest winterbourne overtook daisy and her companion and offering the young girl his hand told her that mrs walker had made an imperious claim upon his society he expected that in answer she would say something rather free something to commit herself still further to that recklessness from which mrs walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her but she only shook his hand hardly looking at him while mr giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat  winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in mrs walkers victoria that was not clever of you he said candidly while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages  in such a case his companion answered i dont wish to be clever i wish to be earnest  well your earnestness has only offended her and put her off  it has happened very well said mrs walker if she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself the sooner one knows it the better one can act accordingly  i suspect she meant no harm winterbourne rejoined  so i thought a month ago but she has been going too far  what has she been doing  everything that is not done here flirting with any man she could pick up sitting in corners with mysterious italians dancing all the evening with the same partners receiving visits at eleven oclock at night her mother goes away when visitors come  but her brother said winterbourne laughing sits up till midnight  he must be edified by what he sees im told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for miss miller  the servants be hanged said winterbourne angrily the poor girls only fault he presently added is that she is very uncultivated  she is naturally indelicate mrs walker declared  take that example this morning how long had you known her at vevey  a couple of days  fancy then her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place  winterbourne was silent for some moments then he said i suspect mrs walker that you and i have lived too long at geneva and he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage  i wished to beg you to cease your relations with miss millernot to flirt with herto give her no further opportunity to expose herselfto let her alone in short  im afraid i cant do that said winterbourne i like her extremely  all the more reason that you shouldnt help her to make a scandal  there shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her  there certainly will be in the way she takes them but i have said what i had on my conscience mrs walker pursued if you wish to rejoin the young lady i will put you down here by the way you have a chance  the carriage was traversing that part of the pincian garden that overhangs the wall of rome and overlooks the beautiful villa borghese it is bordered by a large parapet near which there are several seats one of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady toward whom mrs walker gave a toss of her head at the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop he now descended from the carriage his companion looked at him a moment in silence then while he raised his hat she drove majestically away winterbourne stood there he had turned his eyes toward daisy and her cavalier they evidently saw no one they were too deeply occupied with each other when they reached the low garden wall they stood a moment looking off at the great flattopped pine clusters of the villa borghese then giovanelli seated himself familiarly upon the broad ledge of the wall the western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars whereupon daisys companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it she came a little nearer and he held the parasol over her then still holding it he let it rest upon her shoulder so that both of their heads were hidden from winterbourne this young man lingered a moment then he began to walk but he walkednot toward the couple with the parasol toward the residence of his aunt mrs costello  he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he at least asked for mrs miller at her hotel this lady and her daughter however were not at home and on the next day after repeating his visit winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them mrs walkers party took place on the evening of the third day and in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess winterbourne was among the guests mrs walker was one of those american ladies who while residing abroad make a point in their own phrase of studying european society and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve as it were as textbooks when winterbourne arrived daisy miller was not there but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone very shyly and ruefully mrs millers hair above her exposedlooking temples was more frizzled than ever as she approached mrs walker winterbourne also drew near  you see ive come all alone said poor mrs miller im so frightened i dont know what to do its the first time ive ever been to a party alone especially in this country i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio or someone but daisy just pushed me off by myself i aint used to going round alone  and does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society demanded mrs walker impressively  well daisys all dressed said mrs miller with that accent of the dispassionate if not of the philosophic historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughters career she got dressed on purpose before dinner but shes got a friend of hers there that gentlemanthe italianthat she wanted to bring theyve got going at the piano it seems as if they couldnt leave off mr giovanelli sings splendidly but i guess theyll come before very long concluded mrs miller hopefully  im sorry she should come in that way said mrs walker  well i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours responded daisys mamma i didnt see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr giovanelli  this is most horrible said mrs walker turning away and addressing herself to winterbourne elle saffiche its her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her when she comes i shall not speak to her  daisy came after eleven oclock but she was not on such an occasion a young lady to wait to be spoken to she rustled forward in radiant loveliness smiling and chattering carrying a large bouquet and attended by mr giovanelli everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her she came straight to mrs walker im afraid you thought i never was coming so i sent mother off to tell you i wanted to make mr giovanelli practice some things before he came you know he sings beautifully and i want you to ask him to sing this is mr giovanelli you know i introduced him to you hes got the most lovely voice and he knows the most charming set of songs i made him go over them this evening on purpose we had the greatest time at the hotel of all this daisy delivered herself with the sweetest brightest audibleness looking now at her hostess and now round the room while she gave a series of little pats round her shoulders to the edges of her dress is there anyone i know she asked  i think every one knows you said mrs walker pregnantly and she gave a very cursory greeting to mr giovanelli this gentleman bore himself gallantly he smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome italian at an evening party he sang very prettily half a dozen songs though mrs walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him it was apparently not daisy who had given him his orders daisy sat at a distance from the piano and though she had publicly as it were professed a high admiration for his singing talked not inaudibly while it was going on  its a pity these rooms are so small we cant dance she said to winterbourne as if she had seen him five minutes before  i am not sorry we cant dance winterbourne answered i dont dance  of course you dont dance youre too stiff said miss daisy i hope you enjoyed your drive with mrs walker  no i didnt enjoy it i preferred walking with you  we paired off that was much better said daisy but did you ever hear anything so cool as mrs walkers wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor mr giovanelli and under the pretext that it was proper people have different ideas it would have been most unkind he had been talking about that walk for ten days  he should not have talked about it at all said winterbourne he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him  about the streets cried daisy with her pretty stare where then would he have proposed to her to walk the pincio is not the streets either and i thank goodness am not a young lady of this country the young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it so far as i can learn i dont see why i should change my habits for them  i am afraid your habits are those of a flirt said winterbourne gravely  of course they are she cried giving him her little smiling stare again im a fearful frightful flirt did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not but i suppose you will tell me now that i am not a nice girl  youre a very nice girl but i wish you would flirt with me and me only said winterbourne  ah thank youthank you very much you are the last man i should think of flirting with as i have had the pleasure of informing you you are too stiff  you say that too often said winterbourne  daisy gave a delighted laugh if i could have the sweet hope of making you angry i should say it again  dont do that when i am angry im stiffer than ever but if you wont flirt with me do cease at least to flirt with your friend at the piano they dont understand that sort of thing here  i thought they understood nothing else exclaimed daisy  not in young unmarried women  it seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones daisy declared  well said winterbourne when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place flirting is a purely american custom it doesnt exist here so when you show yourself in public with mr giovanelli and without your mother  gracious poor mother interposed daisy  though you may be flirting mr giovanelli is not he means something else  he isnt preaching at any rate said daisy with vivacity and if you want very much to know we are neither of us flirting we are too good friends for that we are very intimate friends  ah rejoined winterbourne if you are in love with each other it is another affair  she had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation but she immediately got up blushing visibly and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little american flirts were the queerest creatures in the world mr giovanelli at least she said giving her interlocutor a single glance never says such very disagreeable things to me  winterbourne was bewildered he stood staring mr giovanelli had finished singing he left the piano and came over to daisy wont you come into the other room and have some tea he asked bending before her with his ornamental smile  daisy turned to winterbourne beginning to smile again he was still more perplexed for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear though it seemed to prove indeed that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses it has never occurred to mr winterbourne to offer me any tea she said with her little tormenting manner  i have offered you advice winterbourne rejoined  i prefer weak tea cried daisy and she went off with the brilliant giovanelli she sat with him in the adjoining room in the embrasure of the window for the rest of the evening there was an interesting performance at the piano but neither of these young people gave heed to it when daisy came to take leave of mrs walker this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girls arrival she turned her back straight upon miss miller and left her to depart with what grace she might winterbourne was standing near the door he saw it all daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother but mrs miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms she appeared indeed to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them good night mrs walker she said weve had a beautiful evening you see if i let daisy come to parties without me i dont want her to go away without me daisy turned away looking with a pale grave face at the circle near the door winterbourne saw that for the first moment she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation he on his side was greatly touched  that was very cruel he said to mrs walker  she never enters my drawing room again replied his hostess  since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs walkers drawing room he went as often as possible to mrs millers hotel the ladies were rarely at home but when he found them the devoted giovanelli was always present very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone mrs miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance winterbourne noted at first with surprise that daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect she showed no displeasure at her teteatete with giovanelli being interrupted she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one there was always in her conversation the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in giovanelli it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews and he liked her the more for her innocentlooking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor he could hardly have said why but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readers part i may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him it very often seemed to winterbourne among the possibilities that given certain contingencies he should be afraidliterally afraidof these ladies he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy it was part of his conviction or rather of his apprehension that she would prove a very light young person  but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli she looked at him whenever he spoke she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that she was constantly chaffing and abusing him she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs walkers little party one sunday afternoon having gone to st peters with his aunt winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to mrs costello this lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass and then she said  thats what makes you so pensive in these days eh  i had not the least idea i was pensive said the young man  you are very much preoccupied you are thinking of something  and what is it he asked that you accuse me of thinking of  of that young ladysmiss bakers miss chandlerswhats her namemiss millers intrigue with that little barbers block  do you call it an intrigue winterbourne askedan affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity  thats their folly said mrs costello its not their merit  no rejoined winterbourne with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded i dont believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue  i have heard a dozen people speak of it they say she is quite carried away by him  they are certainly very intimate said winterbourne  mrs costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument he is very handsome one easily sees how it is she thinks him the most elegant man in the world the finest gentleman she has never seen anything like him he is better even than the courier it was the courier probably who introduced him and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady the courier will come in for a magnificent commission  i dont believe she thinks of marrying him said winterbourne and i dont believe he hopes to marry her  you may be very sure she thinks of nothing she goes on from day to day from hour to hour as they did in the golden age i can imagine nothing more vulgar and at the same time added mrs costello depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is engaged  i think that is more than giovanelli expects said winterbourne  who is giovanelli  the little italian i have asked questions about him and learned something he is apparently a perfectly respectable little man i believe he is in a small way a cavaliere avvocato but he doesnt move in what are called the first circles i think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him he is evidently immensely charmed with miss miller if she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world he on his side has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor such opulence such expensiveness as this young ladys and then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting i rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck he has nothing but his handsome face to offer and there is a substantial mr miller in that mysterious land of dollars giovanelli knows that he hasnt a title to offer if he were only a count or a marchese he must wonder at his luck at the way they have taken him up  he accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies said mrs costello  it is very true winterbourne pursued that daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofwhat shall i call itof culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins i believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception  ah but the avvocato cant believe it said mrs costello  of the observation excited by daisys intrigue winterbourne gathered that day at st peters sufficient evidence a dozen of the american colonists in rome came to talk with mrs costello who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters the vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir and meanwhile between mrs costello and her friends there was a great deal said about poor little miss millers going really too far winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard but when coming out upon the great steps of the church he saw daisy who had emerged before him get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of rome he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed he felt very sorry for hernot exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty and undefended and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder he made an attempt after this to give a hint to mrs miller he met one day in the corso a friend a tourist like himself who had just come out of the doria palace where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery his friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of innocent x by velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace and then said and in the same cabinet by the way i had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kindthat pretty american girl whom you pointed out to me last week in answer to winterbournes inquiries his friend narrated that the pretty american girlprettier than everwas seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined  who was her companion asked winterbourne  a little italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole the girl is delightfully pretty but i thought i understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde  so she is answered winterbourne and having assured himself that his informant had seen daisy and her companion but five minutes before he jumped into a cab and went to call on mrs miller she was at home but she apologized to him for receiving him in daisys absence  shes gone out somewhere with mr giovanelli said mrs miller shes always going round with mr giovanelli  i have noticed that they are very intimate winterbourne observed  oh it seems as if they couldnt live without each other said mrs miller well hes a real gentleman anyhow i keep telling daisy shes engaged  and what does daisy say  oh she says she isnt engaged but she might as well be this impartial parent resumed she goes on as if she was but ive made mr giovanelli promise to tell me if she doesnt i should want to write to mr miller about itshouldnt you  winterbourne replied that he certainly should and the state of mind of daisys mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard  after this daisy was never at home and winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances because as he perceived these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far they ceased to invite her and they intimated that they desired to express to observant europeans the great truth that though miss daisy miller was a young american lady her behavior was not representativewas regarded by her compatriots as abnormal winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all he said to himself that she was too light and childish too uncultivated and unreasoning too provincial to have reflected upon her ostracism or even to have perceived it then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant passionate perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced he asked himself whether daisys defiance came from the consciousness of innocence or from her being essentially a young person of the reckless class it must be admitted that holding ones self to a belief in daisys innocence came to seem to winterbourne more and more a matter of finespun gallantry as i have already had occasion to relate he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic national and how far they were personal from either view of them he had somehow missed her and now it was too late she was carried away by mr giovanelli  a few days after his brief interview with her mother he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the palace of the caesars the early roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume and the rugged surface of the palatine was muffled with tender verdure daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions it seemed to him that rome had never been so lovely as just then he stood looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city inhaling the softly humid odors and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion it seemed to him also that daisy had never looked so pretty but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her giovanelli was at her side and giovanelli too wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy  well said daisy i should think you would be lonesome  lonesome asked winterbourne  you are always going round by yourself cant you get anyone to walk with you  i am not so fortunate said winterbourne as your companion  giovanelli from the first had treated winterbourne with distinguished politeness he listened with a deferential air to his remarks he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that winterbourne was a superior young man he carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer he had obviously a great deal of tact he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him it even seemed to winterbourne at times that giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with himto say to him as an intelligent man that bless you he knew how extraordinary was this young lady and didnt flatter himself with delusiveor at least too delusivehopes of matrimony and dollars on this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole  i know why you say that said daisy watching giovanelli because you think i go round too much with him and she nodded at her attendant  every one thinks soif you care to know said winterbourne  of course i care to know daisy exclaimed seriously but i dont believe it they are only pretending to be shocked they dont really care a straw what i do besides i dont go round so much  i think you will find they do care they will show it disagreeably  daisy looked at him a moment how disagreeably  havent you noticed anything winterbourne asked  i have noticed you but i noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time i saw you  you will find i am not so stiff as several others said winterbourne smiling  how shall i find it  by going to see the others  what will they do to me  they will give you the cold shoulder do you know what that means  daisy was looking at him intently she began to color do you mean as mrs walker did the other night  exactly said winterbourne  she looked away at giovanelli who was decorating himself with his almond blossom then looking back at winterbourne i shouldnt think you would let people be so unkind she said  how can i help it he asked  i should think you would say something  i do say something and he paused a moment i say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged  well she does said daisy very simply  winterbourne began to laugh and does randolph believe it he asked  i guess randolph doesnt believe anything said daisy randolphs skepticism excited winterbourne to further hilarity and he observed that giovanelli was coming back to them daisy observing it too addressed herself again to her countryman since you have mentioned it she said i am engaged    winterbourne looked at her he had stopped laughing you dont believe she added  he was silent a moment and then yes i believe it he said  oh no you dont she answered well theni am not  the young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure so that winterbourne who had but lately entered presently took leave of them a week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the caelian hill and on arriving dismissed his hired vehicle the evening was charming and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the arch of constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the forum there was a waning moon in the sky and her radiance was not brilliant but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it when on his return from the villa it was eleven oclock winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the colosseum it recurred to him as a lover of the picturesque that the interior in the pale moonshine would be well worth a glance he turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches near which as he observed an open carriageone of the little roman streetcabswas stationed then he passed in among the cavernous shadows of the great structure and emerged upon the clear and silent arena the place had never seemed to him more impressive onehalf of the gigantic circus was in deep shade the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk as he stood there he began to murmur byrons famous lines out of manfred but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the colosseum are recommended by the poets they are deprecated by the doctors the historic atmosphere was there certainly but the historic atmosphere scientifically considered was no better than a villainous miasma winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena to take a more general glance intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat the great cross in the center was covered with shadow it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base one of these was a woman seated her companion was standing in front of her  presently the sound of the womans voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air well he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the christian martyrs these were the words he heard in the familiar accent of miss daisy miller  let us hope he is not very hungry responded the ingenious giovanelli he will have to take me first you will serve for dessert  winterbourne stopped with a sort of horror and it must be added with a sort of relief it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisys behavior and the riddle had become easy to read she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect he stood there looking at herlooking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely he himself must have been more brightly visible he felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding miss daisy miller then as he was going to advance again he checked himself not from the fear that he was doing her injustice but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism he turned away toward the entrance of the place but as he did so he heard daisy speak again  why it was mr winterbourne he saw me and he cuts me  what a clever little reprobate she was and how smartly she played at injured innocence but he wouldnt cut her winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross daisy had got up giovanelli lifted his hat winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness from a sanitary point of view of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria what if she were a clever little reprobate that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa how long have you been here he asked almost brutally  daisy lovely in the flattering moonlight looked at him a moment thenall the evening she answered gently    i never saw anything so pretty  i am afraid said winterbourne that you will not think roman fever very pretty this is the way people catch it i wonder he added turning to giovanelli that you a native roman should countenance such a terrible indiscretion  ah said the handsome native for myself i am not afraid  neither am ifor you i am speaking for this young lady  giovanelli lifted his wellshaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth but he took winterbournes rebuke with docility i told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion but when was the signorina ever prudent  i never was sick and i dont mean to be the signorina declared i dont look like much but im healthy i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight i shouldnt have wanted to go home without that and we have had the most beautiful time havent we mr giovanelli if there has been any danger eugenio can give me some pills he has got some splendid pills  i should advise you said winterbourne to drive home as fast as possible and take one  what you say is very wise giovanelli rejoined i will go and make sure the carriage is at hand and he went forward rapidly  daisy followed with winterbourne he kept looking at her she seemed not in the least embarrassed winterbourne said nothing daisy chattered about the beauty of the place well i have seen the colosseum by moonlight she exclaimed thats one good thing then noticing winterbournes silence she asked him why he didnt speak he made no answer he only began to laugh they passed under one of the dark archways giovanelli was in front with the carriage here daisy stopped a moment looking at the young american did you believe i was engaged the other day she asked  it doesnt matter what i believed the other day said winterbourne still laughing  well what do you believe now  i believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not  he felt the young girls pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway she was apparently going to answer but giovanelli hurried her forward quick quick he said if we get in by midnight we are quite safe  daisy took her seat in the carriage and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her dont forget eugenios pills said winterbourne as he lifted his hat  i dont care said daisy in a little strange tone whether i have roman fever or not upon this the cab driver cracked his whip and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement  winterbourne to do him justice as it were mentioned to no one that he had encountered miss miller at midnight in the colosseum with a gentleman but nevertheless a couple of days later the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little american circle and commented accordingly winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel and that after daisys return there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver but the young man was conscious at the same moment that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little american flirt should be talked about by lowminded menials these people a day or two later had serious information to give the little american flirt was alarmingly ill winterbourne when the rumor came to him immediately went to the hotel for more news he found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him and that they were being entertained in mrs millers salon by randolph  its going round at night said randolphthats what made her sick shes always going round at night i shouldnt think shed want to its so plaguy dark you cant see anything here at night except when theres a moon in america theres always a moon mrs miller was invisible she was now at least giving her daughter the advantage of her society it was evident that daisy was dangerously ill  winterbourne went often to ask for news of her and once he saw mrs miller who though deeply alarmed was rather to his surprise perfectly composed and as it appeared a most efficient and judicious nurse she talked a good deal about dr davis but winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not after all such a monstrous goose daisy spoke of you the other day she said to him half the time she doesnt know what shes saying but that time i think she did she gave me a message she told me to tell you she told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome italian i am sure i am very glad mr giovanelli hasnt been near us since she was taken ill i thought he was so much of a gentleman but i dont call that very polite a lady told me that he was afraid i was angry with him for taking daisy round at night well so i am but i suppose he knows im a lady i would scorn to scold him anyway she says shes not engaged i dont know why she wanted you to know but she said to me three times mind you tell mr winterbourne and then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in switzerland but i said i wouldnt give any such messages as that only if she is not engaged im sure im glad to know it  but as winterbourne had said it mattered very little a week after this the poor girl died it had been a terrible case of the fever daisys grave was in the little protestant cemetery in an angle of the wall of imperial rome beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers winterbourne stood there beside it with a number of other mourners a number larger than the scandal excited by the young ladys career would have led you to expect near him stood giovanelli who came nearer still before winterbourne turned away giovanelli was very pale on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole he seemed to wish to say something at last he said she was the most beautiful young lady i ever saw and the most amiable and then he added in a moment and she was the most innocent  winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words and the most innocent  the most innocent  winterbourne felt sore and angry why the devil he asked did you take her to that fatal place  mr giovanellis urbanity was apparently imperturbable he looked on the ground a moment and then he said for myself i had no fear and she wanted to go  that was no reason winterbourne declared  the subtle roman again dropped his eyes if she had lived i should have got nothing she would never have married me i am sure  she would never have married you  for a moment i hoped so but no i am sure  winterbourne listened to him he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies when he turned away again mr giovanelli with his light slow step had retired  winterbourne almost immediately left rome but the following summer he again met his aunt mrs costello at vevey mrs costello was fond of vevey in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners one day he spoke of her to his auntsaid it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice  i am sure i dont know said mrs costello how did your injustice affect her  she sent me a message before her death which i didnt understand at the time but i have understood it since she would have appreciated ones esteem  is that a modest way asked mrs costello of saying that she would have reciprocated ones affection  winterbourne offered no answer to this question but he presently said you were right in that remark that you made last summer i was booked to make a mistake i have lived too long in foreign parts  nevertheless he went back to live at geneva whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn a report that he is studying hardan intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady
