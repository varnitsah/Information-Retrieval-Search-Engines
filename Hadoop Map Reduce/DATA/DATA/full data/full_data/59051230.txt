59051230	the works  of  lord byron    a new revised and enlarged edition with illustrations     letters and journals vol i        edited by  rowland e prothero    1898        preface  two great collections of byrons letters have been already printed in moores life which appeared in 1830 561 were given these in fitzgreene hallecks american edition of byrons works published in 1847 were increased to 635 the first volume of a third collection edited by mr w e henley appeared early in 1897 a comparison of the number of letters contained in these three collections down to august 22 1811 shows that moore prints 61 halleck 78 and mr henley 88 in other words the edition of 1897 which was the most complete so far as it goes added 27 letters to that of 1830 and 10 to that of 1847 but it should be remembered that by far the greater part of the material added by halleck and mr henley was seen and rejected by moore  the present edition down to august 22 1811 prints 168 letters or an addition of 107 to moore 90 to halleck and 80 to mr henley of this additional matter considerably more than twothirds was inaccessible to moore in 1830  in preparing this volume for the press use has been also made of a mass of material bearing more or less directly on byrons life which was accumulated by the grandfather and father of mr murray the notes thus contain it is believed many details of biographical interest which are now for the first time published  it is necessary to make these comparisons in order to define the position which this edition claims to hold with regard to its predecessors on the other hand no one can regret more sincerely than myselfno one has more cause to regretthe circumstances which placed this wealth of new material in my hands rather than in those of the true poet and brilliant critic who to enthusiasm for byron and wide acquaintance with the literature and social life of the day adds the rarer gift of giving life and significance to bygone events or trivial details by unconsciously interesting his readers in his own living personality  byrons letters appeal on three special grounds to all lovers of english literature they offer the most suggestive commentary on his poetry they give the truest portrait of the man they possess at their best in their ease freshness and racy vigour a very high literary value  the present volume which covers the period from 1798 to august 1811 includes the letters written lord byron from his eleventh to his twentythird year they therefore illustrate the composition of his youthful poetry of english bards and scotch reviewers and of the first two cantos of childe harold they carry his history down to the eve of that morning in march 1812 when he awoke and found himself famousin a degree and to an extent which to the present generation seem almost incomprehensible  if the letters were selected for their literary value alone it is probable that very few of those contained in the present volume would find a place in a collection formed on this principle but biographical interest also demands consideration and in the case of byron this claim is peculiarly strong he has for years suffered much from the suppression of the material on which a just estimate of his life may be formed it is difficult not to regret the destruction of the memoirs in which he himself intended his history to be told their loss cannot be replaced but their best substitute is found in his letters through them a truer conception of byron can be formed than any impression which is derived from dallas leigh hunt medwin or even moore it therefore seems only fair to byron that they should be allowed as far as possible to interpret his career for other reasons also it appears to me too late or too soon to publish only those letters which possess a high literary value the real motive of such a selection would probably be misread and thus further misconceptions of byrons character would be encouraged  with one exception therefore the whole of the available material has been published the exception consists of some of the business letters written by byron to his solicitor enough of these have been printed to indicate the pecuniary difficulties which undoubtedly influenced his life and character but it was not considered necessary to publish the whole series men of genius ask money from their lawyers in the same language and with the same arguments as the most ordinary persons  the picture which the letters give of byron is it is believed unique in its completeness while the portrait has the additional value of being painted by his own hand byrons career lends itself only too easily to that method of treatment which dashes off a likeness by vigorous strokes with a full brush seizing with false emphasis on some salient feature and revelling in striking contrasts of light and shade but the style here adopted by the unconscious artist is rather that in which richardson the novelist painted his pathetic picture of clarissa harlowe with slow laborious touches with delicate gradations of colour sometimes with almost tedious minuteness and iteration the gradual growth of a strangely composite character is presented surrounded by the influences which controlled or moulded its development and traced through all the varieties of its rapidly changing moods written as byron wrote with habitual exaggeration and on the impulse of the moment his letters correct one another and from this point of view every letter contained in the volume adds something to the truth and completeness of the portrait  round the central figure of byron are grouped his relations and friends and two of the most interesting features in the volume are the strength of his family affections and the width if not the depth of his capacity for friendship his father died when the child was only three years old but a bundle of his letters written from valenciennes to his sister mrs leigh in 179091 still exists to attest with startling plainness of speech the strength of the tendencies which john byron transmitted to his son the following extract contains the fathers only allusion to the boy    valenciennes feb 16 1791    have you never received any letters from me by way of bologne i have   sent two for gods sake send me some as i have a great deal to pay   with regard to mrs byron i am glad she writes to you she is very   amiable at a distance but i defy you and all the apostles to live   with her two months for if any body could live with her it was me   mais jeu de mains jeu de vilains for my son i am happy to hear he   is well but for his walking tis impossible as he is clubfooted  between his mother and himself in spite of frequent and violent collisions there existed a real affection while the warmth of his love for his halfsister augusta who had much of her brothers power of winning affection lost nothing in its permanence from the rarity of their personal intercourse outside the family circle the volume introduces the only two men among his contemporaries who remained his lifelong friends in his affection for lord clare whom he very rarely saw after leaving school there was a tinge of romance and in him byron seems to have personified the best memories of an idealized harrow in hobhouse he found at once the truest and the most intimate of his friends a man whom he both liked and respected and to whose opinion and judgment he repeatedly deferred on hobhouses side the sentiment which induced him eminently sensible and practical as he was to treasure the nosegay which byron had given him long after it was withered shows how attractive must have been the personality of the donor  without the dictionary of national biography the labour of preparing the letters for the press would be trebled both in the facts which it supplies and in the sources of information which it suggests it is an invaluable aid  in conclusion i desire to express my special obligations to lord lovelace and mr richard edgcumbe who have read the greater part of the proofs and to both of whom i am indebted for several useful suggestions  r e prothero  march 1898

17651811 afterwards mrs byron and mother of the poet was descended on the paternal side from sir william gordon of gight the third son by annabella stewart daughter of james i of scotland of george second earl of huntly chancellor of scotland 14981502 and lordlieutenant of the north from 1491 to his death in 1507 the owners of gight now a ruin once a feudal stronghold were a hotheaded hastyhanded race sufficiently notable to be commemorated by thomas the rhymer and to leave their mark in the traditions of aberdeenshire in the seventh generation from sir william gordon the property passed to an heiress mary gordon by her marriage with alexander davidson of newton who assumed the name of gordon she had a son alexander mrs byrons grandfather who married margaret duff of craigston a cousin of the first earl of fife their eldest son george the fifth of the gordons of gight who bore that name married catherine innes of rosieburn and by her became the father of catherine gordon born in 1765 afterwards mrs byron both her parents dying early catherine gordon was brought up at banff by her grandmother commonly called lady gight a penurious illiterate woman who however was careful that her granddaughter was better educated than herself thus for the second time gight which with other property was worth between £23000 and £24000 passed to an heiress  miss catherine gordon had her full share of feminine vanity at the age of thirtyfive she was a stout dumpy coarselooking woman awkward in her movements provincial in her accent and manner but as her son was vain of his personal appearance and especially of his hands neck and ears so she when other charms had vanished clung to her pride in her arms and hands she exhausted the patience of stewartson the artist who in 1806 after forty sittings painted her portrait by her anxiety to have a particular turn in her elbow exhibited in the most pleasing light of her ancestry she was to use her sons expression as proud as lucifer looked down upon the byron family and regarded the duke of gordon as an inferior member of her clan in later life at any rate her temper was ungovernable her language when excited unrestrained her love of gossip insatiable capricious in her moods she flew from one extreme to the other passing for the slightest cause from passionate affection to equally passionate resentment how far these defects were produced as they certainly were aggravated by her husbands ill treatment and her hard struggle with poverty it is impossible to say she had many good qualities she bore her ruin as her letters show with good sense dignity and composure she lived on a miserable pittance without running into debt she pinched herself in order to give her son a liberal supply of money she was warmhearted and generous to those in distress she adored her scamp of a husband and in her own way was a devoted mother in politics she affected democratic opinions took in the morning chronicle and paid for it as is shown by a bill sent in after her death at the rate of £4 17s 6d for the halfyearno small deduction from her narrow income she was fond of books subscribed to the southwell book club copied passages which struck her in the course of her reading collected all the criticisms on her sons poetry made shrewd remarks upon them herself moores journal and correspondence vol v p 295 and corresponded with her friends on literary subjects  in 1785 miss catherine gordon was at bath where it may be mentioned her father had some years before committed suicide there she met and there on may 13 1785 in the parish church of st michael as the register shows she married captain john byron  captain john byron 175591 born at plymouth was the eldest son of admiral the hon john byron 172386known in the royal navy as hardy byron or foulweather jackby his marriage 1748 with sophia trevanion of carhais in cornwall the admiral next brother to william fifth lord byron was a distinguished naval officer whose narrative of his shipwreck in the wager was published in 1768 and whose voyage round the world in the dolphin was described by an officer in the said ship in 1767 his eldest son john byron educated at westminster and a french military academy entered the guards and served in america a gambler a spendthrift a profligate scamp disowned by his father he in 1778 ran away with and in 1779 married lady carmarthen wife of francis afterwards fifth duke of leeds née lady amelia darcy only child and heiress of the last earl of holderness and baroness conyers in her own right  captain byron and his wife lived in paris where were born to them a son and a daughter both of whom died in infancy and augusta born 1783 the poets halfsister who subsequently married her first cousin colonel george leigh in 1784 lady conyers died and captain byron returned to england a widower over head and ears in debt and in search of an heiress  it was a rhyme in aberdeenshire    when the heron leaves the tree   the laird of gight shall landless be  tradition has it that at the marriage of catherine gordon with mad jack byron the heronry at gight passed over to kelly or haddo the property of the earl of aberdeen the land itself will not be long in following said his lordship and so it proved for a few months mrs byron gordonfor her husband assumed the name and by this title her scottish friends always addressed herlived at gight but the ready money the outlying lands the rights of fishery the timber failed to liquidate captain byrons debts and in 1786 gight itself was sold to lord aberdeen for £17850 mrs byron gordon found herself at the end of eighteen months stripped of her property and reduced to the income derived from £4200 subject to an annuity payable to her grandmother she bore the reverse with a composure which shows her to have been a woman of no ordinary courage her letters on the subject are sensible not illexpressed and considering the circumstances in which they were written give a favourable impression of her character  the wreck of their fortunes compelled mrs byron gordon and her husband to retire to france at the beginning of 1788 she had returned to london and on january 22 1788 at 16 holles street since numbered 24 and now destroyed in the back drawingroom of the first floor gave birth to her only child george gordon afterwards sixth lord byron hanson gives the names of the nurse mrs mills the manmidwife mr combe the doctor dr denman who attended mrs byron at her confinement dallas was therefore mistaken in his supposition that the poet was born at dover the child was baptized in london on february 29 1788 as is proved by the register of the parish of marylebone  shortly after the birth of her son mrs byron settled in aberdeen where she lived for upwards of eight years during her stay there in the summer of 1791 her husband died at valenciennes in the year 1794 by the death of his cousin william john byron 177294 from a wound received at the siege of calvi in corsica her son became the heir to his greatuncle the wicked lord byron william fifth lord byron 172298 and a solicitor named hanson was appointed to protect the boys interests from aberdeen mrs byron kept up a correspondence with her sisterinlaw frances leigh née byron wife of general charles leigh to whom in a letter dated march 27 1791 she speaks of her son as very well and really a charming boy writing again to mrs leigh december 8 1794 she says    i think myself much obliged to you for being so interested for   george you may be sure i would do anything i could for my son but i   really dont see what can be done for him in that case you say you   are afraid lord b will dispose of the estates that are left if he   can if he has it in his power nobody can prevent him from selling   them if he has not no one will buy them from him you know lord   byron do you think he will do anything for george or be at any   expense to give him a proper education or if he wish to do it is   his present fortune such a one that he could spare anything out of it   you know how poor i am not that i mean to ask him to do anything for   him that is to say to be of any expense on his account  if any application was made to the boys greatuncle it was unsuccessful on may 19 1798 lord byron died and hanson informed mrs byron that her son had succeeded to the title and estates at the end of the summer of that year the little lord byron with his mother and the nurse may gray reached newstead and within a few weeks from their arrival his first letter was written his letters to his mother it may be observed are always addressed to the honourable mrs byron a title to which she had no claim   1to mrs parker 1     newstead abbey nov 8th

introduced the ward to lord carlisle and entered him at harrow it was at his house in earls court that byron for five years spent a considerable part of his successive holidays there he made acquaintance with hansons childrenhis sons charles hargreaves his contemporary at harrow and newton and his daughter mary anne who subsequently march 7 1814 married the earl of portsmouth byron giving her away this letter was written by byron a few weeks after he had gone to school at dr glennies in lordship lane dulwich he remained there from august 1799 to april 1801  in a letter to mrs byron dated september 1 1799 hanson describes dr glennies academy where he had shortly before left the boy    i left my entertaining companion with mr glennie last thursday week   and i have since learnt from him that he is very comfortable and likes   the situation his schoolfellows are very fine youths and their   deportment does very great credit to their preceptor i succeeded in   getting lord byron a separate room and i am persuaded the greatest   attention will be paid to him mr glennie is a scotchman has   travelled a great deal and seems every way qualified for his present   situation    footnote 2 captain james hanson rn was the brother of john hanson to whom the letter is written byron was born with a caul prized by sailors as a preservative from drowning the caul was sold by mrs mills the nurse who attended mrs byron in january 1788 to captain hanson in january 1800 captain hanson in command of hms brazen had captured a french vessel which he sent to portsmouth with a prize crew on the 26th of the month while shorthanded he was caught in a storm off newhaven the brazen foundered and captain hanson with all his men except one were drowned   footnote 3 in the late autumn of 1799 lord portsmouth was staying with the hansons before his marriage november 23 1799 with miss norton sister of lord grantley in rough play he pinched byrons ear the boy picked up a conch shell which was lying on the ground and hurled it at lord portsmouths head missing it by a hairs breadth and smashing the glass behind in vain mrs hanson tried to make the peace by saying that byron did not mean the missile for lord portsmouth but i did mean it he reiterated i will teach a fool of an earl to pinch another nobles ear   footnote 4 the following extract from a letter written by hanson to mrs byron september 1 1799 places the character of byrons nurse in a different light to that which is given in moores life    i assure you madam i should not have taken the liberty to have   interfered in your domestic arrangements had i not thought it   absolutely necessary to apprize you of the proceedings of your   servant mrs gray her conduct towards your son while at nottingham   was shocking and i was persuaded you needed but a hint of it to   dismiss her mrs parkyns when i saw her said something to me about   her but when i found from dispassionate persons at nottingham it was   the general topic of conversation it would have ill become me to have   remained silent    my honourable little companion tho disposed to retain his feelings   could not refrain from the harsh usage he had received at her hands   from complaining to me and such is his dread of the woman that i   really believe he would forego the satisfaction of seeing you if he   thought he was to meet her again he told me that she was perpetually   beating him and that his bones sometimes ached from it that she   brought all sorts of company of the very lowest description into his   apartments that she was out late at nights and he was frequently   left to put himself to bed that she would take the chaiseboys into   the chaise with her and stopped at every little alehouse to drink   with them but madam this is not all she has eventraduced   yourself    i entertain a very great affection for lord byron and i trust i shall   not be considered solely in my professional character but as his   friend i introduced him to my friends lord grantley and his brother   general norton who were vastly taken with him as indeed are every   one and i should be mortified in the highest degree to see the   honourable feelings of my little fellow exposed to insult by the   inordinate indiscretions of any servant he has ability and a   quickness of conception and a correct discrimination that is seldom   seen in a youth and he is a fit associate of men and choice indeed   must be the company that is selected for him      4to his mother     harrowonthehill sunday may 1st 1803    my dear motheri received your letter the other day and am happy to   hear you are well i hope you will find newstead in as favorable a   state as you can wish i wish you would write to sheldrake to tell him   to make haste with my shoes 1    i am sorry to say that mr henry drury 2 has behaved himself to me   in a manner i neithercan nor will bear he has seized now an   opportunity of showing his resentment towards me to day in church i   was talking to a boy who was sitting next me that perhaps was not   right but hear what followed after church he spoke not a word to me   but he took this boy to his pupil room where he abused me in a most   violent manner called me blackguard said he would and could   have me expelled from the school and bade me thank his charity that   prevented him this was the message he sent me to which i shall   return no answer but submit my case to you and those you may think   fit to consult is this fit usage for any body had i stole or   behaved in the most abominable way to him his language could not   have been more outrageous what must the boys think of me to hear such   a message ordered to be delivered to me by a master better let him   take away my life than ruin my character my conscience acquits me   of ever meriting expulsion at this school i have been idle and i   certainly ought not to talk in church but i have never done a mean   action at this school to him or any one if i had done anything so   heinous why should he allow me to stay at the school why should he   himself be so criminal as to overlook faults which merit the   appellation of a blackguard if he had had it in his power to have   me expelled he would long ago have done it as it is he has done   worse if i am treated in this manner i will not stay at this   school i write you that i will not as yet appeal to dr drury his   sons influence is more than mine and justice would be refused me   remember i told you when i left you at bath that he would seize   every means and opportunity of revenge not for leaving him so much as   the mortification he suffered because i begged you to let me leave   him if i had been the blackguard he talks of why did he not of his   own accord refuse to keep me as his pupil you know dr drurys   first letter in it were these words my son and lord byron have had   some disagreements but i hope that his future behaviour will render a   change of tutors unnecessary last term i was here but a short time   and though he endeavoured he could find nothing to abuse me in among   other things i forgot to tell you he said he had a great mind to expel   the boy for speaking to me and that if he ever again spoke to me he   would expel him let him explain his meaning he abused me but he   neither did nor can mention anything bad of me further than what   every boy else in the school has done i fear him not but let him   explain his meaning tis all i ask i beg you will write to dr drury   to let him know what i have said he has behaved to me as also mr   evans very kindly if you do not take notice of this i will leave   the school myself but i am sure you will not see me ill treated   better that i should suffer anything than this i believe you will be   tired by this time of reading my letter but if you love me you will   now show it pray write me immediately i shall ever remain your   affectionate son byron    pshargreaves hanson desires his love to you and hopes you are very   well i am not in want of any money so will not ask you for any god   bless bless you    footnote 1 byron appears to have suffered from what would now be described as infantile paralysis which affected the inner muscles of the right leg and foot and rendered him permanently lame before leaving london for aberdeen mrs byron consulted john hunter who in correspondence with dr livingstone of aberdeen advised her as to the treatment of her son writing may 31 1791 to mrs leigh she says georges foot turns inward and it is the right foot he walks quite on the side of his foot in 1798 the child was placed under the care of lavender see p 7 note 1 at nottingham doubtless on the recommendation of his aunt in july 1799 he was taken to london in order to consult dr baillie from july 1799 till the end of 1802 he was attended by baillie in consultation with dr laurie of 2 bartholomews close special appliances were made for the boy under their superintendence by a scientific bootmaker named sheldrake in the strand in the lancet for 18278 vol ii p 779 mr t sheldrake describes lord byrons case giving an illustration of the foot his account does not tally in some respects with that taken from contemporary letters and his sketch represents the left not the right leg but the nature and extent of byrons lameness have been the subject of a curious variety of opinion lady blessington moore gait the contessa albrizzi never knew which foot was deformed jackson the boxer thought it was the left foot trelawney says that it proceeded from a contraction of the back sinews and that the right foot was most distorted the lasts from which his shoes were made by swift the southwell bootmaker are preserved in the nottingham museum and in both the foot is perfect in shape the last pair of shoes modelled on them were made may 7 1807 mrs leigh hunt says that the left foot was shrunken but was not a clubfoot stendhal says the right foot thorwaldsen indicates the left foot dr james millingen who inspected the feet after the poets death says that there was a malformation of the left foot and leg and that he was born clubfooted two surgical boots are in the possession of mr murray made for byron as a child both are for the right foot ankle and leg and assuming that they were made to fit the foot they are too long and thin for a clubfoot both at dulwich and at harrow byron was frequently seen by laurie whom mrs byron paid as she once complained in a letter to laurie at the rate of £150 a year it is difficult to see what more could have been done for the boy and the explanation of the failure to effect a cure is probably to be found in the following extracts from two of lauries letters to mrs byron the first is dated december 7 1801    agreeable to your desire i waited on lord byron at harrow and i   think it proper to inform you that i found his foot in a much worse   state than when i last saw itthe shoe entirely wet through and the   brace round his ancle quite loose i much fear his extreme inattention   will counteract every exertion on my part to make him better i have   only to add that with proper care and bandaging his foot may still be   greatly recovered but any delay further than the present vacation   would render it folly to undertake it  the second letter is dated october 2 1802 in it laurie complains that the boy had spent several days in london without seeing him and adds    i cannot help lamenting he has so little sense of the benefit he has   already received as to be so apparently neglectful    footnote 2 for henry drury afterwards an intimate friend of byron and his father the headmaster of harrow see p 41 note 2  when byron went to harrow in april 1801 he was placed in henry drurys house but in january 1803 he refused to go back to school unless he was removed from drurys care he was in consequence placed at evanss house dr drury writing to explain the new arrangement says in a letter to hanson dated february 4 1803    the reason why lord byron wishes for this change arises from the   repeated complaints of mr henry drury respecting his inattention to   business and his propensity to make others laugh and disregard their   employments as much as himself on this subject i have had many very   serious conversations with him and though mr h d had repeatedly   requested me to withdraw him from his tuition yet relying on my own   remonstrances and arguments to rectify his error and on his own   reflection to confirm him in what is right i was unwilling to accede   to my sons wishes lord byron has now made the request himself i am   glad it has been made as he thereby imposes on himself an additional   responsibility and encourages me to hope that by this change he   intends to lay aside all that negligence and those childish practices   which were the cause of former complaints  fresh troubles soon arose as byrons letter indicates hanson forwarded the boys complaint to dr drury from whom he received the following answer dated may 15 1803    the perusal of the inclosed has allowed me to inquire into the whole   matter and to relieve your young friends mind from any uneasy   impression it might have sustained from a hasty word i fairly confess   i am sorry it was ever uttered but certainly it was never intended to   make so deep a wound as his letter intimates    i may truly say without any parade of words that i am deeply   interested in lord byrons welfare he possesses as his letter   proves a mind that feels and that can discriminate reasonably on   points in which it conceives itself injured when i look forward to   the possibility of the exercise of his talents hereafter and his   supplying the deficiencies of fortune by the exertion of his abilities   and by application i feel particularly hurt to see him idle and   negligent and apparently indifferent to the great object to be   pursued this event and the conversations which have passed between   us relative to it will probably awaken in his mind a greater degree   of emulation and make him studious of acquiring distinction among his   schoolfellows as well as of securing to himself the affectionate   regard of his instructors      5to his mother     harrowonthehill june 23rd 6th 8th 30th 1803    my dear motheri am much obliged to you for the money you sent me i   have already wrote to you several times about writing to sheldrake i   wish you would write to him or mr hanson to call on him to tell him   to make an instrument for my leg immediately as i want one rather i   have been placed in a higher form in this school to day and dr drury   and i go on very well write soon my dear mother    i remain your affectionate son

over tomorrow in the afternoon i was not wishing to   resist your commands and really seriously intended coming over   tomorrow ever since i received your last letter you know as well as   i do that it is not your company i dislike but the place you reside   in i know it is time to go to harrow it will make me unhappy but   i will obey i only desire entreat this one day and on my   honour i will be over tomorrow in the evening or afternoon i am   sorry you disapprove my companions who however are the first this   county affords and my equals in most respects but i will be   permitted to chuse for myself i shall never interfere in yours and i   desire you will not molest me in mine if you grant me this favour   and allow me this one day unmolested you will eternally oblige your    unhappy son    byron     i shall attempt to offer no excuse as you do not desire one i only   entreat you as a governor not as a mother to allow me this one day   those that i most love live in this county therefore in the name of   mercy i entreat this one day to take leave and then i will join you   again at southwell to prepare to go to a place wherei will write no   more it would only incense you adieu tomorrow i come    footnote 1 this letter is endorsed by hanson lord byron to his mother 1803 in september 1803 at the end of the summer holidays byron did not return to harrow dr drury asked the reason received no reply and on october 4 applied to hanson for an explanation hansons inquiry drew from mrs byron on october 30 the following answer with which was enclosed the above letter from byron    you may well be surprized and so may dr drury that byron is not   returned to harrow but the truth is i cannot get him to return to   school though i have done all in my power for six weeks past he has   no indisposition that i know of but love desperate love the worst   of all maladies in my opinion in short the boy is distractedly in   love with miss chaworth and he has not been with me three weeks all   the time he has been in this county but spent all his time at   annesley    if my son was of a proper age and the lady disengaged it is the   last of all connexions that i would wish to take place it has given   me much uneasiness to prevent all trouble in future i am determined   he shall not come here again till easter therefore i beg you will   find some proper situation for him at the next holydays i dont care   what i pay i wish dr drury would keep him    i shall go over to newstead tomorrow and make a last effort to get   him to town  the effort if made failed on november 7 1803 mrs byron wrote again    byron is really so unhappy that i have agreed much against my   inclination to let him remain in this county till after the next   holydays  it was not till

   although my ever dear augusta i have hitherto appeared remiss in   replying to your kind and affectionate letters yet i hope you will   not attribute my neglect to a want of affection but rather to a   shyness naturally inherent in my disposition i will now endeavour as   amply as lies in my power to repay your kindness and for the future i   hope you will consider me not only as a brother but as your warmest   and most affectionate friend and if ever circumstances should   require it your protector recollect my dearest sister that you   are the nearest relation i have in the world both by the ties of   blood and affection if there is anything in which i can serve you   you have only to mention it trust to your brother and be assured he   will never betray your confidence when you see my cousin and future   brother george leigh 2 tell him that i already consider him as my   friend for whoever is beloved by you my amiable sister will always   be equally dear to me    i arrived here today at 2 oclock after a fatiguing journey i found   my mother perfectly well she desires to be kindly remembered to you   as she is just now gone out to an assembly i have taken the first   opportunity to write to you i hope she will not return immediately   for if she was to take it into her head to peruse my epistle there is   one part of it which would produce from her a panegyric on a friend   of yours not at all agreeable to me and i fancy not particularly   delightful to you if you see lord sidney osborne 3 i beg you will   remember me to him i fancy he has almost forgot me by this time for   it is rather more than a year since i had the pleasure of seeing   himalso remember me to poor old murray 4 tell him we will see   that something is to be done for him for while i live he shall never   be abandoned in his old age write to me soon my dear augusta and   do not forget to love me in the meantime i remain more than words   can express your ever sincere affectionate

mother of seven children their home was at newmarket till in april 1818 they were granted apartments in flag court st jamess palace where she died in november 1851  augusta byron seems scarcely to have seen her brother between his infancy and 1802 lady holderness and mrs byron were not on friendly terms and it was not till the formers death that any intimacy was renewed between the brother and sister writing on october 18 1801 to augusta byron mrs byron says in allusion to the death of lady holderness    as i wish to bury what is past in oblivion i shall avoid all   reflections on a person now no more my opinion of yourself i have   suspended for some years the time is now arrived when i shall form a   very decided one i take up my pen now however to condole with you   on the melancholy event that has happened to offer you every   consolation in my power to assure you of the inalterable regard and   friendship of myself and son we will be extremely happy if ever we   can be of any service to you now or at any future period i take it   upon me to answer for him although he knows so little of you he   often mentions you to me in the most affectionate manner indeed the   goodness of his heart and amiable disposition is such that your being   his sister had he never seen you would be a sufficient claim upon   him and ensure you every attention in his power to bestow    ah augusta need i assure you that you will ever be dear to me as the   daughter of the man i tenderly loved as the sister of my beloved my   darling boy and i take god to witness you once was dear to me on   your own account and may be so again i still recollect with a   degree of horror the many sleepless nights and days of agony i   have passed by your bedside drowned in tears while you lay insensible   and at the gates of death your recovery certainly was wonderful and   thank god i did my duty these days you cannot remember but i never   will forget them  your brother is at harrow school and if you   wish to see him i have now no desire to keep you asunder  from 1802 till byrons death augusta took in him the interest of an elder sister writing to hanson june 17 1804 she says    pray write me a line and mention all you hear of my dear brother he   was a most delightful correspondent while he remained in   nottinghamshire but i cant obtain a single line from harrow i was   much struck with his general improvement it was beyond the   expectations raised by what you had told me and his letters gave me   the most excellent opinion of both his head and heart  in this tone the letters are continued see extracts p 39 p 45 note 1 and p 97 letter 48 footnote 1 further down  from the end of 1805 with some interruptions and less regularity the correspondence between brother and sister was maintained to the end of byrons life to augusta then mrs leigh byron sent a presentation copy of childe harold with the inscription    to augusta my dearest sister and my best friend

1815 in january 1816 when lady byron was still with her husband she writes of and to mrs leigh    in this at least i am truth itself when i say that whatever   the situation may be there is no one whose society is dearer to me   or can contribute more to my happiness  lady byron left byron on january 15 1816 writing to mrs leigh from kirby mallory she speaks of her as her best comforter notices

with extracts mostly on religious topics she was wrote the late earl stanhope in a letter quoted in the quarterly review october 1869 p 421 very fond of talking about byron    she was he continues extremely unprepossessing in her person and   appearancemore like a nun than anything and never can have had the   least pretension to beauty i thought her shy and sensitive to a fault   in her mind and character  frances lady shelley who died in january 1873 and was intimately acquainted with byron and his contemporaries speaks of her as a dowdygoody    i have seen she writes  see quarterly review october 1869 p 421 quoting from a letter signed e m u which appeared in the times for september ii 1869    a great deal of mrs leigh augusta having passed some days with   her and colonel leigh for my husbands shooting near newmarket when   lord byron was in the house and as she told me was writing the   corsair to my great astonishment for it was a wretched small house   full of her

for many years in the employment of william fifth lord byron at his masters death in 1798 he was taken into the service of the duke of leeds    i saw poor joseph murray the other night writes augusta byron to   hanson june 17 1804 who wishes me particularly to apply to col   leigh to get him into some city charity which the prince of wales is   at the head of    i cannot understand what he means nor can any body else and   therefore as he said he was advised by you i think it better to   apply to you on the subject im sure col leigh would be happy to   oblige him but in general he dislikes asking favours of the   prince and this present moment is a bad one to chuse for the   purpose as hrh is so much taken up with public affairs i am   very anxious about poor joseph and would almost do anything to serve   him i fear he is too old and infirm to go to service again  three years later march 19 1807 augusta byron writes again to hanson    i have just had a pitiful note from poor old murray telling me of   his dismissal from the duchess of leeds but he says he does not leave   her till june i therefore hope something may in the mean time be done   for him he requests me to write word of it to my brother i shall   certainly comply with his wishes and send two lines on that subject   to southwell where i conclude he is  byron made murray an allowance of £20 a year see letter 83 took him as soon as he could into his service and was careful as he promises to provide that he should not be abandoned in his old age his affection for murray is marked by the postscript to the

  southwell march 26th 1804     i received your affectionate letter my ever dear sister yesterday   and i now hasten to comply with your injunction by answering it as   soon as possible not my dear girl that it can be in the least   irksome to me to write to you on the contrary it will always prove my   greatest pleasure but i am sorry that i am afraid my correspondence   will not prove the most entertaining for i have nothing that i can   relate to you except my affection for you which i can never   sufficiently express therefore i should tire you before i had half   satisfied myself ah how unhappy i have hitherto been in being so   long separated from so amiable a sister but fortune has now   sufficiently atoned by discovering to me a relation whom i love a   friend in whom i can confide in both these lights my dear augusta i   shall ever look upon you and i hope you will never find your brother   unworthy of your affection and friendship    i am as you may imagine a little dull here not being on terms of   intimacy with lord grey 1 i avoid newstead and my resources of   amusement are books and writing to my augusta which wherever i am   will always constitute my greatest pleasure i am not reconciled to   lord grey and i never will he was once my greatest friend my   reasons for ceasing that friendship are such as i cannot explain not   even to you my dear sister although were they to be made known to   any body you would be the first but they will ever remain hidden in   my own breast    they are good ones however for although i am violent i am not

remembrance   no my affection for you will never permit me to forget you    i am afraid my dear girl that you will be absent when i am in town   i cannot exactly say when i return to harrow but however it will be   in a very short time i hope you were entertained by sir wm fawcets   funeral on saturday 1 though i should imagine such spectacles rather   calculated to excite gloomy ideas but i believe your motive was not   quite of so mournful a cast    you tell me that you are tired of london i am rather surprised to   hear that for i thought the gaieties of the metropolis were   particularly pleasing to young ladies for my part i detest it the   smoke and the noise feel particularly unpleasant but however it is   preferable to this horrid place where i am oppressed with ennui   and have no amusement of any kind except the conversation of my   mother which is sometimes very edifying but not always very   agreeable there are very few books of any kind that are either   instructive or amusing no society but old parsons and old maidsi   shoot a good deal but thank god i have not so far lost my reason as   to make shooting my only amusement there are indeed some of my   neighbours whose only pleasures consist in field sports but in other   respects they are only one degree removed from the brute creation    these however i endeavour not to imitate but i sincerely wish for the   company of a few friends about my own age to soften the austerity of   the scene i am an absolute hermit in a short time my gravity which   is increased by my solitude will qualify me for an archbishoprick i   really begin to think that i should become a mitre amazingly well you   tell me to write to you when i have nothing better to do i am sure   writing to you my dear sister must ever form my greatest pleasure   but especially so at this time your letters and those of one of my   harrow friends form my only resources for driving away dull care   for godsake write me a letter as long as may fill twenty sheets of   paper recollect it is my only pleasure if you wont give me twenty   sheets at least send me as long an epistle as you can and as soon as   possible there will be time for me to receive one more letter at   southwell and as soon as i get to harrow i will write to you excuse   my not writing more my dear augusta for i am sure you will be   sufficiently tired of reading this complaining narrative god bless   you my beloved sister adieu    i remain your sincere and affectionate    friend and brother    byron    remember me kindly to mrs harcourt

letter and so ready compliance with the request of a peevish and   fretful brother it acted as a cordial on my drooping spirits and for   a while dispelled the gloom which envelopes me in this uncomfortable   place you see what power your letters have over me so i hope you   will be liberal in your epistolary consolation    you will address your next letter to harrow as i set out from   southwell on wednesday and am sorry that i cannot contrive to be with   you as i must resume my studies at harrow directly if i speak in   public at all it will not be till the latter end of june or the   beginning of july you are right in your conjecture for i feel not a   little nervous in the anticipation of my debut 1 as an orator   by the bye i do not dislike harrow i find ways and means to   amuse myself very pleasantly there the friend whose correspondence   i find so amusing is an old sporting companion of mine whose   recitals of shooting and hunting expeditions are amusing to me as   having often been his companion in them and i hope to be so still   oftener    my mother gives a party to night at which the principal southwell   belles will be present with one of which although i dont as yet   know whom i shall so far honour having never seen them i intend to   fall violently in love it will serve as an amusement pour passer   le temps and it will at least have the charm of novelty to recommend   it then you know in the course of a few weeks i shall be quite au   désespoir shoot myself and go out of the world with éclat and my   history will furnish materials for a pretty little romance which shall   be entitled and denominated the loves of lord b and the cruel and   inconstant sigismunda cunegunda bridgetina etc etc princess of   terra incognita    dont you think that i have a very good knack for novel writing i   have just this minute been called away from writing to you by two   gentlemen who have given me an invitation to go over to screveton a   village a few miles off and spend a few days but however i shall not   accept it so you will continue to address your letters to harrow as   usual write to me as soon as possible and give me a long letter   remember me to mrs harcourt and all who enquire after me continue to   love me and believe me    your truly affectionate brother and friend    byron    psmy mothers love to you adieu

writes see life p 20 composed declamations which after a revisal by the tutors were submitted to the master to him the authors repeated them that they might be improved in manner and action before their public delivery i certainly was much pleased with lord byrons attitude gesture and delivery as well as with his composition all who spoke on that day adhered as usual to the letter of their composition as in the earlier part of his delivery did lord byron but to my surprise he suddenly diverged from the written composition with a boldness and rapidity sufficient to alarm me lest he should fail in memory as to the conclusion there was no failure he came round to the close of his composition without discovering any impediment and irregularity on the whole i questioned him why he had altered his declamation he declared he had made no alteration and did not know in speaking that he had deviated from it one letter i believed him and from a knowledge of his temperament am convinced that fully impressed with the sense and substance of the subject he was hurried on to expressions and colourings more striking than what his pen had expressed    my qualities says byron in one of his notebooks quoted by moore   life p 20 were much more oratorical and martial than poetical   and dr drury my grand patron our headmaster had a great notion   that i should turn out an orator from my fluency my turbulence my   voice my copiousness of declamation and my action i remember that   my first declamation astonished him into some unwonted for he was   economical of such and sudden compliments before the declaimers at   our first rehearsal  for his subjects byron chose passages expressive of vehement passion such as lears address to the storm or the speech of zanga over the body of alonzo from youngs tragedy the revenge zangas character and speech are famous in history from their application to benjamin franklin in wedderburns speech before the privy council january 1774 on

mothers   absence this afternoon again to inform you or rather to desire to be   informed by you of what is going on for my own part i can send   nothing to amuse you excepting a repetition of my complaints against   my tormentor whose diabolical disposition pardon me for staining   my paper with so harsh a word seems to increase with age and to   acquire new force with time the more i see of her the more my dislike   augments nor can i so entirely conquer the appearance of it as to   prevent her from perceiving my opinion this so far from calming the   gale blows it into a hurricane which threatens to destroy   everything till exhausted by its own violence it is lulled into a   sullen torpor which after a short period is again roused into fresh   and revived phrenzy to me most terrible and to every other spectator   astonishing she then declares that she plainly sees i hate her that   i am leagued with her bitter enemies viz yourself ld carlisle   and mr hanson and as i never dissemble or contradict her we are   all honoured with a multiplicity of epithets too numerous and   some of them too gross to be repeated in this society and in this   amusing and instructive manner have i dragged out a weary fortnight   and am condemned to pass another or three weeks as happily as the   former no captive negro or prisoner of war ever looked forward to   their emancipation and return to liberty with more joy and with more   lingering expectation than i do to my escape from this maternal   bondage and this accursed place which is the region of dullness   itself and more stupid than the banks of lethe though it possesses   contrary qualities to the river of oblivion as the detested scenes i   now witness make me regret the happier ones already passed and wish   their restoration    such augusta is the happy life i now lead such my amusements i   wander about hating everything i behold and if i remained here a few   months longer i should become what with envy spleen and all   uncharitableness a complete misanthrope but notwithstanding this    believe me dearest augusta ever yours etc etc    byron      12to elizabeth bridget pigot 1    burgage manor august

wish to carry them with me   your note was given me by harry 2 at the play whither i attended   miss leacroft 3 and dr s and now i have sat down to answer it   before i go to bed if i am at southwell

happy to receive it adieu    ps2das you say you are a novice in the art of knitting i hope it   dont give you too much trouble go on slowly but surely once   more adieu    footnote 1 elizabeth bridget pigot lived with her mother and two brothers on southwell green in a house opposite burgage manor miss pigot thus describes her first meeting with byron life p 32    the first time i was introduced to him was at a party at his   mothers when he was so shy that she was forced to send for him three   times before she could persuade him to come into the drawingroom to   play with the young people at a round game he was then a fat bashful   boy with his hair combed straight over his forehead and extremely   like a miniature picture that his mother had painted by m de   chambruland the next morning mrs byron brought him to call at our   house when he still continued shy and formal in his manner the   conversation turned upon cheltenham where we had been staying the   amusements there the plays etc and i mentioned that i had seen the   character of gabriel lackbrain very well performed his mother getting   up to go he accompanied her making a formal bow and i in allusion   to the play said goodby gaby his countenance lighted up his   handsome mouth displayed a broad grin all his shyness vanished never   to return and upon his mothers saying come byron are you   readyno she might go by herself he would stay and talk a little   longer and from that moment he used to come in and go out at all   hours as it pleased him and in our house considered himself   perfectly at home  the character of gabriel lackbrain mentioned above occurs in life a comedy by f reynolds it was at byrons suggestion that moore when preparing the life applied to miss pigot for letters on january 22 1828 he was taken to call on her and her mother by the rev john becher    their reception of me most cordial and flattering made me sit in the   chair which byron used to sit in and remarked as a singularity that   this was the poor fellows birthday he would today have been forty   on parting with mrs pigot a fine intelligent old lady who has been   bedridden for years she kissed my hand most affectionately and said   that much as she had always admired me as a poet it was as the   friend of byron she valued and loved me  her affection indeed to   his memory is unbounded and she seems unwilling to allow that he had   a single fault  miss pigot in the evening with his letters which   interested me exceedingly some written when he was quite a boy and   the bad spelling and scrambling

illustrates the enthusiastic interest with which the pigots followed byrons career    indeed my dear mrs byron you have given me a very great treat in   sending me english bards to look at you know how very highly i   thought of the first edition and this is certainly much improved   indeed i do not think anybody but lord byron could in these our   days have produced such a work for it has all the fire of ancient   genius i have always been accustomed to tell you my thoughts most   sincerely and i cannot say that i like that addition to the part   where bowles is mentioned it wants that brilliant spirit which   almost invariably accompanies lord bs writings maurice too and   his granite weight of leaves is in truth a heavy comparison but i   turn with pleasure from these specks in the sun to notice vice and   folly greville and argyle it is most admirable the same pen   may equal but i think it is not in the power of human abilities to   exceed it as to lord carlisle i think he well deserves the note   lord b has put in i am very much pleased with it and the little   word amen at the end gives a point indescribably good the whole   of the conclusion is excellent and the postscript i think must   entertain everybody except jeffrey i hope the poor bear is well i   wish you could make him understand that he is immortalized for if   fourlegd bears have any vanity it would certainly delight him   walter scott too i really do not mean to call him a bear will be   highly gratified the compliment to him is very elegant in short i   look upon it as a most highly finished work and lord byron has   certainly taken the palm from all our poets a good account of   yourself i assure you will always give the most sincere pleasure to my   dear mrs byrons very

a boy at harrow he was famous for the vigour with which he sang this bottles the sun of our table at mother barnards he liked the welsh air mary anne sung by miss chaworth the songs in the duenna when time who steals our years away which he sang with miss pigot or robin adair in which he was accompanied by miss hanson on her harp    it is very odd he said to miss pigot i sing much better to your   playing than to any one elses    that is she answered because i play to your singing  moore journal and correspondence vol v pp 295 296 speaking of byrons chanting method of repeating poetry says that it is the men who have the worst ears for music that sing out poetry in this manner having no nice perception of the difference there ought to be between animated reading and chant rogers tabletalk etc pp 224 225 expresses the same opinion when he says i can discover from a poets versification whether or not he has an ear for music to instance poets of the present dayfrom bowless and moores i should know that they had fine ears for music from southeys wordsworths and byrons that they had no ears for it      13to the hon augusta byron     castle howard malton yorkshire    harrowonthehill

gives a good account of me but   from the quarter you mention i should imagine it was exaggerated   that you are unhappy my dear sister makes me so also were it in my   power to relieve your sorrows you would soon recover your spirits as   it is i sympathize better than you yourself expect but really after   all pardon me my dear sister i feel a little inclined to laugh at   you for love in my humble opinion is utter nonsense a mere jargon   of compliments romance and deceit now for my part had i fifty   mistresses i should in the course of a fortnight forget them all   and if by any chance i ever recollected one should laugh at it as a   dream and bless my stars for delivering me from the hands of the   little mischievous blind god cant you drive this cousin 1 of ours   out of your

james fox a lively letterwriter his correspondence with his friend george selwyn while in italy shows him to have been a young man of wit feeling and taste it is curious to notice that at rome he singles out like his cousin in childe harold or manfred as the most striking objects the general aspect of the marbled wilderness the moonlight view of the amphitheatre the laocoon the belvedere apollo and the group of niobe and her daughters one other taste he shared with byronhe was a lover of dogs and rover was his constant companion abroad  lord carlisle returned to england in 1769 like fox he was a prodigious dandy they once travelled from paris to lyons for the express purpose of buying waistcoats and during the whole journey they talked of nothing else tabletalk of samuel rogers pp 73 74 already well known in london society carlisle was a close friend of george selwyn a familiar figure at whites and brookess an inveterate gambler an adorer of lady sarah bunbury who as lady sarah lennox had won the heart of george iii the flirtation provoked from lord holland an adaptation of lydia dic per omnes    sally sally dont deny   but for gods sake tell me why   you have flirted so to spoil   that once lively youth carlisle   he used to mount while it was dark   now he lies in bed till noon   and you not meeting in the park   thinks that he gets up too soon etc  in 1770 lord carlisle married lady margaret leveson gower a beautiful and charming woman everybody writes lord holland to george selwyn may 2 1770 says it is impossible not to admire lady carlisle but matrimony did not at once steady his character for the next few yearsthough in 1773 he published a volume of poemshis pursuits were mainly those of a young man of fashion and he impoverished himself at the gamingtable from 1777 onwards however his life took a more serious turn in that year he became treasurer of the household and was sworn a member of the privy council in 1778 he was the chief of the three commissioners sent out by lord north to negotiate with the united states there he declined a challenge from lafayette provoked by reflections on the french court and nation which he had issued with his fellowcommissioners in their political capacity in 1779 he was nominated lordlieutenant of yorkshire and first lord of trade and plantations he was lordlieutenant of ireland from 1780 to 1782 and held the post of lord privy seal in the duke of portlands administration of 1783 till the outbreak of the french revolutionary wars he was an opponent of pitt but after 1792 he consistently supported the government  carlisle was a collector of pictures statuary and works of art he was also a writer of verse tragedies and pamphlets but in literature his admirable letters are his best claim to be remembered one of his two tragedies the fathers revenge 1783 was praised by walpole and received the guarded approval of dr johnson his published poetry consisted of an ode on the death of gray verses on that of lord nelson lines for the monument of a favourite spaniel an address to sir joshua reynolds and translations from dante the first two poems provoked richard tickell to write the wreath of fashion 1780 the following lines says tickell in his advertisement were occasioned by the authors having lately studied with infinite attention several fashionable productions in the sentimental stile for example a noble author has lately published his works which consist of three compositions one an ode upon the death of mr gray the two others upon the death of his lordships spaniel    here placid carlisle breathes his gentle line   or haply genrous hare reechoes thine   soft flows the lay as when with tears he paid   the last sad honours to hisspaniels shade   and lo he grasps the badge of wit a wand   he waves it thrice and storer is at hand  his contemporaries seem to have thought that his poetry weak though it was was indebted to his eton friends the hare with many friends and antony storer the latters name is linked with that of carlisle in another satire pandolfo attonito    falln though i am i neer shall mourn   like the dark peer on storers urn  where a note refers to antony storer formerly member for morpeth as some persons near carlisle and castle howard may possibly recollect a gentleman well known in the circles of fashion and polite literature carlisles name occurs in many of the satires of the day on literary subjects the shade of pope ii 191 192 says    carlisle is lost with gillies in surprize   as lysias charms soft jerseys classic eyes  and in the pursuits of literature dialogue ii line 234 a note to the line    while lyric carlisle purrs oer love transformed  again associates his name with that of lady jersey  in 1799 lord carlisle was persuaded by hanson to become byrons guardian in order to facilitate legal proceedings for the recovery of the rochdale property illegally sold by william fifth lord byron he was introduced to his ward by hanson who took the boy to grosvenor place to see his guardian and consult dr baillie in july 1799 he seemed anxious to befriend the boy but byron was eager as hanson notes to leave the house when mrs byron in 1800 was anxious to remove her son from dr glennies care carlisle exercised his authority and forbade the schoolmaster to give him up to his mother he probably on this occasion experienced mrs byrons temper for augusta byron writing to hanson november 18 1804 says that he dreaded having any concern whatever with mrs byron byron does not seem to have met his guardian again till january 1805 when augusta byron writes to hanson    i hear from lady gertrude howard that lord carlisle was very much   pleased with my brother and i am sure from what he said to me at   castle howard is disposed to show him all the kindness and attention   in his power i know you are so partial to byron and so much   interested in all that concerns him that you will rejoice almost as   much as i do that his acquaintance with lord c is renewed in the   mean time it is a great comfort for me to think that he has spent his   holydays so comfortably and so much to his wishes you will easily   believe that he is a very great favourite of mine and i may add the   more i see and hear of him the more i must love and esteem him  it may be doubted whether carlisle ever saw the dedication of hours of idleness augusta byron in a letter to hanson of february 7 1807 says    i return you my brothers poems with many thanks mrs b has had the   attention to send me 2 copies i like some of them very much but you   will laugh when i tell you i have never had courage to shew them to   lord carlisle for fear of his disapproving others  the years 18067 spent at southwell as his sister says in idleness and ill humour with the whole world were not the most creditable of byrons life and carlisles efforts to make him return to cambridge failed it is moreover certain that in 1809 carlisle was ill it is also probable that at a time when the scandal of mary anne clarke and the duke of york threatened to come before the house of lords he was unwilling to connect himself in public with a cousin of whom he knew no good and of whose political views he was ignorant these causes may have combined to produce the coldly formal letter in which he told byron the course of procedure to be adopted in taking his seat in the house of lords and ignored the young mans wish that his cousin and guardian should introduce him for byrons attack upon carlisle and his subsequent admission of having done him some wrong see english bards and scotch reviewers lines 723740 and childe harold canto iii stanzas xxix xxx  it is possible that the paralytic puling may have been suggested by the placid purring of previous satirists in march 1814 his sister augusta was trying hard to persuade byron as he notes in his diary    to make it up with carlisle i have refused every body else but i   cant deny her anything though i had as leif drink up eiseleat a   crocodile  lord carlisle had three daughters the eldest lady caroline isabella howard married in 1789 john first lord cawdor and died in 1848 the second lady elizabeth married in 1799 john henry fifth duke of rutland and died in 1825 the third lady gertrude married in 1806 william sloane stanley of paultons hants and died in 1870

your affectionate letter   and it reached me at a time when i wanted consolation not however of   your kind for i am not yet old enough or goose enough to be in love   no my sorrows are of a different nature though more calculated to   provoke risibility than excite compassion you must know sister of   mine that i am the most unlucky wight in harrow perhaps in   christendom and am no sooner out of one scrape than into another and   to day this very morning i had a thundering jobation from our good   doctor 1 which deranged my nervous system for at least five   minutes but notwithstanding he and i now and then disagree yet upon   the whole we are very good friends for there is so much of the   gentleman so much mildness and nothing of pedantry in his character   that i cannot help liking him and will remember his instructions with   gratitude as long as i live he leaves harrow soon apropos so do   i this quitting will be a considerable loss to the school he is the   best master we ever had and at the same time respected and feared   greatly will he be regretted by all who know him you tell me you   dont know my friend ld delawarr he is considerably younger than me   but the most good tempered amiable clever fellow in the universe to   all which he adds the quality a good one in the eyes of women of   being remarkably handsome almost too much so for a boy he is at   present very low in the school not owing to his want of ability but   to his years i am nearly at the top of it by the rules of our   seminary he is under my power but he is too goodnatured ever to   offend me and i like him too well ever to exert my authority over   him if ever you should meet and chance to know him take notice of   him on my account    you say that you shall write to the dowager soon her address is at   southwell that i need hardly inform you now augusta i am going   to tell you a secret perhaps i shall appear undutiful to you but   believe me my affection for you is founded on a more firm basis my   mother has lately behaved to me in such an eccentric manner that so   far from feeling the affection of a son it is with difficulty i can   restrain my dislike not that i can complain of want of liberality   no she always supplies me with as much money as i can spend and more   than most boys hope for or desire but with all this she is so hasty   so impatient that i dread the approach of the holidays more than   most boys do their return from them in former days she spoilt me now   she is altered to the contrary for the most trifling thing she   upbraids me in a most outrageous manner and all our disputes have   been lately heightened by my one with that object of my cordial   deliberate detestation lord grey de ruthyn she wishes me to explain   my reasons for disliking him which i will never do would i do it to   any one be assured you my dear augusta would be the first who would   know them she also insists on my being reconciled to him and once   she let drop such an odd expression that i was half inclined to   believe the dowager was in love with him but i hope not for he is   the most disagreeable person in my opinion that exists he called   once during my last vacation she threatened stormed begged me to   make it up he himself loved me and wished it but my reason was so   excellentthat neither had effect nor would i speak or stay in the   same room till he took his departure no doubt this appears odd but   was my reason known which it never will be if i can help it i should   be justified in my conduct now if i am to be tormented with her and   him in this style i cannot submit to it you augusta are the only   relation i have who treats me as a friend if you too desert me i   have nobody i can love but delawarr if it was not for his sake   harrow would be a desert and i should dislike staying at it you   desire me to burn your epistles indeed i cannot do that but i will   take care that they shall be invisible if you burn any of mine i   shall be monstrous angry take care of them till we meet    delawarr 2 and myself are in a manner connected for one of our   forefathers in charles the 1sts time married into their family   hartington 3 whom you enquire after is on very good terms with me   nothing more he is of a soft milky disposition and of a happy apathy   of temper which defies the softer emotions and is insensible

  would coincide with mine her temper is so variable and when   inflamed so furious that i dread our meeting not but i dare say   that i am troublesome enough but i always endeavour to be as dutiful   as possible she is so very strenuous and so tormenting in her   entreaties and commands with regard to my reconciliation with that   detestable lord g 2 that i suppose she has a penchant for his   lordship but i am confident that he does not return it for he rather   dislikes her than otherwise at least as far as i can judge but she   has an excellent opinion of her personal attractions sinks her age a   good six years avers that when i was born she was only eighteen when   you my dear sister know as well as i know that she was of age when   she married my father and that i was not born for three years   afterwards but vanity is the weakness of your sexand these are   mere foibles that i have related to you and provided she never   molested me i should look upon them as follies very excusable in a   woman    but i am now coming to what must shock you as much as it does me   when she has occasion to lecture me not very seldom you will think no   doubt she does not do it in a manner that commands respect and in an   impressive style no did she do that i should amend my faults with   pleasure and dread to offend a kind though just mother but she flies   into a fit of phrenzy upbraids me as if i was the most undutiful   wretch in existence rakes up the ashes of my father abuses him   says i shall be a true byrrone which is the worst epithet she can   invent am i to call this woman mother because by natures law she   has authority over me am i to be trampled upon in this manner am i   to be goaded with insult loaded with obloquy and suffer my feelings   to be outraged on the most trivial occasions i owe her respect as a   son but i renounce her as a friend what an example does she shew me   i hope in god i shall never follow it i have not told you all nor   can i i respect you as a female nor although i ought to confide in   you as a sister will i shock you with the repetition of scenes which   you may judge of by the sample i have given you and which to all but   you are buried in oblivion would they were so in my mind i am afraid   they never will and can i my dear sister look up to this mother   with that respect that affection i ought am i to be eternally   subjected to her caprice i hope not indeed a few short years will   emancipate me from the shackles i now wear and then perhaps she will   govern her passion better than at present    you mistake me if you think i dislike lord carlisle i respect him   and might like him did i know him better for him too my mother has an   antipathy why i know not i am afraid he could be but of little use   to me in separating me from her which she would oppose with all her   might but i dare say he would assist me if he could so i take the   will for the deed and am obliged to him in exactly the same manner as   if he succeeded in his efforts    i am in great hopes that at christmas i shall be with mr hanson   during the vacation i shall do all i can to avoid a visit to my   mother wherever she is it is the first duty of a parent to impress   precepts of obedience in their children but her method is so violent   so capricious that the patience of job the versatility of a member   of the house of commons could not support it i revere dr drury much   more than i do her yet he is never violent never outrageous i dread   offending him not however through fear but the respect i bear him   makes me unhappy when i am under his displeasure my mothers   precepts never convey instruction never fix upon my mind to be sure   they are calculated to inculcate obedience so are chains and   tortures but though they may restrain for a time the mind revolts   from such treatment not that mrs byron ever injures my sacred   person i am rather too old for that but her words are of that rough   texture which offend more than personal ill usage a talkative woman   is like an adders tongue so says one of the prophets but which i   cant tell and very likely you dont wish to know but he was a true   one whoever he was    the postage of your letters my dear augusta dont fall upon me but   if they did it would make no difference for i am generally in cash   and should think the trifle i paid for your epistles the best laid out   i ever spent in my life write soon remember me to lord carlisle   and believe me i ever am    your affectionate brother and friend    byrone    footnote 1 in consequence of this letter augusta byron wrote as follows to hanson and byron spent the christmas holidays of 1804 with his solicitor    castle howard nov 18 1804    my dear siri am afraid you will think i presume almost too much   upon the kind permission you have so often given me of applying to you   about my brothers concerns the reason that induces me now to do so   is his having lately written me several letters containing the most   extraordinary accounts of his mothers conduct towards him and   complaints of the uncomfortable situation he is in during the holidays   when with her all this you will easily imagine has more vexed than   surprized me i am quite unhappy about him and wish i could in any   way remedy the grievances he confides to me i wished as the most   likely means of doing this to mention the subject to lord carlisle   who has always expressed the greatest interest about byron and also   shewn me the greatest kindness finding that he did not object to   it i yesterday had some conversation with lord c on the subject and   it is partly by his advice and wishes that i trouble you with this   letter he authorized me to tell you that if you would allow my   brother to spend the next vacation with you which he seems   strongly to wish that it would put it into his power to see more   of him and shew him more attention than he has hitherto being   withheld from doing so from the dread of having any concern whatever   with mrs byron    i need hardly add that it is almost my first wish that this should be   accomplished i am sure you are of my opinion that it is now of the   greatest consequence to byron to secure the friendship of lord c the   only relation he has who possesses the will and power to be of use   to him i think the letters he writes me quite perfect and he does   not express one sentiment or idea i should wish different he tells me   he is soon to leave harrow but does not say where he is to go i   conclude to oxford or cambridge pray be so good as to write me a few   lines on this subject    i trust entirely to the interest and friendship you have ever so   kindly expressed for my brother for my forgiveness of course you   will not mention to mrs b having heard from me as she would only   accuse me of wishing to estrange her son from her which would be very   far from being the case further than his happiness and comfort are   concerned in it my opinion is that as they cannot agree they had   better be separated for such eternal scenes of wrangling are enough   to spoil the very best temper and disposition in the universe i shall   hope to hear from you soon my dear sir and remain most sincerely   yours augusta byron   footnote 2 lord grey de ruthyn see p 23 note 1      16to the hon augusta byron     castle howard malton yorkshire    harrowonthehill novr saturday 17th 1804     i am glad to hear my dear sister that you like castle howard so   well i have no doubt what you say is true and that lord c is much   more amiable than he has been represented to me never having been   much with him and always hearing him reviled it was hardly possible i   should have conceived a very great friendship for his ldship my   mother you inform me commends my amiable disposition and good   understanding if she does this to you it is a great deal more than   i ever hear myself for the one or the other is always found fault   with and i am told to copy the excellent pattern which i see before   me in herself you have got an invitation too you may accept it if   you please but if you value your own comfort and like a pleasant   situation i advise you to avoid southwelli thank you my dear   augusta for your readiness to assist me and will in some manner   avail myself of it i do not however wish to be separated from her   entirely but not to be so much with her as i hitherto have been for   i do believe she likes me she manifests that in many instances   particularly with regard to money which i never want and have as   much as i desire but her conduct is so strange her caprices so   impossible to be complied with her passions so outrageous that the   evil quite overbalances her agreeable qualities amongst other   things i forgot to mention a most ungovernable appetite for scandal   which she never can govern and employs most of her time abroad in   displaying the faults and censuring the foibles of her acquaintance   therefore i do not wonder that my precious aunt comes in for her   share of encomiums this however is nothing to what happens when my   conduct admits of animadversion then comes the tug of war my whole   family from the conquest are upbraided myself abused and i am told   that what little accomplishments i possess either in mind or body are   derived from her and her alone    when i leave harrow i know not that depends on her nod i like it   very well the master dr drury is the most amiable clergyman i   ever knew he unites the gentleman with the scholar without   affectation or pedantry what little i have learnt i owe to him alone   nor is it his fault that it was not more i shall always remember his   instructions with gratitude and cherish a hope that it may one day be   in my power to repay the numerous obligations i am under to him or   some of his family    our holidays come on in about a fortnight i however have not   mentioned that to my mother nor do i intend it but if i can i shall   contrive to evade going to southwell depend upon it i will not   approach her for some time to come if it is in my power to avoid it   but she must not know that it is my wish to be absent i hope you   will excuse my sending so short a letter but the bell has just rung   to summon us together write soon and believe me ever your   affectionate brother byron    i am afraid you will have some difficulty in decyphering my epistles   but that i know you will excuse adieu remember me to lord   carlisle      17to the hon augusta byron     castle howard malton yorkshire harrowonthehill novr 21st   1804     my dearest augustathis morning i received your by no means   unwelcome epistle and thinking it demands an immediate answer once   more take up my pen to employ it in your service there is no   necessity for my mother to know anything of my intentions till the   time approaches and when it does come mr h has only to write her a   note saying that as i could not accept the invitation he gave me   last holidays he imagined i might do it now to this she surely can   make no objections but if she entertained the slightest idea of my   making any complaint of her very lenient treatment the scene that   would ensue beggars all power of description you may have some little   idea of it from what i have told you and what you yourself know    i wrote to you the other day but you make no mention of receiving my   letter in yours of the 18th inst it is however of little importance   containing merely a recapitulation of circumstances which i have   before detailed at full length    to lord carlisle make my warmest acknowledgements i feel more   gratitude than my feelings can well express i am truly obliged to   him for his endeavours and am perfectly satisfied with your   explanation of his reserve though i was hitherto afraid it might   proceed from personal dislike i have some idea that i leave harrow   these holidays the dr whose character i gave you in my last leaves   the mastership at easter who his successor may be i know not but he   will not be a better i am confident you inform me that you intend to   visit my mother then you will have an opportunity of seeing what i   have described and hearing a great deal of scandal she does not   trouble me much with epistolary communications when i do receive   them they are very concise and much to the purpose however i will   do her the justice to say that she behaves or rather means well and   is in some respects very kind though her manners are not the most   conciliating she likewise expresses a great deal of affection for   you but disapproves your marriage wishes to know my opinion of it   and complains that you are negligent and do not write to her or care   about her how far her opinion of your love for her is well grounded   you best know i again request you will return my sincere thanks to   lord carlisle and for the future i shall consider him as more my   friend than i have hitherto been taught to think i have more reasons   than one to wish to avoid going to notts for there i should be   obliged to associate with lord g whom i detest his manners being   unlike those of a gentleman and the information to be derived from   him but little except about shooting which i do not intend to devote   my life to besides i have a particular reason for not liking him   pray write to me soon adieu my dear augusta    i remain your affectionate brother byron      18to john hanson 1     saturday dec 1st 1804     my dear sirour vacation commences on the 5th of this month when i   propose to myself the pleasure of spending the holidays at your house   if it is not too great an inconvenience i tell you fairly that at   southwell i should have nothing in the world to do but play at cards   and listen to the edifying conversation of old maids two things which   do not at all suit my inclinations in my mothers last letter i find   that my poney and pointers are not yet procured and that lord grey is   still at newstead the former i should be very dull at such a place as   southwell without the latter is still more disagreeable to be with i   presume he goes on in the old wayquarrelling with the farmers and   stretching his judicial powers he being now in the commission to the   utmost becoming a torment to himself and a pest to all around   himi am glad you approve of my gun feeling myself happy that it   has been tried by so distinguished a sportsman    i hope your campaigns against the partridges and the rest of the   feathered tribe have been attended with no serious   consequencestrifling accidents such as the top of a few fingers   and a thumb you gentlemen of the city being used to of course   occasion no interruption to your field sports    your accommodation i have no doubt i shall be perfectly satisfied   with only do exterminate that vile generation of bugs which   nearly ate me up the last time i sojourned at your house after   undergoing the purgatory of harrow board and lodging for three   months i shall not be particular or exorbitant in my demands    pray give my best compliments to mrs hanson and the now   quilldriving hargreaves 2 till i see you i remain yours etc   byron    footnote 1 byron spent the christmas holidays of 18045 with the hansons he gave hanson to understand that it was his wish to leave the school and that dr drury agreed with him in the decision hanson after consulting lord carlisle wrote to drury urging that byron was too young to leave the school drurys reply dated december 29 1804 gave a different colour to the matter    your letter he writes supposes that lord byron was desirous to   leave school and that i acquiesced in his wish but i must do him the   justice to observe that the wish originated with me during his last   residence at harrow his conduct gave me much trouble and uneasiness   and as two of his associates were to leave me at christmas i   certainly suggested to him my wish that he might be placed under the   care of some private tutor previously to his admission to either of   the universities this i did no less with a view to the forming of his   mind and manners than to my own comfort and i am fully convinced   that if such a situation can be procured for his lordship it will be   much more advantageous for him than a longer residence at school   where his animal spirits and want of judgment may induce him to do   wrong whilst his age and person must prevent his instructors from   treating him in some respects as a schoolboy if we part now we may   entertain affectionate dispositions towards each other and his   lordship will have left the school with credit as my dissatisfactions   were expressed to him only privately and in such a manner as not to   affect his public situation in the school  finally however dr drury yielding to the appeal of lord carlisle and hanson allowed the boy to return to harrow and byron remained at the school till july 1805 the last three months being passed under the rule of dr butler   footnote 2 hargreaves hanson

jany 1805    i have delayed writing to you so long my dearest augusta from   ignorance of your residence not knowing whether you graced castle   howard or kireton with your presence the instant mr hanson   informed me where you was i prepared to address you and you have but   just forestalled my intention and now i scarcely know what to begin   with i have so many things to tell you i wish to god that we were   together for it is impossible that i can confine all i have got to   say in an epistle without i was to follow your example and fill   eleven pages as i was informed by my proficiency in the art of   magic that you sometimes send that number to lady gertrude    to begin with an article of grand importance i on saturday dined   with lord carlisle and on further acquaintance i like them all very   much amongst other circumstances i heard of your boldness as a   rider especially one anecdote about your horse carrying you into   the stable perforce i should have admired amazingly to have seen   your progress provided you met with no accident i hope you recollect   the circumstance and know what i allude to else you may think that   i am soaring into the regions of romance i wish you to   corroborate my account in your next and inform me whether my   information was correct    i think your friend lady g is a sweet girl if your taste in love   is as good as it is in friendship i shall think you a very   discerning little gentlewoman his lordship too improves upon further   acquaintance her ladyship i always liked but of the junior part of   the family frederick 1 is my favourite i believe with regard to my   future destination that i return to harrow until june and then im   off for the university could i have found room there i was to have   gone immediately    i have contrived to pass the holidays with mr and mrs hanson to   whom i am greatly obliged for their hospitality you are now within a   days journey of my amiable mama if you wish your spirits raised   or rather roused i would recommend you to pass a week or two with   her however i daresay she would behave very well to you for you do   not know her disposition so well as i do i return you my dear girl   a thousand thanks for hinting to mr h and lord c my uncomfortable   situation i shall always remember it with gratitude as a most   essential service i rather think that if you were any time with my   mother she would bore you about your marriage which she disapproves   of as much for the sake of finding fault as any thing for that is   her favourite amusement at any rate she would be very inquisitive   for she was always tormenting me about it and if you told her any   thing she might very possibly divulge it i therefore advise you   when you see her to say nothing or as little about it as you can   help if you make haste you can answer this well written epistle by   return of post for i wish again to hear from you immediately you   need not fill eleven pages nine will be sufficient but whether it   contains nine pages or nine lines it will always be most welcome my   beloved sister to your affectionate brother and friend byron    footnote 1 the hon

correspondence but   as it does not proceed from want of affection but an idle   disposition you will i hope accept my excuses i am afraid   however that when i shall take up my pen you will not be greatly   edified or amused especially at present since i sit down in   very bad spirits out of humour with myself and all the world except   you i left harrow yesterday and am now at mr hansons till sunday   morning when i depart for nottinghamshire to pay a visit to my   mother with whom i shall remain for a week or two when i return to   town and from thence to harrow until july when i take my

it and whichever   is determined upon will meet with my concurrencethis is the outline   of my plans for the next 6 months    i am glad that you are going to pay his lordship a visit as i shall   have an opportunity of seeing you on my return to town a pleasure   which as i have been long debarred of it will be doubly felt after   so long a separation my visit to the dowager does not promise me all   the happiness i could wish however it must be gone through as it is   some time since i have seen her it shall be as short as possible i   shall expect to find a letter from you when i come down as i wish to   know when you go to town and how long you remain there if you stay   till the middle of next month you may have an opportunity of hearing   me speak as the first day of our harrow orations

that as a   memorial of our gratitude for his long services the scholars   presented him with plate to the amount of 330 guineas    i hope you will excuse this hypocondriac epistle as i never was in

i shall be in town on wednesday the 24th at   furthest when i shall not hope to see you or wish it not but what i   should be glad of your entertaining and loquacious society but as i   think you will be more amused at farleigh it would be selfish in me   to wish that you should forego the pleasures of contemplating pigs   poultry pork pease and potatoes together with other rural   delights for my company much pleasure may you find in your excursion   and i dare say when you have exchanged pleadings for ploughshares   and fleecing clients for feeding flocks you will be in no hurry   to resume

yourself of   your safety i myself shall set out for town this day tuesday week   and intend waiting upon you on thursday at farthest in the mean time   i must console myself as well as i can and i am sure no unhappy   mortal ever required much more consolation than i do at present you   as well as myself know the sweet and amiable temper of a certain   personage to whom i am nearly related of course the pleasure i   have enjoyed during my vacation although it has been greater than i   expected yet has not been so superabundant as to make me wish to   stay a day longer than i can avoid however notwithstanding the   dullness of the place and certain unpleasant things that occur in a   family not a hundred miles distant from southwell i contrived to pass   my time in peace till to day when unhappily in a most inadvertent   manner i said that southwell was not peculiarly to my taste but   however i merely expressed this in common conversation without   speaking disrespectfully of the sweet town which between you and   i i wish was swallowed up by an earthquake provided my eloquent   mother was not in it no sooner had the unlucky sentence which i   believe was prompted by my evil genius escaped my lips than i was   treated with an oration in the ancient style which i have often so   pathetically described to you unequalled by any thing of modern   or antique date nay the philippics against lord melville 1 were   nothing to it one would really imagine to have heard the good   lady that i was a most treasonable culprit but thank st peter   after undergoing this purgatory for the last hour it is at length   blown over and i have sat down under these pleasing impressions to   address you so that i am afraid my epistle will not be the most   entertaining i assure you upon my honour jesting apart i have   never been so scurrilously and violently abused by any person as   by that woman whom i think i am to call mother by that being who   gave me birth to whom i ought to look up with veneration and respect   but whom i am sorry i cannot love or admire within one little hour i   have not only heard myself but have heard my whole family by the   fathers side stigmatized in terms that the blackest malevolence   would perhaps shrink from and that too in words you would be shocked   to hear such augusta such is my mother my mother i disclaim her   from this time and although i cannot help treating her with respect   i cannot reverence as i ought to do that parent who by her   outrageous conduct forfeits all title to filial affection to you   augusta i must look up as my nearest relation to you i must confide   what i cannot mention to others and i am sure you will pity me but i   entreat you to keep this a secret nor expose that unhappy failing of   this woman which i must bear with patience i would be very sorry to   have it discovered as i have only one week more for the present in   the mean time you may write to me with the greatest safety as she   would not open any of my letters even from you i entreat then that   you will favour me with an answer to this i hope however to have the   pleasure of seeing you on the day appointed

her letter though i shall scarcely have patience to treat her with   civility far less with affection that was almost over before and   this has given the finishing stroke to filial which now gives

from my mother in which   she talks of coming to town about the commencement of our holidays   if she does it will be impossible for me to call on my sister   previous to my leaving it and at the same time i cannot conceive what   the deuce she can want at this season in london i have written to   tell her that my holidays commence on the 6th of august but however   july the 1st is the proper dayi beg that if you cannot find some   means to keep her in the country that you at least will connive at   this deception which i can palliate and then i shall be down in the   country before she knows where i am my reasons for this are that i   do not wish to be detained in town so uncomfortably as i know i   shall be if i remain with her that i do wish to see my sister and   in the next place she can just as well come to town after my return to   notts as i dont desire to be dragged about according to her caprice   and there are some other causes i think unnecessary to be now   mentioned if you will only contrive by settling this business if it   is in your power or if that is impossible not mention anything   about the day our holidays commence of which you can be easily   supposed not to be informed if i repeat you can by any means   prevent this mother from executing her purposes believe me you will   greatly oblige    yours truly    byron      30to charles o gordon 1     burgage

i say most pleasing occupation will be to write to   you    we have played the eton and were most confoundedly beat 2 however   it was some comfort to me that i got 11 notches the 1st innings and 7   the 2nd which was more than any of our side except brockman  ipswich   could contrive to hit after the match we dined together and were   extremely friendly not a single discordant word was uttered by either   party to be sure we were most of us rather drunk and went together   to the haymarket theatre where we kicked up a row as you may   suppose when so many harrovians  etonians met at one place i was   one of seven in a single hackney 4 eton and 3 harrow and then we all   got into the same box and the consequence was that such a devil of a   noise arose that none of our neighbours could hear a word of the   drama at which not being highly delighted they began to quarrel   with us and we nearly came to a battle royal how i got home after   the play god knows i hardly recollect as my brain was so much   confused by the heat the row and the wine i drank that i could not   remember in the morning how i found my way to bed    the rain was so incessant in the evening that we could hardly get our   jarveys which was the cause of so many being stowed into one i saw   young twilt your brother with malet and saw also an old   schoolfellow of mine whom i had not beheld for six years but he was   not the one whom you were so good as to enquire after for me and for   which i return you my sincere thanks i set off last night at eight   oclock to my mothers and am just arrived this

or other in the same place or under the same roof as   when i have finished my classical labour and my minority is   expired i shall expect you to be a frequent visitor to newstead   abbey my seat in this county which is about 12 miles from my mothers   house where i now am there i can show you plenty of hunting shooting   and fishing and be assured no one ever will be more welcome guest   than

together with its inmate is as agreeable as ever i   am at this moment vis à vis and téte à téte with that amiable   personage who is whilst i am writing pouring forth complaints   against your ingratitude giving me many oblique hints that i ought   not to correspond with you and concluding with an interdiction that   if you ever after the expiration of my minority are invited to my   residence she will no longer condescend to grace it with her   imperial presence you may figure to yourself for your amusement   my solemn countenance on the occasion and the meek lamblike   demeanour of her ladyship which contrasted with my saintlike   visage forms a striking family painting whilst in the back   ground the portraits of my great grandfather and grandmother   suspended in their frames seem to look with an eye of pity on their   unfortunate descendant whose worth and accomplishments deserve   a milder fate    i am to remain in this garden of eden one month i do not indeed   reside at cambridge till october but i set out for hampshire in   september where i shall be on a visit till the commencement of the   term in the mean time augusta your sympathetic correspondence   must be some alleviation to my sorrows which however are too   ludicrous for me to regard them very seriously but they are really   more uncomfortable than amusing    i presume you were rather surprised not to see my consequential name   in the papers 1 amongst the orators of our 2nd speech day but   unfortunately some wit who had formerly been at harrow suppressed the   merits of long 2 farrer 3 and myself who were always supposed to   take the lead in harrow eloquence and by way of a hoax thought   proper to insert a panegyric on those speakers who were really and   truly allowed to have rather disgraced than distinguished themselves   of course for the wit of the thing the best were left out and the   worst inserted which accounts for the gothic omission of my   superior talents perhaps it was done with a view to weaken our   vanity which might be too much raised by the flattering paragraphs   bestowed on our performance the 1st speechday be that as it may we   were omitted in the account of the 2nd to the astonishment of all   harrow these are disappointments we great men are liable to and   we must learn to bear them with philosophy especially when they arise   from attempts at wit i was indeed very ill at that time and after i   had finished my speech was so overcome by the exertion that i was   obliged to quit the room i had caught cold by sleeping in damp sheets   which was the cause of my indisposition however i am now perfectly   recovered and live in hopes of being emancipated from the slavery of   burgage manor but believe me dearest augusta

byron     castle howard malton yorkshire burgage manor august 10th 1805     i have at last succeeded my dearest augusta in pacifying the   dowager and mollifying that piece of flint which the good lady   denominates her heart she now has condescended to send you her   love although with many comments on the occasion and many   compliments to herself but to me she still continues to be a torment   and i doubt not would continue so till the end of my life however   this is the last time she ever will have an opportunity as when i go   to college i shall employ my vacations either in town or during the   summer i intend making a tour through the highlands and to visit the   hebrides with a party of my friends whom i have engaged for the   purpose this my old preceptor drury recommended as the most improving   way of employing my summer vacation and i have now an additional   reason for following his advice as i by that means will avoid the   society of this woman whose detestable temper destroys every idea of   domestic comfort it is a happy thing that she is my mother and not my   wife so that i can rid myself of her when i please and indeed if   she goes on in the style that she has done for this last week that i   have been with her i shall quit her before the month i was to drag   out in her company is expired and place myself any where rather   than remain with such a vixen as i am to have a very handsome   allowance1 which does not deprive her of a sixpence since there is   an addition made from my fortune by the chancellor for the purpose i   shall be perfectly independent of her and as she has long since   trampled upon and harrowed up every affectionate tie it is my   serious determination never again to visit or be upon any friendly   terms with her this i owe to myself and to my own comfort as well   as justice to the memory of my nearest relations who have been most   shamefully libelled by this female tisiphom a name which your   ladyship will recollect to have belonged to one of the furies   you need not take the precaution of writing in so enigmatical a style   in your next as bad as the woman is she would not dare to open any   letter addressed to me from you whenever you can find time to write   believe me your epistles will be productive of the greatest pleasure   to your    affectionate brother    byron    footnote 1 during byrons schooldays mrs byron received £500 a year from the court of chancery for his education when he went to cambridge she gave up this allowance to her son and the expenditure of a certain sum was sanctioned by chancery for furniture clothes plate etc at the same time mrs byron applied for an allowance of £200 a year but in 1807 the allowance had not been granted her pension it may be added most irregularly paid at all times was reduced to £200 a year writing to hanson september 23 1805 she says i give up the five hundred a year to my son and you will supply him with money accordingly the two hundred a year addition i shall reserve for myself nor can i do with less as my house will always be a home for my son whenever he chooses to come to it      33to charles o gordon     burgage manor august 14 1805    believe me my dearest charles no letter from you can ever be   unentertaining or dull at least to me on the contrary they will   always be productive of the highest pleasure as often as you think   proper to gratify me by your correspondence my answer to your first   was addressed to ledbury and i fear you will not receive it till you   return from your tour which i hope may answer your expectation in   every respect i recollect some years ago passing near abergeldie on   an excursion through the highlands it was at that time a most   beautiful place    i suppose you will soon have a view of the eternal snows that summit   the top of lachin y gair which towers so magnificently above the rest   of our northern alps i still remember with pleasure the admiration   which filled my mind when i first beheld it and further on the dark   frowning mountains which rise near invercauld together with the   romantic rocks that overshadow mar lodge a seat of lord fifes and   the cataract of the dee which dashes down the declivity with   impetuous violence in the grounds adjoining to the house all these i   presume you will soon see so that it is unnecessary for me to   expatiate on the subject i sincerely wish that every happiness may   attend you in your progress i have given you an account of our match   in my epistle to herefordshire we unfortunately lost it i got 11   notches the first innings and 7 the 2nd making 18 in all which was   more runs than any of our side except ipswich could make brockman   also scored 18 we were very convivial in the evening1

 him on his way back as i hope his health is by this time perfectly   reestablished and will not require a journey to harrowgate i shall   not as you justly conjecture have any occasion for my chapeau de   bras as there is nobody in the neighbourhood who would be worth the   trouble of wearing it when i went to their parties i am uncommonly   dull at this place as you may easily imagine nor do i think i shall   have much amusement till the commencement of the shooting season i   shall expect when you next write an account of your military   preparations to repel the invader of our isle

malton yorkshire    trin coll wednesday novr 6th 1805    my dear augustaas might be supposed i like a college life   extremely especially as i have escaped the trammels or rather   fetters of my domestic tyrant mrs byron who continued to plague me   during my visit in july and september i am now most pleasantly   situated in superexcellent rooms flanked on one side by my tutor   on the other by an old fellow both of whom are rather checks upon my   vivacity i am allowed 500 a year a servant and horse so feel as   independent as a german prince who coins his own cash or a cherokee   chief who coins no cash at all but enjoys what is more precious   liberty i talk in raptures of that goddess because my amiable mama   was so despotic i am afraid the specimens i have lately given her of   my spirit and determination to submit to no more unreasonable   demands or the insults which follow a refusal to obey her implicitly   whether right or wrong have given high offence as i had a most   fiery letter from the court at southwell on tuesday because i   would not turn off my servant whom i had not the least reason to   distrust and who had an excellent character from his last master at   her suggestion from some caprice she had taken into her head 1 i   sent back to the epistle which was couched in elegant terms a   severe answer which so nettled her ladyship that after reading it   she returned it in a cover without deigning a syllable in return    the letter and my answer you shall behold when you next see me that   you may judge of the comparative merits of each i shall let her go on   in the heroics till she cools without taking the least notice her   behaviour to me for the last two years neither merits my respect nor   deserves my affection i am comfortable here and having one of the   best allowances in college go on gaily but not extravagantly i need   scarcely inform you that i am not the least obliged to mrs b for it   as it comes off my property and she refused to fit out a single thing   for me from her own pocket 2 my furniture is paid for  she has   moreover a handsome addition made to her own income which i do not in   the least regret as i would wish her to be happy but by no means   to live with me in person the sweets of her society i have already   drunk to the last dregs i hope we shall meet on more affectionate   terms or meet no more    but why do i say meet her temper precludes every idea of happiness   and therefore in future i shall avoid her hospitable mansion though   she has the folly to suppose she is to be mistress of my house when i   come of age i must apologize to you for the dullness of this   letter but to tell you the truth the effects of last nights   claret have not gone out of my head as i supped with a large party   i suppose that fool hanson in his vulgar idiom by the word jolly   did not mean fat but high spirits for so far from increasing i have   lost one pound in a fortnight as i find by being regularly weighed    adieu dearest augusta    signature cut out    nb words in square brackets were cut and torn out with the seal   footnote 1 the servant byrons valet frank was accused of obtaining

cellar    he deserves commendation for the attention he paid to my request   the time of oateaters journey approaches i presume he means to   repair his neglect by punctuality in this respect however no   trinity ale will be forthcoming till i have broached the promised   falernum    college improves in every thing but learning nobody here seems to   look into an author ancient or modern if they can avoid it the   muses poor devils are totally neglected except by a few musty old   sophs and fellows who however agreeable they may be to   minerva are perfect antidotes to the graces even i great as is   my inclination for knowledge am carried away by the tide having   only supped at home twice since i saw your father and have more   engagements on my hands for a week to come still my tutor and i go on   extremely well and for the first three weeks of my life i have not   involved myself in any scrape of consequence    i have news for you which i bear with christian resignation and   without any violent transports of grief my mother whose   diabolical temper you well know has taken it into her sagacious   head to quarrel with me her dutiful son she has such a devil of a   disposition that she cannot be quiet though there are fourscore   miles between us which i wish were lengthened to 400 the cause too   frivolous to require taking up your time to read or mine to write at   last in answer to a furious epistle i returned a sarcastick   answer which so incensed the amiable dowager that my letter was   sent back without her deigning a line in the cover when i next see   you you shall behold her letter and my answer which will amuse you   as they both contain fiery philippics i must request you will write   immediately that i may be informed when my servant shall convey   oateater from london the 20th was the appointed but i wish to hear   further from your father i hope all the family are in a convalescent   state i shall see you at christmas if i live as i propose passing   the vacation which is only a month in london    believe me mr terry yours truly    byron      40to john hanson     trin coll cambridge novr 23 1805    dear siryour advice was good but i have not determined whether i   shall follow it this place is the devil or at least his principal   residence they call it the university but any other appellation   would have suited it much better for study is the last pursuit of the   society the master 1 eats drinks and sleeps the fellows 2   drink dispute and pun the employment of the under graduates you   will probably conjecture without my description i sit down to write   with a head confused with dissipation which tho i hate i cannot   avoid    i have only supped at home 3 times since my arrival and my table is   constantly covered with invitations after all i am the most steady   man in college nor have i got into many scrapes and none of   consequence whenever you appoint a day my servant shall come up for   oateater and as the time of paying my bills now approaches the   remaining £50 will be very agreeable you need not make any   deduction as i shall want most of it i will settle with you for the   saddle and accoutrements next quarter the upholsterers bill will   not be sent in yet as my rooms are to be papered and painted at xmas   when i will procure them no furniture has been got except what was   absolutely necessary including some decanters and wine glasses    your cook certainly deceived you as i know my servant was in town 5   days and she stated 4 i have yet had no reason to distrust him but   we will examine the affair when i come to town when i intend lodging   at mrs massingbirds my mother and i have quarrelled which i bear   with the patience of a philosopher custom reconciles me to   everything    in the hope that mrs h and the battalion are in good health    i remain sir etc etc    byron    footnote 1 william lort mansel 17531820 master of trinity 17981820 bishop of bristol 18081820 was the chief wit of cambridge in his day and the author of many neat epigrams i wish said rogers tabletalk etc p 60 somebody would collect all the epigrams written by dr mansel they are remarkably neat and clever beloe in the sexagenarian vol i p 98 speaks of mansel as a young man remarkable for his personal confidence for his wit and humour and above all for his gallantries apparently on the same somewhat unreliable authority he was as master a severe disciplinarian and extremely tenacious of his dignity i p 99   footnote 2 byron probably refers to richard porson 17591808 professor of greek 17921808 the son of the parish clerk of bacton and earl ruston in norfolk porson was entered by the kindness of friends on the foundation of eton college 17741778 at trinity cambridge he became a scholar in 1780 and a fellow 17821792 in 1792 as he could not conscientiously take orders he vacated his fellowship but was elected professor of greek when byron was at cambridge porsons health and powers were failing silent and reserved except in the society of his friends a sloven in his person he had probably taken to drink as a cure for sleeplessness in a note to the pursuits of literature dialogue iv lines 508516    what asks the author j t mathias himself a fellow of trinity   is mere genius without a regulated life to show the deformity of   vice to the rising hopes of the country the policy of ancient sparta   exhibited an inebriated slave  yet porsons fine love of truth and genius for textual criticism make him one of the greatest if not the greatest name in british scholarship porson married in 1795 mrs lunan sister of mr perry the editor of the morning chronicle for which he frequently wrote in the shade of alexander pope mathias again attacks him as dogmatic bardolph in his nuptial noose porsons wife died shortly after their marriage his controversial method was merciless of his letters to archdeacon travis green lover of literature p 213 says that    he dandles travis as a tyger would a fawn and appears only to   reserve him alive for a time that he may gratify his appetite for   sport before he consigns his feeble prey by a rougher squeeze to   destruction      41to john hanson     trinity college cambridge novr 30 1805     sirafter the contents of your epistle you will probably be less   surprized at my answer than i have been at many points of yours 1   never was i more astonished than at the perusal for i confess i   expected very different treatment your indirect charge of   dissipation does not affect me nor do i fear the strictest inquiry   into my conduct neither here nor at harrow have i disgraced myself   the metropolis and the cloisters are alike unconscious of my   debauchery and on the plains of merry sherwood i have experienced   misery alone in july i visited them for the last time    mrs byron and myself are now totally separated injured by her i   sought refuge with strangers too late i see my error for how was   kindness to be expected from others when denied by a parent in   you sir i imagined i had found an instructor for your advice i   thank you the hospitality of yourself and mrs h on many occasions i   shall always gratefully remember for i am not of opinion that even   present injustice can cancel past obligations    before i proceed it will be necessary to say a few words concerning   mrs byron you hinted a probability of her appearance at trinity the   instant i hear of her arrival i quit cambridge though rustication   or expulsion be the consequence many a weary week of torment have   i passed with her nor have i forgot the insulting epithets with   which myself my sister my father and my family have been   repeatedly reviled    to return to you sir though i feel obliged by your hospitality   etc etc in the present instance i have been completely deceived   when i came down to college and even previous to that period i   stipulated that not only my furniture but even my gowns and books   should be paid for that i might set out free from debt now with all   the sang froid of your profession you tell me that not only i shall   not be permitted to repair my rooms which was at first agreed to but   that i shall not even be indemnified for my present expence in one   word hear my determination i will never pay for them out of my   allowance and the disgrace will not attach to me but to those by   whom i have been deceived still sir not even the shadow of   dishonour shall reflect on my name for i will see that the bills   are discharged whether by you or not is to me indifferent so that   the men i employ are not the victims of my imprudence or your   duplicity i have ordered nothing extravagant every man in college is   allowed to fit up his rooms mine are secured to me during my   residence which will probably be some time and in rendering them   decent i am more praiseworthy than culpable the money i requested was   but a secondary consideration as a lawyer you were not obliged to   advance it till due as a friend the request might have been   complied with when it is required at xmas i shall expect the demand   will be answered in the course of my letter i perhaps have expressed   more asperity than i intended it is my nature to feel warmly nor   shall any consideration of interest or fear ever deter me from giving   vent to my sentiments when injured whether by a sovereign or a   subject    i remain etc etc    byron    footnote 1 the quarrel arose from byron misunderstanding a letter from hanson on the subject of the allowance made by the court of chancery for his furniture      42to john hanson     trin coll cambridge dec 4 1805    sirin charging you with downright duplicity i wronged you nor do   i hesitate to atone for an injury which i feel i have committed or   add to my fault by the vindication of an expression dictated by   resentment an expression which deserves censure and demands the   apology i now offer for i think that disposition indeed mean which   adds obstinacy to insult by attempting the palliation of unmerited   invective from the mistaken principle of disdaining the avowal of even   self convicted error in regard to the other declarations my   sentiments remain unaltered the event will shew whether my   prediction is false i know mrs byron too well to imagine that she   would part with a sous and if by some miracle she was prevailed   upon the details of her generosity in allowing me part of my own   property would be continually thundered in my ears or launched   in the lightening of her letters so that i had rather encounter the   evils of embarrassment than lie under an obligation to one who would   continually reproach me with her benevolence as if her charity had   been extended to a stranger to the detriment of her own fortune my   opinion is perhaps harsh for a son but it is justified by experience   it is confirmed by facts it was generated by oppression it has   been nourished by injury to you sir i attach no blame i am too   much indebted to your kindness to retain my anger for a length of   time that kindness which by a forcible contrast has taught me to   spurn the ties of blood unless strengthened by proper and gentle   treatment i declare upon my honor that the horror of entering mrs   byrons house has of late years been so implanted in my soul that i   dreaded the approach of the vacations as the harbingers of misery   my letters to my sister written during my residence at southwell   would prove my assertion with my kind remembrances to mrs h and   hargreaves    i remain sir yours truly    byron      43to john hanson    trin coll cambridge dec 13 1805    dear siri return you my thanks for the remaining £50 which came in   extremely apropos and on my visit to town about the 19th will give   you a regular receipt in your extenuation of mrs byrons conduct you   use as a plea that by her being my mother greater allowance ought   to be made for those little traits in her disposition so much more   energetic than elegant i am afraid however good your intention   that you have added to rather than diminished my dislike for   independent of the moral obligations she is under to protect   cherish and instruct her offspring what can be expected of that   mans heart and understanding who has continually from childhood to   maturity beheld so pernicious an example his nearest relation is the   first person he is taught to revere as his guide and instructor the   perversion of temper before him leads to a corruption of his own and   when that is depraved vice quickly becomes habitual and though   timely severity may sometimes be necessary  justifiable surely a   peevish harassing system of torment is by no means commendable  when   that is interrupted by ridiculous indulgence the only purpose   answered is to soften the feelings for a moment which are soon after   to be doubly wounded by the recal of accustomed harshness i will now   give this disagreeable subject to the winds i conclude by observing   that i am the more confirmed in my opinion of the futility of natural   ties unless supported not only by attachment but affectionate and   prudent behaviour    tell mrs h that the predicted alteration in my manners and habits   has not taken place i am still the schoolboy and as great a rattle   as ever and between ourselves college is not the place to improve   either morals or income    i am sir yours truly    byron      44to the hon augusta byron    castle howard near malton yorkshire     16 piccadilly thursday decr 26th 1805    my dearest augustaby the date of my letter you will perceive that i   have taken up my residence in the metropolis where i presume we shall   behold you in the latter end of january i sincerely hope you will   make your appearance at that time as i have some subjects to discuss   with you which i do not wish to communicate in my epistle    the dowager has thought proper to solicit a reconciliation which in   some measure i have agreed to still there is a coolness which i do   not feel inclined to thaw as terms of civility are the only   resource against her impertinent and unjust proceedings with which you   are already acquainted    town is not very full and the weather has been so unpropitious that i   have not been able to make use of my horses above twice since my   arrival i hope your everlasting negotiation with the father of your   intended is near a conclusion in some manner if you do not hurry   a little you will be verging into the vale of years and though   you may be blest with sons and daughters you will never live to see   your grandchildren    when convenient favour me with an answer and believe me    signature cut out       45to the hon augusta byron    castle howard neat malton yorkshire 16 piccadilly friday   decr 27th 1805    my dear augustayou will doubtless be surprised to see a second   epistle so close upon the arrival of the first especially as it is   not my custom but the business i mentioned rather mysteriously in my   last compels me again to proceed but before i disclose it i must   require the most inviolable secrecy for if ever i find that it has   transpired all confidence all friendship between us has concluded i   do not mean this exordium as a threat to induce you to comply with my   request but merely whether you accede or not to keep it a secret   and although your compliance would essentially oblige me yet believe   me my esteem will not be diminished by your refusal nor shall i   suffer a complaint to escape the affair is briefly thus like all   other young men just let loose and especially one as i am freed from   the worse than bondage of my maternal home i have been extravagant   and consequently am in want of money you will probably now imagine   that i am going to apply to you for some no if you would offer me   thousands i declare solemnly that i would without hesitation refuse   nor would i accept them were i in danger of starvation all i expect   or wish is that you will be joint security with me for a few hundreds   a person one of the money lending tribe has offered to advance in   case i can bring forward any collateral guarantee that he will not be   a loser the reason of this requisition is my being a minor and might   refuse to discharge a debt contracted in my nonage if i live till   the period of my minority expires you cannot doubt my paying as i   have property to the amount of 100 times the sum i am about to raise   if as i think rather probable a pistol or a fever cuts short the   thread of my existence you will receive half the dross saved since   i was ten years old and can be no great loser by discharging a debt   of 7 or £800 from as many thousands it is far from my breast to exact   any promise from you that would be detrimental or tend to lower me in   your opinion if you suppose this leads to either of those   consequences forgive my impertinence and bury it in oblivion i have   many friends most of them in the same predicament with myself to   those who are not i am too proud to apply for i hate obligation my   relations you know i detest who then is there that i can address on   the subject but yourself to you therefore i appeal and if i am   disappointed at least let me not be tormented by the advice of   guardians and let silence rule your resolution i know you will think   me foolish if not criminal but tell me so yourself and do not   rehearse my failings to others no not even to that proud grandee the   earl who whatever his qualities may be is certainly not amiable   and that chattering puppy hanson would make still less allowance for   the foibles of a boy i am now trying the experiment whether a woman   can retain a secret let me not be deceived if you have the least   doubt of my integrity or that you run too great a risk do not   hesitate in your refusal adieu i expect an answer with impatience   believe me whether you accede or not    signature cut out    psi apologize for the numerous errors probably enveloped in this   cover the temper of my mind

another hand6     my dearest augustayour efforts to reanimate my sinking spirits   will i am afraid fail in their effect for my melancholy proceeds   from a very different cause to that which you assign as my nerves   were always of the strongest texturei will not however pretend to   say i possess that gaieté de coeur which formerly distinguished me   but as the diminution of it arises from what you could not alleviate   and might possibly be painful you will excuse the disclosure suffice   it to know that it cannot spring from indisposition as my health was   never more firmly established than now nor from the subject on which   i lately wrote as that is in a promising train and even were it   otherwise the failure would not lead to despair you know me too well   to think it is love  i have had no quarrel or dissention with   friend or enemy you may therefore be easy since no unpleasant   consequence will be produced from the present sombre cast of my   temper i fear the business will not be concluded before your arrival   in town when we will settle it together as by the 20th these sordid   bloodsuckers who have agreed to furnish the sum will have drawn up   the bond believe me my dearest sister it never entered in to my   head that you either could or would propose to anticipate my   application to others by a present from yourself i and i only   will be injured by my own extravagance nor would i have wished you   to take the least concern had any other means been open for   extrication as it is i hope you will excuse my impertinence or if   you feel an inclination to retreat do not let affection for me   counterbalance prudence    signature cut out    footnote 1 words in square brackets accidentally torn off the edge of the paper and

for the money   than the poor devils who were my creditors i have also discharged my   college bills amounting to £231£75 of which i shall trouble hanson   to repay being for furniture and as my allowance is £500 per annum   i do not chuse to lose the overplus as it makes only £125 per quarter   i happen to have a few hundreds in ready cash by me 1 so i have   paid the accounts but i find it inconvenient to remain at college   not for the expence as i could live on my allowance only i am   naturally extravagant however the mode of going on does not suit my   constitution improvement at an english university to a man of rank   is you know impossible and the very idea ridiculous now i   sincerely desire to finish my education and having been sometime at   cambridge the credit of the university is as much attached to my   name as if i had pursued my studies there for a century but   believe me it is nothing more than a name which is already acquired   i can now leave it with honour as i have paid everything  wish to   pass a couple of years abroad where i am certain of employing my time   to far more advantage and at much less expence than at our english   seminaries tis true i cannot enter france but germany and the   courts of berlin vienna  petersburg are still open i shall lay the   plan before hanson  lord c i presume you will all agree and if you   do not i will if possible get away without your consent though i   should admire it more in the regular manner  with a tutor of your   furnishing this is my project at present i wish you to be silent   to hanson about it let me have your answer i intend remaining in   town a month longer when perhaps i shall bring my horses and myself   down to your residence in that execrable kennel i hope you have   engaged

possible  again she writes march 1 1806    i beg you will not mention to my son having heard from me but try   to get out of him his reason for wishing to leave england and where   he got the money i much fear he has fallen into bad hands not only   in regard to money matters but in other respects my idea is that he   has inveigled himself with some woman that he wishes to get rid of and   finds it difficult but whatever it is he must be got out of it  again march 4 1806    that boy will be the death of me and drive me mad i never will   consent to his going abroad where can he get hundreds

wrung from me   by heartrending agony i am well rewarded i came to   nottinghamshire to please him and now he hates it he knows that i am   doing everything in my power to pay his debts and he writes

stunned for a short time but soon   recovered and suffered no material injury the accident happened on   the harrow road i have paid joness bill amounting to £23145 of   which i expect to be reimbursed £75 for furniture i have got his   bankers receipt and the account ready for your inspection i now owe   nothing at cambridge but shall not return this term 1 as i have   been extremely

kindly on that subject as on all others and though he says it may   not be productive of any good and that he may be only able to join   his lamentations with yours he should like to talk to you and try if   anything can be done i was much surprized and vexed to see my brother   a week ago at the play as i think he ought to be employing his time   more profitably at cambridge      49to john

our interviewwe know each other sufficiently to render apology   unnecessary i shall therefore without further prelude proceed to the   subject in question you are not ignorant that i have lately lived at   considerable expence to support which my allotted income by the   sapient court of chancery is inadequatei confess i have   borrowed a trifling sum and now wish to raise £500 to discharge some   debts i have contracted my approaching quarter will bring me £200 due   from my allowance and if you can procure me the other £300 at a   moderate interest it will save 100 per cent i must pay my israelite   for the same purposeyou see by this i have an excellent idea of   oeconomy even in my extravagance by being willing to pay as little   money as possible for the cash must be disbursed somewhere or   somehow and if you decline as in prudence i tell you fairly you   ought the tribe of levi will be my dernier resort however i   thought proper to make this experiment with very slender hopes of   success indeed since recourse to the law is at best a desperate   effort i have now laid open my affairs to you without disguise and   stated the facts as they appear declining all comments or the use of   any sophistry to palliate my application or urge my request all i   desire is a speedy answer whether successful or not    believe me yours truly byron      50to john hanson     16

of giving that but very few   chuse to own themselves competent to the other i do not now write to   urge a 2nd request one denial is sufficient i only require what is   my right this is lady day £125 is due for my last quarter and £75   for my expenditure in furniture at cambridge and i will thank you to   remit    the court of chancery may perhaps put in force your threat i have   always understood it formed a sanction for legal plunderers to   protract the decision of justice from year to year till weary of   spoil it at length condescended to give sentence but i never yet   understood even its unhallowed hands preyed upon the orphan it was   bound to protect be it so only let me have your answer    i remain etc etc byron       51to henry angelo 1   trinity college

despair of gaining our point   and every effort shall be made to remove the obstacles which at   present prevent the execution of our project i yesterday waited on   the master of this college 3 who having a personal dispute with the   mayor declined interfering but recommended an application to the   vice chancellor whose authority is paramount in the university i   shall communicate this to lord altamount4 and we will endeavour to   bend the obstinacy of the upstart magistrate who seems to be   equally deficient in justice and common civility on my arrival in   town which will take place

least as early as 1787 when he published the school of fencing and fenced with the chevalier de st george and other celebrities before the prince of wales at carlton house in 1806 he was travelling down every other week to cambridge as he states in his pic nic 1837 to visit his pupils he had made byrons acquaintance at harrow by teaching him to fence and in later years had many bouts with him with the foils singlesticks and highland broadsword his reminiscences 1830 together with his pic nic contain numerous anecdotes of byron to whom he seems to have been sincerely attached in 1806 he had several rooms in london for the use of his pupils one of these was at 13 bond street which he shared with gentleman jackson the pugilist and exchampion in cruikshanks picture of the room pierce egans

byron had with the connivance of the pigots escaped to london after a quarrel with his mother but the caution to keep his lodgings secret gives a theatrical air to the letter as the rooms kept by mrs massingberd were originally taken by mrs byron and often occupied by her and she was at the time corresponding with hanson about her sons debt to mrs massingberd who seems to have been both landlady

not so the present since   the appearance of a note from the illustrious cause of my sudden   decampment has driven the natural ruby from my cheeks and   completely blanched my woebegone countenance this gunpowder   intimation of her arrival confound her activity breathes less of   terror and dismay than you will probably imagine from the volcanic   temperament of her ladyship and concludes with

suspend the printing of my poems till he   hears further from me as i have determined to give them a new form   entirely this prohibition does not extend to the two last pieces i   have sent with my

surgeons bill with him which i will   discharge immediately on receiving it nor can i conceive the reason   of his not acquainting frank with the state of my unfortunate   quadrupeds dear pigot

letter 34 footnote 2      58to elizabeth bridget pigot 1    my dear bridgeti have only just dismounted from my pegasus which   has prevented me from descending to plain prose in an epistle of   greater length to your fair self you regretted in a former letter   that my poems were not more extensive i now for your satisfaction   announce that i have nearly doubled them partly by the discovery of   some i conceived to be lost and partly by some new productions we   shall meet on wednesday next till then believe me    yours affectionately    byron    psyour brother john is seized with a poetic mania and is now   rhyming away at the rate of three lines per hourso much for   inspiration adieu    footnote 1 this letter was written about september 1806 from harrogate where byron had gone with john pigot it forms the conclusion of a longer letter written by pigot to his sister from which moore quotes life p 37 the following passage    harrowgate is still extremely full wednesday today is our   ballnight and i meditate going into the room for an hour although i   am by no means fond of strange faces lord b you know is even more   shy than myself but for an hour this evening i will shake it off   how do our theatricals proceed lord byron can say all his part and   i most of mine he certainly acts it inimitably lord b is now   poetising and since he has been here has written some very pretty   verses to a beautiful quaker see poems vol i pp 3841 he   is very good in trying to amuse me as much as possible but it is not   in my nature to be happy without either female society or study   there are many pleasant rides about here which i have taken in   company with boswain who with brighton is universally admired   you must read this to mrs b as it is a little tony lumpkinish   lord b desires some space left therefore with respect to all the   comedians elect believe me etc etc   for the theatricals to which mr pigot alludes see page 117 letter 65 footnote 3 4 brighton it may be added was one of byrons horses the other was called sultan boswain was the dog to which byron addressed the wellknown epitaph see poems vol i pp 280 281 and note 1  moore also quotes pigots recollections of the visit to harrogate life pp 37 38    we i remember went in lord byrons own carriage with posthorses   and he sent his groom with two saddlehorses and a beautifully   formed very ferocious bullmastiff called nelson to meet us there   boatswain went by the side of his valet frank on the box with us    the bulldog nelson always wore a muzzle and was occasionally sent   for into our private room when the muzzle was taken off much to my   annoyance and he and his master amused themselves with throwing the   room into disorder there was always a jealous feud between this   nelson and boatswain and whenever he latter came into the room while   the former was there they instantly seized each other and then   byron myself frank and all the waiters that could be found were   vigorously engaged in parting themwhich was in general only   effected by thrusting poker and tongs into the mouths of each but   one day nelson unfortunately escaped out of the room without his   muzzle and going into the stableyard fastened upon the throat of a   horse from which he could not be disengaged the stableboys ran in   alarm to find frank who taking one of his lords wogdons pistols   always kept loaded in his room shot poor nelson through the head to   the great regret of byron    we were at the crown inn at low harrowgate we always dined in the   public room but retired very soon after dinner to our private one   for byron was no more a friend to drinking than myself we lived   retired and made few acquaintance for he was naturally shy very   shy which people who did not know him mistook for pride while at   harrowgate he accidentally met with professor hailstone from   cambridge and appeared much delighted to see him the professor was   at upper harrowgate we called upon him one evening to take him to the   theatre i thinkand lord byron sent his carriage for him another   time to a ball at the granby this desire to show attention to one of   the professors of his college is a proof that though he might choose   to satirise the mode of education in the university and to abuse the   antiquated regulations and restrictions to which undergraduates are   subjected he had yet a due discrimination in his respect for the   individuals who belonged to it i have always indeed heard him speak   in high terms of praise of hailstone as well as of his master bishop   mansel of trinity college and of others whose names i have now   forgotten    few people understood byron but i know that he had naturally a kind   and feeling heart and that there was not a single spark of malice in   his composition  professor hailstone was woodwardian professor of geology 17881818 for bishop mansel see page 84 note 1      59to john hanson 1    southwell dec 7th 1806    sira letter to mrs byron has just arrived which states from what   you have heard of the tenor of my letters you will not put up   with insult i presume this means for i will not be positive on what   is rather ambiguously expressed that some offence to you has been   conveyed in the above mentioned epistles if you will peruse the   papers in question you will discover that the person insulted is   not yourself or any one of your connections on mr bs   apology i have expressed my opinion in a letter to your son if any   misrepresentation has taken place it must be those connections to   whom i am to pay such deference  whose conduct to me has deserved   such ample respect i must now beg leave to observe in turn that i   am by no means disposed to bear insult  be the consequences what   they may i will always declare in plain and explicit terms my   grievance nor will i overlook the slightest mark of disrespect    silently brood over affronts from a mean and interested dread of   injury to my person or property the former i have strength and   resolution to protect the latter is too trifling by its loss to   occasion a moments uneasiness    though not conversant with the methodical  dilatory arrangements of   law or business i know enough of justice to direct my conduct by the   principles of equity nor can i reconcile the insolence of office to   her regulations or forget in an instant a poignant affront    but enough of this dispute you will perceive my sentiments on the   subject in my correspondence with mr b and mr h junior in future   to prevent a repetition and altercation i shall advise but as even   then some demur may take place i wish to be informed if the   equitable court of chancery whose paternal care of their ward can   never be sufficiently commended have determined in the great flow of   parental affection to withhold their beneficent support till i   return to alma mater ie cambridge your information on this   point will oblige as a college life is neither conducive to my   improvement nor suitable to my inclination as to the reverse of the   rochdale trial i received the news of success without confidence or   exultation i now sustain the loss without repining my expectations   from law were never very sanguine    i remain yr very obedt sert    byron    footnote 1 hansons partner birch the mr b of the letter seems to have irritated byron by withholding the income allotted to him by the court of chancery for his education at cambridge the attempt to compel his return to trinity by cutting off the supplies failed he did not appear again at cambridge till the summer term of 1807     60to j ridge    dorants hotel albemarle street jany 12 1807    mr ridgei understand from some of my friends that several of the   papers are in the habit of publishing extracts from my volume   particularly the morning herald i cannot say for my own part i have   observed this but i am assured it is so the thing is of no   consequence to me except that i dislike it but it is to you and as   publisher you should put a stop to it the morning herald is the   paper of course you cannot address any other as i am sure i have   seen nothing of the kind in mine you will act upon this as you think   proper and proceed with the 2d edition as you please i am in no   hurry and i still think you were premature in undertaking it    etc

variety of my avocations in prose and verse must plead my   excuse with this epistle you will receive a volume of all my   juvenilia published since your departure it is of considerably   greater size than the copy in your possession which i beg you will   destroy as the present is much more complete that unlucky poem to   my poor mary 1 has been the cause of some animadversion from ladies   in years i have not printed it in this collection in consequence of   my being pronounced a most profligate sinner in short a young   moore 2 by yourfriend i believe in general they   have been favourably received and surely the age of their author will   preclude severe criticism the adventures of my life from sixteen to   nineteen and the dissipation into which i have been thrown in london   have given a voluptuous tint to my ideas but the occasions which   called forth my muse could hardly admit any other colouring this   volume is vastly correct and miraculously chaste apropos talking   of love         if you can find leisure to answer this farrago of unconnected   nonsense you need not doubt what gratification will accrue from your   reply to yours ever etc    footnote 1 see page

john leacroft 1     january 31 1807     sirupon serious reflection on the conversation we last night held   i am concerned to say that the only effectual method to crash the   animadversions of officious malevolence is by my declining all future   intercourse with those whom my acquaintance has unintentionally   injured at the same time i must observe that i do not form this   resolution from any resentment at your representation which was   temperate and gentlemanly but from a thorough conviction that the   desirable end can be attained by no other line of conduct    i beg leave to return my thanks to mr  mrs leacroft for the   attention and hospitality i have always experienced of which i shall   ever retain a grateful remembrance    so much to them with your permission i must add a few words for   myself you will be sensible that a coolness between families   hitherto remarkable for their intimacy cannot remain unobserved in a   town whose inhabitants are notorious for officious curiosity that   the causes for our separation will be misrepresented i have little   doubt if therefore i discover that such misrepresentation does take   place i shall call upon you to unite with myself in making a serious   example of those men be they who they may that dare to cast an   aspersion on the character i am sacrificing my own comfort to protect    if on the other hand they imagine that my conduct is the   consequence of intimidation from my conference with you i must   require a further explanation of what passed between us on the   subject as however careful i am of your sisters honour i am   equally tenacious of my own    i do not wish this to be misconstrued into any desire to quarrel it   is what i shall endeavour to avoid but as a young man very lately   entered into the world i feel compelled to state that i can permit   no suspicion to be attached to my name with impunity    i have the honour to remain    your very obedient servant    byron    footnote 1 this and the two following letters refer to a quarrel between byron and the leacroft family which arose from his attentions to miss julia leacroft moores statement that captain leacroft the ladys brother see page 34 letter 12 footnote 3 sent a challenge to byron who was at first inclined to accept it is inaccurate but it is possible that byron was acting on the advice of the rev j t becher when he decided in order to prevent misunderstanding to break off his acquaintance with the leacrofts absolutely    63to captain john leacroft    february 4th 1807    siri have just received your note which conveys all that can be   said on the subject i can easily conceive your feelings must have   been irritated in the course of the affair i am sorry that i have   been the unintentional cause of so disagreeable a business the line   of conduct however painful to myself which i have adopted is the   only effectual method to prevent the remarks of a meddling world i   therefore again take my leave for the last time i repeat that   though the intercourse from which i have derived so many hours of   happiness is for ever interrupted the remembrance can never be   effaced from the bosom of    your very obedient servant    byron      64to captain john leacroft  february 4th 1807  siri am concerned to be obliged again to trouble you as i had hoped that our conversations had terminated amicably your good father it seems has desired otherwise he has just sent a most agreeable epistle in which i am honoured with the appellations of unfeeling and ungrateful but as the consequences of all this must ultimately fall on you and myself i merely write this to apprise you that the dispute is not of my seeking and that if we must cut each others throats to please our relations you will do me the justice to say it is from no personal animosity between us or from any insult on my part that such disagreeable events for i am not so much enamoured of quarrels as to call them pleasant have arisen  i remain yours etc  byron      65to the earl of clare 1    southwell notts february 6 1807    my dearest clarewere i to make all the apologies necessary to atone   for my late negligence you would justly say you had received a   petition instead of a letter as it would be filled with prayers for   forgiveness but instead of this i will acknowledge my sins at   once and i trust to your friendship and generosity rather than to my   own excuses though my health is not perfectly reestablished i am   out of all danger and have recovered every thing but my spirits   which are subject to depression you will be astonished to hear i have   lately written to delawarr 2 for the purpose of explaining as far   as possible without involving some old friends of mine in the   business the cause of my behaviour to him during my last residence at   harrow nearly two years ago which you will recollect was rather   en cavalier since that period i have discovered he was treated   with injustice both by those who misrepresented his conduct and by me   in consequence of their suggestions i have therefore made all the   reparation in my power by apologizing for my mistake though with   very faint hopes of success indeed i never expected any answer but   desired one for forms sake that has not yet arrived and most   probably never will however i have eased my own conscience by   the atonement which is humiliating enough to one of my disposition   yet i could not have slept satisfied with the reflection of having   even unintentionally injured any individual i have done all that   could be done to repair the injury and there the affair must end   whether we renew our intimacy or not is of very trivial consequence    my time has lately been much occupied with very different pursuits i   have been transporting a servant 3 who cheated merather a   disagreeable eventperforming in private theatricals   4publishing a volume of poems at the request of my friends for   their perusalmaking loveand taking physic the two last   amusements have not had the best effect in the world for my   attentions have been divided amongst so many fair damsels and the   drugs i swallow are of such variety in their composition that between   venus and Æsculapius i am harassed to death however i have still   leisure to devote some hours to the recollections of past regretted   friendships and in the interval to take the advantage of the moment   to assure you how much i am and ever will be my dearest clare    your truly attached and sincere    byron

his dying words in a style which convulsed byron with laughter  the play itself nearly came to an untimely conclusion captain lightfoot screwed his failing courage to the sticking point by several glasses of wine with the result that being a very abstemious man he became tipsy but restoratives were administered and he went through his part with credit byron who was the star of the company

william bankes 1     southwell march 6 1807     dear bankesyour critique is valuable for many reasons in the first   place it is the only one in which flattery has borne so slight a   part in the next i am cloyed with insipid compliments i have a   better opinion of your judgment and ability than your feelings   accept my most sincere thanks for your kind decision not less   welcome because totally unexpected with regard to a more exact   estimate i need not remind you how few of the best poems in our   language will stand the test of minute or verbal criticism it   can therefore hardly be expected the effusions of a boy and most of   these pieces have been produced at an early period can derive much   merit either from the subject or composition many of them were   written under great depression of spirits and during severe   indispositionhence the gloomy turn of the ideas we coincide in   opinion that the poësies érotiques are the most exceptionable   they were however grateful to the deities on whose altars they   were offeredmore i seek not    the portrait of pomposus 2 was drawn at harrow after a long   sitting this accounts for the resemblance or rather the   caricatura he

doubt they will be deservedly abuseda just   punishment for my unfilial treatment of so excellent an alma mater i   sent you no copy lest we should be placed in the situation of gil   blas and the archbishop of grenada 4 though running some hazard   from the experiment i wished your verdict to be unbiassed had my   libellus been presented previous to your letter it would have   appeared a species of bribe to purchase compliment i feel no   hesitation in saying i was more anxious to hear your critique   however severe than the praises of the million on the same day i   was honoured with the encomiums of mackenzie the celebrated author   of the man of feeling 5 whether his approbation or yours   elated me most i cannot decide    you will receive my juveniliaat least all yet published i have a   large volume in manuscript which may in part appear hereafter at   present i have neither time nor inclination to prepare it for the   press in the spring i shall return to trinity to dismantle my rooms   and bid you a final adieu the cam will not be much increased by my   tears on the occasion your further remarks however caustic or   bitter to a palate vitiated with the sweets of adulation will be   of service johnson has shown us that no poetry is perfect but to   correct mine would be an herculean labour in fact i never looked   beyond the moment of composition and published

i am not personally acquainted with either of these gentlemen   nor ever requested their sentiments on the subject their praise is   voluntary and transmitted through the medium of a friend at whose   house they read the productions    contrary to my former intention i am now preparing a volume for the   public at large my amatory pieces will be exchanged and others   substituted in their place the whole will be considerably enlarged   and appear the latter end of may this is a hazardous experiment but   want of better employment the encouragement i have met with and my   own vanity induce me to

personal animosity as the florid   declamations of parliamentary demagogues i return you my thanks   for your favorable opinion of my muse i have lately been honoured   with many very flattering literary critiques from men of high   reputation in the sciences particularly lord woodhouselee and henry   mackenzie both scots and of great eminence as authors themselves i   have received also some most favorable testimonies from cambridge   this you will marvel at as indeed i did myself encouraged by these   and several other encomiums i am about to publish a volume at large   this will be very different from the present the amatory effusions   not to be wondered at from the dissipated life i have led will be   cut out and others substituted i coincide with you in opinion that   the poet yields to the orator but as nothing can be done in the   latter capacity till the expiration of my minority the former   occupies my present attention and both ancients and moderns have   declared that the two pursuits are so nearly similar as to require in   a great measure the same talents and he who excels in the one would   on application succeed in the other lyttleton glover and young who   was a celebrated preacher and a bard are instances of the kind   sheridan  fox also these are great names i may imitate i can   never equal them    you speak of the charms of southwell the place i abhor the   fact is i remain here because i can appear no where else being   completely done up wine and women have dished your humble   servant not a sou to be had all over condemned to exist i

very thin however it is the fact so much so that the people   here think i am going i have lost 18 lb in my weight that is one   stone  4 pounds since january this was ascertained last wednesday   on account of a bet with an acquaintance however dont be alarmed   i have taken every means to accomplish the end by violent exercise   and fasting as i found myself too plump i shall continue my   exertions having no other amusement i wear seven waistcoats and a   great coat run and play at cricket in this dress till quite   exhausted by excessive perspiration use the hip bath daily eat only   a quarter of a pound of butchers meat in 24 hours no suppers or   breakfast only one meal a day drink no malt liquor but a little   wine and take physic occasionally by these means my ribs display

in your possession accounts to amount and then i   have received £70 for which i believe you have my receipt this extra   £25 or £30 though the bills are long ago discharged from my own   purse i should not have troubled you for had not my present   situation rendered even that trifle of some consequence i have   therefore to request that my draft for £150 instead of £125 the   simple quarter may be honoured but think it necessary to apprize you   previous to its appearance and indeed to request an early answer as   i had one draft returned by mistake from your house some months   past i have no inclination to be placed in a similar dilemma    i lent mrs b £60 last year of this i have never received a sou and   in all probability never shall i do not mention the circumstance as   any reproach on that worthy and lamblike dame 1 but merely to show   you how affairs stand tis true myself and two servants lodge in the   house but my horses etc and their expences are defrayed by your   humble sert i quit cambridge in july and shall have considerable   payments to make at that period for this purpose i must sell my   steeds i paid jones in january £150 £38 to my stable keeper £21

what to say about byrons returning to cambridge when   he was there i believe he did nothing but drink gamble and spend   money  a month later april 29 1807 she consults hanson about raising £1000 by a loan from mrs parkyns on her security    byron from their last letter gave up all hopes of getting the money   and behaved very well on the occasion and proposed selling his horses   and plans of oeconomy that i much fear will be laid aside if the money   is procured my only motive for wishing it was to keep him clear of   the jews but at present he does not seem at all disposed to have

indeed gave to her and now i   am going to make the most selfish and rude of requests the person who   gave it to me when i was very young is dead and though a long   time has elapsed since we met as it was the only memorial i possessed   of that person in whom i was very much interested it has acquired a   value by this event i could have wished it never to have borne in my   eyes if therefore miss pigot should have preserved it i must   under these circumstances beg her to excuse my requesting it to be   transmitted to me at no 8 st jamess street london and i will   replace it by something she may remember me by equally well as she   was always so kind as to feel interested in the fate of him that   formed the subject of our conversation you may tell her that the   giver of that

he has been my   almost constant associate since october 1805 when i entered   trinity college his voice first attracted my attention his   countenance fixed it and his manners attached me to him for ever   he departs for a mercantile house in town in october and we shall   probably not meet till the expiration of my minority when i shall   leave to his decision either entering as a partner through my   interest or residing with me altogether of course he would in his   present frame of mind prefer the latter but he may alter his   opinion previous to that periodhowever he shall have his choice   i certainly love him more than any human being and neither time nor   distance have had the least effect on my in general changeable   disposition in short we shall put lady e butler and miss

  applauded far beyond my deserts i know nothing of the critic but   think him a very discerning gentleman and myself a devilish   clever fellow his critique pleases me particularly because it is   of great length and a proper quantum of censure is administered just   to give an agreeable relish to the praise you know i hate insipid   unqualified commonplace compliment if you would wish to see it   order the 13th number of literary recreations for the last month i   assure you i have not the most distant idea of the writer of the   articleit is printed in a periodical publicationand though i have   written a paper a review of wordsworth which appears in the same   work i am ignorant of every other person concerned in iteven the   editor whose name i have not heard my cousin lord alexander

in   common with the rest of the fashionable world and wished to claim her   relationship with the author i was unluckily engaged on an excursion   for some days afterwards and as the duchess was on the eve of   departing for scotland i have postponed my introduction till the   winter when i shall favour the lady whose taste i shall not   dispute with my most sublime and edifying conversation she

determination of writing no more and a friend to the cause of   literature begs i will gratify the public with some new work at   no very distant period who would not be a bardthat is to say if   all

published or not must depend on circumstances so much for egotism   my laurels have turned my brain but the cooling acids of   forthcoming criticism will probably restore me to modesty    southwell is

have been   praised to the skies in the critical review 4 and abused greatly   in another publication 5 so much the better they tell me for the   sale of the book it keeps up controversy and prevents it being   forgotten besides the first men of all ages have had their share   nor do the humblest escapeso i bear it like a philosopher it is   odd two opposite critiques came out on the same day and out of five   pages of abuse my censor only quotes two lines from different   poems in support of his opinion now the proper way to cut up is   to quote long passages and make them appear absurd

9bre 19 1820     what you said of the late charles skinner matthews 2 has set me to   my recollections but i have not been able to turn up any thing which   would do for the purposed memoir of his brothereven if he had   previously done enough during his life to sanction the introduction of   anecdotes so merely personal he was however a very extraordinary   man and would have been a great one no one ever succeeded in a more   surpassing degree than he did as far as he went he was indolent too   but whenever he stripped he overthrew all antagonists his conquests   will be found registered at cambridge particularly his downing one   which was hotly and highly contested and yet easily won hobhouse   was his most intimate friend and can tell you more of him than any   man william bankes 3 also a great deal i myself recollect more of   his oddities than of his academical qualities for we lived most   together at a very idle period of my life when i went up to   trinity in 1805 at the age of seventeen and a half i was miserable   and untoward to a degree i was wretched at leaving harrow to which i   had become attached during the two last years of my stay there   wretched at going to cambridge instead of oxford there were no rooms   vacant at christchurch wretched from some private domestic   circumstances of different kinds and consequently about as unsocial   as a wolf taken from the troop so that although i knew matthews and   met him often then at bankess who was my collegiate pastor and   master and patron and at rhodes milness prices dicks   macnamaras farrells gally knights and others of that set of   contemporaries yet i was neither intimate with him nor with any one   else except my old schoolfellow edward long 4 with whom i used to   pass the day in riding and swimming and william bankes who was   goodnaturedly tolerant of my ferocities    it was not till 1807 after i had been upwards of a year away from   cambridge to which i had returned again to reside for my degree   that i became one of matthewss familiars by means of hobhouse 5   who after hating me for two years because i wore a white hat and   a grey coat and rode a grey horse as he says himself took me   into his good graces because i had written some poetry i had always   lived a good deal and got drunk occasionally in their companybut   now we became really friends in a morning matthews however was not   at this period resident in college i met him chiefly in london and   at uncertain periods at cambridge hobhouse in the mean time did   great things he founded the cambridge whig club which he seems to   have forgotten and the amicable society which was dissolved in   consequence of the members constantly quarrelling and made himself   very popular with us youth and no less formidable to all tutors   professors and heads of colleges william bankes was gone while he   stayed he ruled the roastor rather the roastingand was father   of all mischiefs    matthews and i meeting in london and elsewhere became great   cronies he was not good temperednor am ibut with a little tact   his temper was manageable and i thought him so superior a man that i   was willing to sacrifice something to his humours which were often   at the same time amusing and provoking what became of his papers   and he certainly had many at the time of his death was never   known i mention this by the way fearing to skip it over and as he   wrote remarkably well both in latin and english we went down to   newstead together 6 where i had got a famous cellar and monks   dresses from a masquerade warehouse we were a company of some seven   or eight with an occasional neighbour or so for visiters and used to   sit up late in our friars dresses drinking burgundy claret   champagne and what not out of the skullcup and all sorts of   glasses and buffooning all round the house in our conventual   garments 7 matthews always denominated me the abbot and never   called me by any other name in his good humours to the day of his   death the harmony of these our symposia was somewhat interrupted a   few days after our assembling by matthewss threatening to throw   hobhouse out of a window in consequence of i know not what commerce   of jokes ending in this epigram hobhouse came to me and said that   his respect and regard for me as host would not permit him to call   out any of my guests and that he should go to town next morning he   did it was in vain that i represented to him that the window was not   high and that the turf under it was particularly soft away he went    matthews and myself had travelled down from london together talking   all the way incessantly upon one single topic when we got to   loughborough i know not what chasm had made us diverge for a moment   to some other subject at which he was indignant come said he   dont let us break throughlet us go on as we began to our   journeys end and so he continued and was as entertaining as ever   to the very end he had previously occupied during my years absence   from cambridge my rooms in trinity with the furniture and jones   8 the tutor in his odd way had said on putting him in      mr matthews i recommend to your attention not to damage any of     the moveables for lord byron sir is a young man of tumultuous     passions    matthews was delighted with this and whenever anybody came to visit   him begged them to handle the very door with caution and used to   repeat joness admonition in his tone and manner there was a large   mirror in the room on which he remarked that he thought his friends   were grown uncommonly assiduous in coming to see him but he soon   discovered that they only came to see themselves joness phrase of   tumultuous passions and the whole scene had put him into such   good humour that i verily believe that i owed to it a portion of his   good graces    when at newstead somebody by accident rubbed against one of his white   silk stockings one day before dinner of course the gentleman   apologised      sir answered matthews it may be all very well for you who have     a great many silk stockings to dirty other peoples but to me who     have only this one pair which i have put on in honour of the     abbot here no apology can compensate for such carelessness     besides the expense of washing    he had the same sort of droll sardonic way about every thing a wild   irishman named farrell one evening began to say something at a large   supper at cambridge matthews roared out silence and then pointing   to farrell cried out in the words of the oracle orson is endowed   with reason you may easily suppose that orson lost what reason he   had acquired on hearing this compliment when hobhouse published his   volume of poems the miscellany which matthews would call the   misssellany all that could be drawn from him was that the   preface was extremely like walsh hobhouse thought this at first a   compliment but we never could make out what it was 9 for all we   know of walsh is his ode to king william 10 and popes epithet of   knowing walsh 11 when the newstead party broke up for london   hobhouse and matthews who were the greatest friends possible agreed   for a whim to walk together to town they quarrelled by the way   and actually walked the latter half of the journey occasionally   passing and repassing without speaking when matthews had got to   highgate he had spent all his money but threepence halfpenny and   determined to spend that also in a pint of beer which i believe he   was drinking before a publichouse as hobhouse passed him still   without speaking for the last time on their route they were   reconciled in london again    one of matthewss passions was the fancy and he sparred uncommonly   well but he always got beaten in rows or combats with the bare fist   in swimming too he swam well but with effort and labour and   too high out of the water so that scrope davies 1 and myself of   whom he was therein somewhat emulous always told him that he would be   drowned if ever he came to a difficult pass in the water he was so   but surely scrope and myself would have been most heartily glad that            the dean had lived     and our prediction proved a lie    his head was uncommonly handsome very like what popes was in his   youth    his voice and laugh and features are strongly resembled by his   brother henrys if henry be he of kings college his passion for   boxing was so great that he actually wanted me to match him with   dogherty 13 whom i had backed and made the match for against tom   belcher 14 and i saw them spar together at my own lodgings with   the gloves on as he was bent upon it i would have backed dogherty to   please him but the match went off it was of course to have been a   private fight in a private room    on one occasion being too late to go home and dress he was equipped   by a friend mr baillie i believe in a magnificently fashionable   and somewhat exaggerated shirt and neckcloth he proceeded to the   opera and took his station in fops alley during the interval   between the opera and the ballet an acquaintance took his station by   him and saluted him      come round said matthews come round      why should i come round said the other you have only to turn     your headi am close by you      that is exactly what i cannot do said matthews dont you see     the state i am in    pointing to his buckram shirt collar and inflexible cravatand there   he stood with his head always in the same perpendicular position   during the whole spectacle    one evening after dining together as we were going to the opera i   happened to have a spare opera ticket as subscriber to a box and   presented it to matthews      now sir said he to hobhouse afterwards this i call courteous     in the abbotanother man would never have thought that i might do     better with half a guinea than throw it to a doorkeeperbut here     is a man not only asks me to dinner but gives me a ticket for the     theatre    these were only his oddities for no man was more liberal or more   honourable in all his doings and dealings than matthews he gave   hobhouse and me before we set out for constantinople a most splendid   entertainment to which we did ample justice one of his fancies was   dining at all sorts of outoftheway places somebody popped upon him   in i know not what coffeehouse in the strandand what do you think   was the attraction why that he paid a shilling i think to dine   with his hat on this he called his hat house and used to boast   of the comfort of being covered at meal times    when sir henry smith 15 was expelled from cambridge for a row with a   tradesman named hiron matthews solaced himself with shouting under   hirons windows every evening      ah me what perils do environ     the man who meddles with hot hiron    he was also of that band of profane scoffers who under the auspices   of used to rouse lort mansel late bishop of bristol from his   slumbers in the lodge of trinity and when he appeared at the window   foaming with wrath and crying out i know you gentlemen i know   you were wont to reply we beseech thee to hear us good   lortgood lort deliver us lort was his christian name as he   was very free in his speculations upon all kinds of subjects although   by no means either dissolute or intemperate in his conduct and as i   was no less independent our conversation and correspondence used to   alarm our friend hobhouse to a considerable degree    you must be almost tired of my packets

his sister    london may 22 1809    my deari must begin with giving you a few particulars of the   singular place which i have lately quitted    newstead abbey is situate 136 miles from londonfour on this side   mansfield it is so fine a piece of antiquity that i should think   there must be a description and perhaps a picture of it in grose   the ancestors of its present owner came into possession of it at the   time of the dissolution of the monasteriesbut the building itself   is of a much earlier date though sadly fallen to decay it is still   completely an abbey and most part of it is still standing in the   same state as when it was first built there are two tiers of   cloisters with a variety of cells and rooms about them which though   not inhabited nor in an inhabitable state might easily be made so   and many of the original rooms amongst which is a fine stone hall   are still in use of the abbey church only one end remains and the   old kitchen with a long range of apartments is reduced to a heap of   rubbish leading from the abbey to the modern part of the habitation   is a noble room seventy feet in length and twentythree in breadth   but every part of the house displays neglect and decay save those   which the present lord has lately fitted up    the house and gardens are entirely surrounded by a wall with   battlements in front is a large lake bordered here and there with   castellated buildings the chief of which stands on an eminence at the   further extremity of it fancy all this surrounded with bleak and   barren hills with scarce a tree to be seen for miles except a   solitary clump or two and you will have some idea of newstead for   the late lord being at enmity with his son to whom the estate was   secured by entail resolved out of spite to the same that the estate   should descend to him in as miserable a plight as he could possibly   reduce it to for which cause he took no care of the mansion and   fell to lopping of every tree he could lay his hands on so furiously   that he reduced immense tracts of woodland country to the desolate   state i have just described however his son died before him so that   all his rage was thrown away    so much for the place concerning which i have thrown together these   few particulars meaning my account to be like the place itself   without any order or connection but if the place itself appear rather   strange to you the ways of the inhabitants will not appear much less   so ascend then with me the hall steps that i may introduce you to   my lord and his visitants but have a care how you proceed be mindful   to go there in broad daylight and with your eyes about you for   should you make any blundershould you go to the right of the hall   steps you are laid hold of by a bear and should you go to the left   your case is still worse for you run full against a wolfnor when   you have attained the door is your danger over for the hall being   decayed and therefore standing in need of repair a bevy of inmates   are very probably banging at one end of it with their pistols so that   if you enter without giving loud notice of your approach you have   only escaped the wolf and the bear to expire by the pistolshots of   the merry monks of newstead    our party consisted of lord byron and four others and was now and   then increased by the presence of a neighbouring parson as for our   way of living the order of the day was generally thisfor   breakfast we had no set hour but each suited his own convenience  everything remaining on the table till the whole party had done   though had one wished to breakfast at the early hour of ten one would   have been rather lucky to find any of the servants up our average   hour of rising was one i who generally got up between eleven and   twelve was alwayseven when an invalidthe first of the party   and was esteemed a prodigy of early rising it was frequently past two   before the breakfast party broke up then for the amusements of the   morning there was reading fencing singlestick or shuttlecock in   the great room practising with pistols in the hall   walkingridingcricketsailing on the lake playing with the bear   or teasing the wolf between seven and eight we dined and our evening   lasted from that time till one two or three in the morning the   evening diversions may be easily conceived    i must not omit the custom of handing round after dinner on the   removal of the cloth a human skull filled with burgundy after   revelling on choice viands and the finest wines of france we   adjourned to tea where we amused ourselves with reading or improving   conversationeach according to his fancyand after sandwiches   etc retired to rest a set of monkish dresses which had been   provided with all the proper apparatus of crosses beads tonsures    etc often gave a variety to our appearance and to our pursuits    you may easily imagine how chagrined i was at being ill nearly the

fear which induced byron to agree to the separation but that on the contrary he was ready to go into court  the staunchest of byrons friends hobhouse was also the most sensible and candid as such byron valued him talking to lady blessington at genoa in 1823 he said conversations p 93 that hobhouse was    the most impartial or perhaps added he unpartial of my   friends he always told me my faults but i must do him the justice to   add that he told them to me and not to others  on another occasion he said p 172    if friendship as most people imagine consists in telling one   truthunvarnished unadorned truthhe is indeed a friend yet hang   it i must be candid and say i have had many other and more   agreeable proofs of hobhouses friendship than the truths he always   told me but the fact is i wanted him to sugar them over a little   with flattery as nurses do the physic given to children and he never   would and therefore i have never felt quite content with him though

author of   percival and aubrey i am sufficiently repaid by his praise   though our periodical censors have been uncommonly lenient i confess   a tribute from a man of acknowledged genius is still more flattering   but i am afraid i should forfeit all claim to candour if i did not   decline such praise as i do not deserve and this is i am sorry to   say the case in the present instance    my compositions speak for themselves and must stand or fall by their   own worth or demerit thus far i feel highly gratified by your   favourable opinion but my pretensions to virtue are unluckily so few

honour has and i trust   ever will prevent me from disgracing my name by a mean or cowardly   action i have been already held up as the votary of licentiousness   and the disciple of infidelity how

requesting his bill might be paid from the balance of the   quarter you obliged me by advancing if he has received this you will   further oblige me by paying what remains i believe somewhere about   five pounds if so much    you will confer a favour upon me by the loan of twenty i will   endeavour to repay it next week as i have immediate occasion for that   sum and i should not require it of you could i obtain it elsewhere    i am now in my one and twentieth year and cannot command as many   pounds to cambridge i cannot go without paying my bills and at   present i could as soon compass the national debt in london i must   not remain nor shall i when i can procure a trifle to take me out of   it home i have none and if there was a possibility of getting out of   the country i would gladly avail myself of it but even that is   denied me my debts amount to three thousand three hundred to jews   eight hundred to mrs b of nottingham to coachmaker and other   tradesmen a thousand more and these must be much increased before   they are lessened    such is the prospect before me which is by no means brightened by   illhealth i would have called on you but i have neither spirits to   enliven myself or others or inclination to bring a gloomy face to   spoil a group of happy ones i remain    your obliged and obedt sert    byron    psyour answer to the former part will oblige as

visit in his letter he mentions a very old friend of yours who   told him he would join my party if i could inform him on what day i   meant to go over this friend you will readily conclude to be a lord   b but not the one who now addresses you shall i bring him to you   and insure a welcome for myself which perhaps might not otherwise be   the case this will not be for a fortnight to come i am waiting for   long who is now at chatham when he arrives we shall probably drive   down and dine with drury    i confess harrow has lost most of its charms for me i do not know if   delawarr is still there but with the exception of yourself and the   earl i shall find myself among strangers long has a brother at   butlers and all his predilections remain in full force mine are   weakened if not destroyed and though i can safely say i never knew   a friend out of harrow i question whether i have one left in it you   leave harrow in july may i ask what is your future destination    in january 1809 i shall be twenty one  in the spring of the same   year proceed abroad not on the usual tour but a route of a more   extensive description what say you are you disposed for a view of   the peloponnesus and a voyage through the archipelago i am merely in   jest with regard to you but very serious with regard to my own   intention which is fixed on the pilgrimage unless some political   view or accident induce me to postpone it adieu if you have leisure   i shall be as happy to hear from you as i would have been to have   seen you believe me    yours very truly    byron    footnote 1

accept my written acknowledgments for the   compliment you were pleased to pay some production of my unlucky muse   last novemberi am induced to do this not less from the pleasure i   feel in the praise of an old schoolfellow than from justice to you   for i had heard the story with some slight variations indeed when we   met this morning wingfield 2 had not undeceived me but he will   tell you that i displayed no resentment in mentioning what i had   heard though i was not sorry to discover the truth perhaps you   hardly recollect some years ago a short though for the time a   warm friendship between us why it was not of longer duration i know   not i have still a gift of yours in my possession that must always   prevent me from forgetting it i also remember being favoured with the   perusal of many of your compositions and several other circumstances   very pleasant in their day which i will not force upon your memory   but entreat you to believe me with much regret at their short   continuance and a hope they are not irrevocable    yours very sincerely etc    byron    footnote 1 william harness 17901869 son of dr j harness commissioner of the transport board was

having told me in three successive letters   of mr harnesss chapel at hampstead i understand he now lives a very   retired life  the friendships of mary russell mitford vol i p 61 from 1826 to 1844 he was incumbent of regent square chapel minister of brompton chapel 184447 perpetual curate 184969 of all saints knightsbridge which he built from subscriptions raised by himself he is described by crabb robinson diary vol iii p 212 as    a clergyman with oxford propensities and a worshipper of the heathen   muses as well as of the christian graces  and again iii 326 as    a man of taste of high church principles and liberal in spirit  miss mitford the friendships of mary russell mitford vol ii p 289 writes that    he has neither catholic nor puseyite tendenciesonly it is a large   and liberal mind like bishop stanleys believing good men and good   christians may exist among papists and will be as safe there as if   they were protestants  again vol ii p 295 she says of him    besides his varied accomplishments and his admirable goodness and   kindness he has all sorts of amusing peculiarities with a temper   never known to fail an indulgence the largest a tenderness as of a   woman he has the habit of talking like a cynic and with more   learning ancient and modern and a wider grasp of literature than   almost any one i know professes to read nothing and care for nothing   but shakespeare and the bible he is the finest reader of both that   i ever heard his preaching which has been so much admired is too   rapid but his reading the prayers is perfection the best parish   priest in london and the truest christian  miss mitfords praise may be exaggerated but she had known harness for a lifetime  harness edited shakespeare 1825 8 vols as well as massinger 1830 and ford 1831 wrote for the quarterly and blackwood and published a number of sermons including the wrath of cain a boyle lecture 1822 he wrote the life of mary russell mitford 1870 in collaboration with the rev a g lestrange whose life of the rev w harness is the chief authority for his career  his friendship with byron began at harrow life pp 23 24 where byron who was older than harness took pity upon his lameness and weakness and protected him from the bullies of the school at a later period they became estranged as is shown by the following letter from byron to harness life pp 24 25    we both seem perfectly to recollect with a mixture of pleasure and   regret the hours we once passed together and i assure you most   sincerely they are numbered among the happiest of my brief chronicle   of enjoyment i am now getting into years that is to say i was   twenty a month ago and another year will send me into the world to   run my career of folly with the rest i was then just fourteenyou   were almost the first of my harrow friends certainly the first in   my esteem if not in date but an absence from harrow for some time   shortly after and new connections on your side and the difference in   our conduct an advantage decidedly in your favour from that   turbulent and riotous disposition of mine which impelled me into   every species of mischiefall these circumstances combined to   destroy an intimacy which affection urged me to continue and memory   compels me to regret but there is not a circumstance attending that   period hardly a sentence we exchanged which is not impressed on my   mind at this moment i need not say morethis assurance alone must   convince you had i considered them as trivial they would have been   less indelible how well i recollect the perusal of your first   flights there is another circumstance you do not knowthe first   lines i ever attempted at harrow were addressed to you you were to   have seen them but sinclair had the copy in his possession when we   went homeand on our return we were strangers they were   destroyed and certainly no great loss but you will perceive from   this circumstance my opinions at an age when we cannot be hypocrites    i have dwelt longer on this theme than i intended and i shall now   conclude with what i ought to have begun we were once friendsnay   we have always been so for our separation was the effect of chance   not of dissension i do not know how far our destinations in life may   throw us together but if opportunity and inclination allow you to   waste a thought on such a harebrained being as myself you will find   me at least sincere and not so bigoted to my faults as to involve   others in the consequences will you sometimes write to me i do not   ask it often and if we meet let us be what we should be and what   we were  the following is harnesss own account of the circumstances in which letter 92 was written    a coolness afterwards arose which byron alludes to in the first of   the accompanying letters and we never spoke during the last year of   his remaining at school nor till after the publication of his hours   of idleness lord byron was then at cambridge i in one of the upper   forms at harrow in an english theme i happened to quote from the   volume and mention it with praise it was reported to byron that i   had on the contrary spoken slightingly of his work and of himself   for the purpose of conciliating the favour of dr butler the master   who had been severely satirised in one of the poems wingfield who   was afterwards lord powerscourt a mutual friend of byron and myself   disabused him of the error into which he had been led and this was   the occasion of the first letter of the collection our intimacy was   renewed and continued from that time till his going abroad whatever   faults lord byron might have had towards others to myself he was   always uniformly affectionate i have many slights and neglects   towards him to reproach myself with but i cannot call to mind a   single instance of caprice or unkindness in the whole course of our   friendship to allege against him  in december 1811 harness paid byron a visit at newstead the only other guest being francis hodgson who like harness was not then ordained he thus describes the visit life of the rev francis hodgson vol i pp 219221    when byron returned with the ms of the first two cantos of childe   harold in his portmanteau i paid him a visit at newstead it was   winterdark dreary weatherthe snow upon the ground and a   straggling gloomy depressive partially inhabited place the abbey   was those rooms however which had been fitted up for residence were   so comfortably appointed glowing with crimson hangings and cheerful   with capacious fires that one soon lost the melancholy feeling of   being domiciled in the wing of an extensive ruin many tales are   related or fabled of the orgies which in the poets early youth had   made clamorous these ancient halls of the byrons i can only say that   nothing in the shape of riot or excess occurred when i was there the   only other visitor was dr hodgson the translator of juvenal and   nothing could be more quiet and regular than the course of our days   byron was retouching as the sheets passed through the press the   stanzas of childe harold hodgson was at work in getting out the   ensuing number of the monthly review of which he was principal   editor i was reading for my degree when we met our general talk was   of poets and poetryof who could or who could not write but it   occasionally rose into very serious discussions on religion byron   from his early education in scotland had been taught to identify the   principles of christianity with the extreme dogmas of calvinism his   mind had thus imbibed a most miserable prejudice which appeared to be   the only obstacle to his hearty acceptance of the gospel of this   error we were most anxious to disabuse him the chief weight of the   argument rested with hodgson who was older a good deal than myself   i cannot even nowat a distance of more than fifty yearsrecall   those conversations without a deep feeling of admiration for the   judicious zeal and affectionate earnestness often speaking with tears   in his eyes which dr hodgson evinced in his advocacy of the truth   the only difference except perhaps in the subjects talked about   between our life at newstead abbey and that of the great families   around us was the hours we kept it was as i have said winter and   the days were cold and as nothing tempted us to rise early we got   up late this flung the routine of the day rather backward and we did   not go early to bed my visit to newstead lasted about three weeks   when i returned to cambridge to take my degree  to harness byron intended to dedicate childe harold but feared to do so lest it should injure him in his profession   footnote 2 three wingfields sons of lord powerscourt entered harrow in february 1801 the hon richard wingfield succeeded his father as fifth viscount powerscourt in 1809 and died in 1823 edward became a clergyman and died of cholera in 1825 john byrons friend the alonzo of childish recollections entered the coldstream guards and died of fever at coimbra may 14 1811    of all human beings i was perhaps at one time most attached to poor   wingfield who died at coimbra 1811 before i returned to england  life p 21 to his memory byron wrote the lines in childe harold canto i stanza xci      93to j ridge     mr

still retain your   predilection and that the public allow me some share of praise i am   of so much importance that a most violent attack is preparing for me   in the next number of the edinburgh review 2 this i had from the   authority of a friend who has seen the proof and manuscript of the   critique you know the system of the edinburgh gentlemen is universal   attack they praise none and neither the public nor the author   expects praise from them it is however something to be noticed as   they profess to pass judgment only on works requiring the public   attention you will see this when it comes outit is i understand   of the most unmerciful description but i am aware of it and hope   you will not be hurt by its severity    tell mrs byron not to be out of humour with them and to prepare her   mind for the greatest hostility on their part it will do no injury   whatever and i trust her mind will not be ruffled they defeat their   object by indiscriminate abuse and they never praise except the   partisans of lord holland and co 3 it is nothing to be abused when   southey moore lauderdale strangford and payne knight share the   same fate 4    i am sorrybut childish recollections must be suppressed during   this edition i have altered at your suggestion the obnoxious   allusions in the sixth stanza of my last ode    and now my dear becher i must return my best acknowledgments for the   interest you have taken in me and my poetical bantlings and i shall   ever be proud to show how much i esteem the advice and the   adviser    believe me most truly etc

chairman of newark quarter sessions in 1816 in all matters relating to the condition of the poor he made himself an acknowledged authority he was the originator of a house of correction a friendly society and a workhouse at southwell he was one of the supervisors appointed to organize the milbank penitentiary which was opened in june 1816 on friendly societies he published three works 1824 1825 and 1826 in which inter alia he sought to prove that labourers paying sixpence a week from the time they were twenty could secure not only sickpay but an annuity of five shillings a week at the age of sixtyfive his antipauper system 1828 pointed to indoor relief as the true cure to pauperism it was by bechers advice that byron destroyed his fugitive pieces no one who has read the silly verses which becher condemned can doubt that the counsel was wise see byrons lines to becher poems vol i pp 112114 114116 247251 the following are the lines in which becher expostulated with byron on the mischievous tendency of his verses    say byron why compel me to deplore   talents designed for choice poetic lore   deigning to varnish scenes that shun the day   with guilty lustre and with amorous

atoms by the ereview it is just out and has completely   demolished my little fabric of fame this is rather scurvy treatment   for a whig review but politics and poetry are different things and i   am no adept in either i therefore submit in silence  among the less sentimental effects of this review upon byrons mind he used to mention that on the day he read it he drank three bottles of claret to his own share after dinner that nothing however relieved him till he had given vent to his indignation in rhyme and that after the first twenty lines he felt himself considerably better moore life p 69    i was sitting with charles lamb h crabb robinson told de morgan   when wordsworth came in with fume in his countenance and the   edinburgh review in his hand      i have no patience with these reviewers he said here is a young     man a lord and a minor it appears who publishes a little volume     of poetry and these fellows attack him as if no one may write     poetry unless he lives in a garret the young man will do something     if he goes on    when i became acquainted with lady byron i told her this story and   she said      ah if byron had known that he would never have attacked     wordsworth he once went out to dinner where wordsworth was to be     when he came home i said        well how did the young poet get on with the old one        to tell you the truth said he i had

rousseau and madame de stael used to say so too in 1813 and the   edinburgh review has something of the sort in its critique on the   fourth canto of childe harold i cant see any point of   resemblancehe wrote prose i verse he was of the people i of the   aristocracy he was a philosopher i am none he published his first   work at forty i mine at eighteen his first essay brought him   universal applause mine the contrary he married his housekeeper i   could not keep house with my wife he thought all the world in a plot   against him my little world seems to think me in a plot against it   if i may judge by their abuse in print and coterie he liked botany i   like flowers herbs and trees but know nothing of their pedigrees   he wrote music i limit my knowledge of it to what i catch by eari   never could learn any thing by study not even a languageit was   all by rote and ear and memory he had a bad memory i had at   least an excellent one ask hodgson the poeta good judge for he   has an astonishing one he wrote with hesitation and care i with   rapidity and rarely with pains he could never ride nor swim nor   was cunning of fence i am an excellent swimmer a decent though   not at all a dashing rider having staved in a rib at eighteen in   the course of scampering and was sufficient of fence particularly   of the highland broadswordnot a bad boxer when i could keep my   temper which was difficult but which i strove to do ever since i   knocked down mr purling and put his kneepan out with the gloves   on in angelos and jacksons rooms in 1806 during the sparring   and i was besides a very fair cricketerone of the harrow   eleven when we played against eton in 1805 besides rousseaus way   of life his country his manners his whole character were so very   different that i am at a loss to conceive how such a comparison could   have arisen as it has done three several times and all in rather a   remarkable manner i forgot to say that he was also shortsighted   and that hitherto my eyes have been the contrary to such a degree   that in the largest theatre of bologna i distinguished and read some   busts and inscriptions painted near the stage from a box so distant   and so darkly lighted that none of the company composed of young   and very brighteyed people some of them in the same box could make   out a letter and thought it was a trick though i had never been in   that theatre before    altogether i think myself justified in thinking the comparison not   well founded i dont say this out of pique for rousseau was a great   man and the thing if true were flattering enoughbut i have no   idea of being pleased with the chimera   footnote 2 the hon mrs george byron née frances levett byrons greataunt widow of the hon george byron

1836 and in 1840 provost of eton at eton he died december 29 1852  hodgsons literary facility was extraordinary he rhymed with an ease which almost rivals that of byron and from 1807 to 1818 he poured out quantities of verse english and latin original and translated besides writing articles for the quarterly the monthly and the critical reviews he published his translation of juvenal in 1807 in which he was assisted by drury and merivale lady jane grey a tale and other poems 1809 sir edgar a tale 1810 leaves of laurel 1812 charlemagne an epic poem 1815 translated from the original of lucien

acquaintance with byron began in 1807 when byron was meditating british bards and hodgson provoked by a review of his juvenal in the edinburgh review was composing his gentle alterative prepared for the reviewers which appears on pp 56 57 of lady jane grey there are some curious points of resemblance between the two poems though hodgsons lines can hardly be compared for force and sting to english bards and scotch reviewers like byron see english bards etc line 513 note 7 he makes merry over the blunder of the edinburgh reviewer who in an article on payne knights principles of taste severely criticized some greek lines which he attributed to knight but which in fact were by pindar    and when he frownd on kns erroneous greek   bad him in pindars page that error seek  like byron also he attributes the blunder to hallam and speaks of hallams baffled art the article was written by lord hollands physician dr allen who according to sydney smith had the creed of a philosopher and the legs

left by his first will 1811 onethird of his personal goods and in 1813 gave £1000 to enable him to marry hodgson corresponded with mrs leigh and with miss milbanke afterwards lady byron endeavoured to heal the breach between husband and wife and was one of the mourners at hucknall torkard church  in haydons tabletalk vol ii pp 3678 is recorded a conversation with hobhouse on the subject of hodgson haydons account of hobhouses words is confused but he definitely asserts that hodgsons life was dissipated and insinuates that he perverted byrons character part of the explanation is probably this hodgsons friend the rev robert bland kept a mistress described as a woman of great personal and mental attraction he asked hodgson during his absence on the continent to visit the lady and send him frequent news of her hodgson did so with the result that at blands return the lady refused to see him when byron came back from his eastern tour he received a frantic letter from bland telling him that hodgson had stolen her love to this byron refers in his letter to harness december 15 1811 and probably told an embellished story to hobhouse but hodgson himself warmly repudiated the charge and there is no reason to think that his version of the affair is not the truth   footnote 2 the rev henry drury married december 20 1808 ann caroline daughter of archdale wilson tayler of boreham wood

views of canning and his friends as editor of the quarterly review from its foundation february 1809 to his resignation in september 1824 he did yeomans service to sound literature by his good sense and adherence to the best models it was a period when all criticism was narrow and to some degree warped by political prejudice in these respects giffords work may not have risen aboveit certainly did not fall belowthe highest standard of contemporary criticism his editions of massinger 1805 which superseded that of monck mason and davies 1765 of ben jonson 1816 of ford 1827 are valuable to his

conveyed he writes to him   in 1813 in the less tender text of the baviad or a monk mason   note to massinger would be obeyed  see also his letter september 7 1811 in which he calls gifford his magnus apollo and values his praise above the gems of samarcand    he was says sir walter scott diary january 18 1827 a little   man dumpled up together and so illmade as to seem almost deformed   but with a singular expression of talent in his countenance  byron was attracted to gifford partly by his devotion to the classical models of literature partly by the outspoken frankness of his literary criticism partly also perhaps by his physical deformity      103to john hanson     newstead abbey notts november 18th 1808     dear siri am truly glad to hear your health is reinstated as for   my

judgment will be more mature and i shall   still be young enough for politics with regard to expence travelling   through the east is rather inconvenient than expensive it is not like   the tour of

place mrs byron at newstead there is one great expence   saved i have no horses to keep a voyage to india will take me six   months and if i had a dozen attendants cannot cost me five hundred   pounds and you will agree with me that a like term of months in   england would lead me into four times that expenditure i have written   to government for letters and permission of the company so you see i   am serious    you honour my debts they amount to perhaps twelve thousand pounds   and i shall require perhaps three or four thousand at setting out   with credit on a bengal agent this you must manage for me if my   resources are not adequate to the supply i must sell but not   newstead i will at least transmit that to the next lord my debts   must be paid if possible in february i shall

nothing would gratify my vanity so much as the   reality even the idea is too precious to part with    i shall expect you here let me have no more excuses hobhouse desires   his best remembrance we are now lingering over our evening potations   i have extended my letter further than i ought and beg you will   excuse it on the opposite page i send you some stanzas 6 i wrote   off on being

me also yours very sincerely    byron    footnote 1 mrs byron also advised his marriage with an heiress the following passage is taken from her letter to hanson january 30 1809    i was sorry i could not see you here byron told me he intended to   put his servants on board wages at newstead i was very sorry to hear   of the great expence the newstead fête would put him to i can see   nothing but the road to ruin in all this which grieves me to the   heart and makes me still worse than i would otherwise be unless   indeed coal mines turn to gold mines or that he mends his fortune   in the old and usual way by marrying a woman with two or three hundred   thousand pounds i have no doubt of his being a great speaker and a   celebrated public character and all that but that wont add to   his fortune but bring on more expenses on him and there is nothing   to be had in this country to make a man rich in his line of life  in another letter to hanson dated march 4 1809 she returns to the same subject    i have had a very dismal letter from my son informing me that he is   ruined he wishes to borrow my money this i shall be very ready to   oblige him in on such security as you approve as it is my all   this is very necessary and i am sure he would not wish to have it on   any other terms it cannot be paid up however under six months   notice i wish he would take the debt of a thousand pounds that i   have been security for on himself and pay about eighty pounds he   owes here    i wish to god he would exert himself and retrieve his affairs he   must marry a woman of fortune this spring love matches is all   nonsense let him make use of the talents god has given him he is an   english peer and has all the privileges of that situation what is   this about proving his grandfathers marriage i thought it had been   in lancashire if it was not it surely easily can be proved is   nothing going forward concerning the rochdale property i am sure if   i was lord byron i would sell no estates to pay jews i only would   pay what was lawful pray answer the note immediately and answer all   my questions concerning lending the money the rochdale property and   why b dont or cant take his seat which is very hard and very   provoking    i am dear sir yours sincerely    c g byron      108to francis hodgson    newstead abbey notts dec 17 1808    my dear hodgsoni have just received your letter and one from b   drury 1 which i would send were it not too bulky to despatch   within a sheet of paper but i must impart the contents and consign   the answer to your care in the first place i cannot address the   answer to him because the epistle is without date or direction and   in the next the contents are so singular that i can scarce believe my   optics which are made the fools of the other senses or else worth   all the rest    a few weeks ago i wrote to our friend harry drury of facetious   memory to request he would prevail on his brother at eton to receive   the son of a citizen in london well known unto me as a pupil the   family having been particularly polite during the short time i was   with them induced me to this application now mark what follows as   somebody or southey sublimely saith on this day the 17th december   arrives an epistle signed b drury containing not the smallest   reference to tuition or intuition but a petition for robert   gregson 2 of pugilistic notoriety now in bondage for certain   paltry pounds sterling and liable to take up his everlasting abode in   banco regis had this letter been from any of my lay acquaintance   or in short from anyone but the gentleman whose signature it bears   i should have marvelled not if drury is serious i congratulate   pugilism on the acquisition of such a patron and shall be happy to   advance any sum necessary for the liberation of the captive gregson   but i certainly hope to be certified from you or some reputable   housekeeper of the fact before i write to drury on the subject when   i say the fact i mean of the letter being written by drury not   having any doubt as to the authenticity of the statement the letter   is now before me and i keep it for your perusal when i hear from you   i shall address my answer to him under your care for as it is now   the vacation at eton and the letter is without time or place i   cannot venture to consign my sentiments on so momentous a concern   to chance    to you my dear hodgson i have not much to say if you can make it   convenient or pleasant to trust yourself here be assured it will be   both to me    footnote 1

i think hargreaves will be gratified by the appearance   of the place and the humours of the day i shall on the first   opportunity pay my respects to your family and though i will not   trespass on your hospitality on the 22nd my obligation is not less   for your agreeable offer which on any other occasion would be   immediately accepted but i wish you much to be present at the   festivities and i hope you will add charles to the party consider   as the courtier says in the tragedy of tom thumb 2      this is a day your majesties may boast of it     and since it never can come oer tis fit you make the most of it    i shall take my seat as soon as circumstances will admit i have not   yet chosen my side in politics nor shall i hastily commit myself with   professions or pledge my support to any men or measures but though i   shall not run headlong into opposition i will studiously avoid a   connection with ministry i cannot say that my opinion is strongly in   favour of either party 3 on the one side we have the late   underlings of pitt possessing all his ill fortune without his   talents this may render their failure more excusable but will not   diminish the public contempt on the other we have the illassorted   fragments of a wornout minority mr windham with his coat twice   turned and my lord grenville who perhaps has more sense than he can   make good use of between the two and the shuttlecock of both a   sidmouth and the general football sir f burdett kicked at by all   and owned by none    i shall stand aloof speak what i think but not often nor too soon   i will preserve my independence if possible but if involved with a   party i will take care not to be the last or least in the ranks   as to patriotism the word is obsolete perhaps improperly so for   all men in the country are patriots knowing that their own existence   must stand or fall with the constitution yet everybody thinks he   could alter it for the better and govern a people who are in fact   easily governed but always claim the privilege of grumbling so much   for politics of which i at present know little and care less bye and   bye i shall use the senatorial privilege of talking and

to hear you like cambridge   firstly because to know that you are happy is pleasant to one who   wishes you all possible sublunary enjoyment and secondly i admire   the morality of the sentiment alma

seem indelicate but when i tell you a friend of   ours first refused to sit under the idea that he was to disburse on   the occasion you will see that it is necessary to state these   preliminaries to prevent the recurrence of any similar mistake i   shall see you in time and will carry you to the limner it   will be a tax on your patience for a week but pray excuse it as it   is possible the resemblance may be the sole trace i shall be able to   preserve of our past friendship and acquaintance just now it seems   foolish enough but in a few years when some of us are dead and   others are separated by inevitable circumstances it will be a kind of   satisfaction to retain in these images of the living the idea of our   former selves and to contemplate in the resemblances of the dead

and dice and the glorious uncertainty not only of good   luck or bad luck but of any luck at all as one had sometimes   to throw often to decide at all i have thrown as many as   fourteen mains running and carried off all the cash upon the table   occasionally but i had no coolness or judgment or calculation it   was the delight of the thing that pleased me upon the whole i left   off in

he never was afflicted with any serious malady that he was sober and temperate that he sometimes used much exercise and at others was of a studious and sedentary turn and thus concludes i do believe

just tied the property up in such a manner as   to prevent the practicability even if my inclination led me to   dispose of it but as such a report may render my tenants   uncomfortable i will feel very much obliged if you will be good   enough to contradict the rumour should it come to your ears on my   authority i rather conjecture it has arisen from the sale of some   copyholds of mine in norfolk 2 i sail for gibraltar in june and   thence to malta when of course you shall have the promised detail i   saw your friend thornhill last night who spoke of you as a friend   ought to do

of ready money and a hundred thousand a year before he was seventeen he wrote his biographical memoirs of extraordinary painters designed as a satire on the vies des peintres flamands memoirs of william beckford by cyrus redding vol i p 96 his travels 177782 in switzerland the low countries and italy are described in his dreams waking thoughts and incidents in a series of letters from various parts of europe published anonymously in 1783 and reprinted with additions and omissions in 1834 and 1840 in the previous year he had written vathek in french in three days and two nights without as he says taking off his clothes the severe application made me very ill this statement if made by beckford as redding implies is untrue evidence exists to prove that vathek was a careful and elaborate composition the book was published with his name in 1787 but a translation made and printed without his leave had already 1784 appeared and was often mistaken for the original in 1783 he married lady margaret gordon with whom he lived in switzerland till her death in 1786 one of his two daughtershe had no sonbecame mrs orde the other the duchess of hamilton from 1787 to 1791 and again from 1794 to 1796 he visited portugal and spain and to this period belong his sketches of spain and portugal 1834 and his recollections of an excursion to the monasteries of alobaca and batalha 1835 between his two visits to portugal on the last of which he occupied the retreat at cintra celebrated by byron childe harold canto i stanzas xviiixxii he saw the destruction of the bastille bought gibbons library at lausanne in 1796 and shutting himself up in it for six weeks from early in the morning until night only now and then taking a ride read himself nearly blind cyrus reddings recollections of the author of vathek new monthly magazine vol lxxi p 307 he also wrote two burlesque novels to ridicule it is said those written by his sister mrs henry azemia a descriptive and sentimental novel by jacquetta agneta mariana jenks of bellgrove priory in wales 1796 and modern novelwriting or the elegant enthusiast by the rt hon lady harriet marlow1797 he represented wells from 1784 to 1790 and hindon from 1806 to 1820 but took no part in political life he was now settled at fonthill 17961822 absorbed in collecting books pictures and engravings laying out the grounds indulging his architectural extravagances and shutting himself and his palace out from the world by a gigantic wall when rogers visited him at fonthill and arrived at the gate he was told that neither his servant nor his horses could be admitted but that mr beckfords attendants and horses would be at his service recollections of the tabletalk of samuel rogers p 217 beckford had been taught music by mozart and rogers says ibid that in the evening beckford would amuse us by reading one of his unpublished works or he would extemporize on the pianoforte producing the most novel and charming melodies  in 1822 his gigantic fortune had dwindled he was in embarrassed circumstances fonthill and most of its contents were sold and beckford settled in lansdowne terrace bath where he still collected books and works of art laid out the grounds and built the tower on lansdowne hill which are now the property of the city at bath he died in 1844  vathek is a masterpiece which as an eastern tale is unrivalled in european literature    for correctness of costume says byron in one of his diaries   beauty of description and power of imagination it far surpasses all   european imitations and bears such marks of originality that those   who have visited the east will find some difficulty in believing it to   be a translation as an eastern tale even rasselas must bow before   it his happy valley will not bear a comparison with the hall of   eblis  beckfords letters are in their way equally masterpieces and like vathek have the appearance of being struck off without labour reprinted as their writer says preface to the edition of 1840 because some justly admired authors condescended to glean a few stray thoughts from these letters they suggest in some respects comparison with byrons own work there is the same prodigality of power the same simple nervous style the same vein of melancholy the same cynical contempt for mankind in both writers there is a passionate feeling for the grander aspects of nature though beckford was also thrilled as byron was not by the beauties of art in both there are similar inconsistencies and incongruities of temperament and the same vein of reckless selfindulgence appears to run by the side of nobler enthusiasms in both there is a taste for oriental magnificence which in beckford was to some degree corrected by his artistic perceptions both finally described not so much the objects they saw as the impression which those objects produced on themselves and thus steeped their pictures clear and vivid though they are in an atmosphere of their own personality  footnote 3 william third viscount courtenay died unmarried in 1835 and with him the viscountcy became extinct in 1831 he proved before parliament his title to the earldom of

to seville and cadiz and thence in the hyperion   frigate to gibraltar the horses are excellentwe rode seventy miles   a day eggs and wine and hard beds are all the accommodation we   found and in such torrid weather quite enough my health is better   than in england    seville is a fine town and the sierra morena part of which we   crossed a very sufficient mountain but damn description it is   always disgusting cadiz sweet cadiz 1it is the first spot in   the creation the beauty of its streets and mansions is only excelled   by the loveliness of its inhabitants for with all national   prejudice i must confess the women of cadiz are as far superior to   the english women in beauty as the spaniards are inferior to the   english in every quality that dignifies the name of man just as i   began to know the principal persons of the city i was obliged to   sail    you will not expect a long letter after my riding so far on hollow   pampered jades of asia talking of asia puts me in mind of africa   which is within five miles of my present residence i am going over   before i go on to constantinople    cadiz is a complete cythera many of the grandees who have left madrid   during the troubles reside there and i do believe it is the prettiest   and cleanest town in europe london is filthy in the comparison the   spanish women are all alike their education the same the wife of a

and a barrister of the middle temple was knighted by the duke of bedford as viceroy of ireland about 1807 he published the fury of discord a poem 1803 the seaside hero a drama in 3 acts 1804 and poems1809 but he is best known by his travels which gained him the nickname of jaunting carr and considerable profit the stranger in france 1803 was bought by johnson for £100 a northern summer or travels round the baltic etc1805 the stranger in ireland 1806 and a tour through holland1807 were bought for £500 £700 and £600 respectively by sir richard phillips who but for the ridicule cast upon carr by edward dubois in my pocket book or hints for a ryhte merrie and conceited tour in quarto to be called the stranger in ireland in 1805 by a knight errant would have given £600 for his caledonian sketches 1808 in spite however of this proof of damages the jury found in carrs action against messrs hood and sharpe the publishers of my pocket book that the criticism was fair and justifiable 1808 carr published in 1811 his descriptive travels in the southern and eastern parts of spain without mentioning byrons name byron concluded his ms of childe harold canto i with three

had so kindly invited him what the   vengeance said the servant dont you know dean swift at which   the barber turned pale and running into the house fell upon his   knees and intreated the dean not to put him into print for that he   was a poor barber had a large family to maintain and if his   reverence put him into black and white he should lose all his   customers swift laughed heartily at

welltimed aid and were my poor friend bland alive he would as   gladly bear the like testimonythough i have most reason of all   men to do so  moore      128to his mother     gibraltar august 11th 1809     dear motheri have been so much occupied since my departure from   england that till i could address you at length i have forborne   writing altogether as i have now passed through portugal and a   considerable part of spain and have leisure at this place i shall   endeavour to give you a short detail of my movements    we sailed from falmouth on the 2nd of july reached lisbon after a   very favourable passage of four days and a half and took up our abode   in that city it has been often described without being worthy of   description for except the view from the tagus which is beautiful   and some fine churches and convents it contains little but filthy   streets and more filthy inhabitants to make amends for this the   village of cintra about fifteen miles from the capital is perhaps   in every respect the most delightful in europe it contains beauties   of every description natural and artificial palaces and gardens   rising in the midst of rocks cataracts and precipices convents on   stupendous heightsa distant view of the sea and the tagus and   besides though that is a secondary consideration is remarkable as   the scene of sir hew dalrymples convention1 it unites in itself   all the wildness of the western highlands with the verdure of the   south of france near this place about ten miles to the right is the   palace of mafra the boast of portugal as it might be of any other   country in point of magnificence without elegance there is a convent   annexed the monks who possess large revenues are courteous enough   and understand latin so that we had a long conversation they have a   large library and asked me if the english had any books in their   country    i sent my baggage and part of the servants by sea to gibraltar and   travelled on horseback from aldea galbega the first stage from   lisbon which is only accessible by water to seville one of the most   famous cities in spain where the government called the junta is now   held the distance to seville is nearly four hundred miles and to   cadiz almost ninety farther towards the coast i had orders from the   governments and every possible accommodation on the road as an   english nobleman in an english uniform is a very respectable   personage in spain at present the horses are remarkably good and the   roads i assure you upon my honour for you will hardly believe it   very far superior to the best english roads without the smallest toll   or turnpike you will suppose this when i rode post to seville in   four days through this parching country in the midst of summer   without fatigue or annoyance    seville is a beautiful town though the streets are narrow they are   clean we lodged in the house of two spanish unmarried ladies who   possess six houses in seville and gave me a curious specimen of   spanish manners they are women of character and the eldest a fine   woman the youngest pretty but not so good a figure as donna josepha   the freedom of manner which is general here astonished me not a   little and in the course of further observation i find that reserve   is not the characteristic of the spanish belles who are in general   very handsome with large black eyes and very fine forms the eldest   honoured your unworthy son with very particular attention embracing   him with great tenderness at parting i was there but three days   after cutting off a lock of his hair and presenting him with one of   her own about three feet in length which i send and beg you will   retain till my return her last words were adios tu hermoso me   gusto muchoadieu you pretty fellow you please me much she   offered me a share of her apartment which my virtue induced me to   decline she laughed and said i had some english amante lover   and added that she was going to be married to an officer in the   spanish army    i left seville and rode on to cadiz through a beautiful country at   xeres where the sherry we drink is made i met a great merchanta   mr gordon of scotlandwho was extremely polite and favoured me with   the inspection of his vaults and cellars so that i quaffed at the   fountain head    cadiz sweet cadiz is the most delightful town i ever beheld very   different from our english cities in every respect except cleanliness   and it is as clean as london but still beautiful and full of the   finest women in spain the cadiz belles being the lancashire witches   of their land just as i was introduced and began to like the   grandees i was forced to leave it for this cursed place but before i   return to england i will visit it again the night before i left it i   sat in the box at the opera with admiral cordovas family 2 he is   the commander whom lord st vincent defeated in 1797 and has an aged   wife and a fine daughter sennorita cordova the girl is very pretty   in the spanish style in my opinion by no means inferior to the   english in charms and certainly superior in fascination long black   hair dark languishing eyes clear olive complexions and forms more   graceful in motion than can be conceived by an englishman used to the   drowsy listless air of his countrywomen added to the most becoming   dress and at the same time the most decent in the world render a   spanish beauty irresistible    i beg leave to observe that intrigue here is the business of life   when a woman marries she throws off all restraint but i believe their   conduct is chaste enough before if you make a proposal which in   england will bring a box on the ear from the meekest of virgins to a   spanish girl she thanks you for the honour you intend her and   replies wait till i am married and i shall be too happy this is   literally and strictly true    miss cordova and her little brother understood a little french and   after regretting my ignorance of the spanish she proposed to become   my preceptress in that language i could only reply by a low bow and   express my regret that i quitted cadiz too soon to permit me to make   the progress which would doubtless attend my studies under so charming   a directress i was standing at the back of the box which resembles   our opera boxes the theatre is large and finely decorated the music   admirable in the manner which englishmen generally adopt for fear   of incommoding the ladies in front when this fair spaniard   dispossessed an old woman an aunt or a duenna of her chair and   commanded me to be seated next herself at a tolerable distance from   her mamma at the close of the performance i withdrew and was   lounging with a party of men in the passage when en

am well i have been in malta 1 a short time and   have found the inhabitants hospitable and pleasant    this letter is committed to the charge of a very extraordinary woman   whom you have doubtless heard of mrs spencer smith of whose escape   the marquis de salvo published a narrative a few years ago 2 she   has since been shipwrecked and her life has been from its   commencement so fertile in remarkable incidents that in a romance   they would appear improbable she was born at constantinople where   her father baron herbert was austrian ambassador married unhappily   yet has never been impeached in point of character excited the   vengeance of buonaparte by a part in some conspiracy several times   risked her life and is not yet twentyfive she is here on her way to   england to join her husband being obliged to leave trieste where   she was paying a visit to her mother by the approach of the french   and embarks soon in a ship of war since my arrival here i have had   scarcely any other companion i have found her very pretty very   accomplished and extremely eccentric buonaparte is even now so   incensed against her that her life would be in some danger if she   were taken prisoner a second time    you have seen murray and robert by this time and received my letter   little has happened since that date i have touched at cagliari in   sardinia and at girgenti in sicily

footnote 1 at gibraltar john galt who was travelling for his health met byron whom he did not know by sight but by whose appearance he was attracted    his dress indicated a londoner of some fashion partly by its   neatness and simplicity with just so much of a peculiarity of style   as served to show that although he belonged to the order of   metropolitan beaux he was not altogether a common one  his   physiognomy was prepossessing and intelligent but ever and anon his   brows lowered and gathereda habit as i then thought with a degree   of affectation in it probably first assumed for picturesque effect   and energetic expression but which i afterwards discovered was   undoubtedly the scowl of some unpleasant reminiscence it was   certainly disagreeable forbidding but still the general cast of his   features was impressed with elegance and character  afterwards galt was a fellowpassenger on board the packet from gibraltar to malta    in the little bustle and process of embarking their luggage his   lordship affected as it seemed to me more aristocracy than befitted   his years or the occasion and then i thought of his singular scowl   and suspected him of pride and irascibility the impression that   evening was not agreeable but it was interesting and that forehead   mark the frown was calculated to awaken curiosity and beget   conjectures  byron held himself aloof and sat on the rail leaning   on the mizzen shrouds inhaling as it were poetical sympathy from   the gloomy rock then dark and stern in the twilight there was in   all about him that  evening much waywardness he spoke petulantly to   fletcher his valet and was evidently ill at ease with himself and   fretful towards others i thought he would turn out an unsatisfactory   shipmate yet there was something redeeming in the tones of his voice   and when some time after having indulged his sullen meditation he   again addressed fletcher so that instead of finding him illnatured   i was soon convinced he was only capricious  on the voyage    about the third day byron relented from his rapt mood as if he felt   it was out of place and became playful and disposed to contribute   his fair proportion to the general endeavour to while away the   tediousness of the dull voyage  but yet throughout the whole passage    if says galt my remembrance is not treacherous he only spent one   evening in the cabin with usthe evening before we came to anchor at   cagliari for when the lights were placed he made himself a man   forbid took his station on the railing between the pegs on which the   sheets are belayed and the shrouds and there for hours sat in   silence enamoured it may be of the moon all these peculiarities   with his caprices and something inexplicable in the cast of his   metaphysics while they served to awaken interest contributed little   to conciliate esteem he was often strangely raptit may have been   from his genius and had its grandeur and darkness been then   divulged susceptible of explanation but at the time it threw as   it were around him the sackcloth of penitence sitting amid the   shrouds and rattlings in the tranquillity of the moonlight churning   an inarticulate melody he seemed almost apparitional suggesting dim   reminiscences of him who shot the albatross  galts life of byron pp 5761   footnote 2 byrons new calypso mrs spencer smith born about 1785 was the daughter of baron herbert austrian ambassador at constantinople wife of spencer smith the british minister at stuttgart and sisterinlaw of sir sidney smith the hero of acre in 1805 she was staying for her health at the baths of valdagno near vicenza when the napoleonic wars overspread northern italy and she took refuge with her sister the countess attems at venice in 1806 general lauriston took over the government of the city in the name of napoleon and m de la garde was appointed prefect of the police a few days after their arrival on april 18 mrs smith was arrested and guarded by gendarmes conveyed towards the italian frontier to be confined as la garde told a sicilian nobleman the marquis de salvo at valenciennes mrs smiths beauty and impending fate deeply impressed the marquis who determined to rescue her the prisoner and her guard had reached brescia and were lodged at the albergo delle due torre the  opportunity seemed favourable once across the guarda lake and in the passes of tyrol it would be easy to reach styria the marquis made his arrangementshired two boats one for the fugitives the other for their postchaise and horses procured for mrs smith a boys dress as a disguise made a ladder long enough to reach her window in the inn and succeeded in making known his plan to the prisoner the escape was effected but all along the road the danger continued for their way lay through a country which was practically french territory it was not till they reached gratz and mrs smith was under the roof of her sister the countess strassoldo that she was safe the story is told in detail by the marquis de salvo in his travels in the year 1806 from italy to england 1807 and by the duchesse dabrantes memoires vol xv pp 174  to mrs spencer

motheri have now been some time in turkey this place is on   the coast but i have traversed the interior of the province of   albania on a visit to the pacha i left malta in the spider a brig   of war on the 21st of september and arrived in eight days at   prevesa i thence have been about 150 miles as far as tepaleen his   highnesss country palace where i stayed three days the name of the   pacha is ali 1 and he is considered a man of the first abilities   he governs the whole of albania the ancient illyricum epirus and   part of macedonia his son vely pacha 2 to whom he has given me   letters governs the morea and has great influence in egypt in   short he is one of the most powerful men in the ottoman empire when   i reached yanina the capital after a journey of three days over the   mountains through a country of the most picturesque beauty i found   that ali pacha was with his army in illyricum besieging ibrahim pacha   in the castle of berat he had heard that an englishman of rank was in   his dominions and had left orders in yanina with the commandant to   provide a house and supply me with every kind of necessary gratis   and though i have been allowed to make presents to the slaves etc   i have not been permitted to pay for a single article of household   consumption    i rode out on the viziers horses and saw the palaces of himself and   grandsons they are splendid but too much ornamented with silk and   gold i then went over the mountains through zitza 3 a village with   a greek monastery where i slept on my return in the most beautiful   situation always excepting cintra in portugal i ever beheld in   nine days i reached tepaleen our journey was much prolonged by the   torrents that had fallen from the mountains and intersected the   roads i shall never forget the singular scene on entering tepaleen at   five in the afternoon as the sun was going down it brought to my   mind with some change of dress however scotts description of   branksome castle in his lay and the feudal system 4 the   albanians in their dresses the most magnificent in the world   consisting of a long white kilt goldworked cloak crimson velvet   goldlaced jacket and waistcoat silvermounted pistols and daggers   the tartars with their high caps the turks in their vast pelisses and   turbans the soldiers and black slaves with the horses the former in   groups in an immense large open gallery in front of the palace the   latter placed in a kind of cloister below it two hundred steeds ready   caparisoned to move in a moment couriers entering or passing out with   the despatches the kettledrums beating boys calling the hour from   the minaret of the mosque altogether with the singular appearance of   the building itself formed a new and delightful spectacle to a   stranger i was conducted to a very handsome apartment and my health   inquired after by the viziers secretary àlamode turque    the next day i was introduced to ali pacha i was dressed in a full   suit of staff uniform with a very magnificent sabre etc the vizier   received me in a large room paved with marble a fountain was playing   in the centre the apartment was surrounded by scarlet ottomans he   received me standing a wonderful compliment from a mussulman and   made me sit down on his right hand i have a greek interpreter for   general use but a physician of alis named femlario who understands   latin acted for me on this occasion his first question was why at   so early an age i left my countrythe turks have no idea of   travelling for amusement he then said the english minister captain   leake 5 had told him i was of a great family and desired his   respects to my mother which i now in the name of ali pacha present   to you he said he was certain i was a man of birth because i had   small ears curling hair and little white hands and expressed   himself pleased with my appearance and garb he told me to consider   him as a father whilst i was in turkey and said he looked on me as   his son indeed he treated me like a child sending me almonds and   sugared sherbet fruit and sweetmeats twenty times a day he begged   me to visit him often and at night when he was at leisure i then   after coffee and pipes retired for the first time i saw him thrice   afterwards it is singular that the turks who have no hereditary   dignities and few great families except the sultans pay so much   respect to birth for i found my pedigree more regarded than my title    today i saw the remains of the town of actium 6 near which antony   lost the world in a small bay where two frigates could hardly   manoeuvre a broken wall is the sole remnant on another part of the   gulf stand the ruins of nicopolis built by augustus in honour of his   victory last night i was at a greek marriage but this and a thousand   things more i have neither time nor space to describe    his highness is sixty years old very fat and not tall but with a   fine face light blue eyes and a white beard his manner is very   kind and at the same time he possesses that dignity which i find   universal amongst the turks he has the appearance of anything but his   real character for he is a remorseless tyrant guilty of the most   horrible cruelties very brave and so good a general that they call   him the mahometan buonaparte napoleon has twice offered to make him   king of epirus but he prefers the english interest and abhors the   french as he himself told me he is of so much consequence that he   is much courted by both the albanians being the most warlike subjects   of the sultan though ali is only nominally dependent on the porte he   has been a mighty warrior but is as barbarous as he is successful   roasting rebels etc etc buonaparte sent him a snuffbox with his   picture he said the snuffbox was very well but the picture he could   excuse as he neither liked it nor the original his ideas of judging   of a mans birth from ears hands etc were curious enough to me he   was indeed a father giving me letters guards and every possible   accommodation our next conversations were of war and travelling   politics and england he called my albanian soldier who attends me   and told him to protect me at all hazard his name is viseillie and   like all the albanians he is brave rigidly honest and faithful but   they are cruel though not treacherous and have several vices but no   meannesses they are perhaps the most beautiful race in point of   countenance in the world their women are sometimes handsome also   but they are treated like slaves beaten and in short complete   beasts of burden they plough dig and sow i found them carrying   wood and actually repairing the highways the men are all soldiers   and war and the chase their sole occupations the women are the   labourers which after all is no great hardship in so delightful a   climate yesterday the 11th of november i bathed in the sea today   is so hot that i am writing in a shady room of the english consuls   with three doors wide open no fire or even fireplace in the   house except for culinary purposes    i am going tomorrow with a guard of fifty men to patras in the   morea and thence to athens where i shall winter 7 two days ago i   was nearly lost in a turkish ship of war owing to the ignorance of   the captain and crew though the storm was not violent fletcher   yelled after his wife the greeks called on all the saints the   mussulmans on alla the captain burst into tears and ran below deck   telling us to call on god the sails were split the mainyard   shivered the wind blowing fresh the night setting in and all our   chance was to make corfu which is in possession of the french or as   fletcher pathetically termed it a watery grave i did what i could   to console fletcher but finding him incorrigible wrapped myself up   in my albanian capote an immense cloak and lay down on deck to wait   the worst i have learnt to philosophise in my travels and if i had   not complaint was useless luckily the wind abated and only drove us   on the coast of suli on the main land where we landed and   proceeded by the help of the natives to prevesa again but i shall   not trust turkish sailors in future though the pacha had ordered one   of his own galliots to take me to patras i am therefore going as far   as missolonghi by land and there have only to cross a small gulf to   get to patras    fletchers next epistle will be full of marvels we were one night   lost for nine hours in the mountains in a thunderstorm and since   nearly wrecked in both cases fletcher was sorely bewildered from   apprehensions of famine and banditti in the first and drowning in the   second instance his eyes were a little hurt by the lightning or   crying i dont know which but are now recovered when you write   address to me at mr stranés english consul patras morea    i could tell you i know not how many incidents that i think would   amuse you but they crowd on my mind as much as they would swell my   paper and i can neither arrange them in the one nor put them down on   the other except in the greatest confusion i like the albanians   much they are not all turks some tribes are christians but their   religion makes little difference in their manner or conduct they are   esteemed the best troops in the turkish service i lived on my route   two days at once and three days again in a barrack at salora and   never found soldiers so tolerable though i have been in the garrisons   of gibraltar and malta and seen spanish french sicilian and   british troops in abundance i have had nothing stolen and was always   welcome to their provision and milk not a week ago an albanian chief   every village has its chief who is called primate after helping us   out of the turkish galley in her distress feeding us and lodging my   suite consisting of fletcher a greek two athenians a greek priest   and my companion mr hobhouse refused any compensation but a written   paper stating that i was well received and when i pressed him to   accept a few sequins no he replied i wish you to love me not to   pay me these are his words    it is astonishing how far money goes in this country while i was in   the capital i had nothing to pay by the viziers order but since   though i have generally had sixteen horses and generally six or seven   men the expense has not been half as much as staying only three   weeks in malta though sir a ball 8 the governor gave me a house   for nothing and i had only one servant by the by i expect hanson   to remit regularly for i am not about to stay in this province for   ever let him write to me at mr stranés english consul patras the   fact is the fertility of the plains is wonderful and specie is   scarce which makes this remarkable cheapness i am going to athens   to study modern greek which differs much from the ancient though   radically similar i have no desire to return to england nor shall i   unless compelled by absolute want and hansons neglect but i shall   not enter into asia for a year or two as i have much to see in   greece and i may perhaps cross into africa at least the egyptian   part fletcher like all englishmen is very much dissatisfied though   a little reconciled to the turks by a present of eighty piastres from   the vizier which if you consider every thing and the value of   specie here is nearly worth ten guineas english he has suffered   nothing but from cold heat and vermin which those who lie in   cottages and cross mountains in a cold country must undergo and of   which i have equally partaken with himself but he is not valiant and   is afraid of robbers and tempests i have no one to be remembered to   in england and wish to hear nothing from it but that you are well   and a letter or two on business from hanson whom you may tell to   write i will write when i can and beg you to believe me    your affectionate son    byron    psi have some very magnifiques albanian dresses the only   expensive articles in this country they cost fifty guineas each and   have so much gold they would cost in england two hundred i have been   introduced to hussein bey 9 and mahmout pacha 9 both little   boys grandchildren of ali at yanina they are totally unlike our   lads have painted complexions like rouged dowagers large black eyes   and features perfectly regular they are the prettiest little animals   i ever saw and are broken into the court ceremonies already the   turkish salute is a slight inclination of the head with the hand on   the heart intimates always kiss mahmout is ten years old and hopes   to see me again we are friends without understanding each other like   many other folks though from a different cause he has given me a   letter to his father in the morea to whom i have also letters from   ali pacha    footnote 1 ali pasha 17411822 was born in albania at tepeleni a town 75 miles north of janina of which his father was governor this mahometan buonaparte or rob roy of albania made himself the supreme ruler of epirus and albania acquired a predominance over the agas of thessaly and pushed his troops to the frontiers of ancient attica see raumers historisches taschenbuch pp 87175 a merciless and unscrupulous tyrant he was also a fine soldier and a born administrator intriguing now with the porte now with buonaparte now with the english using the rival despots of the country against each other hand in glove with the brigands while commanding the police for their suppression he extended his power by using conflicting interests to aggrandize himself the venetian possessions on the eastern shores of the adriatic which had passed in 1797 to france by the treaty of campo formio were wrested from the french by ali who defeated general la salsette 1798 in the plains of nicopolis and with the exception of parga seized and held the principal towns in the name of the sultan byron speaks of his aged venerable face in childe harold canto ii stanza lxii see also stanza xlvii and of the delicacy of his hand in don juan canto iv stanza xlv and finds in his treatment of giaffir pacha of argyro castro or scutari i am not sure which the material for stanzas xiv xv of canto ii of the bride of abydos hobhouse journey through albania edit 1854 vol i pp 96 97 describes ali as    a short man about five feet five inches in height and very fat   though not particularly corpulent he had a very pleasing face fair   and round with blue quick eyes not at all settled into a turkish   gravity his beard was long and white and such a one as any other   turk would have been proud of though he who was more taken up with   his guests than himself did not continue looking at it nor smelling   and stroking it as is usually the custom of his countrymen to fill   up the pauses of conversation  dr afterwards sir henry holland in his travels in the ionian isles albania thessaly and greece in 181213 pp 125 126 1815 gives an account of his first interview with ali    were i to attempt a description of ali i should speak of his face as   large and full the forehead remarkably broad and open and traced by   many deep furrows the eye penetrating yet not expressive of   ferocity the nose handsome and well formed the mouth and lower part   of the face concealed except when speaking by his mustachios and the   long beard which flows over his breast his complexion is somewhat   lighter than that usual among the turks and his general appearance   does not indicate more than his actual age  the neck is short and   thick the figure corpulent and unwieldy his stature i had afterwards   the means of ascertaining to be about five feet nine inches the   general character and expression of the countenance are unquestionably   fine and the forehead especially is a striking and majestic feature   much of the talent of the man may be inferred from his exterior the   moral qualities however may not equally be determined in this way   and to the casual observation of the stranger i can conceive from my   own experience that nothing may appear but what is open placid and   alluring opportunities were afterwards afforded me of looking beneath   this exterior of expression it is the fire of a stove burning   fiercely under a smooth and polished surface the inquiries he made   respecting our journey to joannina gave us the opportunity of   complimenting him on the excellent police of his dominions and the   attention he has paid to his roads i mentioned to him generally lord   byrons poetical description of albania the interest it had excited   in england and mr hobhouses intended publication of his travels in   the same country he seemed pleased with these circumstances and   stated his recollection of lord byron  dr holland brought back to england a letter to byron from ali see letter to moore september 8 1813  a further account of ali together with a portrait will be found in hughess travels in sicily etc pp 446449 he again 1813 asked with much apparent interest respecting lord byron at the close of the napoleonic struggle the interest of this country was excited by the resistance of parga to his arms especially as during the late war the pargiotes had received the protection of great britain after the fall of parga 1819 alis power roused the jealousy of the sultan and it was partly in consequence of his open defiance of the porte that insurrections broke out in wallachia and that ypsilanti proclaimed himself the liberator of greece the turkish troops under kurchid pasha gradually overpowered ali and at the end of 1821 shut him up in his citadel of janina in the following january he surrendered and was at first treated with respect but on february 5 1822 ali was informed that the sultan demanded his head his answer was to fire his pistol at the messenger in the fray that followed he was killed another and better account walshs narrative of a journey from constantinople to england p 62 says that he was stabbed in the back as he was bowing to the departing messenger who had solemnly assured him of the sultans pardon and favour his head was cut off sent to constantinople and fixed on the grand gate of the seraglio with the sentence of death by its side recently fresh interest has been aroused in ali by the publication of mr bains translation of

defeat and the transference of his pashalik to ali veli at this time vizier of the morea resided at tripolizza when he was visited by galt who describes him as sitting    on a crimson velvet cushion

two thousand five hundred pounds sterling in his left   hand he held a string of small coral beads a comboloio which he   twisted backwards and forwards during the greater part of the visit   in his

ago you requested   me to write to youi will do so i have crossed portugal traversed   the south of spain visited sardinia sicily malta and thence passed   into turkey where i am still wandering i first landed in albania   the ancient epirus where we penetrated as far as mount tomarit   excellently treated by the chief ali pachaand after journeying   through illyria chaonia etc crossed the gulf of actium with a   guard of fifty albanians and passed the achelous in our route through   acarnania and Ætolia we stopped a short time in the morea crossed   the gulf of lepanto and landed at the foot of parnassussaw all   that delphi retains and so on to thebes and athens at which last we   remained ten weeks    his majestys ship pylades brought us to smyrna but not before we   had topographised attica including of course marathon and the   sunian promontory from smyrna to the troad which we visited when at   anchor for a fortnight off the tomb of antilochus was our next   stage and now we are in the dardanelles waiting for a wind to   proceed to constantinople    this morning i swam from sestos to abydos 1 the immediate   distance is not above a mile but the current renders it   hazardousso much so that i doubt whether leanders conjugal   affection must not have been a little chilled in his passage to   paradise i attempted it a week ago and failedowing to the north   wind and the wonderful rapidity of the tidethough i have been from   my childhood a strong swimmer but this morning being calmer i   succeeded and crossed the broad hellespont in an hour and ten   minutes    well my dear sir i have left my home and seen part of africa and   asia and a tolerable portion of europe i have been with generals and   admirals princes and pashas governors and ungovernablesbut i have   not time or paper to expatiate i wish to let you know that i live   with a friendly remembrance of you and a hope to meet you again and   if i do this as shortly as possible attribute it to any thing but   forgetfulness    greece ancient and modern you know too well to require description   albania indeed i have seen more of than any englishman except a mr   leake for it is a country rarely visited from the savage character   of the natives though abounding in more natural beauties than the   classical regions of greecewhich however are still eminently   beautiful particularly delphi and cape colonna in attica yet these   are nothing to parts of illyria and epirus where places without a   name and rivers not laid down in maps may one day when more known   be justly esteemed superior subjects for the pencil and the pen to   the dry ditch of the ilissus and the bogs of boeotia    the troad is a fine field for conjecture and snipeshooting and a   good sportsman and an ingenious scholar may exercise their feet and   faculties to great advantage upon the spotor if they prefer   riding lose their way as i did in a cursed quagmire of the   scamander

ajax etcbut mount ida is still in high feather though the   shepherds are nowadays not much like ganymede but why should i say   more of these things are they not written in the boke of gell   2 and has not hobhouse got a journal i keep none as i have   renounced scribbling    i see not much difference between ourselves and the turks save that   we haveand they have nonethat they have long dresses and we   short and that we talk much and they little they are sensible   people ali pacha told me he was sure i was a man of rank because i   had small ears and hands and curling hair by the by i speak   the romaic or modern greek tolerably it does not differ from the   ancient dialects so much as you would conceive but the pronunciation   is diametrically opposite of verse except in rhyme they have no   idea    i like the greeks who are plausible rascalswith all the turkish   vices without their courage however some are brave and all are   beautiful very much resembling the busts of alcibiadesthe women   not quite so handsome i can swear in turkish but except one   horrible oath and pimp and bread and water i have got no   great vocabulary in that language they are extremely polite to   strangers of any rank properly protected and as i have two servants   and two soldiers we get on with great éclat we have been   occasionally in danger of thieves and once of shipwreckbut always   escaped    of spain i sent some account to our hodgson but have subsequently   written to no one save notes to relations and lawyers to keep them   out of my premises i mean to give up all connection on my return   with many of my best friendsas i supposed themand to snarl all my   life but i hope to have one goodhumoured laugh with you and to   embrace dwyer and pledge hodgson before i commence cynicism    tell dr butler i am now writing with the gold pen he gave me before i   left england which is the reason my scrawl is more unintelligible   than usual i have been at athens and seen plenty of these reeds for   scribbling some of which he refused to bestow upon me because   topographic gell had brought them from attica but i will not   describenoyou must be satisfied with simple detail till my   return and then we will unfold the floodgates of colloquy i am in a   thirtysix gun frigate going up to fetch bob adair from   constantinople who will have the honour to carry

travels in sicily etc vol i p 254 published in 1820 speaks of the three daughters of madame macri as the belles of athens of theresa the eldest he says that her countenance was extremely interesting and her eye retained much of its wonted brilliancy but the roses had already deserted the cheek and we observed the remains only of that loveliness which elicited such strains from an impassioned poet walsh in his narrative of a resident in constantinople vol i p 122 speaks of theresa macri the maid of athens whom he saw in 1821 as still very elegant in her person and gentle and ladylike in her manners but adds that she has lost all pretensions to beauty and has a countenance singularly marked by hopeless sadness on the other hand williams in his travels in italy etc vol ii pp 290 291 speaks in 1820 with an artists enthusiasm of the beauty of the three daughters of theodora macri he quotes from the visitors book to which hobhouse alludes four lines written by byron in answer to an anonymous versifier    this modest bard like many a bard unknown   rhymes on our names but wisely hides his own   but yet whoeer he be to say no worse   his name would bring more credit than his verse  theresa and mariana macri were dark katinka was fair the latter name byron uses as that of the fair georgian in don juan canto vi stanza xli    it was says moore if i recollect right in making love to one of   these girls that he had recourse to an act of courtship often   practised in that countrynamely giving himself a wound across the   breast with his dagger the young athenian by his own account looked   on very coolly during the operation considering it a fit tribute to   her beauty but in no degree moved to gratitude  theresa sometimes called thyrza macri married an englishman named black employed in hms consular service at missolonghi she survived her husband and fell into great poverty finlay the historian of greece made an appeal on her behalf which obtained the support of the leading members of athenian society including m charilaus tricoupi for some time prime minister at athens the son of spiridion tricoupibyrons intimate friend in the new york times for october 22 1875 mr anthony martelaus united states consular agent at athens describes mrs black whom he visited in august 1875 as a tall old lady with features inspiring reverence and showing that at a time past she

  paid for except the frame if frame there be before i left england   i believe i mentioned to you in my last that my only notable exploit   lately has been swimming from sestos to abydos in humble imitation of   leander of amorous memory though i had no hero to receive me on   the other shore of the hellespont    of constantinople you have of course read fifty descriptions by sundry   travellers which are in general so correct that i have nothing to add   on the subject when our ambassador takes his leave i shall accompany   him to see the sultan and afterwards probably return to greece i   have heard nothing of mr h but one remittance without any letter   from that legal gentleman if you have occasion for any pecuniary   supply pray use my funds as far as they go without reserve and   lest there should not be enough in my next to mr hi will direct   him to advance any sum you want leaving at your discretion how much   in the present state of my affairs you may think proper to require    i have already seen the most interesting part of turkey in europe and   asia minor but shall not proceed further till i hear from england in   the mean time i shall expect

congratulate you on a child being born 1 as a letter from hodgson   apprizes me of that event in which i rejoice    i am just come from an expedition through the bosphorus to the black   sea and the

of ascending the said rocks   and bruising my carcass in honour of the ancients    i have now sat on the cyaneans swam from sestos to abydos as i   trumpeted in my last and after passing through the morea again   shall set sail for santa maura and toss myself from the leucadian   promontorysurviving which operation i shall probably join you in   england hobhouse who will deliver this is bound straight for these   parts and as he is bursting with his travels i shall not anticipate   his narratives but merely beg you not to believe one word he says   but reserve your ear for me if you have any desire to be acquainted   with the truth    i am bound for athens once more and thence to the morea but my stay   depends so much on my caprice that i can say nothing of its probable   duration i have been out a year already and may stay another but i   am quicksilver and say nothing positively we are all very much   occupied doing nothing at present we have seen every thing but the   mosques which we are to view with a firman on tuesday next but of   these and other sundries let h relate with this proviso that   i am to be referred to for authenticity and i beg leave to   contradict all those things whereon he lays particular stress but if   he soars at any time into wit i give you leave to applaud because   that is necessarily stolen from his fellowpilgrim tell davies 3   that hobhouse has made excellent use of his best jokes in many of his   majestys ships of war but add also that i always took care to   restore them to the right owner in consequence of which he davies   is no less famous by water than by land and reigns unrivalled in the   cabin as in the cocoa tree 4    and hodgson has been publishing more poesyi wish he would send me   his sir edgar 5 and blands

tongue is at your service   remember me to dwyer who owes me eleven guineas tell him to put them   in my bankers hands at gibraltar or constantinople i believe he paid   them once but that goes for nothing as it was an annuity    i wish you would write i have heard from hodgson frequently malta is   my postoffice i mean to be with you by next montem you remember the   lasti hope for such another

     141to his mother    constantinople june 28 1810    my dear motheri regret to perceive by your last letter that several   of mine have not arrived particularly a very long one written in   november last from albania where i was on a visit to the pacha of   that province fletcher has also written to his spouse perpetually    mr hobhouse who will forward or deliver this and is on his return   to england can inform you of our different movements but i am very   uncertain as to my own return he will probably be down in notts some   time or other but fletcher whom i send back as an incumbrance   english servants are sad travellers will supply his place in the   interim and describe our travels which have been tolerably   extensive    i have written twice briefly from this capital from smyrna from   athens and other parts of greece from albania the pacha of which   province desired his respects to my mother and said he was sure i was   a man of high birth because i had small ears curling hair and white   hands he was very kind to me begged me to consider him as a   father and gave me a guard of forty soldiers through the forests of   acarnania but of this and other circumstances i have written to you   at large and yet hope you will receive my letters    i remember mahmout pacha the grandson of ali pacha at yanina a   little fellow of ten years of age with large black eyes which our   ladies would purchase at any price and those regular features which   distinguish the turks asked me how i came to travel so young   without anybody to take care of me this question was put by the   little man with all the gravity of threescore i cannot now write   copiously i have only time to tell you that i have passed many a   fatiguing but never a tedious moment and all that i am afraid of is   that i shall contract a gypsy like wandering disposition which will   make home tiresome to me this i am told is very common with men in   the habit of peregrination and indeed i feel it so on the 3rd of   may i swam from sestos to abydos you know the story of leander   but i had no hero to receive me at landing    i also passed a fortnight on the troad the tombs of achilles and   Æsyetes still exist in large barrows similar to those you have   doubtless seen in the north the other day i was at belgrade a   village in these environs to see the house built on the same site as   lady mary wortleys1 bytheby her ladyship as far as i can   judge has lied but not half so much as any other woman would have   done in the same situation    i have been in all the principal mosques by the virtue of a firman   this is a favor rarely permitted to infidels but the ambassadors   departure obtained it for us i have been up the bosphorus into the   black sea round the walls of the city and indeed i know more of it   by sight than i do of london i hope to amuse you some winters   evening with the details but at present you must excuse mei am not   able to write long letters in june i return to spend my summer in   greece i write often but you must not be alarmed when you do not   receive my letters consider we have no regular post farther than   malta where i beg you will in future send your letters and not to   this city    fletcher is a poor creature and requires comforts that i can dispense   with he is very sick of his travels but you must not believe his   account of the country he sighs for ale and idleness and a wife   and the devil knows what besides i have not been disappointed or   disgusted i have lived with the highest and the lowest i have been   for days in a pachas palace and have passed many a night in a   cowhouse and i find the people inoffensive and kind i have also   passed some time with the principal greeks in the morea and livadia   and though inferior to the turks they are better than the spaniards   who in their turn excel the portuguese of constantinople you will   find many descriptions in different travels but lady mary wortley   errs strangely when she says st pauls would cut a strange figure   by st sophias 2  i have been in both surveyed them inside and   out attentively st sophias is undoubtedly the most interesting from   its immense antiquity and the circumstance of all the greek emperors   from justinian having been crowned there and several murdered at the   altar besides the turkish sultans who attend it regularly but it is   inferior in beauty and size to some of the mosques particularly   soleyman etc and not to be mentioned in the same page with st   pauls i speak like a cockney however i prefer the gothic   cathedral of seville to st pauls st sophias and any religious   building i have ever seen    the walls of the seraglio are like the walls of newstead gardens only   higher and much in the same order but the ride by the walls of the   city on the land side is beautiful imagine four miles of immense   triple battlements covered with ivy surmounted with 218 towers and   on the other side of the road turkish buryinggrounds the loveliest   spots on earth full of enormous cypresses i have seen the ruins of   athens of ephesus and delphi i have traversed great part of turkey   and many other parts of europe and some of asia but i never beheld a   work of nature or art which yielded an impression like the prospect on   each side from the seven towers to the end of the golden horn 3    now for england i am glad to hear of the progress of english bards   etc of course you observed i have made great additions to the new   edition have you received my picture from sanders vigo lane london   it was finished and paid for long before i left england pray send   for it you seem to be a mighty reader of magazines where do you pick   up all this intelligence quotations etc etc though i was happy   to obtain my seat without the assistance of lord carlisle i had no   measures to keep with a man who declined interfering as my relation on   that occasion and i have done with him though i regret distressing   mrs leigh 4 poor thingi hope she is happy    it is my opinion that mr bought to marry miss r our first   duty is not to do evil but alas that is impossible our next is to   repair it if in our power the girl is his equal if she were his   inferior a sum of money and provision for the child would be some   though a poor compensation as it is he should marry her i will   have no gay deceivers on my estate and i shall not allow my tenants a   privilege i do not permit myselfthat of debauching each others   daughters god knows i have been guilty of many excesses but as i   have laid down a resolution to reform and lately kept it i expect   this lothario to follow the example and begin by restoring this girl   to society or by the beard of my father he shall hear of it pray   take some notice of robert who will miss his master poor boy he was   very unwilling to return i trust you are well and happy it will be a   pleasure to hear from you    believe me yours very sincerely    byron    pshow is joe murray    psi open my letter again to tell you that fletcher having   petitioned to accompany me into the morea i have taken

wishes of rwhen he can   express them in person which it seems will be at some very indefinite   date i shall perhaps essay a speech or two in the house when i   return but i am not ambitious of a parliamentary career which is of   all things the most degrading and unthankful if i could by my own   efforts inculcate the truth that a man is not intended for a despot   or a machine but as an individual of a community and fit for the   society of kings so long as he does not trespass on the laws or rebel   against just governments i might attempt to found a new utopia but   as matters are at present in course you will not expect me to   sacrifice my health or self to your or anyones ambition    to quit this new idea for something you will understand better how   are miss rs the ws and

went by an ambassadorial express   my second by the black john lugger my third will be conveyed by   cam the miscellanist    i shall begin by telling you having only told it you twice before   that i swam from sestos to abydos i do this that you may be impressed   with proper respect for me the performer for i plume myself on this   achievement more than i could possibly do on any kind of glory   political poetical or rhetorical having told you this i will tell   you nothing more because it would be cruel to curtail cams   narrative which bytheby you must not believe till confirmed by   me the eyewitness i promise myself much pleasure from contradicting   the greatest part of it he has been plaguily pleased by the   intelligence contained in your last to me respecting the reviews of   his hymns i refreshed him with that paragraph immediately together   with the tidings of my own third edition which added to his   recreation but then he has had a letter from a lincolns inn bencher   full of praise of his harpings and vituperation of the other   contributions to his missellingany which that sagacious person is   pleased to say must have been put in as foils horresco referens   furthermore he adds that cam is a genuine pupil of dryden   concluding with a comparison rather to the disadvantage of pope    i have written to drury by hobhouse a letter is also from me on its   way to england intended for that matrimonial man before it is very   long i hope we shall again be together the moment i set out for   england you shall have intelligence that we may meet as soon as   possible next week the frigate sails with adair i am for greece   hobhouse for england a year together on the 2nd july since we sailed   from falmouth i have known a hundred instances of men setting

considered as singularly quick particularly for the season   of the year i left constantinople with adair at whose adieux of   leave i saw sultan mahmout 1 and obtained a firman to visit the   mosques of which i gave you a description in my last letter now   voyaging to england in the salsette frigate in which i visited the   plains of troy and constantinople your northern gentry can have no   conception of a greek summer which however is a perfect frost   compared with malta and gibraltar where i reposed myself in the shade   last year after a gentle gallop of four hundred miles without   intermission through portugal and spain you see by my date that i   am at athens again a place which i think i prefer upon the whole to   any i have seen    my next movement is tomorrow into the morea where i shall probably   remain a month or two and then return to winter here if i do not   change my plans which however are very variable as you may   suppose but none of them verge to england    the marquis of sligo 2 my old fellowcollegian is here and wishes   to accompany me into the morea we shall go together for that purpose   but i am woefully sick of travelling companions after a years   experience of mr hobhouse who is on his way to great britain lord   s will afterwards pursue his way to the capital and lord b having   seen all the wonders in that quarter will let you know what he does   next of which at present he is not quite certain malta is my   perpetual postoffice from which my letters are forwarded to all   parts of the habitable globeby the bye i have now been in asia

fletcher begs   leave to send halfadozen sighs to sally his spouse and wonders   though i do not that his illwritten and worse spelt letters have   never come to hand as for that matter there is no great loss in   either of our letters saving and except that i wish you to know we   are well and warm enough at this present writing god knows you must   not expect long letters at present for they are written with the   sweat of my brow i assure you it is rather singular that mr hanson   has not written a syllable since my departure your letters i have   mostly received as well as others from which i conjecture that the   man of law is either angry or busy    i trust you like newstead and agree with your neighbours but you   know you are a vixenis not that a dutiful appellation pray   take care of my books and several boxes of papers in the hands of   joseph and pray leave me a few bottles of champagne to drink for i   am very thirstybut i do not insist on the last article without you

travels in albania etc vol ii pp 364 365    the chamber was small and dark or rather illumined with a gloomy   artificial light reflected from the ornaments of silver pearls and   other white brilliants with which it is thickly studded on every side   and on the roof the throne which is supposed the richest in the   world is like a fourposted bed but of a dazzling splendour the   lower part formed of burnished silver and pearls and the canopy and   supporters encrusted with jewels it is in an awkward position being   in one corner of the room and close to a fireplace    sultan mahmoud was placed in the middle of the throne with his feet   upon the ground which notwithstanding the common form of squatting   upon the hams seems the seat of ceremony he was dressed in a robe of   yellow satin with a broad border of the darkest sable his dagger   and an ornament on his breast were covered with diamonds the front   of his white and blue turban shone with a large treble sprig of   diamonds which served as a buckle to a high straight plume of   birdofparadise feathers he for the most part kept a hand on each   knee and neither moved his body nor head but rolled his eyes from   side to side without fixing them for an instant upon the ambassador   or any other person present occasionally he stroked and turned up his   beard displaying a milkwhite hand glittering with diamond rings his   eyebrows eyes and beard being of a glossy jet black did not appear   natural but added to that indescribable majesty which it would be   difficult for any but an oriental sovereign to assume his face was   pale and regularly formed except that his nose contrary to the   usual form of that feature in the ottoman princes was slightly turned   up and pointed his whole physiognomy was mild and benevolent but   expressive and full of dignity he appeared of a short and small   stature and about thirty years old which is somewhat more than his   actual age  byron at the audience claimed some precedence in the procession as a peer on may 23 1819 moore sat at dinner next to stratford canning afterwards lord stratford de redcliffe who    gave a ludicrous account of lord byrons insisting upon taking   precedence of the corps diplomatique in a procession at   constantinople when canning was secretary and upon adairs refusing   it limping with as much swagger as he could muster up the hall   cocking a foreign military hat on his head he found however he was   wrong and wrote a very frank letter acknowledging it and offering to   take his station anywhere    journals etc of thomas moore vol ii p 313  an incident of the voyage from constantinople to zea is mentioned by moore life p 110 picking up a turkish dagger on the deck byron looked at the blade and then

was at athens with a 12gun brig and a crew of fifty men at athens also were lady hester stanhope and michael bruce on their way through european turkey as the party were passing the piraeus they saw a man jump from the molehead into the sea lord sligo recognizing the bather as byron called to him to dress and join them thus began what byron in his memoranda speaks of as the most delightful acquaintance which i formed in greece from lord sligo moore heard the following stories  weakened and thinned by his illness at patras byron returned to athens there standing one day before a lookingglass he said to lord sligo how pale i look i should like i think to die of a consumption why of a consumption asked his friend because then he answered the women would all say see that poor byronhow interesting he looks in dying  he often spoke of his mother to lord sligo who thought that his feeling towards her was little short of aversion some time or other he said i will tell you why i feel thus towards her a few days after when they were bathing together in the gulf of lepanto pointing to his naked leg and foot he exclaimed    look there it is to her false delicacy at my birth i owe that   deformity and yet as long as i can remember she has never ceased to   taunt and reproach me with it even a few days before we parted for   the last time on my leaving england she in one of her fits of   passion uttered an imprecation upon me praying that i might prove as   ill formed in mind as i am in body  relics of ancient art only appealed to byrons imagination among their original and natural surroundings for collections and collectors he had a contempt which like everything he thought or felt was unreservedly expressed lord sligo wished to spend some money in digging for antiquities and byron offered to act as his agent and to see the money honestly applied you may safely trust me he said i am no dilettante your connoisseurs are all thieves but i care too little for these things ever to steal them  his system of thinning himself which he had begun before he left england was continued abroad while at athens where he stayed at the franciscan convent he took a turkish bath three times a week his usual drink being vinegar and water and his food seldom more than a little rice the result was that when he returned to england he weighed only 9 stone 1112 lbs see

meeting with byron if her physicians recollection is to be trusted memoirs by dr meryon vol iii pp 218 219    i think he was a strange character his generosity was for a motive   his avarice for a motive one time he was mopish and nobody was to   speak to him another he was for being jocular with everybody then   he was a sort of don quixote fighting with the police for a woman of   the town and then he wanted to make himself something great  at   athens i saw nothing in him but a wellbred man like many others   for as for poetry it is easy enough to write verses and as for the   thoughts who knows where he got them  he had a great deal of vice   in his lookshis eyes set close together and a contracted browso   imitating it oh lord i am sure he was not a liberal man   whatever else he might be the only good thing about his looks was   this part drawing her hand under the cheek down the front of her   neck and the curl on his forehead  michael bruce with the help of sir robert

27 1810    dear motheri write again in case you have not received my letters   today i go into the morea which will i trust be colder than this   place where i have tarried in the expectation of obtaining rest   sligo has very kindly proposed a union of our forces for the occasion   which will be perhaps as uncomfortable to him as to myself judging   from previous experience which however may be explained by my own   irritability and hurry    at constantinople i visited the mosques plains and grandees of that   place which in my opinion cannot be compared with athens and its   neighbourhood indeed i know of no turkish scenery to equal this   which would be civilised and celtic enough with a little alteration in   situation and inhabitants an usual custom here as at cadiz is to   part with wives daughters etc for a trifling present of gold or   english arms which the greeks set a high value upon the women are   generally of the middle height with turkish eyes straight hair and   clear olive complexion but are not nearly so amorous as the spanish   belles whom i have described to you in former letters i have some   feats to boast of when i return which is undesired and undesirablei   always except you from my complaints and hope you will expect me with   the same delight that i anticipate meeting you you can have no   conception of lord ss ecstasy when i informed him of my probable   movements the man is well enough and sensible enough by himself but   the swarm of attendants turks greeks englishmen that he carries   with him makes his society or rather theirs an intolerable   annoyance if you will read this letter to you may imagine in   what capacity i believe you excel    before i left england i promised to give my silvermounted whip in   your chamber to charles present it to him poor boy for i should   not like him to suppose me as unfaithful as his amante who by the   way is no better than she should be and no great loss to himself or   his family hobhouse is silent and has i suppose not yet returned   indeed like myself he appears to love the world better than england   and the devil more than either who i regret is not present to be   informed of this do not fail if you see him hobhouse i mean to   repeat it and the assurance that i am to him with yourself    ever affectionately    byron      146to his mother    patras july

travelling between   athens and megara the thermometer was at 125° yet i feel no   inconvenience of course i am much bronzed but i live temperately   and never enjoyed better health    before i left constantinople i saw the sultan with mr adair and   the interior of the mosques things which rarely happen to travellers   mr hobhouse is gone to england i am in no hurry to return but have   no particular communications for your country except my surprise at   mr hansons silence and my desire that he will remit regularly i   suppose some arrangement has been made with regard to wymondham and   rochdale malta is my postoffice or to mr strané consulgeneral   patras morea you complain of my silencei have written twenty or   thirty times within the last year never less than twice a month and   often more if my letters do not arrive you must not conclude that we   are eaten or that there is war or a pestilence or famine neither   must you credit silly reports which i dare say you have in notts as   usual i am very well and neither more nor less happy than i usually   am except that i am very glad to be once more alone for i was sick   of my companionnot that he was a bad one but because my nature   leads me to solitude and that every day adds to this disposition if   i chose here are many men who would wish to join meone wants me to   go to egypt another to asia of which i have seen enough the greater   part of greece is already my own so that i shall only go over my old   ground and look upon my old seas and mountains the only   acquaintances i ever found improve upon me    i have a tolerable suite a tartar two albanians an interpreter   besides fletcher but in this country these are easily maintained   adair received me wonderfully well and indeed i have no

indeed   have i any complaint to make since you have written frequently for   which i thank you but i very much condemn mr hanson who has not   taken the smallest notice of my many letters nor of my request before   i left england which i sailed from on this very day fifteen months   ago thus one year and a quarter have passed away without my   receiving the least intelligence on the state of my affairs and they   were not in a posture to admit of neglect and i do conceive and   declare that mr hanson has acted negligently and culpably in not   apprising me of his proceedings i will also add uncivilly his   letters were there any could not easily miscarry the communications   with the levant are slow but tolerably secure at least as far as   malta and there i left directions which i know would be observed    i have written to you several times from constantinople and smyrna   you will perceive by my date i am returned into the morea1 of which   i have been making the tour and visiting the pacha who gave me a   fine horse and paid me all possible honours and attention i have now   seen a good portion of turkey in europe and asia minor and shall   remain at athens and in the vicinity till i hear from england    i have punctually obeyed your injunctions of writing frequently but i   shall not pretend to describe countries which have been already amply   treated of i believe before this time mr hobhouse will have arrived   in england and he brings letters from me written at constantinople   in these i mention having seen the sultan and the mosques and that i   swam from sestos to abydos an exploit of which i take care to boast    i am here on business at present but athens is my headquarters   where i am very pleasantly situated in a franciscan convent believe   me to be

bardship he writes to me   from malta and requests my journal if i keep one i have none or he   should have it but i have replied in a consolatory and exhortatory   epistle praying him to abate three and sixpence in the price of his   next boke seeing that half a guinea is a price not to be given for   any thing save an opera ticket    as for england it is long since i have heard from it every one at   all connected with my concerns is asleep and you are my only   correspondent agents excepted i have really no friends in the world   though all my old school companions are gone forth into that world   and walk about there in monstrous disguises in the garb of guardsmen   lawyers parsons fine gentlemen and such other masquerade dresses   so i here shake hands and cut with all these busy people none of   whom write to me indeed i ask it notand here i am a poor   traveller and heathenish philosopher who hath perambulated the   greatest part of the levant and seen a great quantity of very   improvable land and sea and after all am no better than when i set   outlord help me    i have been out fifteen months this very day and i believe my   concerns will draw me to england soon but of this i will apprise you   regularly from malta on all points hobhouse will inform you if you   are curious as to our adventures 1 i have seen some old english   papers up to the 15th of may i see the lady of the lake2   advertised of course it is in his old ballad style and pretty after   all scott is the best of them the end of all scribblement is to   amuse and he certainly succeeds there i long to read his new   romance    and how does sir edgar and your friend bland i suppose you are   involved in some literary squabble the only way is to despise all   brothers of the quill i suppose you wont allow me to be an author   but i contemn you all you dogsi do    you dont know dallas do you he had a farce 3 ready for the stage   before i left england and asked me for a prologue which i promised   but sailed in such a hurry i never penned a couplet i am afraid to   ask after his drama for fear it should be damnedlord forgive me for   using such a word but the pit sir you know the pitthey will do   those things in spite of merit i remember this farce from a curious   circumstance when drury lane 4 was burnt to the ground by which   accident sheridan and his son lost the few remaining shillings they   were worth what doth my friend dallas do why before the fire was   out he writes a note to tom sheridan 5 the manager of this   combustible concern to inquire whether this farce was not converted   into fuel with about two thousand other unactable manuscripts which   of course were in great peril if not actually consumed now was not   this characteristicthe ruling passions of pope are nothing to it   whilst the poor distracted manager was bewailing the loss of a   building only worth £300000 together with some twenty thousand   pounds of rags and tinsel in the tiring rooms bluebeards elephants   6 and all thatin comes a note from a scorching author requiring   at his hands two acts and odd scenes of a farce    dear h remind drury that i am his wellwisher and let scrope davies   be well affected towards me i look forward to meeting you at   newstead and renewing our old champagne evenings with all the glee of   anticipation i have written by every opportunity and expect   responses as regular as those of the liturgy and somewhat longer as   it is impossible for a man in his senses to hope for happy days let   us at least look forward to merry ones which come nearest to the   other in appearance if not in reality and in such expectations i   remain etc    footnote 1 hobhouse writing to byron from malta july 31 1810 says    mrs bruce picked out a pretty picture of a woman in a fashionable   dress in ackermans repository and observed it was vastly like lord   byron i give you warning of this for fear you should make another   conquest and return to england without a curl upon your head surely   the ladies copy delilah when they crop their lovers after this fashion      successful youth why mourn thy ravishd hair     since each lost lock bespeaks a conquerd fair     and young and old conspire to make thee bare    this makes me think of my poor miscellany which is quite dead if   indeed that can be said to be dead which was never alive not a soul   knows or knowing will speak of it again july 15 1811 he writes   the miscellany is so damned that my friends make it a point of   politeness not to mention it ever to me   footnote

stranés conversation being much the same and my ally nicola   1 in bed with a fever i think i may as well talk to you the   rather as you cant answer me and excite my wrath with impertinent   observations at least for three months to come    i will try not to say the same things i have set down in my other   letter of the 2nd but i cant promise as my poor head is still giddy   with my late fever    i saw the lady hesther stanhope 2 at athens and do not admire that   dangerous thing a female wit she told me take her own words that   she had given you a good setdown at malta in some disputation about   the navy from this of course i readily inferred the contrary or in   the words of an acquaintance of ours that you had the best of it    she evinced a similar disposition to argufy with me which i avoided   by either laughing or yielding i despise the sex too much to squabble   with them and i rather wonder you should allow a woman to draw you   into a contest in which however i am sure you had the advantage   she abuses you so bitterly    i have seen too little of the lady to form any decisive opinion but i   have discovered nothing different from other shethings except a   great disregard of received notions in her conversation as well as   conduct i dont know whether this will recommend her to our sex but   i am sure it wont to her own she is going on to constantinople

cutting of throats in my other letter i   mentioned that vely had given me a fine horse on my late visit he   received me with great pomp standing conducted me to the door with   his arm round my waist and a variety of civilities invited me to   meet him at larissa and see his army which i should have accepted   had not this rupture with ibrahim taken place sultan mahmout is in a   phrenzy because vely has not joined the army we have a report here   that the russians have beaten the turks and taken muchtar pacha   prisoner but it is a greek bazaar rumour and not to be believed    i have

dissolution of parliament battle in portugal and all the cream of   forty newspapers    in my tother letter to which i am perpetually obliged to refer i   have offered some moving topics on the head of your miscellany the   neglect of which i attribute to the half guinea annexed as the   indispensable equivalent for the said volume    now i do hope notwithstanding that exorbitant demand that on your   return you will find it selling or what is better sold in   consequence of which you will be able to face the public with your new   volume if that intention still subsists    my journal did i keep one should be yours as it is i can only offer   my sincere wishes for your success if you will believe it possible   for a brother scribbler to be sincere on such an occasion    will you execute

except a bill which i hope is paid before this time will you   visit the said m and if it be a pecuniary matter refer him to   hanson and if not tell me what he means or forward his letter    i have just received an epistle from galt 5 with a candist poem   which it seems i am to forward to you this i would willingly do but   it is too large for a letter and too small for a parcel and besides   appears to be damned nonsense from all which considerations i will   deliver it in person it is entitled the fair shepherdess or rather   herdswoman if you dont like the translation take the original   title greek transliterated hae boskopoula galt also writes   something not very intelligible about a spartan state paper which by   his account is everything but laconic now the said sparta having some   years ceased to be a state what the devil does he mean by a paper he   also adds mysteriously that the affair not being concluded he   cannot at present apply for it    now hobhouse are you mad or is he are these documents for longman    co spartan state papers and cretan rhymes indeed these   circumstances superadded to his house at mycone whither i am   invited and his levant wines make me suspect his sanity athens is   at present infested with english people but they are moving dio   bendetto i am returning to pass a month or two i think the spring   will see me in england but do not let this transpire nor cease to   urge the most dilatory of mortals hanson i have some idea of   purchasing the island of ithaca i suppose you will add me to the   levant lunatics i shall be glad to hear from your signoria of your   welfare politics and literature    your last letter closes pathetically with a postscript about a   nosegay 6 i advise you to introduce that into your next

owed his cool judgment to the grenville blood lady hester inherited the overweening pride generosity courage and fervent heat of the great commoner as well as his indomitable will like him she despised difficulties and ignored the word impossibility her romantic ideas were also combined with keen insight into character and much practical sagacity these were the qualities which made her for

servant whom i send   homewards with some papers of consequence i have been journeying in   different parts of greece for these last four months and you may   expect me in england somewhere about april but this is very dubious   hobhouse you have doubtless seen he went home in august to arrange   materials for a tour he talks of publishing you will find him well   and scribblingthat is scribbling if well and well if scribbling    i suppose you have a score of new works all of which i hope to see   flourishing with a hecatomb of reviews my works are likely to have   a powerful effect with a vengeance as i hear of divers angry people   whom it is proper i should shoot at by way of satisfaction be it so   the same impulse which made otho a warrior will make me one also my   domestic affairs being moreover considerably deranged my appetite for   travelling pretty well satiated with my late peregrinations my   various hopes in this world almost extinct and not very brilliant in   the next i trust i shall go through the process with a creditable   sang froid and not disgrace a line of cutthroat ancestors    i regret in one of your letters to hear you talk of domestic   embarrassments 1 indeed i am at present very well calculated to   sympathise with you on that point i suppose i must take to   dramdrinking as a succedaneum for philosophy though as i am   happily not married i have very little occasion for either just yet    talking of marriage puts me in mind of drury who i suppose has a   dozen children by this time all fine fretful brats i will never   forgive matrimony for having spoiled such an excellent bachelor if   anybody honours my name with an inquiry tell them of my whereabouts   and write if you like it i am living alone in the franciscan   monastery with one friar a capuchin of course and one frier   a bandylegged turkish cook two albanian savages a tartar and a   dragoman my only englishman departs with this and other letters the   day

shortly but   frequently as the arrival of letters where there exists no regular   communication is of course very precarious i have lately made   several small tours of some hundred or two miles about the morea   attica etc as i have finished my grand giro by the troad   constantinople etc and am returned down again to athens i believe   i have mentioned to you more than once that i swam in imitation of   leander though without his lady across the hellespont from sestos   to abydos of this and all other particulars fletcher whom i have   sent home with papers etc will apprise you i cannot find that he   is any loss being tolerably master of the italian and modern greek   languages which last i am also studying with a master i can order   and discourse more than enough for a reasonable man besides the   perpetual lamentations after beef and beer the stupid bigoted   contempt for every thing foreign and insurmountable incapacity of   acquiring even a few words of any language rendered him like all   other english servants an incumbrance i do assure you the plague of   speaking for him the comforts he required more than myself by far   the pilaws a turkish dish of rice and meat which he could not eat   the wines which he could not drink the beds where he could not sleep   and the long list of calamities such as stumbling horses want of   tea etc which assailed him would have made a lasting source of   laughter to a spectator and inconvenience to a master after all the   man is honest enough and in christendom capable enough but in   turkey lord forgive me my albanian soldiers my tartars and   jannissary worked for him and us too as my friend hobhouse can   testify    it is probable i may steer homewards in spring but to enable me to do   that i must have remittances my own funds would have lasted me very   well but i was obliged to assist a friend who i know will pay me   but in the mean time i am out of pocket at present i do not care   to venture a winters voyage even if i were otherwise tired of   travelling but i am so convinced of the advantages of looking at   mankind instead of reading about them and the bitter effects of   staying at home with all the narrow prejudices of an islander that i   think there should be a law amongst us to set our young men abroad   for a term among the few allies our wars have left us    here i see and have conversed with french italians germans danes   greeks turks americans etc etc etc and without losing sight   of my own i can judge of the countries and manners of others where i   see the superiority of england which by the by we are a good deal   mistaken about in many things i am pleased and where i find her   inferior i am at least enlightened now i might have stayed smoked   in your towns or fogged in your country a century without being   sure of this and without acquiring any thing more useful or amusing   at home i keep no journal nor have i any intention of scribbling my   travels i have done with authorship and if in my last production i   have convinced the critics or the world i was something more than they   took me for i am satisfied nor will i hazard that reputation by a   future effort it is true i have some others in manuscript but i   leave them for those who come after me and if deemed worth   publishing they may serve to prolong my memory when i myself shall   cease to remember i have a famous bavarian artist taking some views   of athens etc etc for me this will be better than scribbling a   disease i hope myself cured of i hope on my return to lead a quiet   recluse life but god knows and does best for us all at least so   they say and i have nothing to object as on the whole i have no   reason to complain of my lot i am convinced however that men do   more harm to themselves than ever the devil could do to them i trust   this will find you well and as happy as we can be you will at   least be pleased to hear i am so and    yours ever      152to his mother     athens february 28 1811     dear madamas i have received a firman for egypt etc i shall   proceed to that quarter in the spring and i beg you will state to mr   hanson that it is necessary to send further remittances on the   subject of newstead i answer as before no if it is necessary to   sell sell rochdale fletcher will have arrived by this time with my   letters to that purport i will tell you fairly i have in the first   place no opinion of funded property if by any particular   circumstances i shall be led to adopt such a determination i will   at all events pass my life abroad as my only tie to england is   newstead and that once gone neither interest nor inclination lead   me northward competence in your country is ample wealth in the east   such is the difference in the value of money and the abundance of the   necessaries of life and i feel myself so much a citizen of the world   that the spot where i can enjoy a delicious climate and every luxury   at a less expense than a common college life in england will always   be a country to me and such are in fact the shores of the   archipelago this then is the alternativeif i preserve newstead i   return if i sell it i stay away i have had no letters since yours   of june but i have written several times and shall continue as   usual on the same plan    believe me yours ever byron    psi shall most likely see you in the course of the summer but of   course at such a distance i cannot specify any particular month      153to his mother     volage frigate at sea june 25 1811     dear motherthis letter which will be forwarded on our arrival at   portsmouth probably about the 4th of july is begun about   twentythree days after our departure from malta i have just been two   years to a day on the 2d of july absent from england and i return   to it with much the same feelings which prevailed on my departure   viz indifference but within that apathy i certainly do not comprise   yourself as i will prove by every means in my power you will be good   enough to get my apartments ready at newstead but dont disturb   yourself on any account particularly mine nor consider me in any   other light than as a visiter i must only inform you that for a long   time i have been restricted to an entire vegetable diet neither fish   nor flesh coming within my regimen so i expect a powerful stock of   potatoes greens and biscuit i drink no wine i have two servants   middleaged men and both greeks it is my intention to proceed first   to town to see mr hanson and thence to newstead on my way to   rochdale i have only to beg you will not forget my diet which it is   very necessary for me to observe i am well in health as i have   generally been with the exception of two agues both of which i   quickly got over    my plans will so much depend on circumstances that i shall not   venture to lay down an opinion on the subject my prospects are not   very promising but i suppose we shall wrestle through life like our   neighbours indeed by hansons last advices i have some apprehension   of finding newstead dismantled by messrs brothers1 etc and he   seems determined to force me into selling it but he will be baffled   i dont suppose i shall be much pestered with visiters but if i am   you must receive them for i am determined to have nobody breaking in   upon my retirement you know that i never was fond of society and i   am less so than before i have brought you a shawl and a quantity of   attar of roses but these i must smuggle if possible i trust to find   my library in tolerable order    fletcher is no doubt arrived i shall separate the mill from mr bs   farm for his son is too gay a deceiver to inherit both and place   fletcher in it who has served me faithfully and whose wife is a good   woman besides it is necessary to sober young mr b or he will   people the parish with bastards in a word if he had seduced a   dairymaid he might have found something like an apology but the   girl is his equal and in high life or low life reparation is made in   such circumstances but i shall not interfere further than like   buonaparte by dismembering mr bs kingdom and erecting part of   it into a principality for fieldmarshal fletcher i hope you govern   my little empire and its sad load of national debt with a wary hand   to drop my metaphor i beg leave to subscribe myself    yours ever byron    ps july 14this letter was written to be sent from portsmouth   but on arriving there the squadron was ordered to the nore from   whence i shall forward it this i have not done before supposing you   might be alarmed by the interval mentioned in the letter being longer   than expected between our arrival in port and

years absence to a day on the 2d of july before which we   shall not arrive at portsmouth i am retracing my way to england i   have as you know spent the greater part of that period in turkey   except two months in spain and portugal which were then accessible i   have seen every thing most remarkable in turkey particularly the   troad greece constantinople and albania into which last region   very few have penetrated so high as hobhouse and myself i dont know   that i have done anything to distinguish me from other voyagers   unless you will reckon my swimming from sestos to abydos on may 3d   1810 a tolerable feat for a modern    i am coming back with little prospect of pleasure at home and with a   body a little shaken by one or two smart fevers but a spirit i hope   yet unbroken my affairs it seems are considerably involved and   much business must be done with lawyers colliers farmers and   creditors now this to a man who hates bustle as he hates a bishop   is a serious concern but enough of my home department    i find i have been scolding cawthorn without a cause as i found two   parcels with two letters from you on my return to malta by these it   appears you have not received a letter from constantinople addressed   to longmans but it was of no consequence    my satire it seems is in a fourth edition a success rather above   the middling run but not much for a production which from its   topics must be temporary and of course be successful at first or   not at all at this period when i can think and act more coolly i   regret that i have written it though i shall probably find it   forgotten by all except those whom it has offended my friend   hobhouses miscellany has not succeeded but he himself writes so   goodhumouredly on the subject i dont know whether to laugh or cry   with him he met with your son at cadiz of whom he speaks highly    yours and pratts 1 protégé blacket 2 the cobbler is dead in   spite of his rhymes and is probably one of

verse making but you have made him   immortal with a vengeance i write this supposing poetry patronage   and strong waters to have been the death of him if you are in town   in or about the beginning of july you will find me at dorants in   albemarle street glad to see you1 i have an imitation of horaces   art of poetry ready for cawthorn but dont let that deter you for   i shant inflict it upon

lord byron pp 127 128 occurs the following passage from which if dallass grammar is to be trusted it seems that the famous epitaph on blacket was not byrons composition dallas    was persuaded by mr pratts warmth to see some sparkling of genius   in the effusions of this young man blacket it was upon this that   lord byron and a young friend of his were sometimes playful in   conversation and in writing to me i see says the latter that   blacket the son of crispin and apollo is dead looking into boswells   life of johnson the other day i saw we were talking about the   famous mr wordsworth the poetical shoemaker now i never before   heard that there had been a mr wordsworth a poet a shoemaker or a   famous man and i dare say you have never heard of him thus it will   be with bloomfield and blacketttheir names two years after their   death will be found neither on the rolls of curriers hall nor of   parnassus who would think that anybody would be such a blockhead as   to sin against an express proverb ne sutor ultra crepidam      but spare him ye critics his follies are past     for the cobler is come as he ought to his last    which two lines with a scratch under last to show where the joke   lies i beg that you will prevail on miss milbanke to have inserted on   the tomb of her departed blacket  it should be added that the shoemaking poet was not wordsworth but woodhouse

shall have completed to a day two years of peregrination   from which i am returning with as little emotion as i set out i   think upon the whole i was more grieved at leaving greece than   england which i am impatient to see simply because i am tired of a   long voyage    indeed my prospects are not very pleasant embarrassed in my private   affairs indifferent to public solitary without the wish to be   social with a body a little enfeebled by a succession of fevers but   a spirit i trust yet unbroken i am returning home without a hope   and almost without a desire the first thing i shall have to encounter   will be a lawyer the next a creditor then colliers farmers   surveyors and all the agreeable attachments to estates out of repair   and contested coalpits in short i am sick and sorry and when i   have a little repaired my irreparable affairs away i shall march   either to campaign in spain or back again to the east where i can at   least have cloudless skies and a cessation from impertinence    i trust to meet or see you in town or at newstead whenever you can   make it convenienti suppose you are in love and in poetry as usual   that husband h drury has never

copyrights good will and lease to john murray and retired to a country farm in hertfordshire he declined to publish childe harold on the grounds that it contained sceptical stanzas and attacked lord

heart  gray to nicholls works vol i p 482   footnote 3 one of byrons first acts on returning to england was to buy a copy of the scourge in ridgways bill for books supplied from piccadilly to byron on july 24 1811 is a copy of the scourge at 2s 6d hewson clarke 17871832 was entered at emanuel college cambridge apparently as a sizar in 1806 obliged to leave the university before he had taken his degree he supported himself in london by his pen he wrote two historical worksa continuation of humes history of england 1832 and an impartial history of the naval etc events in europe from the french revolution to the peace of 1815 it was however as a journalist that he came into collision with byron in the satirist a monthly magazine illustrated with coloured cartoons three attacks were made on byron which he attributed to clarke  1 october 1807 vol i pp 7781 a review of hours of idleness  2 june 1808 vol ii p 368 verses on lord bn to his bear to the tune of lo chin y gair  3 august 1808 vol

an article headed lord byron in which the alleged libel occurred    we are unacquainted says the article with any act of cowardice   that can be compared with that of keeping a libel ready cut and   dried till some favourable opportunity enable its author to disperse   it without the hazard of personal responsibility and under   circumstances which deprive the injured party of every means of   reparation  he confined the knowledge of his lampoon therefore to   the circle of his own immediate friends and left it to be given to   the public as soon as he should have bid adieu to the shores of   britain whether his voyage was in reality no further than to paris   in search of the proofs of his own legitimacy or as he asserts to   africs coasts and calpes adverse height was of little   consequence to mr clarke who felt that to recriminate during his   absence would be unworthy of his character  considering the two   parties not as writers but as men mr clarke might confidently   appeal to the knowledge and opinion of the whole university but a   character like his disdains comparison with that of his noble   calumniator a temper unruffled by malignant passions a mind superior   to vicissitude are gifts for which the pride of doubtful birth and   the temporary possession of newstead abbey are contemptible   equivalents     it may be reasonably asked whether to be a denizen of   berwickupontweed be more disgraceful than to be the illegitimate   descendant of a murderer whether to labour in an honourable   profession for the peace and competence of maturer age be less worthy   of praise than to waste the property of others in vulgar debauchery   whether to be the offspring of parents whose only crime is their want   of title be not as honourable as to be the son of a profligate   father and a mother whose days and nights are spent in the delirium   of drunkenness and finally whether to deserve the kindness of his   own college to obtain its prizes and to prepare himself for any   examination that might entitle him to share the highest honours which   the university can bestow be less indicative of talent and virtue   than to be held up to the derision and

on   the subject he was my oldest friend and though quite unworthy of   his attachment i believe that i was an object of his regard    i now fear that i have not been sufficiently at all times just

for cork it is with   difficulty i bring myself to talk of my paltry concerns but i cannot   refuse giving you such information as may enable me to hear from one   of the friends that i have still left pray do give me a line nothing   is more selfish than sorrow his great and unrivalled talents were   observable by all his kindness was known to his friends you   recollect how affectionately he shook my hand at parting it was the   last time you ever saw himdid you think it would be the last but   three days before his death he told me in a letter that he had heard   from you on friday he wrote to me again and on saturdayalas alas   we are not stocks or stonesevery word of our friend davies letter   still pierces me to the soulsuch a man and such a death i would   that he had not been so minute in his horrid details oh my dear   byron do write to me i am very very sick at heart indeed and   after various efforts to write upon my own concerns i still revert to   the same melancholy subject i wrote to cawthorn today but knew not   what i said to him half my incitement to finish that task is for ever   gone i can neither have his assistance during my labour his comfort   if i should fail nor his congratulation if i should succeed forgive   me i do not forget youbut i cannot but remember him    ever your obliged and faithful john c hobhouse  byron had apparently suggested that hobhouse should write some brief record of his friend hobhouse replies from enniscorthy september 13 1811    the melancholy subject of your last in spite of every effort   perpetually recurs to me it is indeed a hard science to forget   though i cannot but think that it is the wisest and indeed the only   remedy for grief i should be quite incapable every way of doing what   you mention and i could not even set about such a melancholy task   with spirit or prospect of success the thing may be better done by a   person less interested than myself in so cruel a catastrophe whatever   you say in your book will be well said and do credit both to your   heart and head how much would it have gratified him who shall neer   hear it   footnote 2 dallas had written on july 29 to protest on

are superfluous   and unavailing i leave the dead to their rest and return to the dull   business of life which however presents nothing very pleasant to me   either in prospect or retrospection    i hear you have been increasing his majestys subjects which in these   times of war and tribulation is really patriotic notwithstanding   malthus 1 tells us that were it not for battle murder and sudden   death we should be overstocked i think we have latterly had a   redundance of these national benefits and therefore i give you all   credit for your matronly behaviour    i believe you know that for upwards of two years i have been rambling   round the archipelago and am returned just in time to know that i   might as well have staid away for any good i ever have done or am   likely to do at home and so as soon as i have somewhat repaired my   irreparable affairs i shall een go abroad again for i am heartily   sick of your climate and every thing it rains upon always save and   except yourself as in duty bound    i should be glad to see you here as i think you have never seen the   place if you could make it convenient murray is still like a rock   and will probably outlast some six lords

same time   subject to a kind of hysterical merriment or rather laughter without   merriment which i can neither account for nor conquer and yet i do   not feel relieved by it but an indifferent person would think me in   excellent spirits we must forget these things and have recourse to   our old selfish comforts or rather comfortable selfishness    i do not think i shall return to london immediately and shall   therefore accept freely what is offered courteouslyyour mediation   between me and murray 1 i dont think my name will answer the   purpose and you must be aware that my plaguy satire will bring the   north and south grub streets down upon the pilgrimagebut   nevertheless if murray makes a point of it and you coincide with   him i will do it daringly so let it be entitled by the author of   english bards and scotch reviewers my remarks on the romaic etc   once intended to accompany the hints from horace shall go along   with the other as being indeed more appropriate also the smaller   poems now in my possession with a few selected from those published   in hobhouses miscellany i have found amongst my poor mothers   papers all my letters from the east and one in particular of some   length from albania from this if necessary i can work up a note or   two on that subject as i kept no journal the letters written on the   spot are the best but of this anon when we have definitively   arranged    has murray shown the work to any one he maybut i will have no   traps for applause of course there are little things i would wish to   alter and perhaps the two stanzas of a buffooning cast on londons   sunday are as well left out i much wish to avoid identifying childe   harolds character with mine and that in sooth is my second   objection to my name appearing in the titlepage when you have made   arrangements as to time size type etc favour me with a reply i   am giving you an universe of trouble which thanks cannot atone for i   made a kind of prose apology for my scepticism at the head of the ms   which on recollection is so much more like an attack than a defence   that haply it might better be omittedperpend pronounce after   all i fear murray will be in a scrape with the orthodox but i cannot   help it though i wish him well through it as for me i have supped   full of criticism and i dont think that the most dismal treatise   will stir and rouse my fell of hair till birnam wood do come to   dunsinane    i shall continue to write at intervals and hope you will pay me in   kind how does pratt get on or rather get off joe blacketts   posthumous stock you killed that poor man amongst you in spite of   your ionian friend 2 and myself who would have saved him from   pratt poetry present poverty and posthumous oblivion cruel   patronage to ruin a man at his calling but then he is a divine   subject for subscription and biography and pratt who makes the most   of his dedications has inscribed the volume to no less than five   families of distinction    i am sorry you dont like harry white 3 with a great deal of cant   which in him was sincere indeed it killed him as you killed joe   blackett certes there is poesy and genius i dont say this on   account of my simile and rhymes but surely he was beyond all the   bloomfields 4 and blacketts and their collateral cobblers whom   lofft 5 and pratt have or may kidnap from their calling into the   service of the trade you must excuse my flippancy for i am writing i   know not what to escape from myself hobhouse is gone to ireland mr   davies has been here on his way to harrowgate    you did not know matthews he was a man of the most astonishing   powers as he sufficiently proved at cambridge by carrying off more   prizes and fellowships against the ablest candidates than any other   graduate on record but a most decided atheist indeed noxiously so   for he proclaimed his principles in all societies i knew him well   and feel a loss not easily to be supplied to myselfto hobhouse   never let me hear from you and    believe me etc    footnote 1 in 1793 john murray the first born 1745 died leaving a widow two daughters and one son john murray the second 17781843 then a boy of fifteen the bookselling and publishing business at 32 fleet street which the first john murray had purchased in 1768 from william sandby was for two years carried on by the chief assistant samuel highley from 1795 when john murray the second joined it it was conducted as a partnership under the title of murray and highley but in 1803 john murray cancelled the partnership and started for himself at 32 fleet street relieved from a timorous partner he at once displayed his shrewdness energy and literary enthusiasm he rapidly became as byron called him the greek transliterated anax of publishers or as he was nicknamed the emperor of the west in february 1809 he had launched the quarterly review in march 1812 he published childe harold in the following september he moved to 50 albemarle street the lease of which with the stock good will and copyrights he purchased from william miller see page 319 letter 158 footnote 2 1 the remarkable position which the second john murray created for himself has two aspects one commercial the other social he was not only the publisher but the friend of the most distinguished men of the day and he was both by reason partly of his honourable character partly of his personal attractiveness sir walter scott writing october 30 1828 to lockhart speaks of murray in words which sum up his character    by all means do what the emperor says he is what emperor nap was   not much a gentleman  murray was the first to divorce the business of publishing from that of selling books the first to see as he wrote to sir walter scott october 13 1825 a publisher and his friends vol ii p 199 that    the business of a publishing bookseller is not in his shop or even   his connection but in his brains  quicktempered and warmhearted he was endowed with a strong sense of humour and a gift of felicitous expression which made him at once an admirable talker and an excellent letterwriter and enabled him to hold his own among the noted wits and brilliant men of letters whom he gathered under his roof a man of ideas more than a man of business of enterprise rather than of calculation he was always on the watch for new writers and new openings but his imagination and impulsive temperament were checked by his fine taste for sound literature and controlled by high principles in matters of trade thus he was saved from those disastrous speculations which involved scott in ruin and might otherwise have appealed with fatal force to his own sanguine nature his close relations with byron which began in 1811 and lasted till the poets death are set forth in the numerous letters which follow and were never embittered even when he refused to continue the publication of don juan their names are inseparably associated in the history of literature a generous paymaster he was also an hospitable host round him gathers much of the literary history of a halfcentury which includes such names as those of scott byron southey coleridge hallam milman mahon carlyle grote benjamin disraeli sir robert peel canning and mr gladstone his literary dinners were famous and his drawingroom was the rallyingplace of all that was witty and agreeable in society at the same time he was the acknowledged head of the publishing trade unswerving in the rectitude of his commercial dealings and in the maintenance of the honourable traditions of his most distinguished predecessors as well as sincere in his enthusiasm for english letters   footnote 2 walter rodwell wright author of horae ionicae a poem descriptive of

you may have heard of the sudden death of my mother and poor   matthews which with that of wingfield of which i was not fully   aware till just before i left town and indeed hardly believed it   has made a sad chasm in my connections indeed the blows followed each   other so rapidly that i am yet stupid from the shock and though i do   eat and drink and talk and even laugh at times yet i can hardly   persuade myself that i am awake did not every morning convince me   mournfully to the contraryi shall now wave the subjectthe dead   are at rest and none but the dead can be so    you will feel for poor hobhousematthews was the god of his   idolatry and if intellect could exalt a man above his fellows no   one could refuse him preeminence i knew him most intimately and   valued him

lyric ballads a collection which has not undeservedly met with a considerable share of public applause the characteristics of mr wordsworths muse are simple and flowing though occasionally inharmonious verse strong and sometimes irresistible appeals to the feelings with unexceptionable sentiments though the present work may not equal his former efforts many of the poems possess a native elegance natural and unaffected totally devoid of the tinsel embellishments and abstract hyperboles of several contemporary sonneteers the last sonnet in the first volume p 152 is perhaps the best

the cow jumpd over the moon   the little dog laughd to see such sport   and the dish ran away with the spoon   on the whole however with the exception of the above and other innocent odes of the same cast we think these volumes display a genius worthy of higher pursuits and regret that mr w confines his muse to such trifling subjects we trust his motto will be in future paulo majora canamus many with inferior abilities have acquired a loftier seat on parnassus merely by attempting strains in which wordsworth is more qualified to excel      appendix ii  article from the edinburgh review  for january 1808   hours of idleness a series of poems original and translated by george gordon lord byron a minor 8vo pp 200 newark 1807   the poesy of this young lord belongs to the class which neither gods nor men are said to permit indeed we do not recollect to have seen a quantity of verse with so few deviations in either direction from that exact standard his effusions are spread over a dead flat and can no more get above or below the level than if they were so much stagnant water as an extenuation of this offence the noble author is peculiarly forward in pleading minority we have it in the titlepage and on the very back of the volume it follows his name like a favourite part of his style much stress is laid upon it in the preface and the poems are connected with this general statement of his case by particular dates substantiating the age at which each was written now the law upon the point of minority we hold to be perfectly clear it is a plea available only to the defendant no plaintiff can offer it as a supplementary ground of action thus if any suit could be brought against lord byron for the purpose of compelling him to put into court a certain quantity of poetry and if judgment were given against him it is highly probable that an exception would be taken were he to deliver for poetry the contents of this volume to this he might plead minority but as he now makes voluntary tender of the article he hath no right to sue on that ground for the price in good current praise should the goods be unmarketable  this is our view of the law on the point and we dare to say so will it be ruled perhaps however in reality all that he tells us about his youth is rather with a view to increase our wonder than to soften our censures he possibly means to say see how a minor can write this poem was actually composed by a young man of eighteen and this by one of only sixteen but alas we all remember the poetry of cowley at ten and pope at twelve and so far from hearing with any degree of surprise that very poor verses were written by a youth from his leaving school to his leaving college inclusive we really believe this to be the most common of all occurrences that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who are educated in england and that the tenth man writes better verse than lord byron  his other plea of privilege our author rather brings forward in order to waive it he certainly however does allude frequently to his family and ancestrysometimes in poetry sometimes in notes and while giving up his claim on the score of rank he takes care to remember us of dr johnsons saying that when a nobleman appears as an author his merit should be handsomely acknowledged in truth it is this consideration only that induces us to give lord byrons poems a place in our review beside our desire to counsel him that he do forthwith abandon poetry and turn his talents which are considerable and his opportunities which are great to better account  with this view we must beg leave seriously to assure him that the mere rhyming of the final syllable even when accompanied by the presence of a certain number of feetnay although which does not always happen those feet should scan regularly and have been all counted accurately upon the fingersis not the whole art of poetry we would entreat him to believe that a certain portion of liveliness somewhat of fancy is necessary to constitute a poem and that a poem in the present day to be read must contain at least one thought either in a little degree different from the ideas of former writers or differently expressed we put it to his candour whether there is any thing so deserving the name of poetry in verses like the following written in 1806 and whether if a youth of eighteen could say any thing so uninteresting to his ancestors a youth of nineteen should publish it     shades of heroes farewell your descendant departing      from the seat of his ancestors bids you adieu   abroad or at home your remembrance imparting      new courage hell think upon glory and you    though a tear dim his eye at this sad separation      tis nature not fear that excites his regret   far distant he goes with the same emulation      the fame of his fathers he neer can forget    that fame and that memory still will he cherish      he vows that he neer will disgrace your renown   like you will he live or like you will he perish      when decayd may he mingle his dust with your own   now we positively do assert that there is nothing better than these stanzas in the whole compass of the noble minors volume  lord byron should also have a care of attempting what the greatest poets have done before him for comparisons as he must have had occasion to see at his writingmasters are odious grays ode on eton college should really have kept out the ten hobbling stanzas on a distant view of the village and school of harrow     where fancy yet joys to retrace the resemblance     of comrades in friendship and mischief allied   how welcome to me your neerfading remembrance     which rests in the bosom though hope is denied   in like manner the exquisite lines of mr rogers on a tear might have warned the noble author off those premises and spared us a whole dozen such stanzas as the following     mild charitys glow to us mortals below     shows the soul from barbarity clear   compassion will melt where this virtue is felt     and its dew is diffused in a tear    the man doomd to sail with the blast of the gale     through billows atlantic to steer   as he bends oer the wave which may soon be his grave     the green sparkles bright with a tear   and so of instances in which former poets have failed thus we do not think lord byron was made for translating during his nonage adrians address to his soul when pope succeeded so indifferently in the attempt if our readers however are of another opinion they may look at it     ah gentle fleeting wavering sprite   friend and associate of this clay     to what unknown region borne   wilt thou now wing thy distant flight   no more with wonted humour gay     but pallid cheerless and forlorn   however be this as it may we fear his translations and imitations are great favourites with lord byron we have them of all kinds from anacreon to ossian and viewing them as school exercises they may pass only why print them after they have had their day and served their turn and why call the thing in p 79 see p 380 a translation where two words grthelo legein of the original are expanded into four lines and the other thing in p 81 see ibid where gr mesonuktiais poth horais is rendered by means of six hobbling verses as to his ossianic poesy we are not very good judges being in truth so moderately skilled in that species of composition that we should in all probability be criticizing some bit of the genuine macpherson itself were we to express our opinion of lord byrons rhapsodies if then the following beginning of a song of bards is by his lordship we venture to object to it as far as we can comprehend it what form rises on the roar of clouds whose dark ghost gleams on the red stream of tempests his voice rolls on the thunder tis orla the brown chief of oithona he was etc after detaining this brown chief some time the bards conclude by giving him their advice to raise his fair locks then to spread them on the arch of the rainbow and to smile through the tears of the storm  of this kind of thing there are no less than nine pages and we can so far venture an opinion in their favour that they look very like macpherson and we are positive they are pretty nearly as stupid and tiresome  it is a sort of privilege of poets to be egotists but they should use it as not abusing it and particularly one who piques himself though indeed at the ripe age of nineteen on being an infant bardthe artless helicon i boast is youthshould either not know or should seem not to know so much about his own ancestry besides a poem above cited on the family seat of the byrons we have another of eleven pages on the selfsame subject introduced with an apology he certainly had no intention of inserting it but really the particular request of some friends etc etc it concludes with five stanzas on himself the last and youngest of a noble line there is a good deal also about his maternal ancestors in a poem on lachin y gair a mountain where he spent part of his youth and might have learnt that pibroch is not a bagpipe any more than duet means a fiddle  as the author has dedicated so large a part of his volume to immortalise his employments at school and college we cannot possibly dismiss it without presenting the reader with a specimen of these ingenious effusions in an ode with a greek motto called granta we have the following magnificent stanzas     there in apartments small and damp     the candidate for college prizes   sits poring by the midnight lamp     goes late to bed yet early rises    who reads false quantities in sele     or puzzles oer the deep triangle   deprived of many a wholesome meal     in barbarous latin doomd to wrangle    renouncing every pleasing page     from authors of historic use   preferring to the letterd sage     the square of the hypothenuse    still harmless are these occupations     that hurt none but the hapless student   compared with other recreations     which bring together the imprudent   we are sorry to hear so bad an account of the college psalmody as is contained in the following attic stanzas     our choir would scarcely be excused     even as a band of raw beginners   all mercy now must be refused     to such a set of croaking sinners    if david when his toils were ended     had heard these blockheads sing before him   to us his psalms had neer descended     in furious mood he would have tore em   but whatever judgment may be passed on the poems of this noble minor it seems we must take them as we find them and be content for they are the last we shall ever have from him he is at best he says but an intruder into the groves of parnassus he never lived in a garret like thoroughbred poets and though he once roved a careless mountaineer in the highlands of scotland he has not of late enjoyed this advantage moreover he expects no profit from his publication and whether it succeeds or not it is highly improbable from his situation and pursuits hereafter that he should again condescend to become an author therefore let us take what we get and be thankful what right have we poor devils to be nice we are well off to have got so much from a man of this lords station who does not live in a garret but has the sway of newstead abbey again we say let us be thankful and with honest sancho bid god bless the giver nor look the gift horse in the mouth      appendix iii  review of gells geography of ithaca and itinerary of greece  from the monthly review for august 1811  that laudable curiosity concerning the remains of classical antiquity which has of late years increased among our countrymen is in no traveller or author more conspicuous than in mr gell whatever difference of opinion may yet exist with regard to the success of the several disputants in the famous trojan controversy 1 or indeed relating to the present authors merits as an inspector of the troad it must universally be acknowledged that any work which more forcibly impresses on our imaginations the scenes of heroic action and the subjects of immortal song possesses claims on the attention of every scholar  of the two works which now demand our report we conceive the former to be by far the most interesting to the reader as the latter is indisputably the most serviceable to the traveller excepting indeed the running commentary which it contains on a number of extracts from pausanias and strabo it is as the title imports a mere itinerary of greece or rather of argolis only in its present circumstances this being the case surely it would have answered every purpose of utility much better by being printed as a pocket roadbook of that part of the morea for a quarto is a very unmanageable travelling companion the maps 2 and drawings we shall be told would not permit such an arrangement but as to the drawings they are not in general to be admired as specimens of the art and several of them as we have been assured by eyewitnesses of the scenes which they describe do not compensate for their mediocrity in point of execution by any extraordinary fidelity of representation others indeed are more faithful according to our informants the true reason however for this costly mode of publication is in course to be found in a desire of gratifying the public passion for large margins and all the luxury of typography and we have before expressed our dissatisfaction with mr gells aristocratical mode of communicating a species of knowledge which ought to be accessible to a much greater portion of classical students than can at present acquire it by his meansbut as such expostulations are generally useless we shall be thankful for what we can obtain and that in the manner in which mr gell has chosen to present it  the former of these volumes we have observed is the most attractive in the closet it comprehends a very full survey of the farfamed island which the hero of the odyssey has immortalized for we really are inclined to think that the author has established the identity of the modern theaki with the ithaca of homer at all events if it be an illusion it is a very agreeable deception and is effected by an ingenious interpretation of the passages in homer that are supposed to be descriptive of the scenes which our traveller has visited we shall extract some of these adaptations of the ancient picture to the modern scene marking the points of resemblance which appear to be strained and forced as well as those which are more easy and natural but we must first insert some preliminary matter from the opening chapter the following passage conveys a sort of general sketch of the book which may give our readers a tolerably adequate notion of its contents    the present work may adduce by a simple and correct survey of the   island coincidences in its geography in its natural productions and   moral state before unnoticed some will be directly pointed out the   fancy or ingenuity of the reader may be employed in tracing others   the mind familiar with the imagery of the odyssey will   recognise with satisfaction the scenes themselves and this volume is   offered to the public not entirely without hopes of vindicating the   poem of homer from the scepticism of those critics who imagine that   the odyssey is a mere poetical composition unsupported by   history and unconnected with the localities of any particular   situation    some have asserted that in the comparison of places now existing   with the descriptions of homer we ought not to expect coincidence in   minute details yet it seems only by these that the kingdom of   ulysses or any other can be identified as if such an idea be   admitted every small and rocky island in the ionian sea containing a   good port might with equal plausibility assume the appellation of   ithaca    the venetian geographers have in a great degree contributed to raise   those doubts which have existed on the identity of the modern with the   ancient ithaca by giving in their charts the name of val di compare   to the island that name is however totally unknown in the country   where the isle is invariably called ithaca by the upper ranks and   theaki by the vulgar the venetians have equally corrupted the name of   almost every place in greece yet as the natives of epactos or   naupactos never heard of lepanto those of zacynthos of zante or the   athenians of settines it would be as unfair to rob ithaca of its   name on such authority as it would be to assert that no such island   existed because no tolerable representation of its form can be found   in the venetian surveys    the rare medals of the island of which three are represented in the   titlepage might be adduced as a proof that the name of ithaca was   not lost during the reigns of the roman emperors they have the head   of ulysses recognised by the pileum or pointed cap while the   reverse of one presents the figure of a cock the emblem of his   vigilance with the legend greekithakon a few of these medals are   preserved in the cabinets of the curious and one also with the cock   found in the island is in the possession of signor zavo of bathi   the uppermost coin is in the collection of dr hunter the second is   copied from newman and the third is the property of rp knight esq    several inscriptions which will be hereafter produced will tend to   the confirmation of the idea that ithaca was inhabited about the time   when the romans were masters of greece yet there is every reason to   believe that few if any of the present proprietors of the soil are   descended from ancestors who had long resided successively in the   island even those who lived at the time of ulysses in ithaca seem   to have been on the point of emigrating to argos and no chief   remained after the second in descent from that hero worthy of being   recorded in history it appears that the isle has been twice colonised   from cephalonia in modern times and i was informed that a grant had   been made by the venetians entitling each settler in ithaca to as   much land as his circumstances would enable him to cultivate  mr gell then proceeds to invalidate the authority of previous writers on the subject of ithaca sir george wheeler and m le chevalier fall under his severe animadversion and indeed according to his account neither of these gentlemen had visited the island and the description of the latter is absolutely too absurd for refutation in another place he speaks of m le c disgracing a work of such merit by the introduction of such fabrications again of the inaccuracy of the authors maps and lastly of his inserting an island at the southern entry of the channel between cephalonia and ithaca which has no existence this observation very nearly approaches to the use of that monosyllable which gibbon 3 without expressing it so adroitly applied to some assertion of his antagonist mr davies in truth our travellers words are rather bitter towards his brother tourist but we must conclude that their justice warrants their severity  in the second chapter the author describes his landing in ithaca and arrival at the rock korax and the fountain arethusa as he designates it with sufficient positivenessthis rock now known by the name of korax or koraka petra he contends to be the same with that which homer mentions as contiguous to the habitation of eumæus the faithful swineherd of ulysseswe shall take the liberty of adding to our extracts from mr gell some of the passages in homer to which he refers only conceiving this to be the fairest method of exhibiting the strength or the weakness of his argument    ulysses he observes came to the extremity of the isle to visit   eumæus and that extremity was the most southern for telemachus   coming from pylos touched at the first southeastern part of ithaca   with the same intention   greek    kai tote dae r odysaea kakos pothen aegage daimon   agrou ep eschatiaen hothi domata naie subotaes   enth aelthen philos uhios odyssaeos theioio   ek pylon aemathoentos ion sun naei melainae

appear to justify the author in his attempt to identify the situation of his rock and fountain with the place of those mentioned by homer but let us now follow him in the closer description of the sceneafter some account of the subjects in the plate affixed mr gell remarks    it is impossible to visit this sequestered spot without being struck   with the recollection of the fount of arethusa and the rock korax   which the poet mentions in the same line adding that there the swine   ate the sweet 4 acorns and drank the black water     greek    daeeis ton ge suessi paraemenon ai de nemontai   par korakos petrae epi te kraenae arethousae   esthousai balanon menoeikea kai melan hudor   pinousai    odyssei n     having passed some time at the fountain taken a drawing and made   the necessary observations on the situation of the place we proceeded   to an examination of the precipice climbing over the terraces above   the source among shady figtrees which however did not prevent us   from feeling the powerful effects of the midday sun after a short   but fatiguing ascent we arrived at the rock which extends in a vast   perpendicular semicircle beautifully fringed with trees facing to   the southeast under the crag we found two caves of inconsiderable   extent the entrance of one of which not difficult of access is seen   in the view of the fount they are still the resort of sheep and   goats and in one of them are small natural receptacles for the water   covered by a stalagmatic incrustation    these caves being at the extremity of the curve formed by the   precipice open toward the south and present us with another   accompaniment of the fount of arethusa mentioned by the poet who   informs us that the swineherd eumæus left his guests in the house   whilst he putting on a thick garment went to sleep near the herd   under the hollow of the rock which sheltered him from the northern   blast now we know that the herd fed near the fount for minerva tells   ulysses that he is to go first to eumæus whom he should find with   the swine near the rock korax and the fount of arethusa as the swine   then fed at the fountain so it is necessary that a cavern should be   found in its vicinity and this seems to coincide in distance and   situation with that of the poem near the fount also was the fold or   stathmos of eumæus for the goddess informs ulysses that he should   find his faithful servant at or above the fount    now the hero meets the swineherd close to the fold which was   consequently very near that source at the top of the rock and just   above the spot where the waterfall shoots down the precipice is at   this day a stagni or pastoral dwelling which the herdsmen of ithaca   still inhabit on account of the water necessary for their cattle one   of these people walked on the verge of the precipice at the time of   our visit to the place and seemed so anxious to know how we had been   conveyed to the spot that his inquiries reminded us of a question   probably not uncommon in the days of homer who more than once   represents the ithacences demanding of strangers what ship had brought   them to the island it being evident they could not come on foot he   told us that there was on the summit where he stood a small cistern   of water and a kalybea or shepherds hut there are also vestiges of   ancient habitations and the place is now called amarâthia    convenience as well as safety seems to have pointed out the lofty   situation of amarâthia as a fit place for the residence of the   herdsmen of this part of the island from the earliest ages a small   source of water is a treasure in these climates and if the   inhabitants of ithaca now select a rugged and elevated spot to secure   them from the robbers of the echinades it is to be recollected that   the taphian pirates were not less formidable even in the days of   ulysses and that a residence in a solitary part of the island far   from the fortress and close to a celebrated fountain must at all   times have been dangerous without some such security as the rocks of   korax indeed there can be no doubt that the house of eumæus was on   the top of the precipice for ulysses in order to evince the truth of   his story to the swineherd desires to be thrown from the summit if   his narration does not prove correct    near the bottom of the precipice is a curious natural gallery about   seven feet high which is expressed in the plate it may be fairly   presumed from the very remarkable coincidence between this place and   the homeric account that this was the scene designated by the poet as   the fountain of arethusa and the residence of eumæus and perhaps   it would be impossible to find another spot which bears at this day   so strong a resemblance to a poetic description composed at a period   so very remote there is no other fountain in this part of the island   nor any rock which bears the slightest resemblance to the korax of   homer    the stathmos of the good eumæus appears to have been little   different either in use or construction from the stagni and kalybea   of the present day the poet expressly mentions that other herdsmen   drove their flocks into the city at sunseta custom which still   prevails throughout greece during the winter and that was the season   in which ulysses visited eumæus yet homer accounts for this deviation   from the prevailing custom by observing that he had retired from the   city to avoid the suitors of penelope these trifling occurrences   afford a strong presumption that the ithaca of homer was something   more than the creature of his own fancy as some have supposed it for   though the grand outline of a fable may be easily imagined yet the   consistent adaptation of minute incidents to a long and elaborate   falsehood is a task of the most arduous and complicated nature   after this long extract by which we have endeavoured to do justice to mr gells argument we cannot allow room for any farther quotations of such extent and we must offer a brief and imperfect analysis of the remainder of the work in the third chapter the traveller arrives at the capital and in the fourth he describes it in an agreeable manner we select his account of the mode of celebrating a christian festival in the greek church     we were present at the celebration of the feast of the ascension   when the citizens appeared in their gayest dresses and saluted each   other in the streets with demonstrations of pleasure as we sate at   breakfast in the house of signer zavo we were suddenly roused by the   discharge of a gun succeeded by a tremendous crash of pottery which   fell on the tiles steps and pavements in every direction the bells   of the numerous churches commenced a most discordant jingle colours   were hoisted on every mast in the port and a general shout of joy   announced some great event our host informed us that the feast of the   ascension was annually commemorated in this manner at bathi the   populace exclaiming greek anestae o christos alaethinos o theos   christ is risen the true god   in another passage he continues this account as follows    in the evening of the festival the inhabitants danced before their   houses and at one we saw the figure which is said to have been first   used by the youths and virgins of delos at the happy return of   theseus from the expedition of the cretan labyrinth it has now lost   much of that intricacy which was supposed to allude to the windings of   the habitation of the minotaur  etc etc this is rather too much for even the inflexible gravity of our censorial muscles when the author talks with all the reality if we may use the expression of a lemprière on the stories of the fabulous ages we cannot refrain from indulging a momentary smile nor can we seriously accompany him in the learned architectural detail by which he endeavours to give us from the odyssey the groundplot of the house of ulyssesof which he actually offers a plan in drawing showing how the description of the house of ulysses in the odyssey may be supposed to correspond with the foundations yet visible on the hill of aitooh foote foote why are you lost to such inviting subjects for your ludicrous pencilin his account of this celebrated mansion mr gell says one side of the court seems to have been occupied by the thalamos or sleeping apartments of the men etc etc and in confirmation of this hypothesis he refers to the 10th odyssey line 340 on examining his reference we read    greek es thalamon t ienai kai saes epibaemenai eunaes  where ulysses records an invitation which he received from circe to take a part of her bed how this illustrates the above conjecture we are at a loss to divine but we suppose that some numerical error has occurred in the reference as we have detected a trifling mistake or two of the same nature  mr g labours hard to identify the cave of dexia near bathi the capital of the island with the grotto of the nymphs described in the 13th odyssey we are disposed to grant that he has succeeded but we cannot here enter into the proofs by which he supports his opinion and we can only extract one of the concluding sentences of the chapter which appears to us candid and judicious     whatever opinion may be formed as to the identity of the cave of   dexia with the grotto of the nymphs it is fair to state that strabo   positively asserts that no such cave as that described by homer   existed in his time and that geographer thought it better to assign a   physical change rather than ignorance in homer to account for a   difference which he imagined to exist between the ithaca of his time   and that of the poet but strabo who was an uncommonly accurate   observer with respect to countries surveyed by himself appears to   have been wretchedly misled by his informers on many occasions    that strabo had never visited this country is evident not only from   his inaccurate account of it but from his citation of apollodorus and   scepsius whose relations are in direct opposition to each other on   the subject of ithaca as will be demonstrated on a future   opportunity   we must however observe that demonstration is a strong termin his description of the leucadian promontory of which we have a pleasing representation in the plate the author remarks that it is celebrated for the leap of sappho and the death of artemisia from this variety in the expression a reader would hardly conceive that both the ladies perished in the same manner in fact the sentence is as proper as it would be to talk of the decapitation of russell and the death of sidney the view from this promontory includes the island of corfu and the name suggests to mr gell the following note which though rather irrelevant is of a curious nature and we therefore conclude our citations by transcribing it     it has been generally supposed that corfu or corcyra was the   phæacia of homer but sir henry englefield thinks the position of that   island inconsistent with the voyage of ulysses as described in the   odyssey that gentleman has also observed a number of such   remarkable coincidences between the courts of alcinous and solomon   that they may be thought curious and interesting homer was familiar   with the names of tyre sidon and egypt and as he lived about the   time of solomon it would not have been extraordinary if he had   introduced some account of the magnificence of that prince into his   poem as solomon was famous for wisdom so the name of alcinous   signifies strength of knowledge as the gardens of solomon were   celebrated so are those of alcinous od 7 112 as the kingdom of   solomon was distinguished by twelve tribes under twelve princes 1   kings ch 4 so that of alcinous od 8 390 was ruled by an equal   number as the throne of solomon was supported by lions of gold 1   kings ch 10 so that of alcinous was placed on dogs of silver and   gold od 7 91 as the fleets of solomon were famous so were   those of alcinous it is perhaps worthy of remark that neptune sate   on the mountains of the solymi as he returned from Æthiopia to Ægæ   while he raised the tempest which threw ulysses on the coast of   phæacia and that the solymi of pamphylia are very considerably   distant from the routethe suspicious character also which   nausicaa attributes to her countryman agrees precisely with that which   the greeks and romans gave of the jews  the seventh chapter contains a description of the monastery of kathara and several adjacent places the eighth among other curiosities fixes on an imaginary site for the farm of laertes but this is the agony of conjecture indeedand the ninth chapter mentions another monastery and a rock still called the school of homer some sepulchral inscriptions of a very simple nature are includedthe tenth and last chapter brings us round to the port of schoenus near bathi after we have completed seemingly in a very minute and accurate manner the tour of the island  we can certainly recommend a perusal of this volume to every lover of classical scene and story if we may indulge the pleasing belief that homer sang of a real kingdom and that ulysses governed it though we discern many feeble links in mr gells chain of evidence we are on the whole induced to fancy that this is the ithaca of the bard and of the monarch at all events mr gell has enabled every future traveller to form a clearer judgment on the question than he could have established without such a vademecum to ithaca or a have with you to the house of ulysses as the present with homer in his pocket and gell on his sumpterhorse or mule the odyssean tourist may now make a very classical and delightful excursion and we doubt not that the advantages accruing to the ithacences from the increased number of travellers who will visit them in consequence of mr gells account of their country will induce them to confer on that gentleman any heraldic honours which they may have to bestow should he ever look in upon them againbaron bathi would be a pretty title    hoc ithacus velit et magno mercentur atridae    virgil  for ourselves we confess that all our old grecian feelings would be alive on approaching the fountain of melainudros where as the tradition runs or as the priests relate homer was restored to sight  we now come to the grecian patterson or cary which mr gell has begun to publish and really he has carried the epic rule of concealing the person of the author to as great a length as either of the abovementioned heroes of itinerary writ we hear nothing of his hairbreadth scapes by sea or land and we do not even know for the greater part of his journey through argolis whether he relates what he has seen or what he has heard from other parts of the book we find the former to be the case but though there have been tourists and strangers in other countries who have kindly permitted their readers to learn rather too much of their sweet selves yet it is possible to carry delicacy or cautious silence or whatever it may be called to the contrary extreme we think that mr gell has fallen into this error so opposite to that of his numerous brethren it is offensive indeed to be told what a man has eaten for dinner or how pathetic he was on certain occasions but we like to know that there is a being yet living who describes the scenes to which he introduces us and that it is not a mere translation from strabo or pausanias which we are reading or a commentary on those authors this reflection leads us to the concluding remark in mr gells preface by much the most interesting part of his book to his itinerary of greece in which he thus expresses himself     the confusion of the modern with the ancient names of places in this   volume is absolutely unavoidable they are however mentioned in such   a manner that the reader will soon be accustomed to the   indiscriminate use of them the necessity of applying the ancient   appellations to the different routes will be evident from the total   ignorance of the public on the subject of the modern names which   having never appeared in print are only known to the few individuals   who have visited the country    what could appear less intelligible to the reader or less useful to   the traveller than a route from chione and zaracca to kutchukmadi   from thence by krabata to schoenochorio and by the mills of peali   while every one is in some degree acquainted with the names of   stymphalus nemea mycenæ lyrceia lerna and tegea   although this may be very true inasmuch as it relates to the reader yet to the traveller we must observe in opposition to mr gell that nothing can be less useful than the designation of his route according to the ancient names we might as well and with as much chance of arriving at the place of our destination talk to a hounslow postboy about making haste to augusta as apply to our turkish guide in modern greece for a direction to stymphalus nemea mycenæ etc etc this is neither more nor less than classical affectation and it renders mr gells book of much more confined use than it would otherwise have beenbut we have some other and more important remarks to make on his general directions to grecian tourists and we beg leave to assure our readers that they are derived from travellers who have lately visited greece in the first place mr cell is absolutely incautious enough to recommend an interference on the part of english travellers with the minister at the porte in behalf of the greeks    the folly of such neglect page 16 preface in many instances   where the emancipation of a district might often be obtained by the   present of a snuffbox or a watch at constantinople and without the   smallest danger of exciting the jealousy of such a court as that of   turkey will be acknowledged when we are no longer able to rectify   the error  we have every reason to believe on the contrary that the folly of half a dozen travellers taking this advice might bring us into a war never interfere with any thing of the kind is a much sounder and more political suggestion to all english travellers in greece  mr gell apologizes for the introduction of his panoramic designs as he calls them on the score of the great difficulty of giving any tolerable idea of the face of a country in writing and the ease with which a very accurate knowledge of it may be acquired by maps and panoramic designs we are informed that this is not the case with many of these designs the small scale of the single map we have already censured and we have hinted that some of the drawings are not remarkable for correct resemblance of their originals the two nearer views of the gate of the lions at mycenæ are indeed good likenesses of their subject and the first of them is unusually well executed but the general view of mycenæ is not more than tolerable in any respect and the prospect of larissa etc is barely equal to the former the view from this last place is also indifferent and we are positively assured that there are no windows at nauplia which look like a box of dominosthe idea suggested by mr gells plate we must not however be too severe on these picturesque bagatelles which probably were very hasty sketches and the circumstances of weather etc may have occasioned some difference in the appearance of the same objects to different spectators we shall therefore return to mr gells preface endeavouring to set him right in his directions to travellers where we think that he is erroneous and adding what appears to have been omitted in his first sentence he makes an assertion which is by no means correct he says we are at present as ignorant of greece as of the interior of africa surely not quite so ignorant or several of our grecian mungo parks have travelled in vain and some very sumptuous works have been published to no purpose as we proceed we find the author observing that athens is now the most polished city of greece when we believe it to be the most barbarous even to a proverb    greek o athaena protae chora   ti gaidarous trepheis tora 5  is a couplet of reproach now applied to this once famous city whose inhabitants seem little worthy of the inspiring call which was addressed to them within these twenty years by the celebrated riga    greek deute paides ton hellaenon ktl  iannina the capital of epirus and the seat of ali pachas government is in truth deserving of the honours which mr gell has improperly bestowed on degraded athens as to the correctness of the remark concerning the fashion of wearing the hair cropped in molossia as mr gell informs us our authorities cannot depose but why will he use the classical term of eleutherolacones when that people are so much better known by their modern name of mainotes the court of the pacha of tripolizza is said to realise the splendid visions of the arabian nights this is true with regard to the court but surely the traveller ought to have added that the city and palace are most miserable and form an extraordinary contrast to the splendour of the courtmr gell mentions gold mines in greece he should have specified their situation as it certainly is not universally known when also he remarks that the first article of necessity in greece is a firman or order from the sultan permitting the traveller to pass unmolested we are much misinformed if he be right on the contrary we believe this to be almost the only part of the turkish dominions in which a firman is not necessary since the passport of the pacha is absolute within his territory according to mr gs own admission and much more effectual than a firman  money he remarks is easily procured at salonica or patrass where the english have consuls it is much better procured we understand from the turkish governors who never charge discount the consuls for the english are not of the most magnanimous order of greeks and far from being so liberal generally speaking although there are in course some exceptions and strané of patras has been more honourably mentionedafter having observed that horses seem the best mode of conveyance in greece mr gell proceeds some travellers would prefer an english saddle but a saddle of this sort is always objected to by the owner of the horse and not without reason etc this we learn is far from being the case and indeed for a very simple reason an english saddle must seem to be preferable to one of the country because it is much lighter when too mr gell calls the postillion menzilgi he mistakes him for his betters serrugees are postillions menzilgis are postmastersour traveller was fortunate in his turks who are hired to walk by the side of the baggagehorses they are certain he says of performing their engagement without grumbling we apprehend that this is by no means certainbut mr gell is perfectly right in preferring a turk to a greek for this purpose and in his general recommendation to take a janissary on the tour who we may add should be suffered to act as he pleases since nothing is to be done by gentle means or even by offers of money at the places of accommodation a courier to be sent on before to the place at which the traveller intends to sleep is indispensable to comfort but no tourist should be misled by the authors advice to suffer the greeks to gratify their curiosity in permitting them to remain for some time about him on his arrival at an inn they should be removed as soon as possible for as to the remark that no stranger would think of intruding when a room is preoccupied our informants were not so well convinced of that fact  though we have made the above exceptions to the accuracy of mr gells information we are most ready to do justice to the general utility of his directions and can certainly concede the praise which he is desirous of obtainingnamely of having facilitated the researches of future travellers by affording that local information which it was before impossible to obtain this book indeed is absolutely necessary to any person who wishes to explore the morea advantageously and we hope that mr gell will continue his itinerary over that and over every other part of greece he allows that his volume is only calculated to become a book of reference and not of general entertainment but we do not see any reason against the compatibility of both objects in a survey of the most celebrated country of the ancient world to that country we trust the attention not only of our travellers but of our legislators will hereafter be directed the greatest caution will indeed be required as we have premised in touching on so delicate a subject as the amelioration of the possessions of an ally but the field for the exercise of political sagacity is wide and inviting in this portion of the globe and mr gell and all other writers who interest us however remotely in its extraordinary capabilities deserve well of the british empire we shall conclude by an extract from the authors work which even if it fails of exciting that general interest which we hope most earnestly it may attract towards its important subject cannot as he justly observes be entirely uninteresting to the scholar since it is a work which gives him a faithful description of the remains of cities the very existence of which was doubtful as they perished before the æra of authentic history the subjoined quotation is a good specimen of the authors minuteness of research as a topographer and we trust that the credit which must accrue to him from the present performance will ensure the completion of his itinerary    the inaccuracies of the maps of anacharsis are in many respects very   glaring the situation of phlius is marked by strabo as surrounded by   the territories of sicyon argos cleonæ and stymphalus mr hawkins   observed that phlius the ruins of which still exist near agios   giorgios lies in a direct line between cleonæ and stymphalus and   another from sicyon to argos so that strabo was correct in saying   that it lay between those four towns yet we see phlius in the map of   argolis by m barbie du bocage placed ten miles to the north of   stymphalus contradicting both history and fact danville is guilty   of the same error    m du bocage places a town named phlius and by him phlionte on the   point of land which forms the port of drepano there are not at   present any ruins there the maps of danville are generally more   correct than any others where ancient geography is concerned a   mistake occurs on the subject of tiryns and a place named by him   vathia but of which nothing can be understood it is possible that   vathi or the profound valley may be a name sometimes used for the   valley of barbitsa and that the place named by danville claustra may   be the outlet of that valley called kleisoura which has a   corresponding signification    the city of tiryns is also placed in two different positions once by   its greek name and again as tirynthus the mistake between the   islands of sphæria and calaura has been noticed in page 135 the   pontinus which danville represents as a river and the erasinus are   equally ill placed in his map there was a place called creopolis   somewhere toward cynouria but its situation is not easily fixed the   ports called bucephalium and piræus seem to have been nothing more   than little bays in the country between corinth and epidaurus the   town called athenæ in cynouria by pausanias is called anthena by   thucydides book 5 41    in general the map of danville will be found more accurate than   those which have been published since his time indeed the mistakes   of that geographer are in general such as could not be avoided without   visiting the country two errors of danville may be mentioned lest   the opportunity of publishing the itinerary of arcadia should never   occur the first is that the rivers malætas and mylaon near   methydrium are represented as running toward the south whereas they   flow northwards to the ladon and the second is that the aroanius   which falls into the erymanthus at psophis is represented as flowing   from the lake of pheneos a mistake which arises from the ignorance of   the ancients themselves who have written on the subject the fact is   that the ladon receives the waters of the lakes of orchomenos and   pheneos but the aroanius rises at a spot not two hours distant from   psophis   in furtherance of our principal object in this critique we have only to add a wish that some of our grecian tourists among the fresh articles of information concerning greece which they have lately imported would turn their minds to the language of the country so strikingly similar to the ancient greek is the modern romaic as a written language and so dissimilar in sound that even a few general rules concerning pronunciation would be of most extensive use   end of vol i
