97957166	the coast of bohemia    by w d howells   biographical edition    new york and london harper  brothers publishers 1899  copyright 1893 1899 by william dean howells  all rights reserved      introductory sketch   in one of the oldfashioned books for children there was a story of the adventures of a cent or perhaps that coin of older lineage a penny told by itself which came into my mind when the publishers suggested that the readers of a new edition of this book might like to know how it happened to be written i promptly fancied the book speaking and taking upon itself the burden of autobiography which we none of us find very heavy and no sooner had i done so than i began actually to hear from it in a narrative of much greater distinctness than i could have supplied for it  you must surely remember it protested to my forgetfulness that you first thought of me in anything like definite shape as you stood looking on at the trottingraces of a county fair in northern ohio and that i began to gather color and character while you loitered through the artbuilding and dwelt with pitying interest upon the forlorn unpromising exhibits there  but previous to this my motive existed somewhere in that nebulous forelife where both men and books have their impalpable beginning for even you cannot have forgotten that when a certain passionately enterprising young editor asked you for a novel to be printed in his journal you so far imagined me as to say that i would be about a girl when you looked over those hapless works of art at the pymantoning county fair you thought what a good thing it would be to have a nice village girl with a real but limited gift go from here to study art in new york and get in love there and married cornelia and her mother at once stepped out of the inchoate ludlow advanced from another quarter of chaos and i began really to be  the getting me down on paper was a much later affairnearly two years later there were earlier engagements to be met there was an exciting editorial episode to be got behind you and there was material for a veridical representation of the ardent young life of the new york synthesis of art studies to be gathered as nearly at first hands and as furtively as possible  i should be almost ashamed to remind you of the clandestine means you employed before you were forced to a frankness alien to your nature and went and threw yourself on the mercy of a member who upon your avowing your purpose took you through the schools of the synthesis and instructed you in its operation not satisfied with this you got an undergraduate of the synthesis to coach you as to its social side and while she was consenting to put it all down in writing for your convenience you were shamelessly making notes of her boardinghouse as the very place to have cornelia come to  your methods were at first so secret and uncandid that i wonder i ever came to be the innocent book i am and i feel that the credit is far less due to you than to the friends who helped you but i am glad to remember how you got your comeuppings when long after a student of the synthesis whom you asked in your latent vanity how she thought that social part of me was managed answered well any one could see that it was studied altogether from the outside that it wasnt at all the spirit of the synthesis  it was enough almost to make me doubt myself but i recovered my belief in my own truth when i reflected that it was merely a just punishment for you i could expose you in other points if i chose and show what slight foundations you built my facts and characters upon but perhaps that would be ungrateful you were at least a doting parent if not a wise one and in your fondness you did your best to spoil me you gave me two heroines and you know very well that before you were done you did not know but you preferred charmian to cornelia and you had nothing whatever to build charmian upon not the slightest suggestion from life where you afterwards encountered her egyptian profile i think i ought to say that you had never been asked to a synthesis dance when you wrote that account of one in me and though you have often been asked since you have never had the courage to go for fear of finding out how little it was like your description  but if charmian was created out of nothing what should you say if i were frank about the other characters of my story could you deny that the drummer who was first engaged to cornelia was anything more than a materialization from seeing a painter very long ago make his two fingers do a balletdance or that ludlow was not at first a mere pointed beard and a complexion glimpsed in a slim young cuban one night at saratoga or that cornelias mother existed by any better right than your once happening to see a poor lady try to hide the gap in her teeth when she smiled  when i think what a thing of shreds and patches i am i wonder that i have any sort of individual temperament or consciousness at all but i know that i have and that you wrote me with pleasure and like me still you think i have form and that if i am not very serious i am sincere and that somehow i represent a phase of our droll american civilization truly enough i know you were vexed when some people said i did not go far enough and insisted that the coast of bohemia ought to have been the whole kingdom as if i should have cared to be that there are shady places inland where i should not have liked my girls to be and where i think my young men would not have liked to meet them and i am glad you kept me within the sweet pure breath of the sea i think i am all the better book for that and if you are fond of me you have your reasons i  upon my word i interrupted at this point it seems to me that you are saying rather more for yourself than i could say for you if you are one of my spoiled children dont you think we had both better give the reader a chance now  oh if

agricultural society was in its second day the trottingmatches had begun and the vast majority of the visitors had abandoned the other features of the exhibition for this supreme attraction they clustered four or five deep along the halfmile of railing that enclosed the track and sat sweltering in the hot september sun on the benching of the grandstand that flanked a stretch of the course boys selling lemonade and peanuts and other boys with the score of the races made their way up and down the seats with shrill cries now and then there was a shriek of girls laughter from a group of young people calling to some other group or struggling for a programme caught back and forth the young fellows shouted to each other jokes that were lost in midair but for the most part the crowd was a very silent one grimly intent upon the rival sulkies as they flashed by and lost themselves in the clouds that thickened over the distances of the long dusty loop here and there some one gave a shout as a horse broke or settled down to his work under the guttural snarl of his driver at times the whole throng burst into impartial applause as a horse gained or lost a length but the quick throb of the hoofs on the velvety earth and the whir of the flying wheels were the sounds that chiefly made themselves heard  the spectacle had the importance which multitude givers and ludlow found in it the effects which he hoped to get again in his impression he saw the deep purples which he looked to see with eyes trained by the french masters of his school to find them and the indigo blues the intense greens the rainbow oranges and scarlets and he knew just how he should give them in the light of that vast afternoon sky cloudless crystalline in its clearness no brilliancy of rendering could be too bold  if he had the courage of his convictions this purely american event could be reported on his canvas with all its native character and yet it could be made to appeal to the enlightened eye with the charm of a french subject and impressionism could be fully justified of its follower in pymantoning as well as in paris that golden dust along the track the level tops of the buggies drawn up within its ellipse and the groups scattered about in gypsy gayety on the grass there the dark blur of men behind the barrier the women with their bright hats and parasols massed flowerlikeall made him long to express them in lines and dots and breadths of pure color he had caught the vital effect of the whole and he meant to interpret it so that its truth should be felt by all who had received the light of the new faith in painting who believed in the prismatic colors as in the ten commandments and who hoped to be saved by tonecontrasts for the others ludlow was at that day too fanatical an impressionist to care he owed a duty to france no less than to america and he wished to fulfil it in a picture which should at once testify to the excellence of the french method and the american material at twentytwo one is often much more secure and final in ones conclusions than one is afterwards  he was vexed that a lingering doubt of the subject had kept him from bringing a canvas with him at once and recording his precious first glimpses of it but he meant to come to the trottingmatch the next day again and then he hoped to get back to his primal impression of the scene now so vivid in his mind he made his way down the benches and out of the enclosure of the track he drew a deep breath full of the sweet smell of the bruised grass forsaken now by nearly all the feet that had trodden it a few old farmers who had failed to get places along the railing and had not cared to pay for seats on the stand were loitering about followed by their baffled and disappointed wives the men occasionally stopped at the cattlepens but it was less to look at the bulls and boars and rams which had taken the premiums and wore cards or ribbons certifying the fact than to escape a consciousness of their partners harassingly taciturn or voluble in their reproach a number of these embittered women brokenly fringed the piazza of the fairhouse and ludlow made his way toward them with due sympathy for their poor little tragedy so intelligible to him through the memories of his own countrybred youth he followed with his pity those who sulked away through the deserted aisles of the building and nursed their grievance among the prize fruits and vegetables and the fruits and vegetables that had not taken the prizes they were more censorious than they would have been perhaps if they had not been defeated themselves he heard them dispute the wisdom of most of the awards as the shoutings and clappings from the racetrack penetrated the lonely hall they creaked wearily up and down in their new shoes or best shoes and he knew how they wished themselves at home and in bed and wondered why they had ever been such fools as to come anyway occasionally one of their husbands lagged in as if in search of his wife but kept at a safe distance after seeing her or hung about with a group of other husbands who could not be put to shame or suffering as they might if they had appeared singly     ii   ludlow believed that if the right fellow ever came to the work he could get as much pathos out of our farm folks as millet got out of his barbizon peasants but the fact was that he was not the fellow he wanted to paint beauty not pathos and he thought so far as he thought ethically about it that the americans needed to be shown the festive and joyous aspects of their common life to discover and to represent these was his pleasure as an artist and his duty as a citizen he suspected though that the trottingmatch was the only fact of the pymantoning county fair that could be persuaded to lend itself to his purpose certainly there was nothing in the fairhouse with those poor dreary old people straggling through it to gladden an artistic conception agricultural implements do not group effectively or pose singly with much picturesqueness tall stalks of corn mammoth squashes huge apples and potatoes want the beauty and quality that belong to them out of doors when they are gathered into the sections of a county fairhouse piles of melons fail of their poetry on a wooden floor and heaps of grapes cannot assert themselves in a very bacchanal profusion against the ignominy of being spread upon long tables and ticketed with the names of their varieties and exhibitors  ludlow glanced at them to right and left as he walked through the long barnlike building and took in with other glances the inadequate decorations of the graceless interior his roving eye caught the lettering over the lateral archways and with a sort of contemptuous compassion he turned into the fine arts department  the fine arts were mostly represented by photographs and crazy quilts but there were also tambourines and round brass plaques painted with flowers and little satin banners painted with birds or autumn leaves and gilt rollingpins with vines there were medleypictures contrived of photographs cut out and grouped together in novel and unexpected relations and there were set about divers patterns and pretences in keramics as the decoration of earthen pots and jars was called besides these were sketches in oil and charcoal which ludlow found worse than the more primitive things with their secondhand chic picked up in a tenthrate school he began to ask himself whether people tasteless enough to produce these inanities and imagine them artistic could form even the subjects of art he began to have doubts of his impression of the trottingmatch its value its possibility of importance the senseless ugliness of the things really hurt him his worship of beauty was a sort of religion and their badness was a sort of blasphemy he could not laugh at them he wished he could and his first impulse was to turn and escape from the fine arts department and keep what little faith in the artistic future of the country he had been able to get together during his long sojourn out of it since his return he had made sure of the feeling for color and form with which his countrywomen dressed themselves there was no mistake about that even here in the rustic heart of the continent he had seen costumes which had touch and distinction and it could not be that the instinct which they sprang from should go for nothing in the arts supposed higher than mantuamaking and millinery the village girls whom he saw so prettily gowned and picturesquely hatted on the benches out there by the racecourse could it have been they who committed these atrocities or did these come up from yet deeper depths of the country where the vague shallow talk about art going on for the past decade was having its first crude effect ludlow was exasperated as well as pained for he knew that the pretty frocks and hats expressed a love of dressing prettily which was honest and genuine enough while the unhappy effects about him could spring only from a hollow vanity far lower than a womans wish to be charming it was not an innate impulse which produced them but a sham ambition implanted from without and artificially stimulated by the false and fleeting mood of the time they must really hamper the growth of æsthetic knowledge among people who were not destitute of the instinct  he exaggerated the importance of the fact with the sensitiveness of a man to whom æsthetic cultivation was allimportant it appeared to him a far greater evil than it was it was odious to him like a vice it was almost a crime he spent a very miserable time in the fine arts department of the pymantoning county agricultural fair and in a kind of horrible fascination he began to review the collection in detail to guess its causes in severalty and to philosophize its lamentable consequences     iii   in this process ludlow discovered that there was more of the fine arts department than he had supposed at first he was aware of some women who had come into the next aisle or section and presently he overheard fragments of their talk  a girls voice said passionately i dont care i shant leave them here for folks to make remarks about i knew they wouldnt take the premium and i hope youre satisfied now mother  well youre a very silly child came in an older voice suggestive of patience and amiability dont tear them anyway  i shall i dont care if i tear them all to pieces  there was a sound of quick steps and of the angry swirl of skirts and the crackling and rending of paper  there now said the older voice youve dropped one  i dont care i hope theyll trample it under their great stupid hoofs  the paper whatever it was came skating out under the draped tabling in the section where ludlow stood arrested in his sad employment by the unseen drama and lay at his feet he picked it up and he had only time to glance at it before he found himself confronted by a fiercely tearful young girl who came round the corner of his section and suddenly stopped at sight of him with one hand she pressed some crumpled sheets of paper against her breast the other she stretched toward ludlow  oh will you she began and then she faltered and as she turned her little head aside for a backward look over her shoulder she made him somehow think of a hollyhock by the tilt of her tall slim young figure and by the colors of her hat from which her face flowered no doubt the deepcrimson silk waist she wore with its petaledged ruffle flying free down her breast had something to do with his fantastic notion she was a brunette with the lightness and delicacy that commonly go with the beauty of a blonde she could not have been more than fifteen her skirts had not yet matured to the full womanly length she was still a child  a handsome mild middleaged woman appeared beside the stormy young thing and said in the voice which ludlow had already heard well cornelia she seemed to make more account than the girl made of the young fellows looks he was of the medium height for a man but he was so slight that he seemed of lower stature and he eked out an effect of distinction by brushing his little moustache up sharply at the corners in a fashion he had learned in france and by wearing a little black dot of an imperial his brow was habitually darkened by a careworn frown which came from deep and anxious thinking about the principles and the practice of art he was very well dressed and he carried himself with a sort of worldly splendor which did not intimidate the lady before him in the country women have no more apprehension of men who are young and stylish and goodlooking than they have in the city they rather like them to be so and meet them with confidence in any casual encounter  the lady said oh thank you as ludlow came up to the girl with the paper and then she laughed with no particular intention and said its one of my daughters drawings  oh indeed said ludlow with a quick perception of the mothers pride in it and of all the potentialities of prompt intimacy its very good  well i think so said the lady while the girl darkled and bridled in young helplessness if she knew that her mother ought not to be offering a stranger her confidence like that she did not know what to do about it she was just going to take them home said the mother vaguely  im sorry said ludlow i seem to be a day after the fair as far as theyre concerned  well i dont know said the mother with the same amiable vagueness she had some teeth gone and when she smiled she tried to hide their absence on the side next ludlow but as she was always smiling she did not succeed perfectly she looked doubtfully at her daughter in the manner of mothers whom no severity of snubbing can teach that their daughters when wellgrown girls can no longer be treated as infants i dont know as youd think you had lost much we didnt expect they would take the premium a great deal  i should hope not said ludlow the competition was bad enough  the mother seemed to divine a compliment in this indefinite speech she said well i dont see myself why they didnt take it  there was probably no one to feel how much better they were said ludlow  well thats what i think said the mother and its what i tell her she stood looking from ludlow to her daughter and back and now she ventured seeing him so intent on the sketch he still held you an artist  a student of art said ludlow with the effect of uncovering himself in a presence  the mother did not know what to make of it apparently she said blankly oh and then added impressively to her daughter why dont you show them to him cornelia  i should think it a great favor said ludlow intending to be profoundly respectful but he must have overdone it the girl majestically gave her drawings to her mother and marched out of the aisle  ludlow ignored her behavior as if it had nothing to do with the question and began to look at the drawings one after another with various inarticulate notes of comment imitated from a great french master and with various foreign phrases such as bon bon pas mauvais joli chic he seemed to waken from them to a consciousness of the mother and returned to english they are very interesting has she had instruction  only in the high school here and she didnt seem to care any for that she seems to want to work more by herself  thats wrong said ludlow though shes probably right about the high school  the mother made bold to ask where are you taking lessons  i said ludlow dreamily oh everywhere  i thought perhaps the mother began and she stopped and then resumed how many lessons do you expect to take     iv   ludlow descended from the high horse which he saw it was really useless for him to ride in that simple presence i didnt mean that i was a student of art in that sense exactly i suppose im a painter of some sort i studied in paris and im working in new yorkif thats what you mean  yes said the lady as if she did not know quite what she meant  ludlow still remained in possession of the sketches and he now looked at them with a new knot between his eyebrows he had known at the first glance with the perception of one who has done things in any art that here was the possibility of things in his art and he had spoken from a generous and compassionate impulse from his recognition of the possibility and from his sympathy with the girl in her defeat now his conscience began to prick him he asked himself whether he had any right to encourage her whether he ought not rather to warn her he asked her mother has she been doing this sort of thing long  ever since she was a little bit of a thing said the mother you might say shes been doing it ever since she could do anything and she aint but about fifteen now well shes going on sixteen the mother added scrupulously she was born the third of july and now its the beginning of september so shes just fifteen years and a little over two months i suppose shes too young to commence taking lessons regularly  no one would be too young for that said ludlow austerely with his eyes on the sketch he lifted them and bent them frankly and kindly on the mothers face and were you thinking of her going on the mother questioned him for his exact meaning with the sweet unwisdom of her smile did you think of her becoming an artist a painter  well she returned i presume she would have as good a chance as anybody if she had the talent for it  she has the talent for it said ludlow and she would have a better chance than mostthats very little to saybut its a terribly rough road  yes the mother faltered smiling  yes its a hard road for a man and its doubly hard for a woman it means work that breaks the back and wrings the brain it means for a woman tears and hysterics and nervous prostration and insanitysome of them go wild over it the conditions are bad air and long hours and pitiless criticism and the rewards are slight and uncertain one out of a hundred comes to anything at all one out of a thousand to anything worth while new york is swarming with girl artstudents they mostly live in poor boardinghouses and some of them actually suffer from hunger and cold for men the profession is hazardous arduous for women its a slow anguish of endeavor and disappointment most shopgirls earn more than most fairly successful artstudents for years most servantgirls fare better if you are rich and your daughter wishes to amuse herself by studying art its all very well but even then i wouldnt recommend it as an amusement if youre poor  i presume the mother interrupted that she would be selfsupporting by the time she had taken six months lessons and i guess she could get along till then  ludlow stared at the amiably smiling creature from her unruffled composure his warning had apparently fallen like water from the back of a goose he saw that it would be idle to go on and he stopped short and waited for her to speak again  if she was to go to new york to take lessons how do you think shed better she seemed not to know enough of the situation to formulate her question farther he had pity on her ignorance though he doubted whether he ought to have  oh go into the synthesis he said briefly  the synthesis  yes the synthesis of art studies its the only thing the work is hard but its thorough the trainings excellent if you live through it  oh i guess shed live through it said the mother with a laugh she added i dont know as i know just what you mean by the synthesis of art studies  its a society that the artstudents have formed they have their own building and casts and models the principal artists have classes among them you submit a sketch and if you get in you work away till you drop if youre in earnest or till youre bored if youre amusing yourself  and should you think said the mother gesturing toward him with the sketches in her hand that she could get in  i think she could said ludlow and he acted upon a sudden impulse he took a card from his pocketbook and gave it to the mother if youll look me up when you come to new york or let me know i may be of use to you and i shall be very glad to put you in the way of getting at the synthesis  thanks the mother drawled with her eyes on the card she probably had no clear sense of the favor done her she lifted her eyes and smiled on ludlow with another kind of intelligence youre visiting at mrs burtons  yes said ludlow remembering after a moment of surprise how pervasive the fact of a strangers presence in a village is mr burton can tell you who i am he added in some impatience with her renewed scrutiny of his card  oh its all right she said and she put it in her pocket and then she began to drift away a little well im sure im much obliged to you she hesitated a moment and then she said well good afternoon  goodby said ludlow and he lifted his hat and stood bowing her out of the fine arts department while she kept her eyes on him to the last with admiration and approval  well i declare cornelia she burst out to her daughter whom she found glowering at the agricultural implements that is about the nicest fellow do you know what hes done she stopped and began a search for her pocket which ended successfully hes given me his name and told me just what youre to do and when you get to new york if you ever do you can go right straight to him  she handed ludlows card to the girl who instantly tore it to pieces without looking at it ill never go to himhorrid mean cross old thing and you go and talk about me to a perfect stranger as if i were a baby and now hell go and laugh at you with the burtons and theyll say its just like you to say everything that comes into your head that way and think everybodys as nice as they seem but he isnt nice hes horrid and conceited andandhateful and i shall never study art anywhere and id die before i asked him to help me he was just making fun of you all the time and anybody but you would see it mother comparing me to a hired girl  no i dont think he did that cornelia said the mother with some misgiving i presume he may have been a little touched up by your pictures and wanted to put me down about them  oh mother mother mother the girl broke into tears over the agricultural implements they were the dust under his feet  why cornelia how you talk  i wish you wouldnt talk mother ive asked you a thousand times if ive asked you once not to talk about me with anybody and here you go and tell everything that you can think of to a person that you never saw before  what did i tell him about you asked her mother with the uncertainty of ladies who say a great deal  you told him how old i was almost to a day  oh well that wasnt anything i saw hed got to know if he was to give any opinion about your going on that was worth having  itll be all over town tomorrow well never mind its the last time youll ever have a chance to do it ill never never never touch a pencil to draw with again never youve done it now mother i dont care ill help you with your work all you want but dont ever ask me to draw a single thing after this i guess he wouldnt have much to say about the style of a bonnet or set of a dress if it was wrong  the girl swept out of the building with tragedyqueen strides that refused to adjust themselves to the lazy lounging pace of her mother and carried her homeward so swiftly that she had time to bang the front gate and the front door and her own room door and lock it and be crying on the bed with her face in the pillow long before her mother reached the house the mother wore a face of unruffled serenity and as there was no one near to see she relaxed her vigilance and smiled with luxurious indifference to the teeth she had lost     v   ludlow found his friend burton smoking on his porch when he came back from the fair and watching with halfshut eyes the dust that overhung the street some of the farmers were already beginning to drive home and their wheels sent up the pulverous clouds which the western sun just tinged with red burton got the color under the lower boughs of the maple grove of his deep dooryard  well he called out in a voice expressive of the temperament which kept him content with his modest fortune and his village circumstance when he might have made so much more and spent so much more in the world outside did you get your picture  ludlow was only halfway up the walk from the street when the question met him and he waited to reach the piazza steps before he answered  oh yes i think ive got it by this time mrs burton had appeared at the hall doorway and stood as if to let him decide whether he would come into the house or join her husband outside he turned aside to take a chair near burtons tilted against the wall but he addressed himself to her  mrs burton who is rather a longstrung easygoing goodlooking middleaged lady with a daughter about fifteen years old extremely pretty and rather peppery who draws  mrs burton at once came out and sat sidewise in the hammock facing the two men  how were they dressed  ludlow told as well as he could he reserved his fancy of the girls being like a hollyhock  was the daughter pretty  very pretty  dark  yes all thats best of dark and bright  were they both very graceful  very graceful indeed  why it must be mrs saunders where did you see them  in the art department  yes she came to ask me whether i would exhibit some of cornelias drawings if i were she  and you told her you would her husband asked taking his pipe out for the purpose  of course i did that was what she wished me to tell her  burton turned to ludlow had they taken many premiums  no the premiums had been bestowed on the crazy quilts and the medley pictureswhat extraordinarily idiotic inventionsand miss saunders was tearing down her sketches in the next section one of them slipped through on the floor and they came round after it to where i was  and so you got acquainted with mrs saunders said mrs burton  no but i got intimate said ludlow i sympathized with her and she advised with me about her daughters arteducation  what did you advise her to do asked burton  not to have her arteducated  why dont you think she has talent mrs burton demanded with a touch of resentment  oh yes she has beauty too nothing is commoner than the talent and beauty of american girls but theyd better trust to their beauty  i dont think so said mrs burton with spirit  you can see how shes advised mrs saunders said burton winking the eye next ludlow  well you mustnt be vexed with me mrs burton ludlow replied to her i dont think shell take my advice especially as i put it in the form of warning i told her how hard the girl would have to work but i dont think she quite understood i told her she had talent too and she did understand that there was something uncommon in the childs work somethingdifferent who are they mrs burton  isnt there cried mrs burton im glad you told the poor thing that i thought theyd take the premium i was going to tell you about her daughter mrs saunders must have been awfully disappointed  she didnt seem to suffer much ludlow suggested  no mrs burton admitted she doesnt suffer much about anything if she did she would have been dead long ago first her husband blown up by his sawmill boiler and then one son killed in a railroad accident and another taken down with pneumonia almost the same day and she goes on smiling in the face of death  and looking out that he doesnt see how many teeth shes lost burton prompted  ludlow laughed at the accuracy of the touch  mrs burton retorted why shouldnt she her good looks and her good nature are about all she has left in the world except this daughter  are they very poor asked ludlow gently  oh nobodys very poor in pymantoning said mrs burton and mrs saunders has her businesswhen shes a mind to work at it  i suppose she has it even when she hasnt a mind to work at it said burton making his pipe purr with a long deep inspiration of satisfaction i know i have mine  what is her business asked ludlow  well shes a dressmaker and millinerwhen she is mrs burton stated the fact with the effect of admitting it you mustnt suppose that makes any difference in a place like pymantoning shes as good as anybody and her daughter has as high social standing you cant imagine how arcadian we are out here  oh yes i can ive lived in a village said ludlow  a new england village yes but the lines are drawn just as hard and fast there as they are in a city you have to live in the west to understand what equality is and in a purely american population like this youve got plenty of independence in new england but you havent got equality and we haveor used to have mrs burton added the final words with apparent conscience  just saved your distance polly said her husband we havent got equality now any more than weve got buffalo i dont believe we ever had buffalo in this section but we did have deer once and when i was a boy here venison was three cents a pound and equality cheaper yet when they cut off the woods the venison and the equality disappeared they always do when the woods are cut off  theres enough of it left for all practical purposes and mrs saunders moves in the first circles of pymantoning said mrs burton  when she does move said burton she doesnt like to move  well she has the greatest taste and if you can get her to do anything for you your fortunes made but its a favor shell take a thing that youve got home from the city and that youre frantic about its so bad and smile over it a little and touch it here and there and it comes out a miracle of style and becomingness its like magic  she was charming said ludlow in dreamy reminiscence  isnt she mrs burton demanded and her daughter gets all her artistic talent from her mrs saunders is an artist though i dont suppose you like to admit it of a dressmaker  oh yes i do said ludlow i dont see why a man or woman who drapes the human figure in stuffs isnt an artist as well as the man or woman who drapes it in paint or clay  well thats sense mrs burton began  she didnt know you had any ludlow her husband explained  mrs burton did not regard him if she had any ambition she would be anythingjust like some other lazyboots and now she gave the large dangling congress gaiter of her husband a little push with the point of her slipper for purposes of identification as the newspapers say but the only ambition shes got is for her daughter and she is proud of her and she would spoil her if she could get up the energy she dotes on her and nie is fond of her mother too do you think she can ever do anything in art  if she were a boy i should say yes as shes a girl i dont know said ludlow the chances are against her  natures against her too said burton  human nature ought to be for her then said mrs burton if she were your sister what should you wish her to be she asked ludlow  i should wish her to beludlow thought a moment and then concludedhappily married  well thats a shame cried mrs burton  her husband laughed while he knocked the ashes out of his pipe against the edge of his chairseat rough on the holy estate of matrimony polly  oh pshaw i believe as much in the holy estate of matrimony as anybody but i dont believe its the beginall or the endall for a woman any more than it is for a man what katy she spoke to a girl who appeared and disappeared in the doorway oh well come in to supper now i hope you have an appetite mr ludlow mr burtons such a delicate eater and i like to have somebody keep me in countenance she suddenly put her hand on the back of her husbands chair and sprung it forward from its incline against the wall with a violence that bounced him fearfully and extorted a roar of protest from him  they were much older than ludlow and they permitted themselves the little rowdy freedoms that goodnatured married people sometimes use as fearlessly in his presence as if he were a grownup nephew they prized him as a discovery of their own for they had stumbled on him one day before any one else had found him out when he was sketching at fontainebleau they liked the look of his picture as they viewed it at a decent remove over his shoulder and after they got by burton proposed to go back and kill the fellow on account of the solemn coxcombery of his personal appearance his wife said well ask him what hell take for his picture first and burton returned and said with brutal directness while he pointed at the canvas with his stick combien when ludlow looked round up at him and answered with a pleasant light in his eye well i dont know exactly whatll you give burton spared his life and became his friend he called his wife to him and they bought the picture and afterwards they went to ludlows lodging for he had no studio and conscientiously painted in the open air and bought others they got the pictures dog cheap as burton said for ludlow was just beginning then and his reputation which has never since become cloudcapt was a tender and lowly plant they made themselves like a youngish aunt and uncle to him and had him with them all they could while they stayed in paris when they came home they brought the first impressionistic pictures ever seen in the west at pymantoning the village cynic asked which was right side up and whether he was to stand on his head or not to get them in range ludlow remained in france which he maintained had the only sun for impressionism and then he changed his mind all at once and under an impulse of sudden patriotism declared for the american sky and the thin crystalline american air his faith included american subjects and when after his arrival in new york burton wrote to claim a visit from him and ironically proposed the trottingmatch at the county fair as an attraction for his pencil ludlow remembered the trottingmatches he had seen in his boyhood and came out to pymantoning with a seriousness of expectation that alarmed and then amused his friends  he was very glad that he had come and that night after the supper which lasted well into the early autumn lamplight he went out and walked the village streets under the september moon seeing his picture everywhere before him and thinking his young exultant thoughts the maples were set so thick along the main street that they stood like a high dark wall on either side and he looked up at the sky as from the bottom of a chasm the village houses lurked behind their dooryard trees with breadths of autumnal bloom in the gardens beside them within their shadowy porches or beside their gates was      the delight of happy laughter     the delight of low replies  hushing itself at his approach and breaking out again at his retreat the air seemed full of love and in the midst of his proud gay hopes he felt smitten with sudden isolation such as youth knows in the presence of others passion he walked back to burtons rather pensively and got up to his room and went to bed after as little stay for talk with his hosts as he could make decent he did not like to break with his melancholy  he was roused from his first sleep by the sound of singing which seemed to stop with his waking there came a confused murmur of girls and young mens voices and ludlow could see from his open window the dim shapes of the serenaders in the dark of the trees below then they were still and all at once the silence was filled with a rich contralto note carrying the song till the whole choir of voices took up the burden nothing prettier could have happened anywhere in the world ludlow hung rapt upon the music till burton flung up his window as if to thank the singers they stopped at the sound and with gay shouts and shrieks and a medley of wild laughter skurried away into the farther darkness where ludlow heard them begin their serenade again under distant windows as little localized as any space of the sky     vi   ludlow went back to new york and took up his work with vigor and with fervor the picture of the county fair which he exhibited at the american artists ran a gauntlet of criticism in which it was belabored at once for its unimaginative vulgarity and its fantastic unreality then it returned to his studio and remained unsold while the days weeks months and years went by and left each their fine trace on him his purposes dropped away mostly unfulfilled as he grew older and wiser but his dreams remained and he was still rich in a vast future his impressionism was somewhat modified he offered his palette less frequently to the public he now and then permitted a black object to appear in his pictures his purples and greens were less aggressive his moustache had grown so thick that it could no longer be brushed up at the points with just the effect he desired and he suffered it to branch straight across his cheeks his little dot of an imperial had become lost in the beard which he wore so conscientiously trimmed to a point that it might be described as religiously pointed he was now twentyseven  at sixteen cornelia saunders had her first loveaffair it was with a young man who sold what he called artgoods by samplesatin banners gilt rollingpins brass disks and keramics he had permitted himself to speak to her on the train coming over from the junction where she took the cars for pymantoning one afternoon after a days shopping with her mother in lakeland it did not last very long and in fact it hardly survived the brief stay which the young man made in pymantoning where his want of success in artgoods was probably owing to the fact that he gave his whole time to cornelia or rather cornelias mother whom he found much more conversable he played upon the banjo for her and he danced a little clogdance in her parlor which was also her shop to the accompaniment of his own whistling first setting aside the bonnettrees with their scanty fruitage of summer hats and pushing the showtable against the wall wont hurt em a mite he reassured her and he struck her as a careful as well as accomplished young man his passion for cornelia lingered a while in letters which he proposed in parting and then about six months later mrs saunders received the newspaper announcement of his marriage to miss tweety byers of lakeland there were no cards but mrs saunders made out with mrs burtons help that tweety was the infantile for the pet name of sweety and the marriage seemed a fit union for one so warm and true as the young traveller in artgoods  mrs saunders was a good deal surprised but she did not suffer keenly from the disappointment which she had innocently done her best to bring upon her daughter cornelia who had been the passive instrument of her romance did not suffer from it at all having always objected to the thickness of the young mans hands and to the early baldness which gave him the shakespearian brow he had so little use for she laughed his memory to scorn and employed the episode as best she could in quelling her mothers simple trust of passing strangers they worked along together in the easy unambitious village fashion and kept themselves in the average comfort while the time went by and cornelia had grown from a long lean child to a tall and stately young girl who carried herself with so much native grace and pride that she had very little attention from the village youth she had not even a girl friendship and her chief social resource was in her intimacy at the burtons she borrowed books of them and read a good deal and when she was seventeen she rubbed up her old studies and got a teachers certificate for six months and taught a summer term in a district at burnt pastures she came home in the fall and when she called at the burtons to get a book as usual mrs burton said nelie youre not feeling very well are you somehow you looked fagged  well i do feel queer said the girl i seem to be in a kind of dream itscares me im afraid im going to be sick  oh i guess not mrs burton answered comfortably youre just tired out how did you like your school  i hated it said the girl with a trembling chin and wet eyes i dont believe im fit for teaching i wont try it any more ill stay at home and help mother  you ought to keep up your drawing said mrs burton in general admonition do you draw any now  nothing much said the girl  i should think you would to please your mother dont you care anything for it yourself  yes but i havent the courage i had when i thought i knew it all i dont think i should ever amount to anything it would be a waste of time  i dont think so said mrs burton i believe you could be a great artist  the girl laughed what ever became of that painter who visited you year before last at fair time  mr ludlow oh hes in new york he thought your sketches were splendid nelie  he said the girls halfkilled themselves there studying art  did he demanded mrs burton with a note of wrath in her voice  mm he told mother so that day  he had no business to say such a thing before you was that what discouraged you  oh i dont know i got discouraged of course i should like to please mother how much do you suppose it would cost a person to live in new york i dont mean take a room and board yourself i shouldnt like to do that but everything included  i dont know indeed nelie jim always kept the accounts when we were there and we stayed at the fifth avenue hotel  do you suppose it would be twice as much as it is here five dollars a week  yes im afraid it would mrs burton admitted  ive got sixtyfive dollars from my school i suppose it would keep me three months in new york if i was careful but im not going to throw it away on any such wild scheme as that i know that much  they talked away from the question and then talked back to it several times after they had both seemed to abandon it at last mrs burton said why dont you let me write to mr ludlow nelie and ask him all about it  the girl jumped to her feet in a fright if you do mrs burton ill kill myself no i didnt mean to say that but ill never speak to you again now you wont really will you  no i wont nelie if you dont want me to but i dont see why why bless the child  mrs burton sprang forward and caught the girl who was reeling as if she were going to fall katy katy bring some water here quick  when they had laid cornelia on a sofa and restored her from her faint mrs burton would not let her try to rise she sent out to burton who was reading a novel in the mild forenoon air under the crimson maples and made him get the carryall and take cornelia home in it they thought they would pretend that they were out for a drive and were merely dropping her at her mothers door but no ruse was necessary mrs saunders tranquilly faced the fact she said she thought the child hadnt been herself since she got back from her school and she guessed she had better have the doctor now     vii   it was toward the end of january before cornelia was well enough to be about in the old way after her typhoid fever once she was so low that the rumor of her death went out but when this proved false it was known for a good sign and no woman at least was surprised when she began to get well she was delirious part of the time and then she raved constantly about ludlow and going to new york to study art it was a mere superficial effect from her talk with mrs burton just before she was taken down with the fever but it was pathetic all the same to hear her pleading with him quarrelling protesting that she was strong enough and that she was not afraid but that she should get through all right if he would only tell her how to begin now you just tell me that tell me that tell me that its the place that i cant find if i can get to the right door but it wont open it wont open oh dear what shall i do  mrs burton who heard this go on through the solemn hours of night thought that if ludlow could only hear it he would be careful how he ever discouraged any human being again it was as much as her husband could do to keep her from writing to him and making the girls fever a matter of personal reproach to him but she refrained and when cornelia got up from it she was so changed that mrs burton was glad she had never tried to involve any one else in her anxieties about her  not only the fever had burned itself out but cornelias temperament seemed for awhile to have been consumed in the fire she came out of it more like her mother she was gentler than she used to be and especially gentle and good to her mother and she had not only grown to resemble her in a greater tranquillity and easygoingness but to have come into her ambitions and desires the change surprised mrs saunders a good deal up to this time it had always surprised her that cornelia should not have been at all like her she sometimes reflected however that if you came to that cornelias father had never been at all like her either  it was only a passing phase of the girls evolution with the return of perfect health and her former strength she got back her old energetic self but of another quality and in another form probably she would have grown into the character she now took on in any case but following her convalescence as it did it had a more dramatic effect she began to review her studies and her examination papers before the doctor knew it and when the county examiners met in june she was ready for them and got a certificate authorizing her to teach for a year with this she need not meet the poor occasions of any such forlorn endoftheearth as burnt pastures she had an offer of the school at hartleys mills and she taught three terms there and brought home a hundred and fifty dollars at the end all through the last winter she drew more or less and she could see better than any one else that she had not fallen behind in her art but after having let it drop for a time had taken it up with fresh power and greater skill she had come to see things better than she used and she had learned to be faithful to what she saw which is the great matter in all the arts  she had never formulated this fact even if she knew it and mrs burton was still further from guessing what it was that made cornelias sketches so much more attractive than they were when the girl let her look at them in one of her proud shy confidences she said i do wish mr ludlow could see these nelie  do you think he would be very much excited asked the girl with the sarcastic humor which had risen up in her to be one of the reliefs of her earlier intensity  he ought to be said mrs burton you know he did admire your drawings nelie even those you had at the fair that time  did he returned the girl carelessly what did he say  well he said that if you were a boy there couldnt be any doubt about you  cornelia laughed that was a pretty safe kind of praise im not likely ever to be a boy she rose up from where they were sitting together and went to put her drawings away in her room when she came back she said it would be fun to show him some day that even so low down a creature as a girl could be something  i wish you would nie said mrs burton i just wish you would why dont you go to new york this winter and study why dont you make her mrs saunders  who me said mrs saunders who sat by in an indolent abeyance oh i aint allowed to open my mouth any more  well said cornelia dont be so ungrammatical then when you do it without being allowed mother  mrs saunders laughed in lazy enjoyment one thing i know if i had my way shed have been in new york studying long ago instead of fooling away her time out here schoolteaching  and where would you have been mother  me said mrs saunders again incorrigibly oh i guess i should have been somewhere  well ill tell you what mrs burton broke in nie must go and thats all about it i know from what mr ludlow said that he believes she could be an artist she would have to work hard but i dont call teaching school play exactly  indeed it isnt said mrs saunders id sooner set all day at the machine myself and dear knows thats trying enough  im not afraid of the hard work said cornelia  what are you afraid of then demanded her mother afraid of failing  no of succeeding answered cornelia perversely  i cant make the child out said mrs saunders with apparent pleasure in the mystery  cornelia went on at least partially to explain herself i mean succeeding in the way women seem to succeed they make me sick  oh said her mother with sarcasm that could not sustain itself even by a smile letting mrs burton into the joke going to be a rosa bonnhure  cornelia scorned this poor attempt of her mother if i cant succeed as men succeed and be a great painter and not just a great woman painter id rather be excused altogether even rosa bonheur i dont believe her horses would have been considered so wonderful if a man had done them i guess thats what mr ludlow meant and i guess he was right i guess if a girl wants to turn out an artist shed better start by being a boy  i guess said mrs burton with admiring eyes full of her beauty that if mr ludlow could see you now hed be very sorry to have you a boy  cornelia blushed the splendid red of a brunette there it is mrs burton thats whats always in everybodys mind about a girl when she wants to do something its what a magnificent match shell make by her painting or singing or acting and if the poor fool only knew she neednt draw or sing or act to do that  a person would think youd been through the wars cornelia said her mother  i dont care its a shame  it is a shame nelie said mrs burton soothingly and she added unguardedly and i told mr ludlow so when he spoke about a girls being happily married as if there was no other happiness for a girl  oh he thinks that does he  no of course he doesnt he has a very high ideal of women but he was just running on in the usual way he told afterwards how hard the girl artstudents work in new york and go ahead of the young men some of themwhere they have the strength the only thing is that so few of them have the strength thats what he meant  what do you think mother asked the girl with an abrupt turn toward her do you think id break down  i guess if you didnt break down teaching school that you hated you wont break down studying art when you love it so  well cornelia said with the air of putting an end to the audience i guess theres no great hurry about it  she let her mother follow mrs burton out recognizing with a smile of scornful intelligence the ladies wish to have the last word about her to themselves     viii   i dont know as i ever saw her let herself go so far before said mrs saunders leaning on the top of the closed gate and speaking across it to mrs burton on the outside of the fence i guess shes thinking about it pretty seriously shes got money enough and more than enough  well said mrs burton im going to write to mr ludlow about it as soon as i get home and i know i can get him to say something thatll decide her  so do cried mrs saunders delighted  she lingered awhile talking of other things so as to enable herself to meet cornelia with due unconsciousness when she returned to her  have you been talking me over all this time mother the girl asked  we didnt hardly say a word about you said her mother and now she saw what a good thing it was that she had staid and talked impersonalities with mrs burton  well one thing i know said the girl if she gets that mr ludlow to encourage me ill never go near new york in the world  mrs saunders escaped into the next room and answered back from that safe distance i guess youd better get her to tell you what shes going to do  when she returned the girl stood looking dreamily out of the little crooked panes of the low window she asked with her back to her mother what would you do if i went  oh i should get along said mrs saunders with the lazy piety which had never yet found providence to fail it i should get miss snively to go in with me here she aint making out very well alone and she could be company to me in more ways than one  yes said the girl in a deep sigh i thought of her she faced about  why land child cried her mother whats the matter  cornelias eyes were streaming with tears and the passion in her heart was twisting her face with its anguish she flung her arms round her mothers neck and sobbed on her breast oh im going im going and you dont seem to care whether i go or stay and itll kill me to leave you  mrs saunders smiled across the tempest of grief in her embrace at her own tranquil image in the glass and took it into the joke well you aint going to leave this minute she said smoothing the girls black hair and i dont really care if you never go nie you mustnt go on my account  dont you want me to  not unless you do  and you dont care whether im ever an artist or not  what good is your being an artist going to do me asked her mother still with a joking eye on herself in the mirror  and im perfectly free to go or to stay as far as your wish is concerned  well said mrs saunders with insincere scorn of the question  the girl gave her a fierce hug she straightened herself up and dashed the water from her eyes well then she said ill see but promise me one thing mother  what is it  that you wont ask me a single thing about it from this out if i never decide  well i wont nie i promise you that i dont want to drive you to anything and i guess you know ten times as well what you want to do as i do anyway i aint going to worry you  three weeks later just before fair time cornelia went to see mrs burton it was warm and mrs burton brought out a fan for her on the piazza  oh im not hot said cornelia mrs burton ive made up my mind to go to new york this winter and study art  i knew you would nie mrs burton exulted  yes ive thought it all out ive got the money now i keep wanting to paint and i dont know whether i can or not and the only way is to go and find out itll be easy enough to come home ill keep money enough to pay my way back  yes said mrs burton its the only way but i guess youll find out you can paint fast enough its a pretty good sign you can if you want to  oh i dont know some girls want to write poetry awfully and cant mrs burton she broke off with a nervous laugh i dont suppose you expect that mr ludlow out to the fair this year  no nelie i dont said mrs burton with tender reluctance  because said the girl with another laugh he might save me a trip to new york if he could see my drawings something she did not know what in mrs burtons manner made her ask have you heard from him lately perhaps hes given it up too  oh no sighed mrs burton with a break from her cheerfulness with cornelia which set its voluntary character in evidence to the girls keen young perception but he seemed to be rather discouraged about the prospects of artists when he wrote she was afraid cornelia might ask her when he had written he seemed to think the ranks were very full hes a very changeable person hes always talked before now about there being plenty of room at the top  well thats where i expect to be said the girl smiling but trembling she turned the talk and soon rose to go ignoring to the last mrs burtons forced efforts to recur to her plan of studying art in new york now she said mrs burton theres one thing id like to ask you and she lifted her eyes upon her with a suddenness that almost made mrs burton jump  what is it nelie  youve always been so good to meandand taken such an interest that im afraidi thought you might tryi want you to promise me you wont write to mr ludlow about me or ask him to do the least thing for me  i wont i wont indeed nelie mrs burton promised with grateful perfervor  because said the girl taking her skirt in her left hand preparatory to lifting it for her descent of the piazza steps now that ive made up my mind i dont want to be discouraged and i dont want to be helped if i cant do for myself i wont be done for  after she got down through the maples and well out of the gate burton came and stood in the hall doorway with his pipe in his mouth saved your distance polly as usual saved your distance  what would you have done retorted his wife  i should have told her that id just got a letter from ludlow this morning and that he begged and entreated me by everything i held dear to keep the poor girl from coming to new york and throwing away her time and health and money  you wouldnt cried mrs burton you wouldnt have done anything of the kind it would have made her perfectly hate him  burton found his pipe out he lighted a match and hollowed his hands over it above the pipe to keep it from the draught well he said avoiding the point in controversy why shouldnt she perfectly hate him     ix   september was theoretically always a very busy month with mrs saunders she believed that she devoted it to activities which she called her fall work and that she pressed forward in the fulfilments of these duties with a vigor inspired by the cool clear weather but in reality there was not much less folding of the hands with her in september than there was in july she was apt on the coolest and clearest september day to drop into a chair with a deep drawn oh hum after the fatigue of bringing in an apronful of apples or driving the hens away from her chrysanthemums and she spent a good deal of time wondering how with all she had to do she was ever going to get those flowers in before the frost caught them at one of these times sitting up slim graceful and picturesque in the feathercushioned rockerlounge and fanning her comely face with her shadehat it occurred to her to say to cornelia sewing hard beside the window i guess you wont see them in blossom this christmas nie  not unless you cut them at the roots and send them to me by mail to look at said the girl  her mother laughed easily well i must really take hold and help you or youll never get away ive put off everybody elses work till its perfectly scandalous and im afraid theyll bring the roof about my ears and yet i seem to be letting you do all your sewing well one thing i presume i hate to have you go so  mother cried the girl drawing out her needle to the full length of her thread before she let her hand drop nervelessly at her side and she fell back to look fixedly at mrs saunders if thats the way you feel  i dont i want you to go just as much as ever i did but looking at you there just against the window that way i got to thinking you wouldnt be there a great while and mrs saunders caught her breath and was mute a moment before she gave way and began to whimper from the force of habit she tried to whimper with one side of her mouth as she smiled to keep her missing teeth from showing and at the sight of this characteristic effort so familiar and so full of long association cornelias heart melted within her and she ran to her mother and pulled her head down on her breast and covered the unwhimpering cheek with kisses  dont you suppose i think of that too mother and when you go round the room or out in the yard i just keep following you as if i was magnetized and i can see you with my eyes shut as well as i can with them open and i know how i shall feel when thats all ive got of you but ill soon be back why ill be here in june again and its no use now ive got to go  oh yes said her mother pushing herself free and entering upon so prolonged a search for her handkerchief that her tears had almost time to dry without it before she found it but that dont make it any easier child  they had agreed from the time cornelia made up her mind to go and they had vowed the burtons to secrecy that they were not to tell any one till just before she started but it was not in mrs saunderss nature or the nature of things that she should keep her part of the agreement she was so proud of cornelias going to study art in new york and going on her own money that she would have told all her customers that she was going even if it had not proved such a good excuse for postponing and delaying the work they brought her  it was all over town before the first week was out and the fact had been canvassed in and out of the presence of the principals with much the same frankness what cornelia had in excess of a puttingdown pride her mother correspondingly lacked what the girl forbade mrs saunders invited by her manner and there were not many people or at least many ladies in pymantoning who could not put their hands on their hearts and truly declare that they had spoken their minds as freely to mrs saunders as they had to anybody  as the time drew near mrs burton begged to be allowed to ask mr ludlow about a boardingplace for cornelia and to this cornelia consented on condition that he should be strictly prohibited from taking any more trouble than simply writing the address on a piece of paper when mrs burton brought it she confessed that mr ludlow seemed to have so far exceeded his instructions as to have inquired the price of board in a single room  im afraid nelie its more than you expected but everything is very dear in new york and mr ludlow thought it was cheap theres no fire in the room even at that but if you leave the door open when youre out it heats nicely from the hall its over the door four flights up its what they call a side room  how much is it mrs burton cornelia asked steadily but she held her breath till the answer came  its seven dollars a week  well the land said mrs saunders for all comment on the extortionate figure  for a moment cornelia did not say anything then she quietly remarked i can be home all the sooner and she took the paper which ludlow had written the address on she noticed that it smelt of tobacco smoke  he said you could easily find your way from the grand central depot by the street cars its almost straight hes written down on the back which cars you take you give your check to the baggage expressman that comes aboard the train before you get in and then you dont have the least trouble he says there are several girl artstudents in the same house and youll soon feel at home he says if you feel the least timid about getting in alone hell come with a lady friend of his to meet you and shell take you to your boardinghouse  mrs burton escaped with rather more than her life from the transmission of this offer cornelia even said im very much obliged to him im sure but i shouldnt wish to trouble him thank you i wont feel the least timid  but her mother followed mrs burton out to the gate as usual i guess mrs saunders explained she hated to have him make so much todo about it what makes him want to bring a lady friend to meet her somebody hes engaged to  well thats what i wondered at first said mrs burton but then when i came to think how very different the customs are in new york i came to the conclusion that he did it on cornelias account if he was to take her to the boardinghouse himself they might think he was engaged to her  well said mrs saunders  you may be sure its because hes good and thoughtful about it and wants her not to have any embarrassment  oh i guess hes all right said mrs saunders but whod ever have thought of having to take such precautions i shouldnt think life was worth having on such terms if i was a girl  she told cornelia about this strange social ceremony of chaperonage which now for the first time practically concerned them     x   the night began to fall an hour before cornelias train reached new york and it drew into the station through the whirl and dance of particolored lights everywhere  the black porter of the sleepingear caught up her bag and carried it out for her as if he were going to carry it indefinitely and outside she stood letting him hold it while she looked about her scared and bewildered and the passengers hurrying by pushed and bumped against her when she collected her wits sufficiently to take it from him she pressed on with the rest up toward the front of the station where the crowd frayed out in different directions at the open doorway giving on the street she stopped and stood holding her bag and gazed fearfully out on a line of wild men on the curbstone they all seemed to be stretching their hands out to her and they rattled and clamored keb a keb a keb a keb want a keb keb here keb a keb a keb a keb they were kept back by a policeman who prevented them from falling upon the passengers and restored them to order when they yielded by the halfdozen to the fancy that some one had ordered a cab and started off in the direction of their vehicles and then rushed back so as not to lose other chances the sight of cornelia standing bag in hand there seemed to drive them to a frenzy of hope several newsboys eager to share their prosperity rushed up and offered her the evening papers  cornelia strained forward from the doorway and tried to make out in the kaleidoscopic pattern of lights which was the fourth avenue car the street was full of cars and carts and carriages all going every which way with a din of bells and wheels and hoofs that was as if crushed to one clangerous mass by the superior uproar of the railroad trains coming and going on a sort of streetroof overhead a sickening odor came from the mud of the gutters and the horses and people and as if a wave of repulsion had struck against every sense in her the girl turned and fled from the sight and sound and smell of it all into the ladies waitingroom at her right  she knew about that room from mrs burton who had said she could go in there and fix her hair if it had got tumbled when she came off the train but it had been so easy to keep everything just right in the nice dressingroom on the sleeper that she had expected to step out of the station and take a fourth avenue car without going into the ladiesroom she found herself the only person in it except a comfortable friendlylooking middleaged woman who seemed to be in charge of the place and was going about with a dustcloth in her hand she had such a homelike air and it was so peaceful there after all that uproar outside that cornelia could hardly keep back the tears though she knew it was silly and kept saying so to herself under her breath  she put her handbag down and went and stood at one of the windows trying to make up her mind to venture out and then she began to move back and forth from one window to the other it must have been this effect of restlessness and anxiety that made the janitress speak to her at last expecting friends to meet you  cornelia turned round and took a good look at the janitress she decided from her official as well as her personal appearance that she might be trusted as least provisionally it had been going through her mind there at the windows what a fool she was to refuse to let mr ludlow come to meet her with that friend of his and she had been helplessly feigning that she had not refused and that he was really coming but was a little late she was in the act of accepting his apology for the delay when the janitress spoke to her and she said i dont know whether id better wait any longer i was looking for a fourth avenue car  well you couldnt hardly miss one said the janitress theyre going all the time stranger in the city  yes i am cornelia admitted she thought she had better admit it  well said the janitress if i was you id wait for my friends a while longer its after dark now and if they come here and find you gone theyll be uneasy wont they  well said cornelia and she sank submissively into a seat  the janitress sat down too not but what its safe enough and you neednt be troubled if they dont come you can go half an hour later just as well my ive had people sit here all day and wait the things ive seen here well if they were put into a story you couldnt hardly believe them i had a poor woman come in here one morning last week with a baby in her arms and three little children hanging round her to wait for her husband and she waited till midnight and he didnt come i could have told her first as well as last that he wasnt ever coming i knew it from the kind of a letter he wrote her and that she fished up out of her pocket to show me so as to find whether she had come to the right place to wait or not but i couldnt bear to do it and i did for her and the children as well as i could and when it came to it about twelve i coaxed her to go home and come again in the morning she didnt come back again i guess she began to suspect something herself  why dont you suppose he ever meant to come cornelia asked tremulously  i dont know said the janitress i didnt tell her so ive had all kinds of homeless folks come in here that had lost their pocketbooks or never had any and little tots of children with papers pinned on to tell me who they were expecting and ive had em here on my hands till i had to shut up at night  and what did you do then cornelia began to be anxious about her own fate in case she should not get away before the janitress had to shut up  well some i had to put into the street them that were used to it and then there are homes of all kinds for most of em old ladies homes and young girls homes and destitute females homes and childrens homes where they can go for the night and all ive got to do is to give an order it isnt as bad as youd think when you first come to the city i came here from connecticut  cornelia thought she might respond so far as to say im from ohio and the janitress seemed to appreciate the confidence  she said not on your way to the white house i suppose there are so many presidents from your state well i knew you were not from near new york anywhere i do have so many different sorts of folks coming in here and i have to get acquainted with so many of em whether or no lots of foreigners for one thing and men blundering in as well as women they think its a ticketoffice and want to buy tickets of me and i have to direct em where its surprising how bright they are oftentimes the irish are the hardest to get pointed right the italians are quick and the chinese my theyre the brightest of all if a chinaman comes in for a ticket up the harlem road all ive got to do is to set my hand so and so she faced south and set her hand westward then she faced west and set her hand northward they understand in a minute and theyre off like a flash  as if she had done now all that sympathy demanded for cornelia the janitress went about some work in another part of the room and left the girl to herself but cornelia knew that she was keeping a friendly eye on her and in the shelter of her presence she tried to gather courage to make that start into the street alone which she must finally make and which she was so foolish to keep postponing she had written to the landlady of her boarding house that she should arrive on such a day at such an hour and here was the day and she was letting the hour go by and very likely the landlady would give her room to some one else or if the expressman who took her check on the train should get there with her trunk first the landlady might refuse to take it cornelia did not know how people acted about such things in new york she ought to go and she tried to rise but she was morally so unable that it was as if she were physically unable  people came and went some of them more than once and cornelia began to feel that they noticed her and recognized her but still she could not move suddenly a figure appeared at the door the sight of which armed her with the power of flight she knew that it was ludlow from the photograph he had lately sent mrs burton with the pointed beard and the branching moustache which he had grown since they met last and she jumped up to rush past him where he stood peering sharply round at the different faces in the room and finally letting his eyes rest in eager question on hers  he came towards her and then it was too late to escape miss saunders oh im so glad ive been out of town and ive only just got mrs burtons telegram have i kept you waiting long  not very said cornelia she might have said that he had not kept her waiting at all the time that she had waited without being kept by him was now like no time at all but she could not say anything more and she wished to cry she felt so glad and safe in his keeping he caught up her bag and she followed him out with a blush over her shoulder for the janitress who smiled after her with mistaken knowingness but this was at least her selfdelusion and cornelia had an instant in the confusion when it seemed as if ludlows coming had somehow annulled the tacit deceit she had practised in letting the janitress suppose she expected some one  ludlow kept talking to her all the way in the horsecar but she could find only the briefest and dryest answers to his friendly questions about her mother and the burtons and all pymantoning and she could not blame him for taking such a hasty leave of her at her boardinghouse that he almost flew down the steps before the door closed upon her  she knew that she had disgusted him and she hinted at this in the letter of scolding gratitude which she wrote to mrs burton before she slept for the trick she had played her after all though she reasoned she need not be so much troubled he had done it for mrs burton and not for her and he had not thought it worth while to bring a chaperon to be sure he had no time for that but there was something in it all which put cornelia back to the mere child she was when they first met in the fair house at pymantoning she kept seeing herself angry and illmannered and cross to her mother and it was as if he saw her so too she resented that for she knew that she was another person now and she tingled with vexation that she had done nothing to make him realize it     xi   ludlow caught a cab in the street and drove furiously to his lodging where he dressed in ten minutes so that he was not more than fifteen minutes late at the dinner he had risked missing for cornelias sake  im afraid im very late he said from his place at the left of his hostess he pulled his napkin across his lap and began to attack his oysters at once  oh not at all said the lady but he knew that she would have said much the same if he had come as they were rising from table  a clear gay voice rose from the corner of the board diagonally opposite the candles havent begun to burn their shades yet so you are still early mr ludlow  the others laughed with the joy people feel in having a familiar fact noted for the first time they had all seen candleshades weakly topple down on the flames and take fire at dinner  the gay voice went on rendered perhaps a little overbold by success if you see the men rising to put them out you may be sure that theyve been seated exactly an hour  ludlow looked across the bed of roses which filled twothirds of the table across the glitter of glass and the waver of light and shadow and said oh youre there  the wit that had inspired the voice before gave out the owner tried to make a pout do duty for it of course im there she said then pending another inspiration she was silent everybody waited for her to rise again to the level of her reputation for clever things and the general expectation expressed itself in a subdued creaking of stiff linen above the board and the low murmur of silken skirts under the table  finally one of the men said well its bad enough to come late but its a good deal worse to come too early id rather come late any time  mr wetmore wants you to ask him why mrs westley said ludlow  mrs westley entreated oh why mr wetmore and every one laughed  all right ludlow said the gentleman in friendly menace then he answered mrs westley well one thing your hostess respects you more if you come too early you bring reproach and you meet contempt reproach that she shouldnt have been ready to receive you and contempt that you should have supposed her capable of dining at the hour fixed  it was a mrs rangeley who had launched the first shaft at ludlow she now fitted another little arrow to her string under cover of the laugh that followed mr wetmores reasons i shouldnt object to any ones coming late unless i were giving the dinner but what i cant bear is wondering what it was kept them  again she had given a touch that reminded the company of their common humanity and their unity of emotion and the laugh that responded was without any of that reservation or uncertainty which a subtle observer may often detect in the enjoyment of brilliant things said at dinner but the great charm of the westley dinners was that people generally did understand each other there if you made a joke as wetmore said you were not often required to spell it he celebrated the westleys as ideal hosts mrs westley had the youth and beauty befitting a second wife her social ambition had as yet not developed into the passion for millionaires she was simply content with painters like himself and ludlow literary men lawyers doctors and their several wives  general westley was in what wetmore called the bloom of age he might be depended upon for the unexpected like fate he occasionally did it he occasionally said it from the passive hospitality that characterized him  i believe i share that impatience of yours mrs rangeley he now remarked though in the present case i think we ought to leave everything to mr ludlows conscience  oh do you think that would be quite safe she asked with burlesque seriousness well if we must  ludlow said why i think mrs rangeley is right i would much rather yield to compulsion i dont mind telling what kept me if im obliged to  oh i almost hate to have you now mrs rangeley bubbled back your willingness somehow makes it awful you may be going to boast of it  no no wetmore interposed i dont believe its anything to boast of  now you see you must speak said mrs westley  ludlow fell back in his chair and dreamily crumbled his bread i dont see how i can exactly  wetmore leaned forward and looked at ludlow round the snowy shoulder of a tall lady next him  is there any particular form of words in which you like to be prompted when you get to this point  dr brayton might hypnotize him suggested the lady whose shoulder wetmore was looking round  the doctor answered across the table in these cases of the inverted or prostrated will there is often not volition enough to coöperate with the hypnotizer i dont believe i could do anything with mr ludlow  how much sighed mrs rangeley i should like to be the centre of universal interest like that  its a good pose said wetmore but really i think ludlow is working it too hard i dont approve of mob violence as the papers say when theyre going to but if he keeps this up much longer i wont be answerable for the consequences i feel that we are getting beyond the control of our leaders  ludlow was tempted to exploit the little incident with cornelia for he felt sure that it would win the dinnertable success which we all like to achieve her coming to study art in new york and her arriving in that way was a pretty romance prettier than it would have been if she were plainer and he knew that he could give the whole situation so that she should appear charming and should appeal to everybodys sympathy if he could show her stiff and blunt as she was so much the better he would go back to their first meeting and bring in a sketch of pymantoning county fair and of the village itself and its social conditions with studies of burton and his wife every point would tell for though his commensals were now all welltodo new yorkers he knew that the time had been with them when they lived closer to the ground in simple country towns as most prosperous and eminent americans have done  well said wetmore how long are you going to make us wait  oh you mustnt wait for me said ludlow once is enough tonight im not going to say what kept me  this also was a success in its way it drew cries of protest and reproach from the ladies and laughter from the men wetmore made himself heard above the rest mrs westley i know this man and i cant let you be made the victim of one of his shameless fakes there was really nothing kept him he either forgot the time or what is more probable he deliberately put off coming so as to give himself a little momentary importance by arriving late i dont wish to be hard upon him but that is the truth  no no said the hostess in the applause which recognized wetmores mischievous intent ill not believe anything of the kind from her this had the effect of repartee and when she asked with the singleheartedness which wetmore had praised among her friends as her strongest point and advised her keeping up as long as she possibly could it isnt so is it mr ludlow the finest wit could not have done more for her the general beamed upon her over the length of the table mrs rangeley said at his elbow shes always more charming than any one else simply because she is and he made no effort to turn the compliment upon her as she thought he might very well have done  under cover of what the others now began saying about different matters ludlow murmured to mrs westley i dont mind telling you you know that young girl you said you would go with me to meet when i should ask you  the little schoolmistress  yes ludlow smiled she isnt so very little any more it was she who kept me i found a dispatch at my place when i got home today telling me she was coming and would arrive at six and there was no time to trouble you it was halfpast when i got it  shes actually come then asked mrs westlay nothing you could say would stop her  no said ludlow with a shrug he added after a moment but i dont know that i blame her nothing would have stopped me  and is there anything else i can do has she a pleasant place to stay  good enough i fancy its a boardinghouse where several people i know have been she must be left to her own devices now thats the best thing for her its the only thing     xii   in spite of his theory as to what was best for her in some ways ludlow rather expected that cornelia would apply to him for advice as to how and where she should begin work he forgot how fully he had already given it but she had not she remembered what she had overheard him say to her mother that day in the fair house about the superiority of the synthesis of studies and she had since confirmed her faith in his judgment by much silent inquiry of the newspapers they had the sunday edition of the lakeland light at pymantoning and cornelia had kept herself informed of the gossip of the ateliers and concerning women and artists artists summer homes phases of studio life the ladies who are organizing ceramic clubs women art students glimpses of the dens of new york women artists and other æsthetic interests which the sunday edition of the light purveyed with the newspaper syndicates generous and indiscriminate abundance she did not believe it all much of it seemed to her very silly but she nourished her ambition upon it all the same  the lady writers who celebrated the lady artists and who mostly preferred to swim in seas of personal float did now and then offer their readers a basis of solid fact and they all agreed that the synthesis of art studies was the place for a girl if she was in earnest and wished to work  as these ladies described them the conditions were of the exacting sort which cornelias nature craved and she had her sexpride in the synthesis too because she had read that women had borne an important part in founding it the strictest technical training and the freest spirit of artistic endeavor prevailed in a school that owed its existence so largely to them that was a great point even if every one of the instructors was a man she supposed that mr ludlow would have sheltered himself behind this fact if she had used the other to justify herself in going on with art after he had urged that as a woman she had better not do so but the last thing cornelia intended was to justify herself to mr ludlow and she vehemently wished he would not try to do anything more for her now after sleeping upon the facts of their meeting she felt sure that he would not try she approved of herself for not having asked him to call in parting she was almost glad that he hardly had given her a chance to do so  it was saturday night when cornelia arrived and she spent sunday writing home a full account of her adventures to her mother whom she asked to give mrs barton the note she enclosed and in looking over her drawings and trying to decide which she should take to the synthesis with her she had a good deal of tacit argument about them with mr ludlow who persisted in her thoughts after several definitive dismissals and monday morning she presented herself with some drawings she had chosen as less ridiculous than some of the others and hovered with a haughty humility at the door of the little office till the janitor asked her if she would not come in and sit down he had apparently had official experience of cases like hers he refused without surprise the drawings which she offered him as her credentials and said the secretary would be in directly he did not go so far as to declare his own quality but he hospitably did what he could to make her feel at home  numbers of young people began to appear singly and in twos and threes and then go out again and go on up the stairs which led crookedly to and from the corner the office was cramped into some of them went up stairs after merely glancing into the office others found letters there and staid chatting awhile they looked at cornelia with merely an identifying eye at first as if they perceived that she was a new girl but as if new girls were such an old story that they could not linger long over one girl of the kind certain of the young ladies after they went up stairs came down in long dismal calico aprons that covered them to the throat and with an air of being so much absorbed in their work that they did not know what they had on they looked at cornelia again those who had seen her before and those who had not made up for it by looking at her twice and cornelia began to wonder if there was anything peculiar about her as she sat upright stiffening with resentment and faintly flushing under their scrutiny she wore her best dress which was a street dress as the best dress of a village girl usually is her mother had fitted it and they had made it themselves and agreed that it was very becoming mrs burton had said so too the fashion of her hat she was not so sure about but it was a pretty hat and unless she had got it on skewy and she did not believe she had there was nothing about it to make people stare so there was one of these girls whom cornelia felt to be as tall as herself and of much her figure she was as dark as cornelia but of a different darkness instead of the red that always lurked under the dusk in cornelias cheeks and that now burned richly through it her face was of one olive pallor except her crimson lips her long eyes were black with level brows and with a heavy fringe of lucent black hair cut straight above them her nose was straight at first glance but showed a slight arch in profile her mouth was a little too full and her chin slightly retreated she came in late and stopped at the door of the office and bent upon cornelia a look at once prehistoric and fin de siècle which lighted up with astonishment interest and sympathy successively then she went trailing herself on up stairs with her strange sphinxface over her shoulder and turned upon cornelia as long as she could see her  at last a gentleman came in and sat down behind the table in the corner and cornelia found a hoarse voice to ask him if he was the secretary he answered in the friendly way that she afterwards found went all through the synthesis that he was and she said with her country bluntness that she wished to study at the synthesis and she had brought some of her drawings with her if he wanted to look at them he took them but either he did not want to look at them or else it was not his affair to do so he said she would have to fill out a form and he gave her a blank which asked her in print a number of questions she had not thought of asking herself till then it obliged her to confess that she had never studied under any one before and to say which master in the synthesis she would like to study under now she had to choose between life and stilllife and the antique and she chose the antique she was not governed by any knowledge or desire in her choice more definite than such as come from her having read somewhere that the instructor in the antique was the severest of all the synthesis instructors and the most dreaded in his criticisms by the students she did not forget even in the presence of the secretary and with that bewildering blank before her that she wished to be treated with severity and that the criticism she needed was the criticism that every one dreaded  when the secretary fastened her application to her drawings she asked if she should wait to learn whether it was accepted or not but he said that he would send her application to the members room and the instructor would see it there in the morning she would have liked to ask him if she should come back there to find out but she was afraid to do it he might say no and then she should not know what to do she determined to come without his leave and the next morning she found that the master whom they had been submitted to had so far approved her drawings as to have scrawled upon her application recommended to the preparatory the secretary said the instructor in the preparatory would tell her which grade to enter there  cornelias heart danced but she governed herself outwardly and asked through her set teeth can i begin at once she had lost one day already and she was not going to lose another if she could help it  the secretary smiled if the instructor in the preparatory will place you  before noon she had passed the criticism needed for this and was in the lowest grade of the preparatory but she was a student at the synthesis and she was there to work in the way that those who knew best bade her she wished to endure hardness and the more hardness the better     xiii   cornelia found herself in the last of a long line of sections or stalls which flanked a narrow corridor dividing the girl students from the young men who were often indeed hardly more than boys there was a table stretching from this corridor to a window looking down on the roofs of some carpenter shops and stables on the board before her lay the elementary shape of a hand in plaster which she was trying to draw at her side that oddlooking girl who had stared so at her on the stairs the day before was working at a block foot and not getting it very well she had in fact given it up for the present and was watching cornelias work and watching her face and talking to her  what is your name she broke off to ask in the midst of a monologue upon the social customs and characteristics of the synthesis  cornelia always frowned and drew her breath in long sibilations when she was trying hard to get a thing right she now turned a knotted forehead on her companion but stopped her hissing to ask what then she came to herself and said oh saunders  i dont mean your last name said the other i mean your first name  cornelia said the owner of it as briefly as before  i should have thought it would have been gladys the other suggested  cornelia looked up in astonishment and some resentment why in the world should my name be gladys she demanded  i dont know the other explained but the first moment i saw you in the office i said to myself of course her name is gladys mine is charmian  is it said cornelia not so much with preoccupation perhaps as with indifference she thought it rather a nice name but she did not know what she had to do with it  yes the other said as if she had somehow expected to be doubted my last names maybough cornelia kept on at her work without remark and miss maybough pursued as if it were a branch of autobiography im going to have lunch arent you  cornelia sighed dreamily as she drew back for an effect of her drawing which she held up on the table before her is it time  do you suppose they would be letting me talk so to you if it werent the monitor would have been down on me long ago  cornelia had noticed a girl who seemed to be in authority and who sat where she could oversee and overhear all that went on  is she one of the students she asked  miss maybough nodded elected every month shes awful you cant do anything with her when shes on duty but shes a little dear when she isnt youll like her miss maybough leaned toward her and joined cornelia in a study of her drawing how splendidly youre getting it its very chic oh anybody can see that youve got genius  her admiration made no visible impression upon cornelia and for a moment she looked a little disappointed then she took a basket from under the table and drew from it a bottle of some yellowish liquid an orange and a bit of sponge cake are you going to have yours here she asked as cornelia opened a paper with the modest sandwich in it which she had made at breakfast and fetched from her boardinghouse oh im so glad you havent brought anything to drink with you i felt almost sure you hadnt and now youve got to share mine she took a cup from her basket and in spite of cornelias protest that she never drank anything but water at dinner she poured it full of tea for her ill drink out of the bottle she said i like to some of the girls bring chocolate but i think theres nothing like cold tea for the brain chocolates so clogging sos milk but sometimes i bring that its glorious drinking it out of the can she tilted the bottle to her lips and half drained it at a draught i always feel that im working with inspiration after ive had my cold tea of course they wont let you stay here long she added  why cornelia fluttered back in alarm  when they see your work theyll see that youre fit for stilllife at least  oh said cornelia vexed at having been scared for nothing i guess they wont be in any great hurry about it  how magnificent said miss maybough of course with that calm of yours you can wait as if you had eternity before you do you know that you are terribly calm  cornelia turned and gave her a long stare miss maybough broke her bit of cake in two and offered her half and cornelia took it mechanically but ate her sandwich i feel as if i had eternity behind me ive been in the preparatory so long  on the common footing this drop to the solid ground gave cornelia asked her how long  well its the beginning of my second year now if they dont let me go to round hands pretty soon i shall have to see if i cant get the form by modelling thats the best way i suppose its my imagination it carries me away so and i dont see the thing as it is before me thats what they say but with the clay ill have to dont you know well you know some of the french painters model their whole picture in clay and paint it before they touch the canvas any way i shall try it here awhile longer and then if i cant get to the round in any other way ill take to the clay if sculpture concentrates you more perhaps i may stick to it altogether art is one anyhow and the great thing is to live it dont you think so  i dont know said cornelia im not certain i know what you mean  you will said miss maybough after youve been here awhile and get used to the atmosphere i dont believe i really knew what life meant before i came to the synthesis when you get to realizing the standards of the synthesis then you begin to breathe freely for the first time i expect to pass the rest of my days here i shouldnt care if i stayed till i was thirty how old are you  im going on twenty said cornelia why  oh nothing you cant begin too young though some people think you oughtnt to come before youre eighteen i look upon my days before i came here as simply wasted dont you want to go out and sit on the stairs awhile  i dont believe i do said cornelia taking up her drawing again as if she were going on with it  horrors miss maybough put her hand out over the sketch you dont mean that youre going to carry it any farther  why it isnt finished yet cornelia began  of course it isnt and it never ought to be i hope youre not going to turn out a niggler please dont i couldnt bear to have you nobody will respect you if you finish dont if you wont come out with me and get a breath of fresh air do start a new drawing i want them to see this in the rough its so bold  miss maybough had left her own drawing in the rough but it could not be called bold though if she had seen the block hand with a faltering eye she seemed to have had a fearless vision of many other things and she had covered her paper with a fantastic medley of grotesque shapes out of that imagination which she had given cornelia to know was so fatally mischievous to her in its uninvited activities dont look at them she pleaded when cornelia involuntarily glanced at her study my only hope is to hate them i almost pray to be delivered from them lets talk of something else she turned the sheet over do you mind my having said that about your drawing  no said cornelia provoked to laughter by the solemnity of the demand why should i  oh i dont know do you think you shall like me i mean do you care if i like youvery very much  i dont suppose i could stop it if i did could i asked cornelia  the sphinx seemed to find heart to smile of course im ridiculous but i do hope were going to be friends tell me about yourself or have some more tea     xiv   i dont want any more tea thank you said cornelia and there isnt anything to tell  there must be the other girl insisted clinging to her bottle with tragic intensity any one can see that youve lived what part of the country did you come from  ohio said cornelia as the best way to be done with it  and have you ever been in santa fé  goodness no why its in new mexico  yes i was born there then my father went to colorado he isnt living now are your father and mother living  my mother is said cornelia the words brought up a vision of her mother as she must be sitting that moment in the little frontroom and a mist came suddenly before her eyes she shut her lips hard to keep them from trembling  i see you worship her said miss maybough fervidly keeping her gaze fixed upon cornelia you are homesick  im not homesick said cornelia angry that she should be so and that she should be denying it  mine said the other died while i was a baby she had indian blood she added in the same way in which she had said her name was charmian  did she cornelia asked  that is the legend said miss maybough solemnly her grandmother was a zuñi princess she turned her profile see  it does look a little indian said cornelia  some people think its egyptian miss maybough suggested as if she had been leading up to the notion and were anxious not to have it ignored  cornelia examined the profile steadily presented more carefully its a good deal more egyptian  miss maybough relieved her profile from duty and continued weve been everywhere paris two years thats where i took up art in dead earnest julian you know mamma didnt want me to she wanted me to go into society there and she does here but i hate it dont you think society is very frivolous or any way very stupid  i dont know much about it i never went out much said cornelia  well i hope youre not conventional nobodys conventional here  i dont believe im conventional enough to hurt said cornelia  you have humor too said miss maybough thoughtfully as if she had been mentally cataloguing her characteristics youll be popular  cornelia stared at her and turned to her drawing  but youre proud said the other i can see that i adore pride it must have been your pride that fascinated me at the first glance do you mind my being fascinated with you  cornelia wanted to laugh at the same time she wondered what new kind of crazy person she had got with this was hardly one of the artstudents that went wild from overwork miss maybough kept on without waiting to be answered i havent got a bit of pride myself i could just let you walk over me how does it feel to be proud what are you proud for  cornelia quieted a first impulse to resent this pursuit i dont think im very proud i used to be proud when i was littlei guess you ought to have asked me then  oh yes tell me about yourself miss maybough implored again but she went on as before without giving cornelia any chance to reply of course when i say mamma i mean my stepmother shes very good to me but she doesnt understand me youll like her ill tell you what sort of a person she is she did so at such length that the lunch hour passed before she finished and a hush fell upon all the babbling voices about as the monitor came back to her place  toward the end of the afternoon the monitors vigilance relaxed again and miss maybough began to talk again if you want to be anything by the synthesis standards she said youve got to keep this up a whole year you know it was now four oclock and cornelia had been working steadily since eleven except for the halfhour at lunchtime theyll see how well you draw you neednt be afraid of their not doing that and theyll let you go on to the round at once perhaps but if youre truly synthetic in spirit you wont want to youll want to get all you can out of the block and itll take you a year to do that then another year for the full length you know at first we only had the block here and a good many people think now that the full length preparatory encroaches on the antique sometimes they even let you put in backgrounds here but it dont matter much when the instructor in the antique gets hold of you he makes you unlearn everything youve learnt in the fulllength hes grand  a girl who was working at the other end of the table said with a careless air they told me i might go up to the antique today  lida miss maybough protested in a voice hoarse with admiration  yes but im not going  why not i should think you would be so proud how did they come to tell you  oh they just said i might but im not going theyre so severe in the antique they just discourage you  yes that is so said miss maybough with a sigh of solemn joy they make you feel as if you couldnt draw at all  yes said the other girl they act as if you didnt know a thing  i wouldnt go said miss maybough  i dont know perhaps i may the girl went on drawing and miss maybough turned to cornelia again  towards the end of your third yearor perhaps you dont like to have your future all mapped out does it scare you  i guess if it does i shall live through it said cornelia steadily her heart was beginning to quake somewhat but she was all the more determined not to show it  well the third year you may get to painting stilllife while you keep up your drawing afternoons here the next year youll go into the antique class if theyll let you and draw heads and keep up your stilllife mornings when they think youre fit for it theyll let you do an arm maybe and work along that way to the full figure and that takes another whole winter then you go into the life class one of them all the morning and keep drawing from the antique in the afternoons or else do heads from the model you do a head every day and then paint it out and begin another the next day you learn to sacrifice self to art its grand well then the next winter you keep on just the same and as many winters after that as you please you know what one instructor said to a girl that asked him what she should do after she had been five years in the synthesis  no i dont answered cornelia anxiously  stay five years more  miss maybough did not give this time to sink very deep into cornelias spirit will you let me call you by your first name  why ive hardly ever been called by any other said cornelia simply  and will you call me charmian  i had just as lief cornelia laughed she could not help it that girl seemed so odd she did not know whether she liked her or not  what poise you have got sighed charmian may i come to see you not a ceremonious call in your own room where we can talk  cornelia thought that if they went on as they had that day they should probably talk quite enough at the synthesis but she said why yes i should like to have you if you wont care for my sitting on the trunk theres only one chair  let me have the trunk promise me youll let me sit on the trunk its divine is it in a salvation hotel  what do you mean asked cornelia  why thats what they call the places that the young womens christian association keep  no it isnt its just a boardinghouse cornelia wrote her address on a piece of paper and charmian received it with solemn rapture she caught cornelia in a sudden embrace and kissed her before cornelia could help herself oh i adore you she cried  they parted at the head of the stairs where they found themselves among groups of students arriving from all parts of the place and pausing for synthesis gossip which cornelia could not have entered into yet if she had wished she escaped and walked home to her boardinghouse with rather a languid pace and climbed to her little room on the fifth story and lay down on her bed it was harder work than teaching and her back ached and her heart was heavy with the thought of five years in the synthesis when she barely had money enough for one winter she was not afraid of the work she liked that she would be glad to spend her whole life at it but she could not give five years to it and perhaps ten she was ashamed now to think she had once dreamed of somehow slipping through in a year and getting the good of it without working for it she tried to plan how she could go home and teach a year and then come back and study a year and so on but by the end of the twenty years that it would take for ten years study at this rate she would be an old woman of forty ready to drop into the grave she was determined not to give up and if she did not give up there was no other end to it or so it seemed at the close of her first day in the synthesis  she was very homesick and she would have liked to give up altogether and go home but she thought of what people would say of how her mother who would be so glad to see her would feel she would not be a baby and she turned her face over in the pillow and sobbed     xv   cornelia thought that perhaps mr ludlow would feel it due to mrs burton to come and ask how she was getting on but if she did not wish him to come she had reason to be glad for the whole week passed and she did not see him or hear anything from him she did not blame him for she had been very uncouth and no doubt he had done his whole duty in meeting her at the depot and seeing her safely housed the first night she wished to appreciate his kindness and when she found herself wondering a little at his not caring to know anything more about her she made much of it if it was not all that she could have imagined from his offer to be of use to her in any way he could she reminded herself that he had made that offer a very long time ago and that she never meant to use him beside she was proud of having made her start alone and she knew which way she wished to go though the way seemed so hard and long at times she was not sure that all the students at the synthesis were so clear as to their direction but they all had the same faith in the synthesis and its methods they hardly ever talked to her of anything else and first and last they talked a good deal to her it was against the rules to loiter and talk in the corridors as much against the rules as smoking but every now and then you came upon a young man with a cigarette and he was nearly always talking with a group of girls at lunchtime the steps and windowseats were full and the passages were no longer thoroughfares after the first day cornelia came out with the rest charmian maybough said that one could not get into the spirit of the synthesis unless one did and in fact those who wished to work and those who would rather have played as it seemed to her met there in the same æsthetic equality she found herself acquainted with a great many girls whose names she did not know in the fervor of the common interest the perpetual glow of enthusiasm which crowned the severest ordeals of the synthesis with the halo of happy martyrdom if not the wreath of victory  they talked about the different instructors how awful they were and how they made you cry sometimes they were so hard on your work but if you amounted to anything you did not mind it when you got to feel what they meant then you wanted them to be harsh they said of one my you ought to see him he can spoil your drawing for you he just takes your charcoal and puts thick black lines all over everything it dont do to finish much for him they celebrated another for sitting down in front of your work and drooping in silent despair before it for awhile and then looking up at you in cold disgust and asking what made you draw it that way as if it were inconceivable anybody should have been willing to do it so there were other instructors who were known to have the idea of getting at the best in you by a sympathetic interest in what you had tried for and looking for some good in it the girls dramatized their manner of doing this they did not hold them in greater regard than the harder masters but they did not hold them in less and some of them seemed to value an instructor as much for the way he squinted his eyes at your drawing as for what he said of it  the young men did not talk so much of the instructors they were more reticent about everything but some had formed themselves upon them and you could tell which each of these was studying under or this was what charmian maybough said  she led cornelia all about through the quaint old rookery with its wandering corridors and its clusters of rooms distributed at random in the upper stories of several buildings which the synthesis had gathered to itself as if by a sort of affinity and she lectured upon every one and everything  it was against usage for students in the lower grades to visit the upper classes when they were at work but charmian contrived stolen glimpses of the stilllife rooms and the rooms where they were working from the draped models for the first time cornelia saw the irregular hemicycle of students silently intent upon the silent forms and faces of those strange creatures who sat tranced in a lifeless immobility as if the long practice of their trade had resolved them into something as impersonal as the innumerable pictures studied from them she even penetrated with charmian to the womens liferoom where you really could not go while the model was posing and where they had to time their visit at the moment when the girls had left off for lunch and were chattering over their chocolate they had set it out on the vacant modelstand and they invited their visitors to break bread with them the bread they had brought to rub out their drawings with they made cornelia feel as much at home with them on the summit they had reached as she felt with the timidest beginners in the preparatory charmian had reported everywhere that she had genius and in the absence of proofs to the contrary the lifeclass accepted her as if she had their talk was not very different from the talk of the students in the lower grades they spoke of the synthesis and asked her how she liked it but they did not wait for her to say they began to descant upon their instructors and the pictures their instructors had last exhibited at the academy or the american artists and the things that the old synthesis pupils had there cornelia learned here that even actual synthetics had things in the exhibitions and that in the last academy a preparatory girl had sold a picture she determined that before the winter was over she would at least give the academy a chance to refuse the picture of another preparatory girl  she got charmian to point out the girl who had sold the picture she was a little quietlooking thing cornelia saw some of her work in round hands and she did not think it was better than she could do herself she took courage and dreamed of trying not to disappoint the hopes of immediate performance which she knew her mother would be having in spite of her pretending the contrary her mother had written that she must not work herself down trying to learn too fast but must take the whole winter for it cornelia wondered what she would think if she knew how little a person could be expected to do in one winter in the regular synthesis way  she was happier at the end of the first week than she had been at the end of the first day though she was very tired and was glad to stop at the earlier hour when most of the students left their work on saturday afternoon she had begun to feel the charm of the synthesis which every one said she would feel she was already a citizen of the little republic where the heaviest drudgery was sweet with a vague high faith and hope it was all a strange happiness to her and yet not strange it was like a heritage of her own that she had come into something she was born to a right a natural condition  she did not formulate this or anything she did not ask herself why the frivolities and affectations which disgusted her in the beginning no longer offended her so much she only saw that some of the most frivolous and affected of her fellowcitizens were the cleverest and that the worst of them were better than they might have been where the ideal was less generous she did not know then or afterwards just why some of them were there and they did not seem to know themselves there were some who could reasonably expect to live by their art there were more who could hope to live by teaching it but there were others who had no definite aim or purpose and seemed to think their study would shape them to some design they were trying it they did not know clearly why or at least were not able to say clearly why there were several rich girls and they worked from the love of it as hard as the poorest there were some through whom she realized what ludlow meant when he spoke to her mother of the want that often went hand in hand with art there were others even more pitiful who struggled with the bare sufficiency of gift to keep within the synthesis but even among the girls who were so poor that they had to stint themselves of food and fire for arts sake there were the bravest and gayest spirits and some of these who could never have learned to draw well if they had spent their lives in the synthesis and were only waiting till their instructor should find the heart to forbid them further endeavor were so sweet and good that cornelias heart ached for them  at first she was overawed by all the students simply because they were all older students at the synthesis than she was then she included them without distinction in the slight that she felt for the chatter and the airs of some after that she made her exceptions among them she begun to see how every one honored and admired the hard workers she could not revert to her awe of them even of the hardest workers but she became more tolerant of the idlest and vaguest she compared herself with the clever ones and owned herself less clever not without bitterness but certainly with sincerity and with a final humility that enabled her to tolerate those who were least clever     xvi   when she got home from the synthesis the first saturday afternoon cornelia climbed up the four flights of stairs that led to her little room and lay down to rest as she promised mrs burton she would do every day some days she did not she had to lie on her bed which filled twothirds of the room there was a bureau with a glass which she could not see the bottom of her skirt in without jumping up and a washstand with a shutdown lid where she wrote her letters and drew a chair stood between that and her trunk which was next the door and let the door open part way  it seemed very cramped at first but she soon got used to it and then she did not think about it but accepted it as she did everything else in the life that was all so strange to her she had never been in a boardinghouse before and she did not know whether it was new york usage or not that her trunk which the expressman had managed to leave in the lower hall should be left standing there for twentyfour hours after his escape and that then she should be asked to take some things out of it so that it should not be too heavy for the servingmaids to carry up to her room there was no manservant in the place but the landlady said that they expected to have a furnaceman as soon as it came cold weather  the landlady was such an indistinct quality that it could seldom be known whether she was at home or not and when she was identifiably present whether she had promised or had not promised to do this or that people were always trying to see her for some reason or no reason and it was said that the best time to find her was at table this was not so easy the meals had a certain range in time and the landlady was nominally at the head of the table but those who came early to find her made the mistake of not having come late and if you came late you just missed her yet she was sometimes actually to be encountered at the head of the stairs from the kitchen or evanescing from the parlor and somehow the house was operated the meals came and went and the smell of their coming and going filled the hallway from the ground floor to the attic some people complained of the meals but cornelias traditions were so simple that she thought them a constant succession of prodigies with never less than steak fish and hash for breakfast and always turkey and cranberry sauce for dinner and often icecream sometimes the things were rather burnt but she did not see that there was much to find fault with she celebrated the luxury in her letters home and she said that she liked the landlady too and that they had got to be great friends in fact the landlady reminded the girl of her own mother in the sort of springless effectiveness with which she brought things to pass when you would never have expected any result whatever and she was gentle like her mother and simplehearted with all her elusiveness but she was not neat like mrs saunders the house went at loose ends cornelia found fluff under her bed that must have been there a long time the parlor and the diningroom were kept darkened and no one could have told what mysteries their corners and set pieces of furniture harbored the carpets where the subdued light struck them betrayed places worn down to the warp mrs montgomery herself had a like effect of unsparing use her personal upholstery showed frayed edges and broken woofs which did not seriously discord with her nerveless gentility  the parlor was very long and rather narrow and it was crossed at the rear by the diningroom which showed the table in stages of preparation or dismantling through slidingdoors never quite shut at intervals along the parlor walls were set sofas in linen brocade and yellow jute and various easy and uneasy chairs in green plush stood about in no definite relation to the blackwalnut marbletopped centretable a scarf knotted and held by a spelter vase to one of the marble mantles for there were two recorded a moment of the æsthetic craze which had ceased before it got farther amidst the earlier and honester ugliness of the room the gasfixtures were of the vineleaf and grapecluster bronzeage some of the garlands which ought to have been attached to the burners hung loose from the parent stem without the effort on the part of any witness to complete the artistic intention in the evening the ladyboarders received their gentlemencallers in the parlor their ladycallers were liable at all times to be asked if they would not like to go to the boarders rooms and whether they expressed this preference or not they were directed where to find them by the maid who then rapidly disappeared down the kitchen stairs  in fact the doorservice at mrs montgomerys was something she would probably have deprecated if any one had asked her to do so it was the charge of a large rawboned irish girl who made up by her athletic physique and her bass voice for the want of a manservant on the premises she browbeat visitors into acceptance of the theory that the persons they came to see were not at home especially if they showed signs of intending to wait in the parlor while she went upstairs to find out those who suffered from her were of the sex least fitted to combat her the gentlemen boarders seldom had callers when they had their callers did not ask whether their friends were in or not they went and saw for themselves  the gentlemen at mrs montgomerys were fewer than the ladies and they were for several reasons in greater favor for one thing they gave less trouble they had a less lively fear of mice and they were not so apt to be out of health and to want their meals sent up they ate more but they did not waste so much and they never did any sort of washing in their rooms cornelia did not know who or what some of them were but she made sure of a theatrical manager two or three gentlemen in different branches of commerce a newspaper writer of some sort and an oldish gentleman who had been with mrs montgomery a great while and did not seem to be anything but a gentleman boarder pure and simple they were all very civil and quiet and they bore with the amiable american fortitude the hardships of the common lot at mrs montgomerys which cornelia underwent ignorantly as necessary incidents of life in new york  she now fell asleep where she lay and she was startled from her nap but hardly surprised to hear her name spoken in the hall far below as if it were a theme of contention between the bassvoiced irish girl and some one at the street door who supported the other side of the question in low indistinct ladylike murmurs  no she dont be in said the irish girl bluntly the polite murmur insisted and the irish girl said with finality well then yous can go up yourselves and see the room is right over the dure four flights up  cornelia jumped up and tried to pull her hair into a knot before the glass there came a tap at her door and the voice of charmian maybough asked may i come in miss saunderscornelia  yes said cornelia and she opened the door as far as her trunk would let her  charmian pushed impetuously in she took cornelia in her arms and kissed her as if they had not met for a long time  oh she said whirling about so as to sweep the whole room with her glance before sinking down on cornelias trunk why cant i have something like this well i shall have i hope before i die yet what made her say you werent in i knew you were she rose and flew about the room and examined it in detail she was very beautifully dressed in a street costume of immediate fashion without a suggestion of the æstheticism of the picturesque gown she wore at the synthesis that had originality but cornelia perceived with the eye trained to see such differences that this had authority charmian could not help holding and carrying herself differently in it too she was exquisitely gloved and cornelia instinctively felt that her hat was from paris though till then she had never seen a paris hat to know it she might have been a little overawed by it if the wearer had not abruptly asked her what she thought of it  well said cornelia with her country directness which was so different from the others abruptness i think its about the most perfect thing i ever saw  charmian sighed i saw you looking at it yes it is a dream but its a badge of slavery sos the whole costume look how im laced she flung open the jacket and revealed a waist certainly much smaller than she had earlier in the day thats the way it goes through my whole life mamma is dead set against the artistic and im dead set against the fashionable as long as im at the synthesis i do as the synthetics do i dress like the synthesis and i think like it and i act like it as soon as i get home in the afternoon i have to be of the world worldly i put on a worth frock and mamma would make me put on a worth spirit if she could i do my best to conform because its the bargain and ill keep my word if it kills me now you see what a double life i lead if i could only be steeped in hopeless poverty to the lips if i could have a room like this even sometimes im so bewildered by the twofold existence im leading i dont really know what im saying those your things of course she sprang from cornelias trunk which she had sank down upon again and swiftly traversed the sketches cornelia had pinned about the wall what touch yes you merely have to live on to be anything you like itll do itself for you well i suppose youll have to see her she turned about to cornelia with an air of deprecation mamma you know shes down stairs waiting for us she thinks it right to come with me always i dare say it is she isnt so very bad you know only she insists upon knowing all the girls i take a fancy to herself you neednt be afraid of her  i dont know why i should be afraid of anybody said cornelia  the darker corner of the long parlor was occupied by a young couple in the earnest inquiry into each others psychological peculiarities which marks a stage of the passion of love it obliged them to get very close together where they sat she on a lounge and he in the chair which he kept pulling nearer and nearer they fulfilled these conditions and exchanged their observations with a freedom that ignored the presence of the lady sitting somewhat severely upright between the two long front windows exactly midway of the dingy lace curtains trained fanwise on the carpet they were not disturbed when cornelia and charmian appeared the young lady continued to dangle the tassel of a cushion through her fingers and the young man leaned toward her with his face in his hand and his elbow sunk in the arm of the lounge but the other lady rose at once and came quickly forward as if escaping from them beside the tall girls she looked rather little and she was decidedly blonde against their brunette color she wore a veil that came just between her upper and her lower lip and that stirred lightly when she spoke she was dressed with the same authoritative fashion as charmian but not so simply  she did not wait for her daughter to speak but took cornelias hand and said in a soft voice miss saunders i am very glad we found you at home my daughter has been speaking to me about you and we hoped to have come sooner but we couldnt manage together before  wont you sit down asked cornelia  no i thank you mrs maybough returned with a velvety tenderness of tone that seemed to convey assent we shall be rather late as it is i hope youre comfortably situated here  oh very said cornelia ive never been away from home before and of course it isnt like home  yes said mrs maybough one misses the refinements of home in such places she turned and swept the appointments of the room including the students of psychology with a critical eye  i wish i could come here sighed the daughter if i could have a room like cornelias mamma i wish you could see it  im glad youre pleasantly placed miss saunders i hope youre not working too hard at the synthesis i understand the young ladies there are so enthusiastic  oh no cornelia protested  of course she is said charmian everybody works too hard at the synthesis its the ideal of the place we woke her out of a nap and i know she was tired to death  cornelia could not deny it and so she said nothing  oh said mrs maybough noncommittally that wont do she paused without intermitting the scrutiny which cornelia felt she had been subjecting her to from the first moment through her veil you mustnt wear yourself out she paused again and then while charmian turned away with an effect of impatience she asked do you ever go out on sundays  why i dont know cornelia began not certain whether mrs maybough meant walking out or driving out young people did both in pymantoning  mrs maybough pursued we receive on thursdays but we have a few friends coming in tomorrow afternoon and we should be very glad to see you if you have nothing better  the invitation was so tentatively so gingerly offered in manner if not in words that cornelia was not quite sure it had been given she involuntarily searched her memory for something better before she spoke for the first time in her life she was about to invent a previous engagement when charmian suddenly turned and laid her arms about her neck  youll come of course  charmian said mrs maybough it would have been hard to tell whether she was reproving the action or the urgence then we shall hope to see you  yes thank you said cornelia  do come said charmian as if she had not yet accepted i cant let it be a whole day and two nights before i see you again she put her arm round cornelias waist as the girl went with them to the outer door to open it for them in her village fashion in the hall charmian whispered passionately dont you envy them oh if i could live in such a house with you and with people like that just to look at  my dear said mrs maybough  they seem to be engaged said cornelia placidly without sense of anything wrong in the appearance of the fact  evidently said mrs maybough  i shouldnt care for the engagement said charmian that would be rather horrid but if you were in love to feel that you neednt hide it or pretend not to be that is life im coming here mamma     xvii   mrs maybough had an apartment in the mandan flats and her windows looked out over miles of the tinted foliage of the park and down across the avenue into one of the pretty pools which light up its woodland reaches the position was superb and the mandan was in some sort worthy of it the architect had done his best to give unity and character to its tremendous mass and he had failed in much less measure than the architects of such buildings usually do cornelia dismounted into the dirty street in front of it from a shabby horsecar and penetrated its dimmed splendors of mosaic pavement and polished granite pillars and frescoed vaults with a heart fluttered by a hallboy all over buttons and a janitor in blue and silver livery and an elevatorman in like keeping with american ideals she was disgusted with herself that she should be so scared and she was ashamed of the relief she felt when a servant in plain clothes opened mrs mayboughs door to her she knew he must be a servant because he had on a dresscoat and a white tie and she had heard the burtons joke about how they were always taking the waiters for clergymen at first in europe he answered her with subdued respectfulness when she asked for the ladies and then he went forward and for the first time in her life she heard her name called into a drawingroom as she had read it was done in england but never could imagine it the man held aside the portière for her to pass but before she could pass there came a kind of joyous whoop from within a swishing of skirts toward her and she was caught in the arms of charmian who kissed her again and again and cried out over her goodness in coming  why didnt you expect me cornelia asked bluntly  yes but i was just pretending you wouldnt come or something had happened to keep you so that i could have the good of the revulsion when you did come and feel that it was worth all i had suffered dont you like to do that  i dont believe i ever did it said cornelia  thats what makes you so glorious charmian exulted you dont need to do such things youre equal to life as it comes but i have to prepare myself for it every way i can dont you see  she led her all embraced into the drawingroom where she released her to the smooth welcome of mrs maybough there was no one else in the vast high room which was lit with long windows and darkened again with long thick curtains but was still light enough to let cornelia see the elaborate richness of mrs mayboughs dress and the simple richness of charmians she herself wore her streetdress and she did not know whether she ought to keep her hat on or not but charmian said she must pour tea with her and she danced cornelia down the splendid length of the three great salons opening into each other along the front of the apartment toward her own room where she said she must leave it the drawingroom was a harmony of pictures so rich and soft and rugs so rich and soft that the colors seemed to play from wall to floor and back again in the same mellow note the dimness of the diningroom was starred with the glimmer of silver and cutglass and the fainter reflected light of polished mahogany the library was a luxury of low leather chairs and lounges lurking windowseats curtained in warm colors and shelves full of even ranks of books in french bindings of blue and green leather there was a great carved library table in front of the hearth where a softcoal fire flickered with a point or two of flame on the mantel a french clock of classic architecture caught the eye with the gleam of its pendulum as it vibrated inaudibly it was all extremely well done infinitely better done than cornelia could have known it was tasteful and refined with the taste and refinement of the decorator who had wished to produce the effect of long establishment and wellbred permanency the mandan flats were really not two years old and mrs maybough had taken her apartment in the spring and had been in it only a few weeks  now all this is mamma charmian said suffering cornelia to pause for a backward glance at the rooms as she pushed open a door at the side of the library i simply endure it because its in the bargain but its no more me than my gown is this is where i stay when im with mamma but im going to show you where i live where i dream she glided down the electriclighted corridor where they found themselves and apologized over her shoulder to cornelia behind her of course you cant have an attic in a flat and anything like rain on the roof is practically impossible but ive come as near to it as i could be careful here are the stairs she mounted eight or ten steps that crooked upward and flung wide a door at the top of the landing it gave into a large room fronting northward and lighted with one wide window the ceiling sloped and narrowed down to this from the quadrangular vault and the cool gray walls rose not much above cornelias head where they met the roof they were all stuck about with sketches in oil and charcoal an easel with a canvas on it stood convenient to the light a fleshtinted layfigure in tumbled drapery drooped limply in a corner a table littered with palettes and brushes and battered tubes of color was carelessly pushed against the window there were some lustrous rugs hung up beside the door the floor was bare except for a great tigerskin with the head on that sprawled in front of the fireplace this was very simple with rough iron firedogs the low mantel was scattered with cigarettes cigars in chinese bronze vases at either end and midway a medley of pipes longstemmed in clay and stubbed in briarwood  good gracious said cornelia do you smoke  not yet charmian answered gravely but im going to learn bernhardt does these are just some pipes that i got the men at the synthesis to give me pipes are so full of character and isnt this something like she invited cornelia to a study of the place by turning about and looking at it herself it seemed as if it never would come together at one time everything was in it just as it should be and then i found it was the ridiculous ceiling that was the trouble it came to me like a flash what to do and i got this canvas painted the color of the walls and sloped so as to cut off half the height of the room and now its a perfect symphony you wouldnt have thought it wasnt a real ceiling  no i shouldnt said cornelia as much surprised as charmian could have wished  you can imagine what a relief it is to steal away here from all that unreality of mammas down there and give yourself up to the truth of art i just draw a long breath when i get in here and leave the world behind me why when i get off here alone for a minute i unlace  cornelia went about looking at the sketches on the walls they were all that mixture of bad drawing and fantastic thinking which she was used to in the things charmian scribbled over her paper at the synthesis she glanced toward the easel but charmian said dont look at it theres nothing there i havent decided what i shall do yet i did think i should paint this tiger skin but i dont feel easy painting the skin of a tiger i havent killed myself if i could get mamma to take me out to india and let me shoot one but dont you think the whole place is perfect ive tried to make it just what a studio ought to be and yet keep it free from pose dont you know  yes said cornelia ive never seen a studio before  you poor thing you dont mean it cried charmian in deep pity cornelia said nothing and charmian went on with an air of candor well i havent seen a great many myselfonly two or threebut i know how they are and its easy enough to realize one what i want is to have the atmosphere of art about me all the time im like a fish out of water when im out of the atmosphere of art i intend to spend my whole time here when im not at the synthesis  i should think it would be a good place to work cornelia conceded  yes and i am going to work here said charmian the great trouble with me is that i have so many things in my mind i dont know which to begin on first thats why the synthesis is so good for me it concentrates me if it is on a block hand youre concentrated by nature and so you cant feel what a glorious pang it is to be fixed to one spot like a butterfly with a pin through you i dont see how i ever lived without the synthesis im going to have a wolfhoundas soon as i can get a goodtempered one that the man can lead out in the park for exerciseto curl up here in front of the fire and im going to have foils and masks over the chimney as soon as im a member of the synthesis im going to get them to let me be one of the monitors thatll concentrate me if anything will keeping the rest in order and i can get a lot of ideas from posing the model dont you think so but youve got all the ideas you want already arent you going to join the sketch class  i dont know but i am said cornelia i havent got quite turned round yet  well you must do it im going to have the class here some day as soon as i get the place in perfect order i must have a suit of japanese armor for that corner over there and then two or three of those queerlooking old long faded trunks you know with eastern stuffs gaping out of them to set along the wall i should be ashamed to have anybody see it now but you have an eye you can supply every thing with a glance im going to have a bed made up in the alcove over there and sleep here sometimes just that broad lounge you know with some rugs on itive got the cushions you see alreadyand mice running over you for the crumbs youve left when youve got hungry sitting up late are you afraid of mice  well i shouldnt care to have them run over me much said cornelia  well i shouldnt either said charmian but if you sleep in your studio sometime you have to they all do just put your hat in here and she glided before cornelia through the studio door into one that opened beside it the room was a dim and silent bedchamber appointed with the faultless luxury that characterized the rest of the apartment cornelia had never dreamt of anything like it but dont look at it charmian pleaded i hate it and im going to get into the studio to sleep as soon as ive thought out the kind of hangings well we shall have to hurry back now but she kept cornelia while she critically rearranged a ribbon on her and studied the effect of it over her shoulder in the glass yes she said with a deep sigh of satisfaction perfectly roman gladys wouldnt have done for you cornelia was a step in the right direction but it ought to have been fulvia      i should have clung to fulvias waist and thrust             the dagger through her side  she chanted tragically and she flung her arms about cornelia for illustration dream of fair women you know what part are you going to play today  what part cornelia demanded freeing herself with her darkest frown of perplexity youre not going to have theatricals i hope she thought it was going pretty far to receive company sunday afternoon and if there was to be anything more she was ready to take her stand now  charmian gave a shout of laughter i wish we were then i could be natural but i mean what are you going to be very gentle and mild and sweet and shrinking or very philosophical and thoughtful or very stately and cold and remote you know you have to be something dont you always plan out the character you want them to think you  no said cornelia driven to her bluntest by the discomfort she felt at such a question and the doubt it cast her into  charmian looked at her gloomily you strange creature she murmured but i love you she added aloud i simply idolize you  cornelia said halflaughing dont be ridiculous and pulled herself out of the embrace which her devotee had thrown about her but she could not help liking charmian for seeming to like her so much     xviii   they still had some time with mrs maybough when they went back to her before any one else came cornelia could see that her features were rather small and regular and that her hair was that sort of elderly blond in color which makes people look younger than they are after they have passed a certain age she was really well on in the thirties when she went out to leadville to take charge of charmian mayboughs education from the new england town where she had always lived and ended by marrying charmians father at that time andrew maybough had already made and lost several fortunes without great depravation from the immoralities of the process he remained as he had always been a large loosely goodnatured casual kind of creature of whom it was a question whether he would not be buried by public subscription in the end but he died so opportunely that he left the widow of his second marriage with the income from a million dollars which she was to share during her lifetime with the child of his first mrs maybough went abroad with her stepdaughter and most of the girls life had been spent in europe  there was a good deal of dresden in their sojourn something of florence necessarily a little of paris it was not altogether wanting in london where mrs maybough was presented at court but so far as definitively materialized society was concerned europe could not be said to have availed when she came back to her own country it was without more than the hope that some society people whom she had met abroad might remember her  youll see the greatest lot of frumps if they ever do come charmian said to cornelia after her stepmother had made her excuses to cornelia for her friends being rather late and i dont think theyre half as uncertain to come as mamma does anyway theyre certain to stay after they get here till you want to rise up and howl  my dear said mrs maybough  oh i dont suppose i ever shall howl im too thoroughly subdued and with cornelia here today i shall be able to hold in youre the first synthesis girl she frankly explained to cornelia that mammas ever let me have she thinks they spend all their time drawing the nude  mrs maybough looked at cornelia for the effect of this boldness upon her and the girl frowned to keep herself from laughing and then gave way mrs maybough smiled with a ladylike decorum which redeemed the excess from impropriety charmian seemed to know the bounds of her license and as if mrs mayboughs smile had marked them she went no farther and her mother began softly to question cornelia about herself the girl perceived that charmian had not told her anything quite right concerning her but had got everything dramatically and picturesquely awry she tried to keep cornelia from setting the facts straight because it took all the romance out of them and she said she should always believe them as she had reported them cornelia knew from novels that they were very humble facts but she was prepared to abide by them whatever a great society woman like mrs maybough should think of them mrs maybough seemed to think none the worse of them in the simple angularity which cornelia gave them  her friends began to come in at last and cornelia found herself for the first time in a company of those modern nomads whom prosperity and the various forms of indigestion have multiplied among us they were mostly people whom mrs maybough had met in europe drinking different waters and sampling divers climates and they had lately arrived home or were just going abroad or to florida or colorado or california the men were not so sick as the women but they were prosperous and that was as good or as bad a reason for their homelessness they gradually withdrew from the ladies and stirred their tea in groups of their own sex and talked investments sometimes they spoke of their diseases or their hotels and steamers and they took advice of each other about places to go to if they went in this direction or that but said that when it came to it they supposed they should go where their wives decided the ladies spoke of where they had met last and of some who had died since or had got their daughters married they professed a generous envy of mrs maybough for being so nicely settled and said that now they supposed she would always live in new york unless one of them archly suggested her daughter should be carried off somewhere if one had such a lovely daughter it was what one might expect to happen any day     xix   the part that charmian had chosen to represent must have been that of an egyptian slave she served her mothers guests with the tea that cornelia poured in attitudes of the eldest sculptures and mural paintings and received their thanks and compliments with the passive impersonality of one whose hope in life had been taken away some time in the reign of thotmes ii she did not at once relent from her selfsacrificial conception of herself even under the flatteries of the nice little fellow who had decorated the apartment for mrs maybough and had come to drink a cup of tea in the environment of his own taste perhaps this was because he had been one of the first to note the peculiar type of charmians style and beauty and she wished to keep him in mind of it he did duty as youth and gayety beside the young ladies at their teaurn and when he learned that cornelia was studying at the synthesis he professed a vivid interest and a great pleasure  i want huntley to paint miss maybough he said dont you think he would do it tremendously well miss saunders  miss saunders is going to paint me said charmian mystically  as soon as i get to the round said cornelia to charmian she was rather afraid to speak to the decorator i suppose you wouldnt want to be painted with block hands  the decorator laughed and charmian asked isnt she nice not to say anything about a block head very few synthesis girls could have helped it its one of the oldest synthesis jokes  the young man smiled sympathetically and said he was sure they would not keep miss saunders long at the block theres a friend of mine i should like to bring here some day  mamma would be glad to see him said charmian who is it  somebody began to sing a fullbodiced lady in a bonnet and with an overarching bust distended with chestnotes which swelled and sank tumultuously to her music her little tightlygloved hands seemed of an earlier period cornelia lost the name which mr plaisdell gave in the first outburst and caught nothing more of the talk which charmian dropped and then caught up again when the handclapping began  some of the people went and others came with brief devoirs to mrs maybough in the crepuscular corner where she sat the tea circulated more and more the babble rose and fell it was all very curious to cornelia who had never seen anything like it before and quite lost the sense of the day being sunday the stout ladys song had been serious if not precisely devotional in character but cornelia could not have profited by the fact for she did not know german mr plaisdell kept up his talk with charmian and she caught some words now and then that showed he was still speaking of his friend or had recurred to him im rather dangerous when i get started on him hes working out of his mannerisms into himself hes a great fellow im going to ask mrs maybough but he did not go at once he drew nearer cornelia and tried to include her in the talk but she was ashamed to find that she was difficult to get on common ground she would not keep on talking synthesis as if that were the only thing she knew but in fact she did not know much else in new york even about art  ah he broke off to charmian with a lift of his head thats too bad there he comes now with wetmore  cornelia looked toward mrs maybough with him one gentleman was presenting another to mrs maybough they got through with her as quickly as most people did and then they made their way toward cornelias table she had just time to govern her head and hand into stony rigidity when wetmore came up with ludlow whom he introduced to charmian she was going to extend the acquaintance to cornelia but had no chance before ludlow took cornelias petrified fingers and bowed over them the men suppressed their surprise if they had any at this meeting as of old friends but charmian felt no obligation to silence  where in the world have you met before why cornelia saunders why didnt you say you knew mr ludlow  im afraid i didnt give her time ludlow answered  yes but we were just speaking of youmr plaisdell was said charmian with the injury still in her voice  i didnt hear you speak of him cornelia said with a vague flutter of her hands toward the teacups  the action seemed to justify wetmore to himself in saying yes thank you i will have some tea miss saunders and then ill get some one to introduce me to you you havent seen me before and i cant stand these airs of ludlows he made them laugh and charmian introduced them and cornelia gave him his tea then charmian returned to her grievance and complained to cornelia i thought you didnt know anybody in new york  well it seems you were not far wrong wetmore interposed i dont call ludlow much of anybody  you dont often come down to anything as crude as that wetmore ludlow said  not if i can help it but i was driven to it this time the provocation was great  i had the pleasure of meeting miss saunders at home several years ago ludlow said in obedience to charmian we had some very delightful friends in common thereold friends of mineat pymantoning  what a pretty name said mr plaisdell what a pity that none of our great cities happen to have those musical indian names  chicago wetmore suggested  yes chicago is big and the name is indian but is it pretty  you cant have everything i dont suppose it is very decorative  pymantoning is as pretty as its name said ludlow it has the loveliness of a level to begin with were so besotted with mountains in the east that we dont know how lovely a level is  the sea wetmore suggested again  well yes thats occasionally level ludlow admitted but it hasnt got white houses with green blinds behind black ranks of maples in the moonlight  if good taste could have had its way the white house with green blinds would have been a thing of the past said the decorator and they were a genuine instinct an inspiration with our people the white paint is always beautifulas marble is people tried to replace it with mudcolorthe color of the ground the house was built on i congratulate miss saunders on the conservatism of py  pymantoning said cornelia eager to contribute something to the talk and then vexed to have it made much of by mr plaisdell  wetmore was looking away he floated lightly off with the buoyancy which is sometimes the property of people of his bulk and ludlow remained talking with charmian then with what was like the insensible transition of dreams to her he was talking with cornelia he said he had been meaning to come and see her all the week past but he had been out of town and very busy and he supposed she was occupied with looking about and getting settled he did not make out a very clear case she chose to think and she was not sure but he was treating her still as a child and she tried to think how she could make him realize that she was not he seemed quite surprised to hear that she had been at work in the synthesis ever since tuesday he complimented her energy and asked not how she was getting on there but how she liked it she answered stiffly and she knew that he was ignoring her blunt behavior as something she could not help and that vexed her the more she wished to resist his friendliness because she did not deserve it she kept seeing how handsome he was with his brilliant brown beard and his hazel eyes there were points of sunny light in his eyes when he smiled and then his teeth shone very white he did not smile very much she liked his being serious and not making speeches she wished she could do something to make him think her less of an auk but when she tried it was only worse he did not say anything to let her think he had changed his mind as to the wisdom of her coming to study art in new york and she liked that she should have hated him if he had  have you got that little manet yet mr plaisdell broke in upon them i was telling miss maybough about it  yes said ludlow its at my place why wont miss maybough and miss saunders come and see it youll come wont you miss maybough  if mamma will let me said charmian meekly  of course suppose we go ask her  the friends of mrs maybough had now reduced themselves to wetmore who sat beside her looking over at the little teatable group ludlow led the rest toward her  what an imprudence he called out when id just been booming you now you come up in person to spoil everything  ludlow presented his petition and mrs maybough received it with her provisional anxiety till he named the day for the visit she said she had an engagement for saturday afternoon and ludlow ventured then perhaps youd let the young ladies come with a friend of mine mrs westley shell be glad to call for them im sure  mrs general westley  yes  we met them in rome said mrs maybough i shall be very happy indeed for my daughter but you know miss saundersis not staying with us  miss saunders will be very happy for herself said charmian  the men took their leave and charmian seized the first moment to breathe in cornelias ear oh what luck i didnt suppose he would do it when i got mr plaisdell to hint about that manet and its all for you now come into my room and tell me everything about it you have got to stay for dinner  no no i cant cornelia gasped and im not going to his studio he asked me because he had to  i should think he did have to he talked to you as if there was no one else here how did you meet him before when did you she could not wait for cornelia to say but broke out with fresh astonishment why walter ludlow do you know who walter ludlow is hes one of the greatest painters in new york hes the greatest  who is mr wetmore cornelia asked evasively  dont name him in the same century hes grand too does those little meissonier things hes going to paint mamma shes one of his types he must have brought mr ludlow to see me but he didnt he saw nobody but you oh cornelia she caught cornelia in her arms  dont be a goose said cornelia struggling to get away  will you tell me all about it then  yes but it isnt anything  at the end of the story charmian sighed how romantic of course hes simply in a frenzy till he sees you again i dont believe he can live through the week  hell have to live through several said cornelia you can excuse me when you go hes very conceited and he talks to you as if he were a thousand years old i think mr plaisdell is a great deal nicer he doesnt treat you as if you werei dont know what     xx   the next day cornelia found herself the object of rumors that filled the synthesis she knew that they all came from charmian and that she could not hope to overtake them with denial the ridiculous romances multiplied themselves and those who did not understand that cornelia and ludlow had grown up together in the same place or were first cousins had been encouraged to believe that they were old lovers who had quarrelled and never spoken till they happened to meet at mrs mayboughs ludlow was noted for a certain reticence and austerity with women which might well have come from an unhappy loveaffair once when he took one of the instructors classes at the synthesis temporarily his forbidding urbanity was so glacial that the girls scarcely dared to breathe in his presence and left it halffrozen the severest of the masters with all his sarcasm was simply nothing to him  cornelia liked to hear that she should have despised ludlow if she had heard he was silly with girls and she did not wish to despise him though she knew that he despised her she could bear that the synthesis praises made her the more determined however to judge his recent work when she came to see it just as she would judge any ones work but first of all she meant not to see it  she seemed to have more trouble in bringing herself back to this point than in keeping charmian to it charmian came to believe her at last after declaring it the rudest thing she ever heard of and asking cornelia what she expected to say to mrs westley when she came for her cornelia could never quite believe it herself though she strengthened her purpose with repeated affirmation tacit and explicit and said it would be very easy to tell mrs westley she was not going if she ever did come for her she could not keep charmian from referring the case to every one on the steps and windowsills in the synthesis and at the sketchclass where charmian published it the first time cornelia came and wove a romance from it which involved herself as the close friend and witness of so strange a being  cornelia tried not to let all this interfere with her work but it did and at the sketchclass where she might have shown some rebound from the servile work of the preparatory and some originality she disappointed those whom charmian had taught to expect anything of her they took her rustic hauteur and her professed indifference to the distinction of ludlows invitation as her pose she went home from the class vexed to tears by her failure and puzzled to know what she really should say to that mrs westley when she came it wouldnt be so easy to tell her she was not going after all cornelia hated her and wished she would not come she had let the whole week go by now till thursday and perhaps she really would not come the girl knew so little of the rigidity of city dates that she thought very likely mrs westley had decided to put it off till another week  she let herself into her boardinghouse with her latchkey and stood confronted in the hall with ludlow who was giving some charge to the maid oh miss saunders he said and he put the card he held into his pocket im so glad not to miss you i was just leaving a written message but now i can tell you  he hesitated and cornelia did not know what to do but she said wont you come in with a vague movement toward the parlor  why yes thank you for a moment he said and he went back with her  i hope i havent kept you waiting she said with a severity which was for her own awkwardness  he did not take it for himself oh no ive just come from mrs westleys and shes charged me with a message for you he handed cornelia a note she will call for you and miss maybough at the synthesis rather earlier than you usually leave work i believe but i want you to have some daylight on my manet i hope halfpast two wont be too early  oh no said cornelia and while she wondered how she could make this opening of assent turn to refusal in the end ludlow went on  theres something of my own that id like to have you look at of course you wont get away with the manet alone i dont suppose you expected that ive an idea you can tell me where ive gone wrong if i have its all a great while ago have you ever been at the county fair at pymantoning since  he stopped and cornelia perceived that it was with doubt whether it might not still be a tender point with her  oh yes ive forgiven the fair long ago she laughed and he laughed with her  its best not to keep a grudge against a defeat i suppose if we do it wont help us ive had my quarrel with the pymantoning county fair too but it wasnt with the fine arts committee  no i didnt suppose you wanted to exhibit anything there said cornelia  why i dont know it might be a very good thing for me why not id like to exhibit this very picture there its an impressionnot just what id do nowof the trottingmatch i saw there that day  yes said cornelia letting her eyes fall mrs burton said you had painted it or you were going to  well i did said ludlow and nobody seemed to know what i was after i wonder if they would in pymantoning but what i wanted to ask was that you would try to look at it from the pymantoning point of view i hope you havent lost that yet  well i havent been away such a great while said cornelia smiling  no but still one sophisticates in new york very soon ill tell you what ive got a notion of well its all very much in the air yet but so far as ive thought it out its the relation of our art to our life it sounds rather boring i know and i suppose im a bit of a theorist i always was its easy enough to prove to the few that our life is full of poetry and picturesqueness but can i prove it to the many can the people themselves be made to see it and feel it thats the question can they be interested in a picturea real work of art that asserts itself in a good way can they be taught to care for my impression of the trottingmatch at the pymantoning county fair as much as they would for a chromo of the same thing and be made to feel that there was something more in it perhaps  he sat fronting her with his head down over the hat he held between his hands now he lifted his face and looked into hers she smiled at his earnestness and for a little instant felt herself older and wiser in her practicality  you might send it out to the next county fair and see  why thats just what i thought of he said and he laughed do you suppose they would let me exhibit it in the fine arts department  i dont believe they would give you the first premium said cornelia  well well then i should have to put up with the second i should like to get the first i confess ludlow went on seriously the premium would mean something to menot so much of course as a popular recognition what do you think the chance of that would be  well i havent seen the picture yet cornelia suggested  ah thats true i forgot that he said and they both laughed but what do you think of my theory it seems to me and now he leaned back in his chair and smiled upon her with that bright earnestness which women always found charming in him it seems to me that the worst effect of an artists life is to wrap him up in himself and separate him from his kind even if he goes in for what they call popular subjects he takes from the many and gives to the few he ought to give something back to the crowdhe ought to give everything back but the terrible question is whether theyll have it and he has no means of finding out  and youve come to one of the crowd to inquire cornelia asked up to that moment she had been flattered too by his serious appeal to her and generously pleased but the chance offered and she perversely seized it  he protested with a simple ah and she was ashamed  i dont know she hurried on to say i never thought about it in that way  well it isnt so simple any more after you once begin i dont suppose i shall be at peace quite till i try what i can do and seeing you sunday brought pymantoning all so freshly back that ive been wondering from time to time ever since whether you could possibly help me  i will try as the good little boy said cornelia assented  it makes me feel like a good little boy to have asked it ludlow did not profit by the chance which the conclusion of their agreement offered him to go he stayed and talked on and from time to time he recurred to what he had asked and said he was afraid she would think he was using her and tried to explain that he really was not but was approaching her most humbly for her opinion he could not make it out but they got better and better acquainted in the fun they had with his failures it went on till cornelia said now really if you keep it up i shall have to stand you in the corner with your face to the wall  oh do he entreated it would be such a relief  you know i was a teacher two winters she said and have actually stood boys in corners  that seemed to interest him afresh he made her tell him all about her schoolteaching he stayed till the bell rang for dinner and he suffered a decent moment to pass before he rose then  after all he said at parting i think youd better decide that its merely my manet youre coming to see  yes merely the manet cornelia assented if i choose the ludlows will all be stood in the corners with their faces to the wall  she found her own face very flushed when she climbed up to her room for a moment before going in to dinner and her heart seemed to be beating in her neck she looked at mrs westleys note it stated everything so explicitly that she did not see why mr ludlow need have come to explain she remembered now that she had forgotten to tell him she was not going     xxi   cornelia thought mrs westley would come for charmian and herself in her carriage but when they went down to her in the synthesis office they found that she had planned to walk with them to ludlows studio she said it was not a great way off and she had got into the habit of walking there when he was painting her she supposed they would rather walk after their work cornelia said oh yes and charmian asked at her perfervidest had mr ludlow painted her and mrs westley answered calmly yes she believed he did not think it very successful her husband liked it though charmian said oh how much she should like to see it and mrs westley said she must show it her some time cornelia thought mrs westley very pretty but she decided that she did not care to see ludlows picture of her  his studio stood a little back from the sidewalk it was approached by a broad sloping pavement and had two wide valves for the doorway he opened the door himself at their ring and they found themselves in a large gray room which went to the roof with its vaulted ceiling this was pierced with a vast window that descended halfway down the northward wall my studio started in life as a gentlemans stable then it fell into the hands of a sculptor and then it got as low as a painter he said to charmian mr plaisdell has told me how ingeniously you treated one of your rooms that you took for a studio  charmian answered with dark humility but a studio without a painter in it and there were some offers and refusals of compliment between them which ended in his saying that he would like to see her studio and her saying that mrs maybough would always be glad to see him then he talked with mrs westley who was very pleasant to cornelia while the banter with charmian went on and proposed to show his pictures he fancied that was what he had got them there for but he would make a decent pretence of the manet first  the manet was one of that painters most excessive it was almost insolent in its defiance of the old theory and method of art he had to go too far in those days or he wouldnt have arrived anywhere ludlow said dreamily as he stood looking with them at the picture he fell back to the point he had really meant to reach he put the picture away amidst the sighs and murmurs of mrs westley and charmian and the silence of cornelia which he did not try to break he began to show his own pictures taking them at random as it seemed from the ranks of canvasses faced against the wall you know we impressionists are nothing if not prolific he said and he kept turning the frame on his easel now for a long picture and now for a tall one the praises of the others followed him but cornelia could not speak some of the pictures she did not like some she thought were preposterous but there were some that she found brilliantly successful and a few that charmed her with their delicate and tender poetry he said something about most of them in apology or extenuation cornelia believed that she knew which he liked by his not saying anything of them  suddenly he set a large picture on the easel that quite filled the frame trotting match at the pymantoning county fair he announced and he turned away and began to make tea in a little battered copper kettle over a spiritlamp on a table strewn with colortubes in the corner  ah yes said mrs westley i remember this at the american artists three or four years ago wasnt it but youve done something to it havent you  improved with age said ludlow with his back toward them bent above his teakettle thats all  it seems like painting a weed though said charmian how can you care for such subjects  ludlow came up to her with the first cup of tea its no use to paint lilies you know  do you call that an answer  a poor one  he brought mrs westley some tea and then he came to cornelia with a cup in each hand one for her and one for himself and frankly put himself between her and the others well what do you think of it he asked as if there were no one else but they two  she felt a warm flush of pleasure in his boldness i dont know its like it thats the way ive always seen it and its beautiful but somehow  what  it looks as if it were somewhere else  youve hit it said ludlow it serves me right you see i was so anxious to prove that an american subject was just as susceptible of impressionistic treatment as a french one that i made this look as french as i could i must do it again and more modestly not be so patronizing i should like to come out there next fall again and see another trottingmatch i suppose theyll have one  they always have them it wouldnt be the fair without them said cornelia  well i must come and somehow do it on the spot thats the only way he pulled himself more directly in front of her and ignored the others who talked about his picture with faded interest to each other and then went about and looked at the objects in the studio i dont think i made myself quite clear the other day about what i wanted to do in this way he plunged into the affair again and if cornelia did not understand it better it was not for want of explanation perhaps she did not listen very closely all the time she thought how brilliantly handsome he was and how fine by every worldly criterion yes he said that is something i have been thinking of ever since my picture failed with the public it deserved to fail and youve made it so clear why that i cant refuse to know or to keep myself in the dark about it any longer i dont believe we can take much from the common stock of life in any way and find the thing at all real in our hands without intending to give something back do you  cornelia had never thought about it before she did not try to pretend that she had it seemed a little fantastic to her but it flattered her to have him talk to her about it and she liked his seriousness he did not keep up the kind of banter with her that he did with charmian he did not pay her compliments and she hated compliments from men  ludlow went off to speak to mrs westley of something he saw her looking at charmian edged nearer to cornelia i would give the world to be in your place i never saw anything like it keep on looking just as you are its magnificent such color and that queenly pose of the head it would kill those synthesis girls if they knew how he had been talking to you my if i could get anybody to be serious with me talk say something do you think its going to rain before we get home his eyes keep turning this way all the time you cant see them but they do i am glad i brought my umbrella have you got your waterproof im going to make you tell me every word he said when he came to see you yesterday itll be mean if you dont no i think i shall go up by the elevated and then take the surfacecar across its the most romantic thing i ever heard of no i dont believe it will be dark speak say something you mustnt let me do all the talking hell notice  cornelia began to laugh and charmian turned away and joined mrs westley and ludlow who were tilting outward some of the canvasses faced against the wall and talking them over cornelia followed her and they all four loitered over the paintings luxuriously giving a glance at each and saying a word or two about it yes ludlow said sometimes i used to do three or four of them a day i work more slowly now if you want to get any thinking in youve got to take time to it  it was growing dark ludlow proposed to see them all home one after another mrs westley said no indeed the broadway car at the end of the second block would leave her within three minutes of her door  and nothing could happen in three minutes said ludlow that stands to reason  and my one luxury is going home alone said charmian mamma doesnt allow it except to and from the synthesis then im an art student and perfectly safe if i were a young lady my life wouldnt be worth anything  yes ludlow assented the great thing is to have some sort of business to be where you are  i know a girl whos in some of the charities and she goes about at all hours of the night and nobody speaks to her said charmian  well then said ludlow i dont see that theres anything for me to do unless we all go together with mrs wesley to get her broadway car and then keep on to the elevated with you miss maybough miss saunders may be frightened enough then to let me walk to her door with her a man likes to be of some little use in the world  they had some mild fun about the weakness of cornelia in needing an escort she found it best to own that she did not quite know her way home and was afraid to ask if she got puzzled  ludlow put out his spiritlamp which had been burning blue all the time and embittering the tea in the kettle over it and then they carried out their plan cornelia went before with mrs westley who asked her to come to her on her day whenever she could leave her work for such a reckless dissipation at the foot of the elevated station stairs where charmian inflexibly required that they should part with her in the interest of the personal liberty which she prized above personal safety she embraced cornelia formally and then added an embrace of a more specific character and whispered to her ear youre glorious and fled up the station stairs  cornelia understood that she was glorious because mr ludlow was walking home with her and that charmian was giving the fact a significance out of all reason they talked rather soberly as two people do when a gayer third has left them and they had little silences they spoke of charmian and cornelia praised her beauty and her heart and said how everybody liked her at the synthesis  do they laugh at her a little too ludlow asked  why  shes rather romantic  oh i thought all girls were romantic  yes youre not  what makes you think so asked the girl im a great deal more romantic than is good for me dont you like romantic people i do  i dont believe i do said ludlow theyre rather apt to make trouble i dont mean miss maybough shell probably take it out in madly impossible art can she draw  cornelia did not like to say what she thought of charmians drawing exactly she said well i dont know  ludlow hastened to say i oughtnt to have asked that about your friend  were both in the preparatory you know cornelia explained i think charmian has a great deal of imagination  well thats a good thing if it doesnt go too far fortunately it cant in the preparatory  at her door cornelia did not know whether to ask him in as she would have done in pymantoning she ended by not even offering him her hand but he took it all the same as if he had expected her to offer it     xxii   cornelia found herself in her room without knowing how she got there or how long she had been there when the manvoiced irish girl came up and said something to her she did not understand at first then she made out that there was a gentleman asking for her in the parlor and with a glance at her face in the glass she ran down stairs she knew it was ludlow and that he had thought of something he wanted to say and had come back it must be something very important it might be an invitation to go with him somewhere she wondered if they would have a chaperone  in the vague light of the long parlor where a single burner was turned half up because it was not yet dark outside a figure rose from one of the sofas and came toward her with one hand extended in gay and even jocose greeting it was the figure of a young man with a high forehead and with nothing to obstruct the view of the shakespearian dome it mounted into except a modest growth of hair above either ear he was light upon his feet and he advanced with a rhythmical step cornelia tried to make believe that she did not know who it was she recoiled but her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth and she could not gainsay him when he demanded joyfully why nie why nelie dont you remember me dickerson j b with gates  clarkson art goods pymantoning days of yore generally oh pshaw now  yes i remember you said cornelia in a voice as cold as the fingertips which she inwardly raged to think she gave him but was helpless to refuse simply because he was holding out his hand to her  well its good for sore eyes to see you again said mr dickerson closing both of his hands on hers lets see its four years ago how the time flies i declare it dont hardly seem a day mustnt tell you how youve grown i suppose well we werent much more than children then anyhow set down im at home here old stampingground of mine when im in new york our house has its headquarters in new york now everythings got to come sooner or later well its a great place  cornelia obeyed him for the same reason that she gave him her hand which was no reason i heard your voice there at the door when you came in a little while ago and i was just going to rush out and speak to you i was sure it was you but thinks i it cant be its too good to be true and i waited till i could see mrs montgomery and then i sent up for you didnt send my name thought id like to surprise you well hows the folks mother still doing business at the old stand living and well i hope  my mother is well said cornelia she wondered how she should rid herself of this horrible little creature who grew as she looked at him in her fascination more abominable to her every moment she was without any definite purpose in asking how is mrs dickerson  the question appeared to give mr dickerson great satisfaction he laughed throwing back his head who tweet well i thought youd be after me there about the first thing i dont blame you dont blame you a bit be just so myself if i was in your place perfectly natural you should then you aint heard  i dont know what you mean said cornelia with mounting aversion she edged away from him for in the expression of his agreeable emotion he had pushed nearer to her on the sofa  why tweet is mrs byers now court let her take back her maiden name i didnt oppose the divorce nothing like peace in families you know tweet was all right and i haint got anything to say against her shes a good girl but we couldnt seem to hit it off and we agreed to quit after wed tried it a couple of years or so and ive been a free man ever since  it could not be honestly said that cornelia was profoundly revolted by the facts so lightly almost gaily presented her innocence of so much that they implied and her familiarity with divorce as a common incident of life alike protected her from the shock but what really struck terror to her heart was something that she realized with the look that the hideous little man now bent upon her the mutual understanding the rights once relinquished which might now be urged again the memory of things past were all suggested in this look she thought of ludlow with his lofty ideals and his great gifts and then she looked at this little grinning leering wretch and remembered how he had once put his arm round her and kissed her it seemed impossibletoo cruel and unjust to be she was scarcely more than a child then and that foolish affair had been more her mothers folly than her own it flashed upon her that unless she put away the shame of it the shame would weaken her and master her but how to assert herself she did not know till he gave her some pretext  well he sighed rolling his head against the back of the sofa and looking up at the chandelier sometimes a man has more freedom than hes got any use for i dont know as i want to be back under tweets thumb but i guess the scripture was about right where it says it aint good for a man to be alone when dyou leave pymantoning nelie  it makes no difference when i left cornelia got to her feet trembling and ill thank you not to call me by my first name mr dickerson i dont know why you should do it and i dont like it  oh all right all right said mr dickerson i dont blame you i think youre perfectly excusable to feel the way you do but some time when i get a chance i should like to tell you about it and put it to you in the right light  i dont want to hear about it cried cornelia fiercely and i wont have you thinking that its because i ever did care for you i didnt and i was only too glad when you got married and i dont hate you for i despise you too much and i always did so  she stamped her foot for a final emphasis but she was aware of her words all having fallen effectless like blows dealt some detestable thing in a dream  good just what i expected and deserved said mr dickerson with a magnanimity that was appalling i did behave like a perfect scallawag to you nie but i was young then and tweet got round me before i knew i can explain  i dont want you to explain i wont let you youre too disgusting for anything dont i tell you i never cared for you  why of course said mr dickerson tolerantly you say that now and i dont blame you but i guess you did care once nelie  oh my goodness what shall i do she found herself appealing in some sort to the little wretch against himself  why lets see how you look i haint had a fair peep at you yet as if with the notion of affording a relief to the strain of the situation he advanced and lifted his hand toward the lowburning chandelier  stop cried cornelia are you staying herein this house  well i inferred that i was from a remark that i made  then im going away instantly i will tell mrs montgomery and i will go tonight  why nie  hush dont youdont dare to speak to me oh youyou she could not find a word that would express all her loathing of him and her scorn of herself in the past for having given him the hold upon her that nothing appeared to have loosed she was putting on a bold front and she meant to keep her word but if she left that house she did not know where in the whole vast city she should go of course she could go to charmian maybough but besides bring afraid to venture out after dark she knew she would have to tell charmian all about it or else make a mystery of it there was nothing probably that charmian would have liked better but there was nothing that cornelia would have liked less she wanted to cry it always seems hard and very unjust to us in after life when some error or folly of our youth rises up to perplex us and cornelia was all the more rebellious because the fault was not wholly hers or not even largely but mostly her dear innocent unwise mothers  mr dickerson dropped his hand without turning up the gas perhaps he did not need a stronger light on cornelia after all oh well i dont want to drive you out of the house ill go ive got my grip out here in the hall but see here i told mrs montgomery we hailed from the same placechildren together and i dont know but what cousinsand how glad i was to find you here and now if i leave better let me stay here over night anyhow im off on the road tomorrow anyway i wont trouble you i wont indeed now you can depend upon it words as good as my bond if my bond aint worth a great deal but honor bright  cornelias heart which stood still at the threat she made began to pound in her breast she panted so that she could hardly speak  will you call me by my first name she demanded  no you shall be miss saunders to me till you say when  and will you ever speak to me or look at me as if we were ever anything but the most perfect strangers  itll be a good deal of a discount from what i told mrs montgomery but i guess i shall have to promise  and you will go in the morning  sure  how soon  well i dont like a very early breakfast but i guess i can get out of the house by about nine or halfpast eight maybe  then you may stay cornelia turned and marched out of the parlor with a state that failed her more and more the higher she mounted toward her room if it had been a flight further she would have had to crawl on her hands and knees  at first she thought she would not go down to dinner but after a while she found herself very hungry and she decided she must go for appearance sake at any rate at the bottom of her heart too she was curious to see whether that little wretch would keep his word  he was the life of the table his jokes made everybody laugh it could be seen that he was a prime favorite with the landlady after the coffee came he played a great many tricks with knives and forks and spoons and coins he dressed one of his hands all but two fingers with a napkin which he made like the skirts of a balletdancer and then made his fingers dance a hornpipe he tried a skirtdance with them later but it was comparatively a failure for want of practice he said  toward cornelia he behaved with the most scrupulous deference even with delicacy as if they had indeed met in former days but as if she were a person of such dignity and consequence that their acquaintance could only have been of the most formal character he did it so well and seemed to take such a pleasure in doing it that she blushed for him some of the things he said to the others were so droll that she had to laugh at them but he did not presume upon her tolerance     xxiii   the false courage that supported her in dickersons presence left cornelia when she went back to her room and she did not sleep that night or she thought she did not she came down early for a cup of coffee and the landlady told her that mr dickerson had just gone he wished mrs montgomery to give cornelia his respects and apologize for his going away without waiting to see her again he had really expected to stay over till monday but he found he could save several days by taking the chicago limited that morning mrs montgomery praised his energy she did not believe he would be on the road a great while longer he would be in the firm in less than another year she hinted at his past unhappiness in the married state and she said she did hope that he would get somebody who would appreciate him next time there did not seem to be any doubt in her mind that there would be a next time with him  cornelia wanted to ask whether she expected him back soon she could not but she resolved that whenever he came he should not find her in that house she thought where she should go and what excuse she should make for going what she should tell charmian or mr ludlow if she ever saw him again it seemed to her that she had better go home but cornelia hated to give up she could not bear to be driven away she went to church to escape herself and a turmoil of things alien to the place and the hour whirled through her mind during the service she came out spent with a thousandfold dramatization of her relations to mr dickerson and to mr ludlow she sat down on a bench in the little park before the church and tried to think what she ought to do while the children ran up and down the walks and the people from the neighboring east side avenues in their poor sunday best swarmed in the square for the mild sun and air of the late october the street cars dinned ceaselessly up and down and back and forth the trains of the elevated hurtled by on the west and on the east the troubled city roared all round with the anguish of the perpetual coming and going but it was as much sunday there as it would have been on the back street in pymantoning where her mothers little house stood the leaves that dripped down at her feet in the light warm breaths of wind passing over the square might have fallen from the maple before the gate at home the awful unity of life for the first time appeared to her was it true that you could not get away from what you had been was that the meaning of that little wretchs coming back to claim her after he had forfeited every shadow of right to her that even her mothers ignorance and folly had given him then it meant that he would come back again and again and never stop coming she made believe that if she looked up she should now see him actually coming down the path toward her she held her eyes fixed upon the ground at her feet and then it seemed to her every moment that he was just going to take the seat next her the seat was already taken a heavy german woman filled it so solidly that no phantasm could have squeezed in beside her but the presence of dickerson became so veritable that cornelia started up breathless and hurried home sick with the fear that she should find him waiting for her there  she was afraid to go out the next morning lest she should meet him on the street though she knew that by this time he was a thousand miles away  at the synthesis she was ashamed to let charmian think that her absent and tremulous mood had something to do with ludlow but she was so much more ashamed of the shabby truth that she would have been willing to accept the romance herself this was very dishonest it was very wicked and foolish cornelia saw herself becoming a guilty accomplice in an innocent illusion she found strength to silence charmians surmise if not to undeceive her she did her best and as the days began to remove her farther and farther from the moment of her actual encounter with dickerson her reason came more and more into control of her conscience she tried not to be the fool of a useless remorse for something she was at least not mainly to blame for she had to make the struggle alone there was no one she could advise with her heart shut when she thought of telling any one her trouble but in her perpetual reveries she argued the case before ludlow  it seemed to her as if he had come to render her a final judgment when his name was sent up to her room that saturday afternoon which ended the longest week of her life she went down and found him alone in the long parlor and it was in keeping with her fantastic prepossession that he should begin i wonder how i shall say what ive come for as if he would fain have softened her sentence  he kept her hand a moment longer than he need but he was not one of those disgusting people who hold your hand while they talk to you and whom cornelia hated she did not now resent it though she was sensible of having to take her hand from him  i dont know she answered with hysterical flippancy if i did i would tell you  he laughed as if he liked her flippancy and he said its very simple in fact thats what makes it so difficult  then you might practice on something hard first she suggested wildly how would the weather do  yes hasnt it been beautiful said ludlow with an involuntary lapse into earnestness i was in the park today for a little effect i wanted to get and it was heartbreaking to leave the woods i was away up in those forest depths that look wild in spite of the asphalt if you havent been there you must go some day while the autumn color lasts i saw a lot of your synthesis ladies painting there i didnt know but i might see you  this was all very matter of fact cornelia took herself in hand and shook herself out of her hallucination no i dont suppose it would be right for a person who was merely in the preparatory to go sketching in the park and charmian and i were very good today and kept working away at our block hands as long as the light lasted  ah yes miss maybough said ludlow then he paused absently a moment do you think she is going to do much in art  how should i know returned cornelia she thought it rather odd he should recur to that after she had let him see she did not want to talk about charmians art  because you know that you can do something yourself said ludlow that is the only kind of people who can really know the other sort of people can make clever guesses they cant know  and you believe that i can do something asked cornelia and a sudden revulsion of feeling sent the tears to her eyes it was so sweet to be praised believed in after what she had been through but you havent seen anything of mine except those thingsin the fair house  oh yes i have ive seen the drawings you submitted at the synthesis ive just seen them i may as well confess it i asked to see them  you did andandwell she fluttered back  it will take hard work  oh i know that  and it will take time  yes that is the worst of it i dont see how i can give the time  why he asked  oh becausei cant very well be away from home she colored as she said this for she could have been away from home well enough if she had the money i thought i would come and try it for one winter  he said lightly perhaps youll get so much interested that youll find you can take more time  i dont know she answered  well then you must get in all the work you can this winter block hands are well enough but theyre not the whole of art nor the whole preparation for it  oh ive joined the sketch class she said  yes thats well enough too he assented but i want you to come and paint with me he suddenly added  you me she gasped  yes he returned ill tell you what i mean ive been asked to paint a lady shell have to come to my place and i want you to come with her and see what you can do too i hope it doesnt seem too extraordinary he broke off at sight of the color in her face  oh no said cornelia she wondered what charmian would say if she knew this she wondered what the synthesis would say the synthesis held mr ludlow in only less honor than the regular synthesis instructors and mr ludlow had asked her to come and paint with him she took shelter in the belief that mrs burton must have put him up to it somehow but she ought to say something grateful or at least something she found herself stupidly and aimlessly asking is it mrs westley as if that had anything to do with the matter  no i dont see why i didnt tell you at once said ludlow its your friend miss maybough  cornelia relieved her nerves with a laugh i wonder how she ever kept from telling it  perhaps she didnt know ive only just got a letter from her mother asking me to paint her and i havent decided yet that i shall do it  she thought that he wanted her to ask him why and she asked what are you waiting for  for two reasons do you want the real reason first he asked smiling at her  she laughed no the unreal one  well i doubt whether mrs maybough wrote to me of her own inspiration entirely i suspect that wetmore and plaisdell have been working the affair and i dont like that  well  and im waiting for you to say whether i could do it thats the real reason  how should i know  i could make a picture of her he said but could i make a portrait there is something in every one which holds the true likeness if you dont get at that you dont make a portrait and you dont give people their moneys worth they havent proposed to buy merely a picture of you theyve proposed to buy a picture of a certain person you may give them more but you cant honestly give them less and if you dont think you can give them that then you had better not try i should like to try for miss mayboughs likeness and ill do that at least if youll try with me the question is whether you would like to  like to its the greatest opportunity why i hope i know what a chance it is and i dont know why you ask me to  i want to learn of you  if you talk that way i shall know you are making fun of me  then i will talk some other way i mean what i say i want you to show me how to look at miss maybough it sounds fantastic  it sounds ridiculous i shall not do anything of the kind  very well then i shall not paint her  you dont expect me to believe that said cornelia but she did believe it a little and she was daunted she said charmian would hate it  i dont believe she would said ludlow i dont think she would mind being painted by halfadozen people at once the more the better  that shows you dont understand her cornelia began  didnt i tell you i didnt understand her now you see you must i should have overdone that trait in her of course there is something better than that  i dont see how you could propose my painting her too cornelia relented provisionally  ludlow was daunted in his turn he had not thought of that it would be a little embarrassing certainly but he could not quite own this he laughed and said i have a notion she will propose it herself if you give her a chance  oh said cornelia if she does that all well and good  then i may say to her mother that i will make a try at the portrait  what have i to do with it cornelia demanded liking and not liking to have the decision seem left to her i shall have nothing to do with it if she doesnt do it of her own accord  you may be sure that she shall not have even a suggestion of any kind said ludlow solemnly  i shall know it if she does cornelia retorted not so solemnly and they both laughed  while he stayed and talked with her the affair had its reason and justification it seemed very simple and natural but when he went away it began to look difficult and absurd it was something else she would have to keep secret like that folly of the past it cast a malign light upon ludlow and showed him less wise and less true than she had thought him she must take back her consent she must send for him write to him and do it but she did not know how without seeming to blame him and she wished to blame only herself she let the evening go by and she stood before the glass putting up her hand to her back hair to extract the first dismantling hairpin for a sleepless night when a knock at her door was followed by the words hes waitun in the parlor the door was opened and the irish girl put a card in her hand     xxiv   the card was ludlows and the words do see me if you can for a moment were scribbled on it  cornelia ran down stairs he was standing hat in hand under the leafy gas chandelier in the parlor and he said at once ive come back to say it wont do you cant come to paint miss maybough with me it would be a trick i wonder i ever thought of such a thing  she broke out in a joyful laugh i knew you came for that  he continued to accuse himself to explain himself he ended you must have been despising me  i despised myself but i had made up my mind to tell charmian all about it theres no need to do that now its all over  but it isnt all over for me said ludlow gloomily i went straight home from here and wrote to mrs maybough that i would paint her daughter and now im in for it  he looked so acutely miserable that cornelia gave way to a laugh which had the effect of raising his fallen spirits and making him laugh too they sat down together and began to talk the affair all over again  some of the boarders who were at the theatre came in before he rose to go  cornelia followed him out into the hall then there is nothing for me to do about it  no nothing he said unless you want to take the commission off my hands and paint the picture alone he tried to look gloomy again but he smiled  every one slept late at mrs montgomerys on sunday morning all sects united in this observance of the day in fact you could not get breakfast till nine cornelia opened her door somewhat later even than this and started at the sight of charmian maybough standing there with her hand raised in act to knock they exchanged little shrieks of alarm  did i scare you well its worth it and youll say so when you know whats happened go right back in charmian pushed cornelia back and shut the door you neednt try to guess and i wont ask you to but its simply this mr ludlow is going to paint me what do you think of that though i shant expect you to say at once but its so mamma wrote to him several days ago but she kept the whole affair from me till she knew he would do it and he only sent his answer last night after dinner charmian sat down on the side of the bed with the effect of intending to take all the time that was needed for the full sensation and now while youre absorbing the great central fact i will ask if you have any idea why i have rushed down here this morning before you were up or mamma either to interview you  no i havent said cornelia  you dont happen to have an olive or a cracker any where about i dont need them for illustration but i havent had any breakfast yet  there are some gingersnaps in the bureau box right before you said cornelia from the windowsill  gingersnaps will do in an extreme case like this said charmian and she left her place long enough to search the bureau box what little ones she sighed but no matter i can eat them all she returned to her seat on cornelias bed with the paper bag which she had found in her hand well i have thought it perfectly out and all you have to do is to give your consent and if you knew how much valuable sleep i had lost thinking it out you would consent at once you know that the sittings will have to be at his studio and that i shall have to have somebody go with me cornelia was silent and charmian urged you know that much dont you  yes i suppose so cornelia allowed  well then you know i could have mamma go but it would bore her or i could have a maid go but that would bore me and so ive decided to have you go  me  yes and dont say you cant till you know what youre talking about itll take all your afternoons for a week or a fortnight and youll think you cant give the time but ill tell you how you can and more too how you can give the whole winter if it takes him that long to paint me but they say he paints very rapidly and gets his picture at a dash or else doesnt get it at all and its neither more nor less than this im going to get him to let you paint me at the same time what do you think of that  all our motives are mixed and it was not pure conscience which now wrought in cornelia it was pride too and a certain resentment that charmian should assume authority to make mr ludlow do this or that for an instant she questioned whether he had not broken faith with her and got charmian to propose this then she knew that it could not have been she said coldly i cant do it  what not when ive come down here before breakfast to ask you why cant you charmian wailed  because mr ludlow was here last night and asked me to do it  he did then i am the happiest girl in the world let me embrace you cornelia  dont bedisgusting said cornelia but she felt that charmian was generously glad of the honor done her and that she had wronged her by suspecting her of a wish to show power over mr ludlow i told him i couldnt and i cant because it would have seemed to be making use of you andandyou wouldnt like it and i wouldnt like it in your place andi wouldnt do it and i should have to tell you that he proposed it and that you would perfectly hate it  when it was the very first thing i thought of let me embrace you again cornelia saunders you adorable wooden image why his proposing it makes it perfectly divine and relieves me of all responsibility oh i would come down here every day before breakfast a whole week for a moment like this then its all settled and we will send him word that we will begin tomorrow afternoon lets discuss the character you will do me in i want you to paint me in characterboth of yousomething allegorical or mythical or perhaps youre hungry too and ive eaten every one of the snaps  no i cant do it cornelia still protested but the reasons why she could not seemed to have escaped her or to have turned into mere excuses in fact since charmian had proposed it and seemed to wish it they were really no longer reasons cornelia alleged them again with a sense of their fatuity she did not finally assent she did not finally refuse but she felt that she was very weak  i see what youre thinking about said charmian but you neednt be afraid i shall not show anything out i shall be a perfecttomb  what do you mean demanded cornelia with a vexation heightened by the sense of her own insincerity  oh you know what but from this time forth i dont it will be glorious not to let myself realize it i shall just sit and think up conundrums and not hear or see or dream anything yes i can do it and it will be splendid practice this is the way i shall look she took a pose in cornelias one chair and put on an air of impenetrable mystery which she relinquished a moment to explain of course this back is rather too stiff and straight i shall be more crouching she pushed a gingersnap between her lips and chewed enigmatically upon it see she said  now look here charmian maybough said cornelia sternly if you ever mention that again or allude to it the least in the world  dont i say i wont demanded charmian jumping up that will be the whole fun of it from the very first moment till im framed and hung in a good light im going to be mum through and through and if you dont speak of him i shant except as a fellowartist  what a simpleton said cornelia she laughed in spite of her vexation im not obliged to let what you think trouble me  of course not  your thinking it doesnt make it so  no  but if you let him see  the whole idea is not to let him see thats what i shall do it all for goodby  she put the paper bag down on the bureau for the greater convenience of embracing cornelia  why dont you stay and have breakfast with me cornelia asked youll be sick  breakfast and ruin everything i would rather never have any breakfast she took up the paper bag again and explored it with an eager hand while she stared absently at cornelia ah i thought there was one left what mites of things she put the last gingersnap into her mouth and with a flying kiss to cornelia as she passed she flashed out of the door and down the stairs     xxv   after all ludlow decided that he would paint charmian in her own studio with the accessories of her peculiar pose in life about her they were factitious but they were genuine expressions of her character he could not realize her so well away from there  the first afternoon was given to trying her in this light and that and studying her from different points she wished to stand before her easel in her synthesis workingdress with her palette on her thumb and a brush in her other hand he said finally why not and cornelia made a tentative sketch of her  at the end of the afternoon he waited while the girl was putting on her hat in charmians room where she smiled into the glass at charmians face over her shoulder thinking of the intense fidelity her friend had shown throughout to her promise of unconsciousness  didnt i do it magnificently charmian demanded it almost killed me but i meant to do it if it did kill me and now his offering to see you aboard the car shows that he is determined to do it too if it kills him i call it masterly  well dont go and spoil it now said cornelia and if youre going to ask me every day how youve done  oh im not only the first day and the last day  well  as ludlow walked with cornelia toward the point where she was to take her car down town he began you see she is so dramatic that if you tried to do her in any other waythat is simplyyou would be doing her artificially you have to take her as she is dont you think  i dont know as i think charmian is acting all the time if thats what you mean said cornelia or any of the time even  ludlow wished she had said she did not know that instead of as but he reflected that ninety americans out of a hundred lettered or unlettered would have said the same oh i dont at all mean that she is intentionally its because its her nature that i want to recognize it you think it is her nature dont you he asked deferentially  oh i suppose it is she answered it amused her to have him take such a serious tone about charmian  i shall have to depend a great deal on your judgment in that matter he went on you wont mind it i hope  not if you wont mind its not being worth anything  it will be worth everything  or if you wont care for my not giving it sometimes  i dont understand  well i shouldnt want to seem to talk her over  oh no you dont think i expected you to do that it was merely the right point of view i wanted to get  i dont know as i object to that said cornelia  the car which she wished to take came by and he stopped it and handed her aboard she thought he might decide to come with her but he bowed his goodnight and she saw him walking on down town as she passed him  at the end of a fortnight ludlow had failed to get his picture of charmian at the end of a month he began with a new pose and a fresh theory that quality of hers which he hoped to surprise with cornelias help and which was to give verity and value to his portrait when once he expressed it there escaped him still  she was capable of perfect poses but they were mere flashes of attitude then the antique mystery lurking in her face went out of it and she became fin de siècle and romantic and young ladyish and uninteresting to ludlow  she made tea every afternoon when they finished and sometimes the talk they began with before they began work prolonged itself till the time for the tea had come on the days when mr plaisdell dropped in for a cup the talk took such a range that the early dark fell before it ended and then cornelia had to stay for dinner and to be sent home in mrs mayboughs coupé  she had never supposed there was anything like it in all the world money and in a certain measure the things that money could buy were imaginable in pymantoning but joys so fine so simple as these were what she could not have forecast from any ground of experience or knowledge she tried to give her mother a notion of what they said and did but she told her frankly she never could understand mrs saunders in fact could not see why it was so exciting she read cornelias letters to mrs burton who said she could see and she told mrs saunders that she would like it as much as cornelia did if she were in her place that she was a kind of bohemian herself  she tried to explain what bohemian meant and what bohemia was but this is what no one can quite do charmian herself who aimed to be a perfect bohemian was uncertain of the ways and means of operating the bohemian life when she had apparently thrown off all the restrictions for the afternoon at least that prevented its realization she had a faultless setting for it there never was a girls studio that was more like a mans studio an actual studio mr ludlow himself praised it he said he felt at home in it and he liked it because it was not carried a bit too far charmians mother had left her free to do what she wished and there was not a convention of philistine housekeeping in the arrangement of the place everything was in the admired disorder of an artists environment but mrs maybough insisted upon neatness even here charmian had to submit to a compromise she might and did keep things strewn all about in her studio but every morning the housemaid was sent in to sweep it and dust it she was a housemaid of great intelligence and an imperfect sense of humor and she obeyed with unsmiling scrupulosity the instructions she had to leave everything in miss charmians studio exactly as she found it but to leave it clean in consequence this home of art had an effect of indescribable coldness and bareness and there were at first some tempestuous scenes which cornelia witnessed between charmian and her mother when the girl vainly protested  but dont you see mamma that if you have it regularly dusted it never can have any sentiment any atmosphere  i dont see how you can call dust atmosphere my dear said her stepmother if i left your studio looking as you want it and there should be a fire what would people think  well if there should happen to be anybody from wilbraham mass charmian retorted they might criticise but i dont think the new york fire department would notice whether the place had been dusted or not but go on mamma some day i shall have a studio out of the housecornelia and i are going to have oneand then i guess you wont have it dusted  im sure miss saunders wouldnt let it get dusty said mrs maybough and then in selfdefence charmian gave cornelia the worst character for housekeeping that she could invent from her knowledge of cornelias room  she begged her pardon afterwards but she said she had to do it and she took what comfort she could in slamming everything round as she called it in her studio when she went with cornelia to have her coffee there the maid restored it to its conscious picturesqueness the next day  charmian was troubled to decide what was truly bohemian to eat when they became hungry over their work she provided candy and chocolate in all their forms and phases but all girls ate candy and chocolate and they were so missish and so indistinctive and they both went so badly with tea which she must have because of the weird effect of the spiritlamp under the kettle that she disused them after the first week there remained always crackers which went with anything but the question was what to have with them their natural association with cheese was rejected because charmian said she should be ashamed to offer mr ludlow those insipid little neufchatel things which were made in new jersey anyway and the gruyère smelt so and so did camembert and pineapple cheese was philistine there was nothing for it but olives and though olives had no savor of originality the little crescent ones were picturesque and if you picked them out of the bottle with the end of a brushhandle sharpened to a point and the other person received them with their thumb and finger the whole act was indisputably bohemian  there was one day when they all got on particularly well and charmian boldly ordered some champagne for a burst the man brought back apollinaris water and she was afraid to ask why for fear he should say mrs maybough sent it ludlow said he never took champagne and was awfully glad of the apollinaris and so the change was a great success for neither charmian nor cornelia counted in any case they both hated every kind of wine  another time cornelia when she came found charmian lighting one of the cigars kept for show on her mantel she laughed wildly at cornelias dismay and the smoke which had been going up her nose went down her throat in a volume and cornelia had to run and catch her she was reaching out in every direction for help  cornelia led her to the couch which was still waiting its rugs to become a bed and she lay down there very pale and still and was silent a long time till cornelia said now if i could find a moose somewhere to run over you and they both burst into a shriek of laughter  but im going to learn charmian declared where did that cigar go she sprang up to look for it but they never could find it and they decided it must have gone into the fire and been burnt up that particular cigar seemed essential to the experiment or at least charmian did not try another  they were both very grave after ludlow came when he went away he said with an absent look at charmian you have a magnificent pallor today miss maybough and i must compliment you on keeping much quieter than usual  oh thank you said charmian gravely and as soon as the door closed upon him she flung herself into cornelias arms and they stifled their laughter in each others necks it seemed to them that nothing so wildly funny had ever happened before they remained a long while quaking over the question whether there was smell of smoke enough in the room to have made him suspect anything and whether his congratulations were not ironical charmian said that her mistake was in not beginning with a cigarette instead of a cigar she said she was ready to begin with a cigarette then and she dared cornelia to try one too cornelia refused the challenge and then she said well she would do it herself some day  there was a moment when it seemed to her that the bohemian ideal could be realized to a wild excess in popcorn she bought a popper and three ears of corn and brought them home tied up in paper and fastened to some canvases she got for cornelia she insisted that it was part of the bargain that she should supply cornelias canvases but the process of popping made them all very red in the face they had to take it by turns for she would not let ludlow hold the popper the whole time they had a snowy heap of corn at last which she put on the hearth before them in the hollow of a japanese shield detached from a suit of armor for that use they sat on the hearth to eat it and they told ghoststories and talked of the most psychological things they could think of in all this charmian put cornelia forward as much as she dared and kept herself in a sort of impassioned abeyance if cornelia had been the most jealous and exacting of principals she could not have received from her second a more single and devoted allegiance charmians joy in her fortunately mounted in proportion to the devotion she paid her rather than cornelias gratitude for it she did not like to talk of herself and these séances were nothing if not strictly personal but charmian talked for her and represented her in phases of interest which cornelia repudiated with a laugh or denied outright without scruple when the invention was too bold charmian contrived that she should acquire the greater merit from her refusals of it and went on to fresh selfsacrifices in her behalf  sometimes she started the things they talked of not because she ever seemed to have been thinking of them or of anything definitely but because she was always apparently letting her mind wander about in space and chanced upon them there mostly however the suggestions came from ludlow he talked of art its methods its principles its duties to the age the people the civilization the large moral uses which kindled charmians fancy and made cornelia laugh when charmian proposed a scheme for the relief and refinement of the poor on the east side by frescoing the outsides of the tenement houses in mott street and mulberry bend with subjects recalling the home life of the dwellers there ricefields and teaplantations for the chinese and views of etna and vesuvius and their native shores for the sicilians and neapolitans with perhaps religious histories  ludlow had to explain that he had not meant the employment of any such direct and obvious means but the gradual growth of a conscience in art cornelia thought him vague but it seemed clear to charmian she said oh yes that and she made tea and had him set fire to some pieces of southern lightwood on her hearth for the sake of the murky fumes and the wreaths of dusky crimson flame which she said it was so weird to sit by  in all matters of artistic theory and practice she set cornelia the example of grovelling at the masters feet as if there could be no question of anything else but in other things cornelia sometimes asserted herself against this slavish submission with a kind of violence little short of impertinence after these moral paroxysms in which she disputed the most obviously right and reasonable things she was always humiliated and cast down before his sincerity in trying to find a meaning in her difference from him as if he could not imagine the nervous impulse that carried her beyond the bounds of truth and must accuse himself of error when this happened she would not let charmian take her to task for her behavior she would not own that she was wrong she put the blame on him and found him arrogant and patronizing she had always known he was that kind of person and she did not mean to be treated like a child in everything even if he was a genius  by this time they were far away from that point in charmians romance where the faithful friend of the heroine remains forever constant to her vow not to speak to the heroine of the heros passion for her and in fact rather finds it a duty to break her vow and enjoys being snubbed for it as the transaction of the whole affair took place in charmians fancy cornelia had been obliged to indulge her in it with the understanding that she should not let it interfere with their work or try to involve her visibly or palpably in it  with all their idling they had days when they worked intensely and ludlow was as severe with cornelias work as he was with his own he made her rub out and paint out and he drew ruthless modifications of her work all over it like the crudest of the synthesis masters he made her paint out every day the work of the day before as they did in the synthesis though sometimes he paused over it in a sort of puzzle once he said holding her sketch into the light he wanted at the close of the afternoon if i didnt know you had done that today i should say it was the one you had done yesterday  toward the end of the month he recurred to this notion again suppose he said we keep this and you do another tomorrow  the next day he said in the same perplexity well keep this and do another  after a week he took all her canvases and set them one back of another but so that he could see each in nearly the same light he stood looking at them silently with the two girls behind him one at either shoulder  its as lovely as standing between two mirrors charmian suggested dreamily  pretty much of a sameness cornelia remarked  mm ludlow made in his throat he glanced over the shoulder next her and asked as if charmian were not there what makes you do her always alike  because she is always alike  then ive seen her wrong said ludlow and he stared at charmian as if she were a layfigure she bore his scrutiny as impassively as a layfigure could  he turned again to cornelias sketches and said gloomily i should like to have wetmore see these  oh said cornelia  charmian came to life with another oh and then she demanded when we must have something besides tea for mr wetmore  i think ill ask him to step round in the morning said ludlow with authority  charmian said oh again but submitted with the eagerness of a disciple all phases of the artlife were equally precious and even a snub from such a master must be willingly accepted  he went away and would not have any tea he had an air of troublealmost of offence isnt he grand gloomy and peculiar charmian said i wonder whats the matter  she turned to ludlows picture which he had left standing on the chair where he painted at it in disdain of an easel and silently compared it with cornelias sketches then she looked at cornelia and gave a dramatic start  what is the matter asked cornelia she came up and began to look at the picture too  charmian demanded dont you see  no i dont see anything said cornelia but as she looked something became apparent which she could not deny she blushed violently and turned upon charmian you ought to be ashamed she began and she tried to take hold of her she did not know why  charmian escaped and fled to the other end of the room with a wild laugh and stood there cornelia dropped into the chair before the picture with her head fallen on her elbow she seemed to be laughing too and charmian went on  what is there to be ashamed of i think its glorious its one of the most romantic things i ever heard of he simply couldnt help it and it proves everything ive said of course that was the reason he couldnt see me all along why if such a thing had happened to me i should go round shouting it from the housetops i dont suppose he knew what he was doing or else he didnt care perfectly desperate what fun  cornelia kept laughing but charmian stopped and waited a moment and listened why cornelia she said remorsefully entreatingly but she remained the length of the room away then she approached tentatively and when cornelia suddenly ceased to laugh she put her hand on her head and tenderly lifted her face it was dabbled with tears cornelia she said again  cornelia sprang to her feet with a fierceness that sent her flying some yards away charmian maybough will you ever speak of this to any living soul  no no indeed i wont charmian began  will you ever think of it  no  because i dont choose to have you think i am such a fool as toto  no indeed i dont  because there isnt anything of it and it wouldnt mean anything if there were  no said charmian the only thing is to tear him out of your heart and i will help you she made as if she were ready to begin then and cornelia broke into a genuine laugh  dont be ridiculous i guess there isnt much to tear  then what are you going to do  nothing what can i there isnt anything to do anything about if its there he knows it and hes left it there because he didnt care what we thought he was just trying something hes always treated me like a perfectchild thats all there is of it and you know it  yes charmian meekly assented then she plucked up a spirit in cornelias behalf the only thing is to keep going on the same as ever and show him we havent seen anything and dont care if we have  no said cornelia sadly i shall not come any more or if i do it will just be to im not certain yet what i shall do she provisionally dried her eyes and repaired her looks at the little mirror which hung at one side of the mantel and then came back to charmian who stood looking at cornelias sketches still in the order ludlow had left them in she stole her arm round cornelias waist well anyway he cant say youve returned the compliment theyre perfectly magnificent every one and theyre all me now we can both live for art     xxvi   wetmore came the next morning with ludlow and looked at cornelias studies well theres no doubt about her talent i wonder why it was wasted on one of her sex these gifted girls poor things there dont seem to be any real call for them he turned from the sketches a moment to the arrangement of charmians studio i suppose this is the other girls expression he looked more closely at the keeping of the room and said with a smile of mixed compassion and amusement why this girl seems to be trying to do the bohemian act  that is her pose ludlow admitted  and does she get a great deal of satisfaction out of it  the usual amount i fancy ludlow began to tell of some of charmians attempts to realize her ideal  wetmore listened with a pitying smile poor thing it isnt much like the genuine thing as we used to see it in paris is it we americans are too innocent in our traditions and experiences our bohemia is a nonalcoholic unfermented condition when it is diluted down to the apprehension of an american girl its no better or no worse than a kind of arcadia miss maybough ought to go round with a shepherdesss crook and a straw hat with daisies in it thats what she wants to do if she knew it is that a practicable pipe i suppose those cigarettes are chocolates in disguise well he reverted to cornelias canvases why of course theyre good shes doomed she will have to exhibit you couldnt do less ludlow than have her carry this one a little fartherhe picked out one of the canvases and set it apartand offer it to the academy  do you really think so asked ludlow looking at it gravely  i dont know with the friends youve got on the committee but you dont suppose i came up here to see these things alone did you wheres your picture  i havent any said ludlow  ob rubbish wheres your theory of a picture then i dont care what you call it my only anxiety when you got a plain simple everyday conundrum like miss maybough to paint was that you would try to paint the answer instead of the conundrum and i dare say thats the trouble youve been trying to give something more of her character than you found in her face is that it well you deserved to fail then youve been trying to interpret her to come the prophet i dont condemn the poetry in your nature ludlow wetmore went on and if i could manage it for you i think i could keep it from doing mischief that is why i am so plainspoken with you  do you call it plainspeaking ludlow said putting his picture where it could be seen best i was going to accuse you of flattery  well you had better ponder the weighty truths i have let fall i dont go round dropping them on everybodys toes  probably there are not enough of them ludlow suggested  oh yes there are wetmore waited till ludlow should say he was ready to have him look at his picture the fact is ive been giving a good deal of attention to your case lately youre not simple enough and youve had the wrong training you would naturally like to paint the literature of a thing and let it go at that but youve studied in france where they know better and you cant bring yourself to do it your nature and your school are at odds you ought to have studied in england they dont know how to paint there but theyve brought fiction in color to the highest point and theyre not ashamed of it  perhaps youve boon theorizing too said ludlow stepping aside from his picture  not on canvas wetmore returned he put himself in the place ludlow had just left hello he began but after a glance at ludlow he went on with the effect of having checked himself to speak carefully and guardedly of the work in detail his specific criticism was as gentle and diffident as his general censure of ludlow was blunt and outright it was given mostly in questions and in recognitions of intention  well the sum of it is said ludlow at last you see its a failure  wetmore shrugged as if this were something ludlow ought not to have asked he went back to cornelias sketches and looked at them one after another that girl knows what shes about or what she wants to do and she goes for it every time she has got talent whether shes got enough to stand the training thats the great difference after all lots of people have talent thats the gift the question is whether one has it in paying quantity or enough of it to amount to anything after the digging and refining i should say that girl had but very likely i might be mistaken  ludlow joined in the examination of the sketches he put his hand on the weak points as well as on the strong ones he enjoyed with wetmore the places where her artlessness had frankly offered itself instead of her art there was something ingenuous and honest in it all that made it all charming  yes i think she can do it said wetmore if she wants to bad enough or if she doesnt want to get married worse  ludlow winced isnt there something a little vulgar in that notion of ours that a woman always wishes first and most of all to get married  my dear boy said wetmore with an affectionate hand on ludlows shoulder i never denied being vulgar  oh i dare say but i was thinking of myself  ludlow sent word to charmian at the synthesis that he should not ask her to sit to him that afternoon and in the evening he went to see wetmore it was eleven oclock and he would have been welcome at wetmores any time between that hour of the night and two of the morning he found a number of people mrs westley was there with mrs rangeley they had been at a concert together mrs wetmore had just made a welsh rabbit and they were all talking of the real meaning of the word beautiful  i think mrs rangeley was saying that the beautiful is whatever pleases or fascinates there are lots of goodlooking people who are not beautiful at all because they have no atmosphere and you see other people who are irregular and quite plain even and yet you come away feeling that they are perfectly beautiful mrs rangeleys own beauty was a little irregular she looked anxiously round and caught wetmore in a smile what are you laughing at she demanded in rueful deprecation  oh nothing nothing he said i was thinking how convincing you were  nothing of the kind said one of the men who had been listening patiently till she fully committed herself there couldnt be a more fallacious notion of the meaning of beauty the thing exists in itself independently of our pleasure or displeasure they have almost nothing to do with it if you mix it with them you are lost as far as a true conception of it goes beauty is something as absolute as truth and whatever varies from it as it was ascertained well say by the greek sculptors and the italian painters is unbeautiful just as anything that varies from the truth is untrue charm fascination atmosphere are purely subjective one feels them and another doesnt but beauty is objective and nobody can deny it who sees it whether he likes it or not you cant get away from it any more than you can get away from the truth there it is  where asked wetmore he looked at the ladies as if he thought one of them had been indicated  how delightful to have ones ideas jumped on just as if they were a mans sighed mrs rangeley her opponent laughed a generous delight as if he liked nothing better than having his reasoning brought to naught he entered joyously into the tumult which the utterance of the different opinions prejudices and prepossessions of the company became  ludlow escaped from it and made his way to mrs westley in that remoter and quieter corner which she seemed to find everywhere when you saw her out of her own house there she was necessarily prominent  i think mr agnew is right and mrs rangeley is altogether wrong she said there couldnt be a better illustration of it than in those two young artstudent friends of yours miss saunders is beautiful in just that absolute way mr agnew speaks of you simply cant refuse to see it and miss maybough is fascinating if you feel her so i should think youd find her very difficult to paint and with miss saunders there all the time i should be afraid of getting her decided qualities into my picture  ludlow said ah thats very interesting  he meant to outstay the rest for he wished to speak with wetmore alone and it seemed as though those people would never go they went at last mrs wetmore herself went off to the domestic quarter of the apartment and left the two men together  baccy asked wetmore with a hospitable gesture toward the pipes on his mantel  no thank you said ludlow  well  wetmore what was it you saw in my picture today when you began with that hello of yours and then broke off to say something else  did i do that well if you really wish to know  i do  ill tell you i was going to ask you which of those two girls you had painted it from the topography was the topography of miss maybough but the landscape was the landscape of miss saunders he waited as if for ludlow to speak then he went on i supposed you had been working from some new theory of yours and i thought i had said about as much on your theories as you would stand for the time  was that all ludlow asked  all it seems to me thats a good deal to be compressed into one small hello  wetmore lighted a pipe and began to smoke in great comfort we were talking just before you dropped in of what you may call the psychical chemistry of our kind of shop the way a fellow transmutes himself into everything he does i can trace the man himself in every figure he draws or models you cant get away from yourself simply because you are always thinking yourself or through yourself you cant see or know any one else in any other way  its a very curious thing said ludlow uneasily ive noticed that too i suppose every one has butgoodnight  wetmore followed him out of the studio to the head of the public stairs with a lamp and ludlow stopped there again should you think there was anything any one but you would notice  you mean the two girls themselves well i should say on general principles that what two such girls didnt see in your work  of course thenwhat would you do would you speak to her about it  which  you know miss saunders  ah it seems rather difficult doesnt it  confoundedly  why if you mean to say it was unconscious perhaps i was mistaken the thing may have been altogether in my own mind id like to take another look at it  you cant ive painted it out ludlow ran down one flight of the stairs and then came stumbling quickly back i say wetmore do you tell your wife everything  my dear boy i dont tell her anything she finds it out but then she never tells anybody     xxvii   ludlow sent word again to charmian that he should not be able to keep his appointment for the afternoon and as soon as he could hope to find cornelia at home from the synthesis he went to see her  he began abruptly i came to tell you miss saunders when i first thought of painting miss maybough and now ive come to tell you that ive given it up  given it up she repeated  youve seen the failures ive made i took my last one home yesterday and painted it out he looked at cornelia but if he expected her to give him any sort of leading he was disappointed he had to conclude unaided im not going to try any more  she did not answer and he went on after a moment of course its humiliating to make a failure but its better to own it and leave it behind you if you dont own it you have to carry it with you and it remains a burden  she kept her eyes away from him but she said oh yes certainly  the worst of it was the disappointment i had to inflict upon mrs maybough he went on uneasily she was really hurt and i dont believe i convinced her after all that i simply and honestly couldnt get the picture i went to tell her this afternoon and she seemed to feel some sort of disparagementi cant express itin my giving it up  he stopped and cornelia asked as if forced to say something does charmian know  i suppose she does by this time said ludlow he roused himself from a moment of revery and added but i didnt intend to oppress you with this i want to tell you somethingelse  he drew a deep breath she started forward where she sat and looked past him at the door as if to see whether the way of escape was clear he went on i took wetmore there with me yesterday and i showed him your sketches and he thinks you might get one of them into the academy exhibition in the spring after youve carried it a little farther  she sank back in her chair does he she asked listlessly and she thought as of another person how her heart would once have thrilled at the hope of this  yes but i dont feel sure that it would be well said ludlow i wanted to say though that i shall be glad to come and be of any little use i can if youre going on with it  oh thank you said cornelia she thought she was going to say something more but she stopped stiffly at that and they both stood in an embarrassment which neither could hide from the other he repeated his offer in other terms and she was able finally to thank him a little more fitly and to say that she should not forget his kind offer she should not forget all he had done for her all the trouble he had taken and they parted with a vague alienation  as we grow older we are impatient of misunderstandings of disagreements we make haste to have them explained but while we are young life seems so spacious and so full of chances that we fetch a large compass round about such things and wait for favoring fortuities and hope for occasions precisely fit we linger in dangerous delays and take risks that may be ruinous  cornelia went hack to her work at the synthesis as before but she worked listlessly and aimlessly the zest was gone and the meaning she knew that for the past month she had drudged through the morning at the synthesis that she might free herself to the glad endeavor of the afternoon at charmians studio with a good conscience ludlows criticism even when it was harshest was incentive and inspiration and her life was blank and dull on the old terms  the arts have a logic of their own which seems no logic at all to the interests ludlows world found it altogether fit and intelligible that he should give up trying to paint charmian if he had failed to get his picture of her and thought he could not get it mrs mayboughs world regarded it as a breach of contract for him not to do what he had undertaken she had more trouble to reconcile her friends to his behavior than she had in justifying it to herself through charmian she had at least a secondhand appreciation of motives and principles that were instantly satisfactory to the girl and to all her comrades at the synthesis they accepted it as another proof of ludlows greatness that he should frankly own he had missed his picture of her and they exalted charmian as a partner in his merit for being so impossible the arguments of wetmore went for something with mrs maybough though they were mainly admissions to the effect that ludlow was more of a crank than he had supposed and would have to be humored in a case of the kind but it was chiefly the courage and friendship of mrs westley that availed she enforced what she had to say in his behalf with the invitation to her january thursdays which she had brought she had brought it in person because she wished to beg mrs maybough to let her daughter come with her friend miss saunders and pour tea at the first of the thursdays  i got you off she said to ludlow when they met but it was not easy she still thinks you ought to have let her see your last attempt and left her to decide whether it was good or not  mrs westley showed her amusement at this but ludlow answered gravely that there was a certain reason in the position if shes disappointed in not having any portrait though he added she had better take miss saunderss  do you really mean that mrs westley asked with more or less of that incredulity concerning the performance of a woman which all the sex feel in spite of their boasting about one another has she so much talent  why not somebody has to have the talent  this was like wetmores tone and it made mrs westley think of him and do you believe she could get her picture into the exhibition  has wetmore been talking to you about it  yes  i dont know said ludlow that was wetmores notion  and does she know about it  i mentioned it to her  it would be a great thing for her if she could get her picture inand sell it  yes ludlow dryly admitted he wished he had never told mrs westley how cornelia had earned the money for her studies at the synthesis he resented the implication of her need and mrs westley vaguely felt that she had somehow gone wrong she made haste to retrieve her error by suggesting perhaps miss maybough would object though  thats hardly thinkable said ludlow lightly he would have gone away without making mrs westley due return for the trouble she had taken for him with mrs maybough and she was so far vexed that she would have let him go without telling him that she was going to have his protégée pour tea for her she had fancied that this would have pleased him  but by one of those sudden flashes that seem to come from somewhere without he saw himself in the odious light in which she must see him and he turned in time mrs westley i think you have taken a great deal more pains for me than im worth its difficult to care what such a poor little philistine as mrs mayboughthe mere figment of somebody elses misgotten moneythinks of me but she is to be regarded and i know that you have looked after her in my interest and its very kind of you and very goodits like you if youve done it though with the notion of my keeping on in portraits or getting more portraits to paint im sorry for i shall not try to do any im not fit for that kind of work i dont say it because i despise the work but because i despise myself i should always let some wretched preoccupation of my ownsome fancy some whimcome between me and what i see my sitter to be and paint that  that is you have some imagination she began in defence of him against himself  no no theres scope for the greatest imagination the most intense feeling in portraits but i cant do that kind of thing and i must stick to my little sophistical fantasies or my bald reports of nature but miss saunders if she were not a womanexcuse me  oh i understand  she could do it and she will if she keeps on she could have a career she could be a painter of womens portraits a mans idea of a woman its interesting of course but its never quite just its never quite true it cant be every woman knows that but you go on accepting mens notions of women in literature and in art as if they were essentially or anything but superficially like women i couldnt get a picture of miss maybough because i was always making more or less than there really was of her you were speaking the other night at wetmores of the uncertain quality of her beauty and the danger of getting something else in said ludlow suddenly grappling with the fact and i was always doing that or else leaving everything out her beauty has no fixed impression it ranges from something exquisite to something grotesque just as she ranges in character from the noblest generosity to the most inconceivable absurdity you never can know how she will look or how she will behave at least i couldnt i was always guessing at her but miss saunders seemed to understand her all her studies of her are alike the last might be taken for the first except that the handling is better its invariably the very person without being in the least photographic as people call it because it is one womans unclouded perception of another the only question is whether miss saunders can keep that saving simplicity it may be trained out of her or she may be taught to put other things before it wetmore felt the danger of that when we looked at her sketches im not saying theyre not full of faults the technique is bad enough sometimes its almost childish but the root of the matter is there she knows what she sees and she tells  really said mrs westley it is hard for a woman to believe much in women we dont expect anything of each other yet should you like her to paint me  i  i mean do you think she could do it  not yet she doesnt know enough of life even if she knew enough of art she merely painted another girl  that is true said mrs westley with a sigh she added impersonally but if people only kept to what they knew and didnt do what they divined there would be very little art or literature left it seems to me  well perhaps the less the better said ludlow with a smile for the absurdity he was reduced to what was left would certainty be the best  he felt as if his praise of cornelia were somehow retrieval as if it would avail where he seemed otherwise so helpless and would bring them together on the old terms again there was indeed nothing explicit in their alienation and when he saw cornelia at mrs westleys first thursday he made his way to her at once and asked her if she would give him some tea with the effect of having had a cup from her the day before he did not know whether to be pleased or not that she treated their meeting as something uneventful too and made a little joke about remembering that he liked his tea without sugar  i wasnt aware that you knew that he said  oh yes that is the way charmian always made it for you and sometimes i made it  to be sure it seems a great while ago how are you getting on with your picture  im not getting on said cornelia and she turned aside to make a cup of tea for an old gentleman who confessed that he liked a spoonful of rum in his general westley had brought him up and presented him and he remained chatting with cornelia apparently in the fatuity that if he talked trivially to her he would be the same as a young man ludlow stayed too and when the old gentleman got away he said the same as if there had been no interruption why arent you getting on  because im not doing anything to it  you ought to i told you what wetmore said of it  yes but i dont know how said cornelia with a laugh that he liked it seemed an effect of pleasure in his presence at her elbow though from time to time she ignored him and talked with other people who came for tea he noticed that she had begun to have a little society manner of her own he did not know whether he liked it or not she wore a very pretty dress too one he had not seen before  will you let me show you howas well as i can  after ive asked you thank you  i offered once before you asked  oh said cornelia with her face aslant from him over her teacups i thought you had forgotten that  he winced but he knew that he deserved the little scratch he did not try to exculpate himself but he asked may i talk with miss maybough about it  cornelia returned gayly its a free country  he rose from the chair which he had been keeping at her elbow and looked about over the room it was very full and the first of mrs westleys thursdays was successful beyond question with the roving eye which he would not suffer to be intercepted he saw the distinguished people whom she had hitherto affected in their usual number and in rather unusual number the society people who had probably come to satisfy an amiable curiosity he made his reflection that mrs westleys evolution was proceeding in the inevitable direction and that in another winter the swells would come so increasingly that there would be no celebrities for them to see his glance rested upon mrs maybough who stood in a little desolation of her own trying to look as if she were not there and he had the inspiration to go and speak to her instead of her daughter there were people enough speaking to charmian or seeming to speak to her which serves much the same purpose on such occasions she was looking her most mysterious and he praised her peculiar charm to mrs maybough  its no wonder i failed with that portrait  mrs maybough said you must try again mr ludlow  no i wont abuse your patience again but i will tell you i should like to come and look now and then at the picture miss saunders has begun of her and that i want her to keep on with  why not asked mrs maybough in the softest assent she would not listen to the injuries which ludlow heaped upon himself in proof of his unworthiness to cross her threshold  he went back to cornelia and said well its arranged ive spoken with mrs maybough and we can begin again whenever you like  with mrs maybough you said you were going to speak to charmian  it doesnt matter does it  yes ii dont know yet as i want to go on with the picture i hadnt thought  oh said ludlow with marked politeness then i misunderstood but dont let it annoy you it doesnt matter of course theres no sort of appointment  he found mrs westley in a moment of disoccupation before he went and used a friends right to recognize the brilliancy of her thursday she refused all merit for it and asked him if he had ever seen any thing like the contrast of charmian at the chocolate with cornelia at the tea did you notice the gown miss saunders had on its one that her mother has just sent her from home she says her mother made it and she came to ask me the other day if it would do to pour tea in wasnt it delightful im going to have her spend a week with me in lent the general has taken a great fancy to her i think i begin to appreciate her fascination its her courage and her candor together most girls are so uncertain and capricious its delightful to meet such a straightforward and downright creature  oh yes said ludlow     xxviii   cornelia knew that ludlow was offended she had not meant to hurt or offend him though she thought he had behaved very queerly ever since he gave up painting charmian she had really not had time to think of his offer before he went off to speak with charmian as she supposed the moment he was gone she saw that it would not do that she could not have him coming to look at her work she did not feel that she could ever touch it again she wondered at him and now if he had spoken to mrs maybough instead of charmian it was not her fault certainly she did not wish to revenge herself but she remembered how much she had been left to account for as she could or painfully to ignore if he was mystified and puzzled now it was no more than she had been before  there was nothing that cornelia hated so much as to be made a fool of and this was the grievance which she was willing fate should retaliate upon him though she had not meant it at all she ought to have been satisfied and she ought to have been happy but she was not  she wished to escape from herself and she eagerly accepted an invitation to go with mrs montgomery to the theatre that night the manager had got two places and given them to the landlady  cornelia had a passion for the theatre and in the excitement of the play which worked strongly in her ingenuous fancy she forgot herself for the time or dimly remembered the real world and her lot in it as if it were a subordinate action of the piece at the end of the fourth act she heard a voice which she knew saying well well is this the way the folks at pymantoning expect you to spend your evenings she looked up and around and saw mr dickerson in the seat behind her he put forward two hands over her shoulderone for her to shake and one for mrs montgomery  why mr dickerson said the landlady where did you spring from you been sitting here behind us all the time  i wish i had said dickerson but this seat is anothers as they say on the stage hes gone out to see a man and im keeping it for him just caught sight of you before the curtain fell couldnt hardly believe my eyes  but where are you why havent you been round to the house  well im only here for a day said dickerson with a note of selfdenial in his voice that cornelia knew was meant for her and i thought i wouldnt disturb you no use making so many bites of a cherry i got in so late last night i had to go to a hotel anyway  mrs montgomery began some hospitable expostulations but be waived them with yes thats all right ill remember it next time mrs montgomery and then he began to speak of the play and he was so funny about some things in it that he made cornelia laugh he took leave of them when the owner of the seat came back he told mrs montgomery he should not see her again this time but at the end of the play they found him waiting for them at the outer door of the theatre he skipped lightly into step with them thought i might as well see you home as they say in pymantoning do know as i shall be back for quite a while this next trip and we dont see much ladies society on the road at least i dont im not so easy to make acquaintance as i used to be i suppose it was being married so long i cant manage to help a pretty girl raise a carwindow or put her grip into the rack the way i could once fact is there dont seem to be so many pretty girls as there were or else im gettin oldsighted and cant see em  he spoke to mrs montgomery but cornelia knew he was talking at her now he leaned forward and addressed her across mrs montgomery do know as i told you that i saw your mother in lakeland day before yesterday miss saunders  oh did you cornelia eagerly besought him the apparition of her mother rose before her it was almost like having her actually there to meet some one who had seen her so lately was she looking well the last letter she wrote she hadnt been very  well i guess shes all right now you know i think your mother is about the finest woman in this world miss nelie and the prettiestlooking ive never told you about mrs saunders have i mrs montgomery well you wouldnt know but her and miss nelie were sisters she looks like a girl a little way off and she is a girl in her feelings shes got the kindest heart and shes the best person i ever saw i tell you it would be a different sort of a world if everybody was like mrs saunders and i should ha been a different sort of a man if id always appreciated her goodness well so it goes he said with a sigh of indefinite regret which availed with cornelia because it was mixed with praise of her mother it made her feel safer with him and more tolerant he leaned forward again and said across mrs montgomery as before she was gettin off the train from pymantoning and i was just takin my train west but i knew it was her as soon as i saw her walk i was half a mind to stop and speak to her and let my train go  cornelia could see her mother just how she would look wandering sweetly and vaguely away from her train and the vision was so delightful to her that it made her laugh i guess youre mothers girl mrs montgomery interpreted and mr dickerson said  well i guess shes got a good right to be i wasnt certain whether it was her or miss saunders first when i saw her the other day  at her door mrs montgomery invited him to come in and he said he did not know but he would for a minute and cornelias gratitude for his praise of her mother kept her from leaving them at once in the diningroom where mrs montgomery set out a lunch for him he began to tell stories  cornelia had no grudge against him for the past she was only too glad that it had all fallen out as it did and though she still knew that he was a shameless little wretch she did not feel so personally disgraced by him as she had at first when she was not sure she could make him keep his distance he was a respite from her own thoughts and she lingered and lingered and listened and listened remotely aware that it was wrong but somehow bewildered and constrained  mrs montgomery went down to the kitchen a moment for something more to add to the lunch and he seized the chance to say i know how you feel about me miss saunders and i dont blame you you neednt be afraid i aint going to trouble you i might if you was a different kind of girl but ive thought it all over since i saw you and i respect you i hope you wont give me away to mrs montgomery but if you do i shall respect you all the same and i shant blame you even then the landlady returned and he went on i was just tellin miss saunders about my friend bob whiteleys railroad accident but youve heard it so often  oh well do go on said mrs montgomery setting down the plate of cold chicken she had brought back with her  it was midnight before he rose i declare i could listen all night said mrs montgomery  cornelia could have done so too but she did not say it while the talk lasted she had a pleasure in the apt slang and sinister wit and low wisdom which made everything higher and nobler seem ridiculous she tried helplessly to rise above the delight she found in it and while she listened she was miserably aware that she was unworthy even of the cheap respect which this amusing little wretch made a show of paying her before mrs montgomery  she loathed him and yet she hated to have him go for then she would be left to herself and her own thoughts as she crept up the long stairs to her room she asked herself if she could be the same girl who had poured tea at mrs westleys and talked to all those refined people who seemed to admire her and make much of her as if she were one of them before she had escaped from the toils of that folly of the past by disowning it but now she had voluntarily made it hers she had wilfully entangled herself in its toils they seemed to trip her steps and make her stumble on the stairs as if they were tangible things she had knowingly suffered such a man as that whose commonness of soul she had always instinctively felt to come back into her life and she could never banish him again she could never even tell any one she was the captive of her shabby secret till he should come again and openly claim her he would come again there could be no doubt of that  on the bureau before her glass lay a letter it was from ludlow and it delicately expressed the hope that there had been nothing in his manner of offering to help her with her picture which made it impossible for her to accept i need not tell you that i think you have talent for i have told you that before i have flattered myself that i had a personal interest in it because i saw it long ago and i have been rather proud of thinking that you were making use of me i wish you would think the matter over and decide to go on with your picture of miss maybough i promise to reduce my criticism to a minimum for i think it is more important that you should keep on in your own way even if you go a little wrong in it now and then than that you should go perfectly right in some ones else do let me hear from you and say that i may come saturday to miss mayboughs studio and silently see what you are doing  in a postscript he wrote i am afraid that i have offended you by something in my words or ways if i have wont you at least let me come and be forgiven  she dropped her face on the letter where it lay open before her and stretched out her arms and moaned in a despair that no tears even came to soften she realized how much worse it was to have made a fool of herself than to be made a fool of     xxix   there was only one thing for cornelia to do now and she did it as well as she knew how or could hope to know without the help that she could not seek anywhere she wrote to ludlow and thanked him and told him that she did not think she should go on with the picture of charmian for the present she said in the first five or six drafts of her letter that it had been her uncertainty as to this which made her hesitate when he spoke to her but in every form she gave this she found it false and at last she left it out altogether and merely assured him that she had nothing whatever to forgive him she wished to forbid his coming to see her she did not know quite how to do that but either the tone of her letter was forbidding enough or else he felt that he had done his whole duty now for he did not come  with moments of utter selfabasement she had to leave charmian to the belief that she was distraught and captious solely for the reason they shared the secret of and charmian respected this with a devotion so obvious as to be almost spectacular cornelia found herself turning into a romantic heroine and had to make such struggle against the transformation as she could in bursts of hysterical gayety these had rather the effect of deepening charmians compassionate gloom till she exhausted her possibilities in that direction and began to crave some new expression there was no change in her affection for cornelia and there were times when cornelia longed to trust her fully she knew that it would be safe and she did not believe that it would lower her in charmians eyes but to keep the fact of her weakness altogether her own seemed the only terms on which she could bear it  one day there came a letter from her mother out of her usual order of writing she wrote on sunday and her letters reached cornelia the next evening but this letter came on a wednesday morning and the sight of it filled cornelia with alarm first for her mother and then for herself which deepened as she read      dear nie that goodfornothing little scrub has been here talken     aboute you and acting as if you was handandglove with him now     nelie i dont want to interfere with you anyway and i wont if you     say the word but i never felt just righte about that fellow and     what i done long ago to make you tollerate him and now i want to     make it up to you if i can he is a common lowdown person and he     isnt fit to speake to you and i hope you wont speake to him the     divorce the way i look at it dont make any difference hese just     as much married as what he ever was and if he had never been     married atoll it wouldnt of made any difference as far as i feel     about it now nelie you are old enough to take care of yourself     but i hope if that fellow ever comes around you again youll box     his ears and be done with him i know hes got a smooth tongue and     he can make you laugh in spite of yourselfe but dont you have     anything to do with him      mother      p s i have been talken it over with mrs burton and she thinks     just the way i do aboute it she thinks you are good enough for the     best and you no need to throw yourself away on such a perfect     little scamp in haste how is that cellebrated picture that you     are painting with mr ludlow getting along                                                 cornelia got this letter from the postman at mrs montgomerys door when she opened it to go out in the morning and she read it on her way to the synthesis it seemed to make the air reel around her and step by step she felt as if she should fall a wild anger swelled her heart and left no room there for shame even she wondered what abominable lies that little wretch had told but they must have been impudent indeed to overcome her mothers lifelong reluctance from writing and her wellgrounded fears of spelling so far as to make her send a letter out of the usual course but when her first fury passed and she began to grow weak in the revulsion she felt only her helplessness in the presence of such audacity and a fear that nothing could save her from him if he could make her so far forget herself as to tolerate him to listen to his stories to laugh at his jokes and show him that she enjoyed his company after all she knew of him then he could make her marry him if he tried  the logic was perfect and it seemed but another link in the infrangible chain of events when she found another letter waiting for her at the office of the synthesis it bore the postmark of lakeland of the same date as her mothers and in the corner of the envelope the business card of gates  clarkson dealers in art goods j b dickerson in a line of fine print at the top was modestly with them  the address dear friend was written over something else which had been rubbed out but beyond this the letter ran fluently and uninterruptedly along in a hand which had a businesslike directness and distinctness i dont know the writer said as you expected to hear from me and i dont know as i expected to let you but circumstances alter cases and i just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that i have been in pymantoning and seen your mother she is looking prime and younger than ever we had a long talk about old times and i told her what a mistake i made confession is good for the soul they say and i took a big dose of it i guess i confessed pretty much everything regular topsey style well your mother didnt spare me any and i dont know but what she was about right the fact is a man on the road dont think as much about his ps and qs as he ought as long as he is young and if i made a bad break in that little matrimonial venture of mine i guess it was no more than i deserved to i told your mother just how i happened to meet you again and how the sight of you was enough to make another man of me i was always a little too much afraid of you or it might have turned out different but i can appreciate a character like yours and i want you to know it i guess your mother sized it up about right when i said all i asked was to worship you at a distance and she said she guessed you would look out for the distance i told her you had up to date i want you to understand that i dont presume on anything and if we seemed to have a pretty good time after the theatre the other night it was because you didnt want to spoil mrs montgomerys fun and treated me well just because i was a friend of hers well its pretty hard to realize that my life is ruined and that i have got nobody but myself to thank for it but i guess thats what ive got to come to sooner or later its what your mother said and i guess she was right she didnt spare me a bit and i didnt want her to i knew she would write to you as soon as i was gone and tell you not to have anything to do with me and if she has all i have got to say is all right i have been a bad lot and i dont deny it and all i can ask now from this time forward is to be kept from doing any more mischief i dont know as i shall ever see you again i had a kind of presentiment i shouldnt and i told your mother so i dont know but i told a little more about how kind you were to me the other evening than what the facts would justify exactly but as sure as you live i didnt mean to lie about it if i exaggerated any it was because it seemed the greatest thing in the world to me just to talk to you and be where i could see you smile and hear you laugh youve got a laugh that is like a childs or an angels if angels laugh ive heard of their weeping and if you knew my whole life i think you would shed a tear or two over me but that is not what i am trying to get at i want to explain that if i appeared to brag of being tolerated by you and made it seem any thing more than toleration it was because it was like heaven to me not to have you give me the grand bounce again and what i want to ask you now is just to let me write to you every now and then and when i am tempted to go wrong anywaysand a business life is full of temptationslet me put the case before you and have you set me right i wont want but a word from you and most part of the time i shall just want to free my mind to you on life in general and wont expect any answer i feel as if you had got my soul in your hands and you could save it or throw it away that is all i am writing on the train and i have to use pencil i hope youll excuse the stationery its all the porter could get me and im anxious to have a letter go back to you at once i know your mother has written to you and i want to corroborate everything she says against me  the letter covered halfadozen telegraph blanks and filled them full so that the diffident suggestion my permanent address is with gates  clarkson had to be written along the side of the first page  the low cunning the impudent hypocrisy the leering pretence of reverence the affectation of penitence the whole fraudulent design so flimsy that the writer himself seemed to be mocking at it was open to cornelia and she read the letter through with distinct relief whatever the fascinations of mr dickerson were when he was personally at hand he had none at a distance and when she ran over the pages a second time it was with a laugh which she felt sure he would have joined her in if he had been there it turned her tragedy into farce so completely for the time that she went through her mornings work with a pleasure and a peace of mind which she had not felt for many days it really seemed such a joke that she almost yielded to the temptation of showing passages of the letter to charmian and she forebore only because she would have had to tell more than she cared to have any one know of mr dickerson if she did she had a right to keep all that from those who had no right to know it but she had no right or if she had the right she had not the power to act as if the past had never been she set herself to bear what was laid upon her and if she was ever to have strength for her burden she must begin by owning her weakness there was no one to whom she could own it but her mother and she did this fully as soon as she got back to her room and could sit down to answer her letter she enclosed dickersons and while she did not spare him she took the whole blame upon herself for she said she might have known that if she suffered him to see that he amused her or pleased her at all he was impudent enough to think that he could make her like him again and mother she wrote you know i never really liked him and was only too glad to get rid of him you know that much but i suppose you will wonder then why i ever let him speak to me if i really despised him as much as ever and that is not easy to explain for one thing he was with mrs montgomery and she likes him and she has always been so good to me that i hated to treat him badly before her but that is not the real reason and i am not going to pretend it was you know yourself how funny he is and can make you laugh in spite of yourself but it was not that either it was because i was angry with myself for having been angry with some one else without a cause as i can see it now and i had made a fool of myself and i wanted to get away from myself i cannot tell you just how it was yet and i do not know as i ever can but that was truly it and nothing else though the other things had something to do with it i suppose it was just like men when they take a drink of whiskey to make them forget the worst of it all is and the discouraging part is that it shows me i have not changed a particle my temper is just us bad as ever and i might as well be back at sixteen for all the sense ive got sometimes it seems to me that the past is all there is of us anyway it seems to come up in me all the time and i am so ashamed i dont know what to do i make all kinds of good resolutions and i want to be good and then comes something and it is all over with me then it appears as if it was not me altogether that is to blame i know i was to blame this last time laughing at that little scrubs jokes as you call him and behaving like a fool but i dont see how i was to blame for his coming back into my life when i never really wanted him at all and certainly never wished to set eyes on him again  i dont suppose it would be the least use to ask you not to show this letter to mrs burton and i wont but if you do i wish you would ask her what she thinks it means and whether its fate or foreordination or what  mrs saunders carried cornelias letter to mrs burton as cornelia had foreseen but the question she put to her was not the abstraction the girl had suggested mrs burton she asked who was it do you suppose nie was so mad with that she had to go off and play the fool that way  mrs burton passed the point of casuistry too well of course i dont know mrs saunders has she said anything about mr ludlow lately  no she haint said a word and that seems suspicious she said a week or two ago that he had give up trying to paint that maybough girl and that she guessed she had got the last of her lessons from him but she didnt seem much troubled about it but i guess by her not wantin to tell its him what do you suppose he did to provoke her  oh just some young peoples nonsense probably itll come all right you neednt worry about it because if it wont come right of itself hell make it come  oh im not worrying about that said mrs saunders im worrying about this she gave her the letter cornelia had enclosed and as mrs burton began to read it she said if that fellow keeps on writing to her i dont know what i will do     xxx   ludlow did not come to see cornelia but they met from time to time at mrs westleys where he was aware of her being rather taken up at mrs mayboughs where he found it his duty to show himself after his failure with charmians picture so as to help mrs maybough let people know there was nothing but the best feeling about it and more to his surprise at wetmores at the painters charmian who came with her realized more than anywhere else her dream of bohemia and wetmore threw a little excess into the social ease of his life that he might fulfil her ideal he proposed that mrs wetmore should set the example of hilarities that her domestic spirit abhorred he accused her of cutting off his beer and invented conditions of insolvency and privation that surpassed charmians wildest hopes he borrowed money of ludlow in her presence and said that he did not know that he should ever be able to pay it back he planned roystering escapades which were never put in effect and once he really went out with the two girls to the shop of an old german on the avenue who dealt in delicatessen and bought some nuremberg gingerbread and a bottle of limejuice after rejecting all the ranker meats and drinks as unworthy the palates of true bohemians he invited charmian to take part in various bats for the purpose of shocking the pymantoning propriety of cornelia and they got such fun out of it as children do when the makebelieve of their elders has been thinned to the most transparent pretence but charmian who knew he was making fun of her remained as passionately attached to the ideal he mocked as ever and cornelia had the guilty pang of wondering what he would think of her if he knew all about mr dickerson whose nature she now perceived to be that of the vulgarest batting  she did not answer the letter she first got nor any of those which immediately followed and this had the effect of checking mr dickersons ardor for so long a time that she began to think he would not trouble her again  there was no real offence between her and ludlow or any but such as could wear itself away with time and the custom of friendly meeting he had the magnanimity to ignore it when he first saw her after that thursday of mrs westleys and she had too keen a sense of having been a fool not to wish to act more wisely as soon as she could forget there came so long a lapse between the letters of mr dickerson that he ceased at least perpetually to haunt her thoughts she had moments when it seemed as if she might justly consent to be happy again or at least allow herself to enjoy the passing pleasure of the time without blame she even suffered herself to fancy taking up the picture of charmian and carrying it farther under ludlows criticism she was very ambitious to try her fate with the academy and when he offered so generously to help her again as if she had not refused him once so rudely she could not deny him she found herself once more in charmians studio and it all began to go on the same as if it had never stopped it seemed like a dream sometimes when she thought about it and it did not seem like a very wise dream cornelia now wished above all things to have a little bit of sense as she phrased it in her thoughts and she was aware that the present position of affairs might look rather crazy to some people the best excuse for it was that it would have looked crazier yet if she had refused such an opportunity simply because of the circumstances she began to be a little vague about the circumstances and whether they were queer because she had fancied a likeness of herself in mr ludlows picture of charmian or because she had afterwards made a fool of herself so irreparably as to be unworthy mr ludlows kindness  if it was merely kindness and she was the object of charity it was all right she could accept it on those terms she even tempted him to patronize her but when he ventured upon something elderly and paternal in his monitions she resented it so fiercely that she was astonished and ashamed there was an inconsistency in it all that was perplexing but not so perplexing as to spoil the pleasure of it  there were not sittings every day now ludlow came once or twice a week and criticised her work sometimes he struck off a sketch himself in illustration of a point and these sketches were now so unlike cornelia and so wholly like charmian that when he left them for her guidance she studied them with a remote ache in her heart never mind charmian consoled her once he just does it on purpose  does what cornelia demanded awfully  oh nothing  one of the sketches he fancied so much that he began to carry it forward he worked at it whenever he came and under his hand it grew an idealized charmian in which her fantastic quality expressed itself as high imagination and her formless generosity as a wise and noble magnanimity  she made fun of it when they were alone but cornelia could see that she was secretly proud of having inspired it and that she did not really care for the constant portrait which cornelia had been faithfully finishing up while ludlow changed and experimented though charmian praised her to his disadvantage  one day he said he had carried his picture as far as he could and he should let it go at that it seemed an end of their pleasant days together the two girls agreed that now there could be no further excuse for their keeping on and cornelia wondered how she could let him know that she understood that evening he came to call on her at mrs montgomerys and before he sat down he began to say i want to ask your advice miss saunders about what i shall do with my sketch of miss maybough  cornelia blenched for no reason that she could think of she could not gasp out the yes that she tried to utter  you see he went on i know that ive disappointed mrs maybough and id like to make her some sort of reparation but i cant offer her the sketch instead of the portrait if she liked it she would want to pay for it and i cant take money for it so ive thought of giving the sketch to miss maybough  he looked at cornelia now for the advice he had asked but she did not speak and he had to say but i dont know whether she likes it or not do you know whether she does has she ever spoken of it to you of course shes said civil things to me about it i beg your pardon i suppose you dont care to tell and i had no right to inquire  oh yes yes  well  i know she likes it she must  but she hasnt said so  notexactly  then what makes you think she does  i dont know any one would its very beautiful cornelia spoke very dryly very coldly  but is it a likeness is it she her character what do you think of it yourself  i dont know as i can say  ah i see you dont like it said ludlow with an air of disappointment and yet i aimed at pleasing you in it  at pleasing me she murmured thickly back  yes you i tried to see her as you do to do her justice and if it is overdone or flattered or idealized it is because ive been working toward your notion  oh said cornelia and then to the great amazement of herself as well as ludlow she began to laugh and she laughed on with her face in her handkerchief when she took her handkerchief down her eyes looked strange but she asked with a sort of radiance and did you think i thought charmian was really like that  why i didnt know youve been very severe with me when ive suggested she wasnt at first when i wanted to do her as humbug you wouldnt stand it and now when ive done her as mystery you laugh  cornelia pressed her handkerchief to her shining eyes and laughed a little more that is because she isnt either cant you understand  i could understand her being both i think dont you think shes a little of both  i told you said cornelia gravely that i didnt like to talk charmian over  that was a good while ago i didnt know but you might by this time  why she asked am i so changeable  no youre the one constant and steadfast creature in a world of variableness i didnt really expect that i know that i can always find you where i left you you are the same as when i first saw you  it seemed to cornelia that she had been asking him to praise her and she was not going to have that do you mean that i behave as badly as i did in the fair house no wonder you treat me like a child this was not at all what she meant to say however and was worse than what she had said before  no he answered seriously i meant that you are not capricious and i hate caprice but do i treat you like a child  sometimes said cornelia looking down and feeling silly  i am very sorry i wish you would tell me how  she had not expected this pursuit and she flashed back you are doing it now you wouldnt say that totoany one else  ludlow paused thoughtfully then he said i seem to treat myself like a child when i am with you perhaps thats what displeases you well i cant help that it is because you are so true that i cant keep up the conventions with you they were both silent cornelia was trying to think what she should say and he added irrelevantly if you dont like that sketch of her i wont give it to her  i what have i to do with it she did not know what they were talking about or to what end yes you must give it to her i know she wants it and i know how kind you are and good i didnt meani didnt wish to blame youi dont know why im making such a perfect fool of myself  she had let him have her hand somehow and he was keeping it but they had both risen  may i stay a moment he entreated  no one thing now seemed more inconsequent than another and cornelia answered with a catching of her breath but as if it quite followed why certainly and they both sat down again  there is something i wish to tellto speak of he began i think its what you mean in my picture of miss maybough  i didnt mean that at all that doesnt make any difference to me she broke incoherently in upon him i didnt care for it you can do what you please with it  he looked at her in a daze while she spoke oh he said i am very stupid i didnt mean this sketch of mine i dont care for that now i meant that other picture of herthe last onethe one i painted out before i gave up painting her did you see that it was like you  cornelia felt that he was taking an advantage of her and she lifted her eyes indignantly mr ludlow  ah dont think that he pleaded and she knew that he meant her unexpressed sense of unfairness in him i know you saw it and the likeness was there becausei wanted to tell you long ago but i couldnt because when we met afterwards i was afraid that i was mistaken in what i thoughthoped i had no right to know anything till i was sure of myself butthe picture was like you because you were all the time in my thoughts and nothing and no one but you cornelia she rose up crazily and looked toward the door as if she were going to run out of the room what is it he implored you know i love you  let me go she panted  if you tell me you dont care for me  i dont i dont care for you andlet me go  he stood flushed and scared before her ii am sorry i didnt meani hoped but it is all right i mean you are right and i am wrong i am very wrong     xxxi   ludlow stood aside and cornelia escaped when she reached her own room she had a sense of her failure to take formal leave of him and she mechanically blamed herself for that before she blamed herself for anything else at first he was altogether to blame and she heaped the thought of him with wild reproach and injury if she had behaved like a fool it was because she was trapped into it and could not help it she had to do so she recalled distinctly amidst the turmoil how she had always kept in mind that a girl who had once let a man like that dreadful little wretch whose name she could not take into her consciousness suppose that she could care for him could not let a man like ludlow care for her if she did she was wicked and she knew she had not done it for she had been on her guard against it the reasoning was perfect and if he had spoiled everything now he had himself to thank for it and she did not pity him still she wished she had not run out of the room she wished she had behaved with more dignity and not been rude he could laugh at her for that it was like her behavior with him from the very beginning there was something in him that always made her behave badly with him like a petulant child he would be glad to forget her he would believe now that she was not good enough for him and he might laugh but at least he could not say that she had ever done or said the least thing to let him suppose that she cared for him if she had she should not forgive herself and she should pity him as much as she blamed him now there was nothing in her whole conduct that would have warranted her in supposing such a thing if she were a man cornelia had this comfort and she clung to it till it flashed through her that not being a man she could not imagine what the things were that could let a man suppose it she had never thought of that before and it dazed her perhaps he had seen all along that she did care for him that he had known it in some way unknown and forever unknowable to her the way a man knows and all her disguises had availed nothing against him then if he had known he had acted very deceitfully and very wrongfully and nothing could excuse him unless there had been other signs that a girl would recognize too that would excuse him it would justify him and she tried to see the affair with another womans eyes she tried to see it with charmians eves but she knew they were filled with a romantic iridescence that danced before them and wrapt it in a rainbow mist then she tried mrs westleys eyes which she knew were friendly to both ludlow and herself and she told her everything in her impassioned revery all about that little wretch all about the first portrait of charmian and the likeness they had seen in it all about what had happened since ludlow began to criticise her work again in the mere preparation for this review she found anothers agency insufferable she abandoned herself wildly to a vision which burned itself upon her in mass and detail under a light that searched motive and conduct alike and left her no refuge from the truth then she perceived how at every moment since they began those last lessons at charmains he must have believed she cared for him and wished him to care for her if she had not seen it too it was because she was stupid and she was to blame all the same she was blind to what he saw in her and she had thought because she was hidden from herself that she was hidden from him  it was not a question now of whether she cared for him or not that was past all question but whether she had not led him on to think she did and she owned that down to the last moment before he had spoken wittingly or unwittingly she had coaxed him to praise her to console her lo make love to her she was rightly punished and she was ready to suffer but she could not let him suffer the shame of thinking himself wrong that was mean that was cowardly and whatever she was cornelia was not base and not afraid she would have been willing to follow him into the night to go to his door and knock at it and when he came flash out at him i did love you i do love you and then run she did not know where but somewhere out of the world but he might not be there or some one else might come to the door the crude material difficulties denied her the fierce joy of this exploit but she could not rest she should never really rest again till she had done the nearest thing to it that she could she looked at the little busybee clock ticking away on her bureau and saw that it was halfpast eleven oclock and that there was no time to lose and she sat down and wrote i did care for you but i can never see you again i cannot tell you the reason  she drew a deep breath when the thing was done and hurried the scrap unsigned into an envelope and addressed it to ludlow she was in a frenzy till she could get it out of her hands and into the postalbox beyond recall she pulled a shawl over her head and flew down stairs and out of the door into the street toward the postalbox on the corner but before she reached it she thought of a specialdelivery stamp which should carry the letter to ludlow the first thing in the morning and she pushed on to the druggists at the corner beyond to get it she was aware of the man staring at her as if she had asked for arsenic and she supposed she must have looked strange this did not come into her mind till she found herself again at mrs montgomerys door where she stood in a panic ecstasy at having got rid of the letter which the special stamp seemed to make still more irrevocable and tried to fit her nightlatch into the lock the cat which had been shut out crept up from the area and rubbed with a soft insinuation against her skirt she gave a little shriek of terror and the door was suddenly pulled open from within  she threw back her shawl from her head and under the lowburning gaslight held aloft by the spelter statuette in the newel post she confronted mr dickerson he had his hat on and had the air of just having let himself in his gripsack stood at his feet  why nelie miss saunders is that you why where in the world well this is something like willy we have missed you ive just come what was the matter out there somebody trying to scare you well theres nothing to be afraid of now anyway how you do pant but it becomes you yes it does you look now just like ive seen you all the time ive been gone you didnt answer any of my letters i dont know as i could have expected any different but i did hope nelie its no use ive got to speak out and its now or never maybe there wont be another chance look here my girl i want youi love you nie and i always d  he had got her hand and he was drawing her toward him she struggled to free herself but he pulled her closer  her heart swelled with a fury of grief for all she had suffered and lost through him she thought of what her mother had said she ought to do if he ever spoke to her again there came without her agency almost three swift sharp electrical blows from the hand she had freed she saw him reeling backward with his hand at his face and then she was standing in her own room looking at her ghost in the glass  now if mr ludlow knew he would surely despise her and she wished she were dead indeed not so much because she had boxed dickersons ears as because she had done what obliged her to do it     xxxii   it is hard for the young to understand that the world which seems to stop with their disaster is going on with smooth indifference and that a little time will carry them so far from any fateful event that when they gather courage to face it they will find it curiously shrunken in the perspective nothing really stops the world but death and that only for the dead if we live we must move on we must change we must outwear every motion however poignant or deep cornelias shame failed to kill her she woke the next morning with a selfloathing that seemed even greater than that of the night before but it was actually less and it yielded to the strong will which she brought to bear upon herself she went to her work at the synthesis as if nothing had happened and she kept at it with a hard mechanical faithfulness which she found the more possible perhaps because charmian was not there for some reason and she had not her sympathy as well as her own weakness to manage she surprised herself with the results of her pitiless industry and realized for the first time the mysterious duality of being in the power of the brain and the hand to toil while the heart aches  she was glad she kept assuring herself that she had put an end to all hope from ludlow she rejoiced bitterly that now however she had disgraced herself in her violent behavior she had at least disgraced no one else no one else could suffer through any claim upon her or kindness for her or had any right to feel ashamed of her or injured by her but cornelia was at the same time puzzled and perplexed with herself and dismayed with the slightness of her hold upon impulses of hers which she thought she had overcome and bound forever she made the discovery which she was yet far too young to formulate that she had a temperament to deal with that could at any time shake to ruins the character she had so carefully built upon it and had so wholly mistaken for herself in the midst of this dismay she made another discovery and this was that perhaps even her temperament was not what she had believed it but was still largely unknown to her she had always known that she was quick and passionate but she certainly had not supposed that she was capable of the meanness of wondering whether mr ludlow would take her note as less final than she had meant it and would perhaps seek some explanation of it no girl that she ever heard or read of had ever fallen quite so low as to hope that but was not she hoping just that perhaps she had even written those words with the tacit intention of calling him back but this conjecture was the mere play of a morbid fancy and weak as she was cornelia had the strength to forbid it and deny it  at the end of the afternoon she pretended that she ought to go and see what had happened to charmian and on the way she had time to recognize her own hypocrisy and to resolve that she would do penance for it by coming straight at the true reason of her errand she was sent to charmian in her studio and she scarcely gave her a chance to explain that she had staid at home on account of a cold and had written a note for cornelia to come to dinner with her which she would find when she got back  cornelia said i want to tell you something charmian and i want you to tell me what you really thinkwhether ive done right or not  charmians eyes lightened wait a moment she got a piece of the lightwood and put it on the fire which she had kindled on the hearth to keep the spring chill off and went and turned ludlows sketch of herself to the wall i know its about him then she came and crouched on the tigerskin at cornelias feet and clasped her hands around her knees and fixed her averted face on the blazing pine now go on she said as if she had arranged the pose to her perfect satisfaction  cornelia went on its about him and its about some one else too and she had no pity on herself in telling charmian all about that early shabby affair with dickerson  i knew it said charmian with a sigh of utter content i told you the first time i saw you that you had lived well and has heturned up  he has turned upthree times said cornelia  charmian shivered with enjoyment of the romantic situation she reached a hand behind her and tried to clutch one of cornelias but had to get on without it and well have they met  no they havent said cornelia crossly but not so much with charmian as with the necessity she was now in of telling her about her last meeting with ludlow she began they almost did and when charmian in the intensity of her interest could not keep turning around to stare at her cornelia took hold of her head and turned her face toward the fire again then she went on to tell how it had all happened she did not spare herself at any point and she ended the story with the expression of her belief that she had deserved it all it wasnt boxing that little wretchs ears that was the disgrace it was having brought myself to where i had to box them  yes that was it sighed charmian with deep conviction  and i had to tell him that i could never care for him because i couldnt bear to tell him what a fool i had been  no no you never could do that  and i couldnt bear to have him think i was better than i really was or let him care for me unless i told him all about that miserable old affair  no you couldnt cornelia said charmian solemnly some girls might most girls would they would just consider it a flirtation and not say anything about it or not till after they were engaged and then just laugh but you are different from other girlsyou are so true yes you would have to tell it if it killed you i can see that and you couldnt tell it and you had to break his heart yes you had to  oh charmian maybough how cruel you are cornelia flung herself forward and cried charmian whirled round and kneeling before her threw her arms around her in a pose of which she felt the perfection and kissed her tenderly  why didnt you let me see how you were looking how i have gone on  cornelia pulled herself loose charmian do you dare to mean that i want him to ever speak to me againor look at me  no no  or that im sorry i did it  no its this cold thats making me so stupid  if he were to come back again this instant i should have to tell him just the same or else tell him about thatthatand you know i couldnt do that if i lived a thousand years  now she melted indeed and suffered charmian to moan over her and fortify her with all the reasons she had urged herself in various forms of repetition charmain showed her again how impossible everything that she had thought impossible was and convinced her of every conviction she made cornelias tragedy her romance and solemnly exulted in its fatality while she lifted her in her struggle of conscience to a height from which for the present at least cornelia could not have descended without a ruinous loss of selfrespect in the renunciation in which the worshipper confirmed her saint ludlow and his rights and feelings were ignored and cornelia herself was offered nothing more substantial than the prospect that henceforth she and charmian could live for each other in a union that should be all principle on one side and all adoration on the other     xxxiii   cornelia did not go to pass that week in lent with mrs westley when she went rather tardily to withdraw her promise she said that the time was now growing so short she must give every moment to the synthesis mrs westley tacitly arranged to cancel some little plans she had made for her and in the pity a certain harassed air of the girls moved in her she accepted her excuses as valid and said but i am afraid you are overworking at the synthesis miss saunders are you feeling quite well  oh perfectly cornelia answered with a false buoyancy from which she visibly fell she looked down and said i wish the work was twice as hard  ah you have come to that very soon said mrs westley and then they were both silent till she added how are you getting on with your picture of miss maybough  oh im not doing anything with that said cornelia and she stood up to go  but you are going to exhibit it mrs westley persisted  no t dont know as i am i should have to offer it first  it would be sure to be accepted mr ludlow thinks it would  oh yes i know said cornelia feeling herself get very red but i guess i wont offer it goodbye  mrs westley kept the impression of something much more personal than artistic in cornelias reference to her picture and when she met ludlow a few days after she asked him if he knew that miss saunders was not going to offer her picture to the exhibition  he said simply that he did not know it  dont you think she ought i dont think shes looking very well of late do you  i dont know isnt she i havent seen her he began carelessly he added anxiously when did you see her  a few days ago she came to say she could not take the time from the synthesis to pay me that little visit im afraid shes working too hard of course shes very ambitious but i cant understand her not wanting to show her picture there and trying to sell it  ludlow stooped forward and pulled the long ears of mrs westleys fashionable dog which lay on the rug at his feet  have you any idea why shes changed her mind  yes said ludlow i think its because i helped her with it  is she so independent or perhaps i am not quite discreet  why not you say she didnt look well  she lookedworried  he asked as if it immediately followed mrs westley should you mind giving me a little advice about a mattera very serious matter  if you wont follow it  do we ever  well  how much use can a man be to a girl when he knows that he cant be of the greatest  none if he is sure  he is perfectly sure  he had better let her alone then he had better not try  i am going to try but i thank you for your advice more than if i were going to take it  they parted laughing and mrs westley was contented to be left with the mystery which she believed was no mystery to her  ludlow went home and wrote to cornelia      dear miss saunders i hear you are not going to try to get your     picture into the exhibition i will not pretend not to understand     why and you would not wish me to so i feel free to say that you     are making a mistake you ought to offer your picture i think it     would be accepted and you have no right to forego the chance it     would give you for the only reason you can have i know that mr     wetmore would be glad to advise you about it and i am sure you     will believe that i have not asked him to do so      yours sincerely      w ludlow  cornelia turned this letter in many lights and tried to take it in many ways but in the end she could only take it in the right way and she wrote back      dear mr ludlow i thank you very much for your letter and i am     going to do what you say yours sincerely      cornelia saunders      p s i do appreciate your kindness very much  she added this postscript after trying many times to write a reply that would seem less blunt and dry but she could not write anything at all between a letter that she felt was gushing and this note which certainly could not be called so she thought the postscript did not help it much but she let it go  as soon as she had done so it seemed to her that she had no reason for having done so and she did not see how she could justify it to charmian whom she had told that she should not offer her picture she would have to say that she had changed her mind simply because mr ludlow had bidden her and she tried to think how she could make that appear sufficient but charmian was entirely satisfied oh yes she said that was the least you could do when he asked you you certainly owed him that much now she added mystically he never can say a thing  they were in charmians studio where cornelias sketch of her had been ever since she left working on it and charmian ran and got it and set it where they could both see it in the light of the new event  its magnificent cornelia theres no other word for it did you know he was going to give me his  yes he told me he was going to said cornelia looking at her sketch with a dreamy suffusion of happiness in her face  its glorious but it doesnt come within a million miles of yours mr wetmore isnt on the committee this year but he knows them all and  cornelia turned upon her charmian maybough if you breathe if you dream a word to him about it i will never speak to you if my picture cant get into the exhibition without the help of friends  oh i shant speak to him about it charmian hastened to assure her in pursuance of her promise she only spoke to mrs wetmore and at the right time wetmore used his influence with the committee then for the reason or the no reason that governs such matters or because cornelias picture was no better than too many others that were accepted it was refused     xxxiv   the blow was not softened to cornelia by her having prophesied to charmian as well as to herself that she knew her picture would be refused now she was aware that at the bottom of her heart she had always hoped and believed it would be accepted she had kept it all from her mother but she had her fond proud visions of how her mother would look when she got her letter saying that she had a picture in the exhibition and how she would throw on her sacque and bonnet and run up to mrs burton for an explanation and full sense of the honor in these fancies cornelia even had them come to new york to see her picture in position it was not on the line of course and yet it was not skyed  her pride was not involved and she suffered no sting of wounded vanity from its rejection her hurt was in a tenderer place she would not have cared how many people knew of her failure if her mother and mrs burton need not have known but she wrote faithfully home of it and tried to make neither much nor little of it she forbade charmian the indignation which she would have liked to vent but she let her cry over the event with her no one else knew that it had actually happened except wetmore and ludlow she was angry with them at first for encouraging her to offer the picture but wetmore came and was so mystified and humbled by its refusal that she forgave him and even comforted him for his part in the affair  she acted like a little man about it he reported to ludlow shell do when a girl can take a blow like that the way she does she makes you wish that more fellows were girls when i had my first picture refused it laid me up but im not going to let this thing rest im going to see if that picture cant be got into the american artists  better not said ludlow so vaguely that wetmore thought he must mean something  why  ohi dont believe shed like it  what makes you think so have you seen her  no  you havent well ludlow i didnt lose any time perhaps you think there was no one else to blame for the mortification of that poor child  no i dont i am to blame too i encouraged her to tryi urged her  then i should think you would go and tell her so  ah i think she knows it if i told her anything i should tell her no one was to blame but myself  well that wouldnt be a bad idea wetmore lighted his pipe confound those fellows i should like to knock their heads together if there is anything like the selfrighteousness of a committee when its wrongbut there isnt fortunately  it was not the first time that ludlow had faltered in the notion of going to cornelia and claiming to be wholly at fault in thought he was always doing it and there were times when he almost did it in reality but he let these times pass effectless hoping for some better time when the thing would do itself waiting for the miracle which love expects when it is itself the miracle that brings all its desires to fulfilment he certainly had some excuses for preferring a passive part in what he would have been so glad to have happen cornelia had confessed that she had once cared for him but at the same time she had implied that she cared for him no longer and she had practically forbidden him to see her again much study of her words could make nothing else of them and it was not until ludlow saw his way to going impersonally in his quality of mistaken adviser from whom explanation and atonement were due that he went to cornelia even then he did not quite believe that she would see him and he gladly lost the bet he made himself at the sound of a descending step on the stairs that it was the irish girl coming back to say that miss saunders was not at home  they met very awkwardly and ludlow had such an official tone in claiming responsibility for having got cornelia to offer her picture and so have it rejected that he hardly knew who was talking that is all he said stiffly and he rose and stood looking into his hat it seemed to me that i couldnt do less than come and say this and i hope you dont feel that imim unwarranted in coming  oh no cried cornelia its very kind of you and no ones to blame but me i dont suppose i should care onlyshe bit her lips hard and added deep in her throati hated to have my mother but i am rightfully punished  she meant for the dickerson business but ludlow thought she meant for her presumption and his heart smote him in tender indignation as her head sank and her face averted itself it touched him keenly that she should speak to him in that way of her mother as if from an instinctive sense of his loving and faithful sympathy and then somehow he had her in his arms there in mrs montgomerys dim parlor he noted as in a dream that his hat had fallen and was rolling half the length of it  oh wait cried the girl what are you doing you dont know there is something i must tell youthat will make you hate me she struggled to begin somehow but she did not know where  no he said you neednt tell me anything there isnt anything in the world that could change me to younothing that you could tell me sometime if you mustif you wish but not now ive been too miserable and now im so happy  but its very foolish its silly i tell you  not now not now he insisted he made her cry he made her laugh but he would not listen to her she knew it was all wrong that it was romantic and fantastic and she was afraid of it but she was so happy too that she could not will it for the moment to be otherwise she put off the time that must come or let him put it off for her and gladly lost herself in the bliss of the present the fear growing more and more vague and formless haunted her rapture but even this ceased before they parted and left her at perfect peace in his lovetheir love  he told her how much she could be to him how she could supplement him in every way where he was faltering and deficient and he poured out his heart in praises of her that made her brain reel they talked of a thousand things touching them and leaving them and coming back but always keeping within the circle of their relation to themselves they flattered one another with the tireless and credulous egotism of love they tried to tell what they had thought of each other from the first moment they met and tried to make out that they neither had ever since had a thought that was not the others they believed this the commonplaces of the passion ever since it began to refine itself from the earliest savage impulse seemed to have occurred to them for the first time in the history of the race they accused themselves each of not being worthy of the other they desired to be very good and to live for the highest things  they began this life by spending the whole afternoon together when some other people came into the parlor they went out to walk they walked so long and far that they came at last to the park without meaning to and sat on a bench by a rock other people were doing the same nurses with babycarriages before them men smoking and reading elderly husbands with their elderly wives beside them whom they scarcely spoke to it must have been a very common idle thing but to them it had the importance the distinction of something signal done for the first time they staid there till it was almost dark and then they went and had tea together in the restaurant of one of the vast hotels at the entrance of the park it was a very philistine place with richlooking dulllooking people travellers and sojourners dining about in its spacious splendor but they got a table in a corner and were as much alone there as in the park their happiness seemed to push the world away from them wherever they were and to leave them free within a wide circle of their own she poured the tea for them both from the pot which the waiter set at her side he looked on in joyful wonder and content how natural it all is he sighed i should think you had always been doing that for me but i suppose it is only from the beginning of time  she let him talk the most because she was too glad to speak and because they had both the same thoughts and it did not need two to utter them now and then he made her speak he made her answer some question but it was like some question that she had asked herself from time to time they spoke of others besides themselves of her mother and the burtons of charmian of mrs westley of wetmore but it was in relation to themselves without this relation nothing had any meaning  when they parted after an evening prolonged till midnight in mrs montgomerys parlor that which had been quiescent in cornelias soul stirred again and she knew that she was wrong to let ludlow go without telling him of dickerson it was the folly of that agreement of theirs about painting charmian repeating itself in slightly different terms and with vastly deeper meaning but to a like end of passive deceit of tacit untruth his wish did not change it she thought afterwards she could not have let him go without telling him if she had not believed somehow that the parallel would complete itself and that he would come back as he had done before and help her undo what was false between them but perhaps this was not so perhaps if she had been sure he would not come back she would not have spoken at any rate he did not come back     xxxv   cornelia was left to no better counsels than those of charmian maybough and these were disabled from what they might have been at their best by cornelias failure to be frank with her if she was wronging charmian by making her a halfconfidant only she could not be more open with her than with ludlow and she must let her think that she had told him everything until she had told him everything  she did honestly try to do so from time to time she tried to lead him on to ask her what it was he had kept her from telling him in that first moment of their newly confessed love when it would have been easier than it could ever be again she reproached him in her heart for having prevented her then it seemed as if he must know that she was longing for his help to be frank but she never could make that cry for his help pass her lips where it trembled when she ought to have felt safest with him she began to be afraid of him and he began to be aware of her fear  he went home after parting with her that first night of their engagement too glad of all that was to feel any lack in it but the first thought in his mind when he woke the next morning was not that perfect joy which the last before he fell asleep had been his discomfort was a formless emotion at first and it was a moment before it took shape in the mistake he had made in forbidding cornelia to tell him what she had kept from him merely because he knew that she wished to keep it he ought to have been strong enough for both and he had joined his weakness to hers from a fantastic impulse of generosity now he perceived that the truth slighted and postponed must right itself at the cost of the love which it should have been part of he began to be tormented with a curiosity to know what he could not ask or let her suspect that he even wished to know whether he was with her or away from her he always had that in his mind and in the small nether ache inappeasable and incessant he paid the penalty of his romantic folly he had to bear it and to hide it yet they both seemed flawlessly happy to others and in a sort they seemed so to themselves they waited for the chance that should make them really so  cornelia kept on at her work all the more devotedly because she was now going home so soon and because she knew herself divided from it by an interest which made art seem slight and poor when she felt secure in her happiness and made it seem nothing when her heart misgave her she never could devolve upon that if love failed her art could only be a part of her love henceforward she could go home and help her mother with her work till she died if love failed her but she could never draw another line  there was going to be an exhibition of synthesis work at the close of the synthesis year and there was to be a masquerade dance in the presence of the pictures charmian was the heart and soul of the masquerade and she pushed its claims to the disadvantage of the exhibition some of the young ladies who thought that art should have the first place went about saying that she was for the dance because she could waltz and mask better than she could draw and would rather exhibit herself than her work but it was a shame that she should make miss saunders work for her the way she did because miss saunders though she was so overrated was really learning something thanks to the synthesis atmosphere and charmian maybough would never learn anything it was all very well for her to pretend that she scorned to send anything to a school exhibition but she was at least not such a simpleton as to risk offering anything for it would not be accepted that they said was the real secret of her devotion to the masquerade and of her theory that the spirit of the synthesis could be expressed as well in making that beautiful as in the exhibition charmian had cornelia come and stay with her the whole week before the great event and she spent it in a tumult of joyful excitement divided between the tremendous interests of ludlows coming every night to see cornelia and of having them both advise with her about her costume ludlow was invited to the dance and he was to be there so as to drive home with her and cornelia  in the mean time charmians harshest critics were not going to be outdone if they could help it in any way they not only contributed to the exhibition but four or five days beforehand they began to stay away from the synthesis and get up their costumes for the masquerade everything was to be very simple and you could come in costume or not as you pleased but the consensus was that people were coming in costume and you would not want to look odd  the hall for the dancing was created by taking down the board partitions that separated three of the classrooms and hanging the walls with cheesecloth to hide the old stains and paintmarks and with pictures by the instructors there was a piano for the music and around the wall rough benches were put with rugs over them to save the ladies dresses the effect was very pretty with palettes on nails high up and tall flowers in vases on brackets and a lifestudy in plaster by one of the girls in a corner of the room it all had the charm of tasteful design yielding here and there to happy caprice this mingling of the ordered and the bizarre expressed the spirit at once free and submissive of the place there had been a great deal of trouble which at times seemed out of all keeping with the end to be gained but when it was all over the trouble seemed nothing the exhibition was the best the synthesis had ever made and those who had been left out of it were not the least of those in the masquerade they were by no means the worst dressed or when they unmasked the plainest and charmians favorite maxim that art was all one was verified in the costumes of several girls who could not draw any better than she could if they were not on the walls in one way neither were they in another after they had wandered heartsick through the different rooms and found their sketches nowhere they had their compensation when the dancing began  the floor was filled early and the scene gathered gayety and brilliancy it had the charm that the taste of the school could give in the artistic effects and its spirit of generous comradery found play in the praises they gave each others costumes and each others looks when they were not in costume it was a question whether cornelia who came as herself was lovelier than charmian who was easily recognizable as cleopatra with ophidian accessories in her dress that suggested at once the serpent of old nile and a moqui snakedancer cornelia looked more beautiful than ever her engagement with ludlow had come out and she moved in the halo of poetic interest which betrothal gives a girl with all other girls it was thought an inspiration that she should not have come in costume but in her own character ludlows fitness to carry off such a prize was disputed he was one of the heroes of the synthesis and much was conceded to him because he had more than once replaced the instructor in stilllife there but there remained a misgiving with some whether cornelia was right in giving up her art for him whether she were not recreant to the synthesis in doing that the doubt freshly raised by her beauty was not appeased till charmian met it with the assertion that cornelia was not going to give up her art at all but after her marriage was coming back to study and paint with ludlow  charmian bore her honors graciously both as the friend of the new fiancée and as the most successful mask of the evening in her pride and joy she set the example of looking out for girls who were not having a good time and helping them to have one with the men of her own too constant following and with those who stood about wanting the wish or the courage to attach themselves to any one in the excitement she did not miss cornelia or notice whether ludlow had come yet when she did think of her it was to fancy that she was off somewhere with him and did not want to be looked up before the high moment when one of the instructors appeared and chose a partner fur the virginia reel charmian had fused all the faltering and reluctant temperaments in the warmth of her amiability nobody ever denied her good nature in fact whatever else they denied her and there were none who begrudged her its reward at last she was last on the floor when the orchestra having played as long as it had bargained to refused to play any longer and the dance came to an end she then realized that it was after twelve and she remembered cornelia she rushed down into the dressingroom and found her sitting there alone bonneted and wrapped for the street there was something suddenly strange and fateful about it all to charmian  cornelia she entreated what is the matter what has become of mr ludlow hasnt he been here tonight  cornelia shook her head and made a hoarse murmur in her throat as if she wished to speak and could not there seemed to be some sort of weight upon her so that she could not rise but charmian swiftly made her own changes of toilet necessary for the street and got cornelia out of doors and into her coupé which was waiting for them before the others descended from the dancingroom where the men staid to help the janitor put out the lights as the carriage whirled them away they could hear the gay cries and laughter of the first of the revellers who came out into the night after them     xxxvi   the solemn manservant who was now also sleepy but who saved the respect due the young ladies by putting his hand over a yawn when he let them in brought cornelia a letter which he seemed to have been keeping on his professional salver a letter for you miss it came about an hour after you went out the messenger said he wasnt to wait for an answer and mrs maybough thought she neednt send it to you at the synthesis she wanted me to tell you miss  oh it is all right thank you said cornelia with a tremor which she could not repress at the sight of ludlows handwriting  charmian put her arm round her come into the studio dear you can answer it there if you want to at once  well said cornelia passively  charmian found her sitting with the letter in her lap as if she had not moved from her posture while she had been away exchanging her ptolemaic travesty for the ease of a long silken morning gown of nile green she came back buttoning it at her throat when she gave a start of high tragic satisfaction at something stonily rigid in cornelias attitude but she kept to herself both her satisfaction and the poignant sympathy she felt at the same time and sank noiselessly into a chair by the fireless hearth  after a moment cornelia stirred and asked do you want to see it charmian  do you want me to charmian asked back with her heart in her throat lest the question should make cornelia change her mind  there were two lines from ludlow unsigned i have received the enclosed letter which i think you should see before i see you again his note enclosed a letter from dickerson to ludlow which ran      although you are a stranger to me i feel an old friends interest     in your engagement to miss cornelia saunders of which i have just     been informed i can fully endorse your good taste was once     engaged to the young lady myself some years since and have been in     correspondence with her up to a very recent date would call and     offer my well wishes in person but am unexpectedly called away on     business presume miss saunders has told you of our little affair     so will not enlarge upon the facts please give her my best     regards and congratulations      yours respectly      j b dickerson  charmian let the papers fall to her lap and looked at cornelia who stared blankly helplessly back at her what a hateful spiteful little cad she began and she enlarged at length upon mr dickersons character and behavior she arrested herself in this pleasure and said but i dont understand why mr ludlow should have staid away this evening on account of his letter or why he should have sent it to you if he knew about it already it seems to me  he didnt know about it said cornelia i havent told him yet  why cornelia  the reproachful superiority in charmians tone was bitter to cornelia but she did not even attempt to resent it she said meekly i did try to tell him i wanted to tell him the very first thing but he wouldnt let me then and theni couldnt  charmians superiority melted into sympathy of course she said  and now i never can tell him cornelia desperately concluded  never charmian assented the gleam of commonsense which had visited her for an instant was lost in the limelight of romance which her fancy cast upon the situation and what are you going to do she asked enraptured by its hopeless gloom  nothing what can i do  no you can do nothing she started as with a sudden inspiration why look here cornelia why wouldnt this do  she stopped so long that cornelia asked somewhat crossly well  i dont know whether id better tell you but i know it would be the very thing do you want me to tell you  oh it makes no difference said cornelia hopelessly  charmian went on tentatively why its this ive often heard of such things me to pretend that i wrote this horrid dickerson letter and there isnt any such person but i did it just for a joke or wanted to break off the engagement because i couldnt bear to give you up dont you see its like lots of things on the stage and ive read of them id be perfectly willing to sacrifice myself in such a cause and i should have to for after i said i had done such a thing as that he would never let you speak to me again or look at me even but i should die happy she stopped frozen to silence by the scornful rejection in cornelias look oh no no it wouldnt do i see it wouldnt dont speak but theres nothing else left that i know of she added by another inspiration or yes nownowwe can live for each other cornelia you will outlive this you will be terribly changed of course and perhaps your health may be affected but i shall always be with you from this on i have loved you more truly than he ever did if he can throw you over for a little thing like that if i were a man i should exult to ignore such a thing oh if men could only be what girls would be if they were men but now you must begin to forget him from this instantto put him out of your mindyour life  to further this end charmian talked of ludlow for a long time and entered upon a close examination of his good and bad qualities his probable motives for now behaving as he was doing and the influence of the present tragedy upon his future as a painter it would either destroy him or it would be the fire out of which he would rise a master he would degenerate into a heartless worldling which he might very well do for he was fond of society or he might become a gloomy recluse and produce pictures which the multitude would never know were painted with tears and blood of course i dont mean literally the idea is rather disgusting but you know what i mean cornelia he may commit suicide like that french painter robert but he doesnt seem one of that kind exactly hes much more likely to abandon art and become an artcritic yes it may make an artcritic of him  cornelia sat in a heavy muse hearing and not hearing what she said charmian bustled about and made a fire of lightwood and then kindled her spirit lamp and made tea which she brought to cornelia we may as well take it she said we shall not sleep tonight anyway what a strange ending to our happy evening its perfectly hawthornesque dont you think its like the marble faun somehow i believe you will rise to a higher life through this trouble cornelia just as donatello did through his crime i can arrange it with mamma to be with you and if i cant i shall just simply abandon her and we will take a little flat like two newspaper girls that i heard of and live together we will get one downtown on the east side  cornelia look the tea and drank it but she could not speak it would have been easier to bear if she had only had herself alone to blame but mixed with her shame and with her pity for him was a sense of his want of wisdom in refusing to let her speak at once when she wanted to tell him all about dickerson that was her instinct she had been right and he wrong she might be to blame for everything since but he was to blame then and for that now it was all wrong and past undoing she tried in the reveries running along with what she was hearing of charmians talk every way of undoing it that she could imagine she wrote to ludlow she sent for him she went to him but it was all impossible she did not wish to undo the wrong that she might have back her dream of happiness again she had been willing to be less than true and she could wish him to know that she hated herself for that  it went on and on in her brain there was no end to it no way to undo the snarl that life had tangled itself up into she looked at the clock on the mantel and saw that it was three oclock why dont you go to bed she asked charmian  i shall not go to bed i shall never go to bed said charmian darkly she added if youll come with me i will  i cant said cornelia with a sort of dry anguish she rose from where she had been sitting motionless so long let me lie down on that couch of yours there im tired to death  she went toward the alcove curtained off from the studio and charmian put her arm round her to stay her and help  dont i can get along perfectly well  i will lie down here with you said charmian you wont mind  no i shall like to have you  cornelia shivered as she sat down on the edge of this divan and charmian ran back to put another stick of lightwood on the fire and turn the gas down to a blue flame she pulled down rugs and draperies and dragged them toward the alcove for covering oh how different it is from the way i always supposed it would be when i expected to sleep here she sank her voice to a ghostly whisper and yawned now you go to sleep cornelia but if you want anything i shall be watching here beside you and you must ask me would you like anything now an olive or acracker  nothing said cornelia tumbling wearily upon the couch  charmian surveyed her white drawn face with profound appreciation then she stretched herself at her side and in a little while cornelia knew by her long regular breathing that she had found relief from the stress of sympathy in sleep     xxxvii   the cold northlight of the studio showed that it was broad day when a tap at the door roused cornelia from a thin drowse she had fallen into at dawn she stirred and charmian threw herself from the couch to her feet dont moveill get itlet me she tossed back the black mane that fell over her eyes and stared about her whatwhat is it have i been asleep oh i never can forgive myself  the tapping at the door began again and she ran to open it the inexorable housemaid was there she said that mrs maybough was frightened at her not finding either of the young ladies in their rooms and had sent her to see if they were in the studio  yes tell her we are please we fell asleep on the couch please and norah we want our breakfast here we are verybusy and we cant be disturbed  she twisted her hair into a loose knot and cowered over the hearth where she kindled some pieces of lightwood and then sat huddled before it watching the murky roll of its flames till the maid came back with the tray charmian wished to bring cornelia a cup of coffee where she still lay so crushed with the despair that had rolled back upon her with the first consciousness that she thought she never could rise again but as the aroma of the coffee that charmian poured out stole to her she found strength to lift herself on her elbow and say no i will take it there with you  the maid had put the tray on the low table where charmian usually served tea but in spite of all the poignant associations of this piece of furniture with happier times the two girls ate hungrily of the omelette and the vienna rolls and by the time the maid had put the studio in order and beaten up the cushions of the couch into their formal shape they had cleared the tray and she took it away with her quite empty even in the house of mourning and perhaps there more than elsewhere the cravings of the animal which hungers and thirsts on whatever happens satisfy themselves while the spirit faints and despairs  perhaps if cornelia had thought of it she would not have chosen to starve to no visible end but she did not think and she ate ravenously as long as there was anything left and when she had eaten she felt so much stronger in heart and clearer in mind that after the maid had gone she began charmian i am going home at once and you mustnt try to stop me i mean to mrs montgomerys i want to write to mr ludlow i shall tell him it is all true  cornelia  yes what else could i tell him  oh you must but must you write it  yes i never can see him again and i wont let him think that i want to or to have him forgive me he was to blame but i was the most for he might have thought it was just some little thing and i knew what it was and that it was something he ought to know at once he will always believe now that it was worse than it is if anything can be worse i shall tell him that after i had seen mr dickerson again and knew just what aa dreadful thing he was i tolerated him and lured him on  you didnt lure him on and i wont let you say such a thing cornelia saunders charmian protested you always did profess to have sense and that isnt sense  i never had any sense said cornelia i can see that now i have been a perfect fool from the beginning  you may have been a fool said charmian judicially but you have not been false and i am not going to let you say so if you dont promise not to i will tell mr ludlow myself that you were always perfectly true and you couldnt help being true any more than aa broomstick or anything else that is perpendicular now will you promise  i will tell him just how everything was and he can judge but what difference its all over and i wouldnt help it if i could  yes i know that said charmian but thats all the more reason why you shouldnt go and say more than there is he cant think even if youre just to yourself that you want towheedle  wheedle cried cornelia  well not wheedle exactly but what would be wheedling in some other girlin me said charmian offering herself up will you let me see the letter before you send it i do believe ive got more sense than you have about such things this minute  you wouldnt have any to brag of even then said cornelia with gloomy meekness and unconscious sarcasm yes i will let you see the letter  well then you neednt go home to write it you can write in your room here i want to see that letter and i shant let it go if theres the least thing wrong in it she jumped up gayly as if this were the happiest possible solution of the whole difficulty and began to push cornelia out of the room now go and after youve put yourself in shape and got your hair done youll have some selfrespect i suppose you wont begin to write till youre all as spick and span as if you were going to receive a call from him im such a slouch that i should just sit down and write looking every whichwaybut i know you cant  she came back to the studio an hour later and waited impatiently for cornelias appearance she was so long coming that charmian opened the door to go and ask her some question so as to get her to say that she would be with her in a moment even if she didnt come and almost ran against the manservant who was bringing her a card she gave a little nervous shriek and caught it from his salver  for miss saunders miss he said in respectful deprecation of her precipitate behavior  yes yes its all right say that sheis in the studio charmian spoke in thick gasps the card was ludlows and between the mans going and ludlows coming she experienced a succession of sensations which were perhaps the most heroically perfect of any in a career so much devoted to the emotions she did not stop to inquire what she should do after she got ludlow there or to ask herself what he was coming for a little after nine oclock in the morning she simply waited his approach in an abandon which exhausted the capabilities of the situation and left her rather limp and languid when he did appear if it had been her own affair she could not have entered into it with more zeal more impassioned interest so far as she reasoned her action at all it was intended to keep ludlow after she got him there till cornelia should come for she argued that if she should go for her cornelia would suspect something and she would not come at all     xxxviii   when ludlow found charmian and not cornelia waiting for him he managed to get through the formalities of greeting decently but he had an intensity which he had the effect of not allowing to relax he sat down with visible selfconstraint when charmian invited him to do so  miss saunders has just gone to her room shell be back in a moment she added with wild joy in a fact which veiled the truth she is writing a note  oh said ludlow and he was so clearly able not to say anything more that charmian instantly soared over him in smooth selfpossession we were so sorry not to see you last night mr ludlow it was a perfect success except your not coming of course  thank you said ludlow i wasi couldnt comeat the last moment  yes i understood you intended to come i do wish you could have seen miss saunders i dont believe she ever looked lovelier i wanted her to go in costume you know but she wouldnt and in fact when i saw her i saw that she neednt she doesnt have to eke herself out as some people do  ludlow was aware of the opening for a civil speech but he was quite helpless to use it he stared blankly at charmian who went on  and then cornelia is so perfectly truthful you know so sincere that any sort of disguise would have been out of character with her and im glad she went simply as herself we were up so late talking that we slept till i dont know when this morning i forgot to wind my clock i suppose its very late  no said ludlow its so very early that i ought to apologize for coming i suppose but i wished to see miss saunders he stopped feeling that he had given too rude a hint  charmian did not take it amiss oh cornelia is usually up at all sorts of unnatural hours of the day i expected when she came here to spend the week with me we should have some fun sitting up and talking but last night is the only time we have had a real good talk and i suppose that was because we were so excited that even cornelia couldnt go to sleep at once i do wish you could have seen some of the costumes mr ludlow  ludlow began to wonder whether cornelia had got his letter or whether if she had got it she had kept the matter so carefully from charmian that she had not suspected anything was wrong or what was more likely had not cornelia cared was she glad to be released and had she joyfully hailed his letter and its enclosure as a means of escape his brain reeled with these doubts which were the next moment relieved with the crazy hope that if his letter had not yet been delivered he might recover it and present the affair in the shape he had now come to give it he believed that charmian must have some motive for what she was doing and saying beyond the hospitable purpose of amusing him till cornelia should appear we always think that other people have distinct motives but for the most part in our intercourse with one another we are really as superficially intentioned when we are intentioned at all as charmian was in wishing to get what sensation she could out of the dramatic situation by hovering darkly over it and playing perilously about its circumference she divined that he was not there to deepen its tragical tendency at least and she continued without well knowing what she was going to say next yes i think that the real reason why cornelia wouldnt go in costume was that she felt that it was a kind of subterfuge she keeps me in a perfect twitter of selfreproach i tell her i would rather have the conscience of the worst kind of person than hers i could get along with it a great deal easier dont you think you could mr ludlow  yes yes said ludlow aimlessly he rose up and pretended a curiosity about a sketch on the wall he could not endure to sit still  wont you have a cup of tea asked charmian cornelia and i had some last night and  no thank you said ludlow  do let me ring for some coffee then  no i have just breakfastedthat is i have breakfasted  why were you up early too said charmian with what seemed to ludlow a supernatural shrewdness its perfectly telepathic the psychical research ought to have it it would be such fun if we could get together and compare our reasons for waking so early but cornelia and i didnt know just when we did wake and i suppose the psychical research wouldnt care for it without she seems to be writing a pretty long note or a pretty hard one ludlow lifted his downcast eyes and gave her a look that was ghastly did you look at your watch she asked  look at my watch he returned in a daze  when you woke that is  oh he groaned  because  charmian suddenly stopped and ran to the door which cornelia opened before she could reach it  cornelia gave her a letter see if this will do she said spiritlessly and charmian caught it from her hand  yes yes ill read it she said as she slipped out of the door and shut cornelia in  cornelia saw ludlow and made an instinctive movement of flight  for pitys sake dont go he implored  i didnt know you were here she said the same dejection in her tone  no they told me you were here but let me stay long enough to tell you that abominable letteryou ought never to have known that it existed i dont expect you to forgive me i dont ask you but i am so ashamed and i would do anything if i could recallundocornelia isnt there any way of atoning for it come i dont believe a word of that scoundrels i dont know what his motive was and i dont care let it all be as if nothing of the kind had ever happened dearest dont speak of it and i never will  cornelia was tempted she could see how he had wrought himself up to this pitch and she believed that he would keep his word we believe such miracles of those we love before life has taught us that love cannot make nature err against itself in his absence the duty she had to do was hard in his presence it seemed impossible now when he asked her not to do it she had not expected ever to see him again or to be tried in this way she had just written it all to him but she must speak it now she had been weak and had brought on herself the worst she had to tell and should she be false even though he wished it and not tell  she forced the words out in a voice that hardly seemed her own at first  no we made a mistake you did and i did too there was somethingsomethingi wanted to tell you at first but you wouldnt let me and i was glad you wouldnt but it was all wrong and now i have got to tell you when everything is over and it can never do any good she gave a dry sob and cast upon him a look of keen reproach which he knew he deserved i was engaged to him once or she added as if she could not bear to see him blench he could think so it was the year after you were in pymantoning  she went on and told him everything she did not spare herself any fact that she thought he ought to know and as she detailed the squalid history it seemed to her far worse than it had ever been in her own thoughts of it  he listened patiently and at the end he asked is that all  all  yes i wanted to know just how much you have to forgive me she looked at him stupefied yes i ought to have let you tell me all this before when you wanted to at first but i have been a romantic fool and i have made you suffer for my folly i have left you to think all the time that i might care for this that i might not know that you were yourself through it all or that i could care for you any the less because of it when it only makes you dearer to me  no she said for all protest and he understood  oh i dont mean that you were always right in it or always wise but i can truly say it makes no difference with me except to make you dearer if i had always had more sense than i had you would not have to blame yourself for the only wrong or unwise thing you have done and i am really to blame for that  she knew that he meant her having taken refuge from his apparent indifference in dickerson when she fell below her ideal of herself this was what she had thought at the time it was the thought with which she had justified herself then and she could not deny it now she loved him for taking her blame away and she said to strengthen herself for her doom well it is all over  no he said why is it over dont be worse than i was let us be reasonable about it why shouldnt we talk of it as if we were other people do you mean it is all over because you think i must be troubled by what youve told me or because you cant forgive me for not letting you tell me before  you know which she said  well then what should you think of some other man if he could care for such a thing when some other girl had told it him of herself you would think him very unjust and  but it isnt some other man it isnt some other girl  no im glad it isnt but cant we reason about it as if it were  no we cant it would bewicked  it would be wicked not to do you think you ought to break our engagement because i didnt let you tell me this at first  cornelia could not say that she did she could hardly say i dont know  ludlow assumed that she had said more then if you dont think you ought to do it for that do you think you ought to do it for nothing  for nothing cornelia asked herself was there really nothing else then she stood looking at him as if she were asking him that aloud he was not so far off as when they began to talk just after they had risen and now he suddenly came much nearer still  are you going to drive me from you because i dont care for all this  you ought to care she persisted  but if i dont if i cant then what is the reason you wont let it all be as if nothing had happened ah i see you cant forgive me for sending you his letter well i deserve to be punished for that  no i should have despised you if you hadnt  well  she was silent looking at the floor he put his arm round her and pushed her head down on his shoulder oh how silly she said with lips muted against his own     xxxix   cornelia and ludlow were married at pymantoning in the latter part of june and he spent the summer there working at a picture which he was going to exhibit in the fall at the same time he worked at a good many other pictures and he helped cornelia with the things she was trying he painted passages and incidents in her pictures sometimes illustratively and sometimes for the pleasure of having their lives blended in their work and he tried to see how nearly he could lose his work in hers he pretended that he learned more than he taught in the process and that he felt in her efforts a determining force a clear sense of what she wanted to do that gave positive form and direction to what was vague and speculative in himself he was strenuous that she should not in the slightest degree lapse from her ideal and purpose or should cease to be an artist in becoming a wife he contended that there was no real need of that and though it had happened in most of the many cases where artists had married artists he held that it had happened through the mans selfishness and thoughtlessness and not through the conditions he was resolved that cornelia should not lose faith in herself from want of his appreciation or from her own overvaluation of his greater skill and school and he could prove to any one who listened that she had the rarer gift he did not persuade her with all his reasons but her mother faithfully believed him it had never seemed surprising to her that cornelia should win a man like ludlow she saw no reason why cornelia should not and she could readily accept the notion of cornelias superiority when he advanced it she was not arrogant about it she was simply and entirely satisfied and she was every moment so content with cornelias husband that cornelia herself had to be a little critical of him in selfdefence she called him a dreamer and theorist she ran him down to the burtons and said he would never come to anything because artists who talked well never painted so well she allowed that he talked divinely and it would not have been safe for mrs burton to agree with her otherwise but mrs burton was far too wise a woman to do so she did not perhaps ride so high a horse as mrs saunders in her praises of ludlow but it would have been as impossible to unseat her she regarded herself as somehow the architect of cornelias happiness in having discovered ludlow and believed in him long before cornelia met him and she could easily see that if he had not come out to visit burton that first time they would never have met at all mrs saunders could joyfully admit this without in the least relinquishing her own belief so inarticulate that it was merely part of her personal consciousness that this happiness was of as remote an origin as the foundations of the world she could see now that nothing else could have been intended from the beginning but she did not fail at the same time to credit herself with forethought and wisdom in bracing cornelia against the overtures of dickerson when he reappeared in her life burton of course advanced no claim to recognition in the affair he enjoyed every moment of ludlows stay in pymantoning and gave his work a great deal of humorous attention and gratuitous criticism especially the picture he was chiefly engaged upon this when it was shown at the county fair where ludlow chose to enter it before he took it back to now york with him in the fall did not keep the crowd away from the trottingmatches and it did not take either the first or the second premium in fact if the critics of the metropolis were right in their judgment of it when it appeared later in the academy it did not deserve either of them they said that it was an offence to those who had hoped better things of the painter as time went on with him and who would now find themselves snubbed by this return to his worst manner here they said was his palette again with a tacit invitation to the public to make what it liked of the colors as children did with the embers on the hearth or the frost on the window you paid your money and you took your choice as to what mr ludlow meant by this extraordinary performance if he really meant anything at all  as far as it could be made out with the naked eye it represented a clump of hollyhocks with a slim shadowy and uncertain young girl among them and the painter had apparently wished to suggest a family resemblance among them all to this end he had emphasized some facts of the girls dress accessories to his purpose the petaledged ruffle of her crimson silk waist the flowerlike flare of her red hat and its finials of knotted ribbon and in the hollyhocks he had recognized a girlishness of bearing which he evidently hoped would appeal to a fantastic sympathy in the spectator the piece was called hollyhocks it might equally well be called girls though when you had called it one or the other it would be hard to say just what you were to do about it especially with the impression curiously left by the picture that whether it was a group of girls or a clump of hollyhocks they were not in very good humor the moment chosen if one might judge from some suggestions of light was that just before the breaking of a thunderstorm the girl if it was a girl had flashed into sight round the corner of the house where the hollyhocks if they were hollyhocks were blowing outward in the first gust of the storm it could not be denied that there was something fine in the wild toss and pull of the flowers with the abandon of the storm in them this was the best thing in the piece it was probably intended to express a moment of electric passion but there was something so forced and at the same time so ineffectual in the execution of the feebly fantastic design that it became the duty of impartial criticism to advise mr ludlow if he must continue to paint at all to paint either girls or flowers but not both at once or both together or convertibly  ludlow did not mind these criticisms much being pretty well used to that kind of thing and feeling secure of his public in any event but cornelia was deeply vexed she knew that it must be evident to those who knew her and knew him that she was the girl and she was the hollyhocks and though the origin of the picture was forever hid in the memories of their first meeting she was aware of a measure of justice in the censure that condemned it for obscurity she had not wished him to show it but here as often elsewhere she found him helpless to yield to her even though he confessed that she was right he did not try to justify himself and he did not explain himself very clearly i dont know how it is about ones work exactly up to a certain point you are master over it and it seems to belong absolutely to you but beyond that it is its own master and does what it pleases with itself of course i could have kept from showing that picture and yeti must  well at least then you can keep from selling it said cornelia i want it give it to me  my dear i will buy it for you mrs maybough became the owner of the picture yesterday but i will offer her an advance on the price she paid  cornelia now thought she was really angry with him for the first time since their marriage she would not speak at once but when she did speak it was to say no let her keep it i know charmian made her buy it and i wouldnt like to take it from her she has so much imagination that maybe she can see some meaning in it and it will always be such a pleasure to her to explain it even if she cant  charmian made the ludlows a bohemian dinner as soon as the people whom she wanted got back to town she said it was a bohemian dinner and she asked artists mostly but of course she had the westleys and their friend mrs rangeley there were several of the synthesis girls who said the synthesis would never be itself again without cornelia and there were some of the students nice fellows whom charmian had liked there were of course the wetmores ludlows picture was in evidence in a place of honor especially created for it and wetmore said when they sat down at dinner well ludlow all this company can tell where you got your hollyhocks cornelia turned the color of the reddest in the picture and wetmore recognized her consciousness with the added remark oh youll be in all his imaginative pictures now mrs ludlow thats the fate of the wife of an imaginative painter but you really must get him to keep you out of his portraits  charmian checked herself in a wild laugh and sent cornelia a look of fond and proud intelligence which mrs rangeley tapped as it were on its way up the length of the table o mrs ludlow she entreated what is it i hope it isnt professional envy is he afraid of mr ludlow becoming too popular  ludlow answered for his wife mrs rangeley that was worthy even of you and he boldly kissed his hand to her  the dinner was remembered for several weeks as one of the pleasantest people had ever been at and it established mrs maybough in such social acceptance that she was asked to the first of the westley dinners where swells prevailed and where she was as null as any of them but although charmian was apparently radiant the whole evening and would hardly let cornelia go away at the end she wanted her to stay so and talk it over she had a girls perverseness in not admitting the perfection of the occasion to mrs maybough when she said well my dear i hope your dinner was bohemian enough for you  bohemian she retorted it wasnt bohemian at all you oughtnt to have taken the ladies away at coffee they ought to have stayed and had cigarettes with the gentlemen  my dear you know that the mere smell of tobacco makes you sick  no matter i shouldif i could only have seen cornelia ludlow smokingi should have been willing to die and nownow im afraid shes going to be perfectly respectable                                                   harpers magazine  1850   one
