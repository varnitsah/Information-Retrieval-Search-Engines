in paris and a hasty removal thence by her father during the revolution of 48 of later travels as a little maiden by diligence to pau and the then undiscovered pyrenees to a montpellier and a nice as yet unspoiled unto her seventyeighth year her french accent had remained unruffled her soul in love with french gloves and dresses and her face had the pale unwrinkled slightly aquiline perfection of the french marquise typeit may perhaps be doubted whether any french marquise ever looked the part so perfectly  how it came about that she had settled down in a southern french town in the summer of 1914 only her roving spirit knew she had been a widow ten years which she had passed in the quest of perfection all her life she had been haunted by that instinct halfsmothered in ministering to her husband children and establishments in london and the country now in loneliness the intrinsic independence of her soul was able to assert itself and from hotel to hotel she had wandered in england wales switzerland france till now she had found what seemingly arrested her was it the age of that oldest of western cities that little mother of western civilisation which captured her fancy or did a curious perversity turn her from more obvious abodes or was she kept there by the charm of a certain church which she would enter every day to steep herself in mellow darkness the scent of incense the drone of incantations and quiet communion with a god higher indeed than she had been brought up to highchurch though she had always been she had a pretty little apartment where for very littlethe bulk of her small wealth was habitually at the service of othersshe could manage with one maid and no fuss she had some nice french friends there too but more probably it was simply the war which kept her there waiting like so many other people for it to be over before it seemed worth while to move and reestablish herself the immensity and wickedness of this strange event held her as it were suspended body and spirit high up on the hill which had seen the ancient peoples the romans gauls saracens and all and still looked out towards the flat camargue here in her three rooms with a little kitchen the maid augustine a parrot and the paris daily mail she dwelt as it were marooned by a world event which seemed to stun her not that she worried exactly the notion of defeat or of real danger to her country and to france never entered her head she only grieved quietly over the dreadful things that were being done and every now and then would glow with admiration at the beautiful way the king and queen were behaving it was no good to fuss and one must make the best of things just as the dear little queen was doing for each queen in turn and she had seen three reign in her time was always that to her her ancestors had been uprooted from their lands their house burned and her pedigree diverted in the stuart warsa reverence for royalty was fastened in her blood  quite early in the business she had begun to knit moving her slim fingers not too fast gazing at the grey wool through glasses specially rimless and invisible perched on the bridge of her firm wellshaped nose and now and then speaking to her parrot the bird could say scratch a poll poll already and hullo those keys to the english language the maid augustine having completed some small duty would often come and stand her head on one side gazing down with a sort of inquiring compassion in her wise young clearbrown eyes it seemed to her who was straight and sturdy as a young tree both wonderful and sad that madame should be seventyseven and so frailmadame who had no lines in her face and such beautiful grey hair who had so strong a willpower too and knitted such soft comforters pour nos braves chers poilus and suddenly she would say madame nest pas fatiguée and madame would answer no speak english augustinepolly will pick up your french come here and reaching up a pale hand she would set straight a stray fluff of the girls darkbrown hair or improve the set of her fichu  those two got on extremely well for though madame wasoh but very particular she was always très gentille et toujours grande dame and that love of form so deep in the french soul promoted the girls admiration for one whom she could see would in no circumstances lose her dignity besides madame was full of dainty household devices and could not bear waste and these though exacting were qualities which appealed to augustine with her french passion for the family she used to wonder how in days like these madame could endure to be far away from her son and daughter and the grandchildren whose photographs hung on the walls and the long letters her mistress was always writing in a beautiful fine hand beginning my darling sybil my darling reggie and ending always your devoted mother seemed to a warm and simple heart but meagre substitutes for fleshandblood realities but as madame would inform herthey were too busy doing things for the dear soldiers and working for the war they could not come to herthat would never do and to go to them would give so much trouble when the railways were so wanted for the troops and she had their lovely letters which she keptas augustine observedevery one in a lavenderscented sachet and frequently took out to read another point of sympathy between those two was their passion for military music and seeing soldiers pass augustines brother and father were at the front and madames dead brother had been a soldier in the crimean warlong before you were born augustine when the french and english fought the russians i was in france then too a little girl and we lived at nice it was so lovely you cant thinkthe flowers and my poor brother was so cold in the siege of sebastopol somehow that time and that war were more real to her than this  in december when the hospitals were already full her french friends first took her to the one which they attended she went in her face very calm with that curious inward composure which never deserted it carrying in front of her with both hands a black silk bag wherein she had concealed an astonishing collection of treasures for the poor men a bottle of acidulated drops packets of cigarettes two of her own mufflers a pocket set of drafts some english riddles translated by herself into french very curious some ancient copies of an illustrated paper boxes of chocolate a ball of string to make cats cradles such an amusing game her own packs of patience cards some photograph frames postcards of arles andmost singulara kettleholder at the head of each bed she would sit down and rummage in the bag speaking in her slow but quite good french to explain the use of the acidulated drops or to give a lesson in cats cradles and the poilus would listen with their polite ironic patience and be left smiling and curiously fascinated as if they had been visited by a creature from another world she would move on to other beds quite unconscious of the effect she had produced on them and of their remarks cette vieille dame comme elle est bonne or espèce dange aux cheveux gris lange anglaise aux cheveux gris became in fact her name within those walls and the habit of filling that black silk bag and going there to distribute its contents soon grew to be with her a ruling passion which neither weather nor her own aches and pains not inconsiderable must interfere with the things she brought became more marvellous every week but however much she carried coals to newcastle or tobacco pouches to those who did not smoke or homoeopathic globules to such as crunched up the whole bottleful for the sake of the sugar as soon as her back was turned no one ever smiled now with anything but real pleasure at sight of her calm and truly sweet smile and the scent of soap on her pale hands cher fils je croyais que ceci vous donnerait un peu de plaisir voyezvous comme cest commode nest ce pas each newcomer to the wards was warned by his comrades that the english angel with the grey hair was to be taken without a smile exactly as if she were his grandmother  in the walk to the hospital augustine would accompany her carrying the bag and perhaps a large peasants umbrella to cover them both for the winter was hard and snowy and carriages cost money which must now be kept entirely for the almost daily replenishment of the bag and other calls of war the girl to her chagrin was always left in a safe place for it would never do to take her in and put fancies into her head and perhaps excite the dear soldiers with a view of anything so taking and when the visit was over they would set forth home walking very slowly in the high narrow streets augustine pouting a little and shooting swift glances at anything in uniform and madame making firm her lips against a fatigue which sometimes almost overcame her before she could get home and up the stairs and the parrot would greet them indiscreetly with new phraseskeep smiling and kiss augustine which he sometimes varied with kiss a poll poll or scratch augustine to madames regret tea would revive her somewhat and then she would knit for as time went on and the war seemed to get farther and farther from that end which in common with so many she had expected before now it seemed dreadful not to be always doing something to help the poor dear soldiers and for dinner to augustines horror she now had nothing but a little soup or an egg beaten up with milk and brandy it saved such a lot of time and expenseshe was sure people ate too much and afterwards she would read the daily mail often putting it down to sigh and press her lips together and think one must look on the bright side of things and wonder a little where it was and augustine finishing her work in the tiny kitchen would sigh too and think of red trousers and peaked caps not yet out of date in that southern region and of her own heart saying kiss augustine and she would peer out between the shutters at the stars sparkling over the camargue or look down where the ground fell away beyond an old old wall and nobody walked in the winter night and muse on her nineteenth birthday coming and sigh with the thought that she would be old before any one had loved her and of how madame was looking très fatiguée  indeed madame was not merely looking très fatiguée in these days the worlds vitality and her own were at sad january ebb but to think of oneself was quite impossible of course it would be all right presently and one must not fuss or mention in ones letters to the dear children that one felt at all poorly as for a doctorthat would be sinful waste and besides what use were they except to tell you what you knew so she was terribly vexed when augustine found her in a faint one morning and she found augustine in tears with her hair all over her face she rated the girl soundly but feebly for making such a fuss over a little thing like that and with extremely trembling fingers pushed the brown hair back and told her to wash her face while the parrot said reflectively scratch a pollhullo the girl who had seen her own grandmother die not long before and remembered how fatiguée she had been during her last days was really frightened coming back after she had washed her face she found her mistress writing on a number of little envelopes the same words en bonne amitié she looked up at the girl standing so ominously idle and said  take this hundredfranc note augustine and go and get it changed into single francsthe ironmonger will do it if you say its for me i am going to take a rest i shant buy anything for the bag for a whole week i shall just take francs instead  oh madame you must not go out vous êtes trop fatiguée  nonsense how do you suppose our dear little queen in england would get on with all she has to do if she were to give in like that we must none of us give up in these days help me to put on my things i am going to church and then i shall take a long rest before we go to the hospital  oh madame must you go to church it is not your kind of church you do not pray there do you  of course i pray there i am very fond of the dear old church god is in every church augustine you ought to know that at your age  but madame has her own religion  now dont be silly what does that matter help me into my cloth coatnot the furits too heavyand then go and get that money changed  but madame should see a doctor if madame faints again i shall die with fright madame has no colourbut no colour at all it must be that there is something wrong  madame rose and taking the girls ear between thumb and finger pinched it gently  you are a very silly girl what would our poor soldiers do if all the nurses were like you  reaching the church she sat down gladly turning her face up towards her favourite picture a virgin standing with her baby in her arms it was only faintly coloured now but there were those who said that an arlésienne must have sat for it why it pleased her so she never quite knew unless it were by its cool unrestored devotion by the faint smiling in the eyes religion with her was a strange yet very real thing conscious that she was not clever she never even began to try and understand what she believed probably she believed nothing more than that if she tried to be good she would go to godwhatever and wherever god might besome day when she was too tired to live any more and rarely indeed did she forget to try to be good as she sat there she thought or perhaps prayed whichever it should be called let me forget that i have a body and remember all the poor soldiers who have them  it struck cold that morning in the churchthe wind was bitter from the northeast some poor women in black were kneeling and four candles burned in the gloom of a side aislethin steady little spires of gold there was no sound at all a smile came on her lips she was forgetting that she had a body and remembering all those young faces in the wards the faces too of her own children far away the faces of all she loved they were real and she was notshe was nothing but the devotion she felt for them yes for all the poor souls on land and sea fighting and working and dying her lips moved she was saying below her breath i love them all then feeling a shiver run down her spine she compressed those lips and closed her eyes letting her mind alone murmur her chosen prayer o god who makes the birds sing and the stars shine and gives us little children strengthen my heart so that i may forget my own aches and wants and think of those of other people  on reaching home again she took gelseminum her favourite remedy against that shivering which however hard she tried to forget her own body would keep coming then covering herself with her fur coat she lay down closing her eyes she was seemingly asleep so that augustine returning with the hundred single francs placed them noiselessly beside the little pile of envelopes and after looking at the white motionless face of her mistress and shaking her own bonny head withdrew when she had gone two tears came out of those closed eyes and clung on the pale cheeks below the seeming sleeper was thinking of her children away over there in england her children and their children almost unbearably she was longing for a sight of them not seen for so long now recalling each face each voice each different way they had of saying mother darling or granny look what ive got and thinking that if only the war would end how she would pack at once and go to them that is if they would not come to her for a nice long holiday in this beautiful place she thought of spring too and how lovely it would be to see the trees come out again and almond blossom against a blue sky the war seemed so long and winter too but she must not complain others had much greater sorrows than shethe poor widowed women kneeling in the church the poor boys freezing in the trenches god in his great mercy could not allow it to last much longer it would not be like him though she felt that it would be impossible to eat she meant to force herself to make a good lunch so as to be able to go down as usual and give her little presents they would miss them so if she didnt her eyes opening rested almost gloatingly on the piles of francs and envelopes and she began to think how she could reduce still further her personal expenditure it was so dreadful to spend anything on oneselfan old woman like her doctor indeed if augustine fussed any more she would send her away and do for herself and the parrot leaving his cage which he could always do perched just behind her and said hullo kiss me too  that afternoon in the wards every one noticed what a beautiful colour she had lange anglaise aux cheveux gris had never been more popular one poilu holding up his envelope remarked to his neighbour elle verse des gouttes dciel notr tite granmè to them grateful even for those mysterious joys cats cradles francs were the true drops from heaven  she had not meant to give them all today but it seemed dreadful when she saw how pleased they were to leave any out and so the whole ninetyseven had their franc each the three over would buy augustine a little brooch to make up to the silly child for her fright in the morning the buying of this brooch took a long time at the jewellers in the rue des romains and she had only just fixed on an amethyst before feeling deadly ill with a dreadful pain through her lungs she went out with her tiny package quickly not wanting any fuss and began to mount towards home there were only three hundred yards to go and with each step she said to herself nonsense what would the queen think of you remember the poor soldiers with only one leg you have got both your legs and the poor men who walk from the battlefield with bullets through the lungs what is your pain to theirs nonsense but the pain like none she had ever felta pain which seemed to have sharp double edges like a knifekept passing through and through her till her legs had no strength at all and seemed to move simply because her will said if you dont ill leave you behind so there she felt as if perspiration were flowing down yet her face was as dry as a dead leaf when she put up her hand to it her brain stammered seemed to fly loose came to sudden standstills her eyes searched painfully each greyshuttered window for her own house though she knew quite well that she had not reached it yet from sheer pain she stood still a wry little smile on her lips thinking how poor polly would say keep smiling then she moved on holding out her hand whether because she thought god would put his into it or only to pull on some imaginary rope to help her so foot by foot she crept till she reached her door a most peculiar floating sensation had come over her the pain ceased and as if she had passed through no doors mounted no stairsshe was up in her room lying on her sofa with strange images about her painfully conscious that she was not in proper control of her thoughts and that augustine must be thinking her ridiculous making a great effort she said  i forbid you to send for a doctor augustine i shall be all right in a day or two if i eat plenty of francs and you must put on this little broochi bought it for you from an angel in the street put my fur coat on pollyhes shivering dry your mouth theres a good girl tell my son he mustnt think of leaving the poor war office i shall come and see him after the war it will be over tomorrow and then we will all go and have tea together in a wood granny will come to you my darlings  and when the terrified girl had rushed out she thought there now shes gone to get god and i mustnt disturb him with all he has to see to i shall get up and do for myself when they came back with the doctor they found her halfdressed trying to feed a perch in the empty cage with a spoon and saying kiss granny polly god is coming kiss granny while the parrot sat away over on the mantelpiece with his head on one side deeply interested  when she had been properly undressed and made to lie down on the sofa for she insisted so that she would not go to bed that they dared not oppose her the doctor made his diagnosis it was double pneumonia of that sudden sort which declares for life or death in fortyeight hours at her age a desperate case her children must be wired to at once she had sunk back seemingly unconscious and augustine approaching the drawer where she knew the letters were kept slipped out the lavender sachet and gave it to the doctor when he had left the room to extract the addresses and send those telegrams the girl sat down by the foot of the couch leaning her elbows on her knees and her face on her hands staring at that motionless form while the tears streamed down her broad cheeks for many minutes neither of them stirred and the only sound was the restless stropping of the parrots beak against a wire of his cage then her mistresss lips moved and the girl bent forward a whispering came forth caught and suspended by breathless pausing  mind augustineno one is to tell my childreni cant have them disturbedover a little thinglike thisand in my purse youll find anotherhundredfranc note i shall want some more francs for the day after tomorrow be a good girl and dont fuss and kiss poor polly and mindi wont have a doctortaking him away from his work give me my gelseminum and my prayerbook and go to bed just as usualwe must allkeep smilinglike the dear soldiers the whispering ceased then began again at once in rapid delirious incoherence and the girl sat trembling covering now her ears from those uncanny sounds now her eyes from the flush and the twitching of that face usually so pale and still she could not followwith her little englishthe swerving intricate flights of that old spirit mazed by feverthe memories released the longings disclosed the halfuttered prayers the curious little halfconscious efforts to regain form and dignity she could only pray to the virgin when relieved by the daughter of madames french friend who spoke good english she murmured desperately oh mademoiselle madame est très fatiguéela pauvre têtefautil enlever les cheveux elle fait ça toujours pour ellemême for to the girl with her reverence for the fastidious dignity which never left her mistress it seemed sacrilege to divest her of her crown of fine grey hair yet when it was done and the old face crowned only by the thin white hair of nature that dignity was still there surmounting the wandering talk and the moaning from her parched lips which every now and then smiled and pouted in a kiss as if remembering the maxims of the parrot so the night passed with all that could be done for her whose most collected phrase frequently uttered in the doctors face was mind augustine i wont have a doctori can manage for myself quite well once for a few minutes her spirit seemed to recover its coherence and she was heard to whisper god has given me this so that i may know what the poor soldiers suffer oh theyve forgotten to cover pollys cage but high fever soon passes from the very old and early morning brought a deathlike exhaustion with utter silence save for the licking of the flames at the olivewood logs and the sound as they slipped or settled down calcined the firelight crept fantastically about the walls covered with tapestry of frenchgrey silk crept round the screenhead of the couch and betrayed the ivory pallor of that masklike face which covered now such tenuous threads of life augustine who had come on guard when the fever died away sat in the armchair before those flames trying hard to watch but dropping off into the healthy sleep of youth and out in the clear hard shivering southern cold the old clocks chimed the hours into the winter dark where remote from mans restless spirit the old town brooded above plain and river under the morning stars and the girl dreameddreamed of a sweetheart under the acacias by her home of his pinning their white flowers into her hair till she woke with a little laugh light was already coming through the shutter chinks the fire was but red embers and white ash she gathered it stealthily together put on fresh logs and stole over to the couch oh how white how still was her mistress dead the icy clutch of that thought jerked her hands up to her full breast and a cry mounted in her throat the eyes opened the white lips parted as if to smile a voice whispered now dont be silly the girls cry changed into a little sob and bending down she put her lips to the ringed hand that lay outside the quilt the hand moved faintly as if responding the voice whispered the emerald ring is for you augustine is it morning uncover pollys cage and open his door  madame spoke no more that morning a telegram had come her son and daughter would arrive next morning early they waited for a moment of consciousness to tell her but the day went by and in spite of oxygen and brandy it did not come she was sinking fast her only movements were a tiny compression now and then of the lips a halfopening of the eyes and once a smile when the parrot spoke the rally came at eight oclock mademoiselle was sitting by the couch when the voice came fairly strong give my love to my dear soldiers and take them their francs out of my purse please augustine take care of polly i want to see if the emerald ring fits you take it off please and when it had been put on the little finger of the sobbing girl there you see it does thats very nice your sweetheart will like that when you have one what do you say mademoiselle my son and daughter coming all that way the lips smiled a moment and then tears forced their way into her eyes my darlings how good of them oh what a cold journey theyll have get my room ready augustine with a good fire what are you crying for remember what polly says keep smiling think how bad it is for the poor soldiers if we women go crying the queen never cries and she has ever so much to make her  no one could tell whether she knew that she was dying except perhaps for those words take care of polly and the gift of the ring  she did not even seem anxious as to whether she would live to see her children her smile moved mademoiselle to whisper to augustine elle a la sourire divine  ah mademoiselle comme elle est brave la pauvre dame cest quelle pense toujours aux autres and the girls tears dropped on the emerald ring  night fellthe long night would she wake again both watched with her ready at the faintest movement to administer oxygen and brandy she was still breathing but very faintly when at six oclock they heard the express come in and presently the carriage stop before the house mademoiselle stole down to let them in  still in their travelling coats her son and daughter knelt down beside the couch watching in the dim candlelight for a sign and cherishing her cold hands daylight came they put the shutters back and blew out the candles augustine huddled in the far corner cried gently to herself mademoiselle had withdrawn but the two still knelt tears running down their cheeks the face of their mother was so transparent so exhausted the least little twitching of justopened lips showed that she breathed a tiny sigh escaped her eyelids fluttered the son leaning forward said  sweetheart were here  the eyes opened then something more than a simple human spirit seemed to look throughit gazed for a long long minute then the lips parted they bent to catch the sound  my darlingsdont cry smile and the eyes closed again on her face a smile so touching that it rent the heart flickered and went out breath had ceased to pass the faded lips  in the long silence the french girls helpless sobbing rose the parrot stirred uneasily in his stillcovered cage and the son and daughter knelt pressing their faces hard against the couch     ii  defeat   she had been standing there on the pavement a quarter of an hour or so after her shillings worth of concert women of her profession are not supposed to have redeeming points especially whenlike may belinski as she now preferred to dub herselfthey are german but this woman certainly had music in her soul she often gave herself these music baths when the promenade concerts were on and had just spent half her total wealth in listening to some mozart and a beethoven symphony  she was feeling almost elated full of divine sound and of the wonderful summer moonlight which was filling the whole dark town women of a certain type have at all events emotionsand what a comfort that is even to themselves to stand just there had become rather a habit of hers one could seem to be waiting for somebody coming out of the concert not yet overwhich of course was precisely what she was doing one need not forever be stealthily glancing and perpetually moving on in that peculiar way which while it satisfied the police and mrs grundy must not quite deceive others as to her business in life she had only been at it long enough to have acquired a nervous dread of almost everythingnot long enough to have passed through that dread to callousness some women take so much longer than others and even for a woman of a certain type her position was exceptionally nerveracking in wartime going as she did by a false name indeed in all england there could hardly be a greater pariah than was this german woman of the night  she idled outside a bookshop humming a little pretending to read the titles of the books by moonlight taking off and putting on one of her stained yellow gloves now and again she would move up as far as the posters outside the hall scrutinising them as if interested in the future then stroll back again in her worn and discreet dark dress and her small hat she had nothing about her to rouse suspicion unless it were the trail of violet powder she left on the moonlight  for the moonlight this evening was almost solid seeming with its cool still vibration to replace the very air in it the wartime precautions against light seemed fantastic like shading candles in a room still full of daylight what lights there were had the effect of strokes and stipples of dim colour laid by a painters brush on a background of ghostly whitish blue the dreamlike quality of the town was perhaps enhanced for her eyes by the veil she was wearingin daytime no longer white as the music died out of her elation also ebbed somebody had passed her speaking german and she was overwhelmed by a rush of nostalgia on this moonlight night by the banks of the rhinewhence she camethe orchards would be heavy with apples there would be murmurs and sweet scents the old castle would stand out clear high over the woods and the chalkywhite river there would be singing far away and the churning of a distant steamers screw and perhaps on the water a log raft still drifting down in the blue light there would be german voices talking and suddenly tears oozed up in her eyes and crept down through the powder on her cheeks she raised her veil and dabbed at her face with a little nottooclean handkerchief screwed up in her yellowgloved hand but the more she dabbed the more those treacherous tears ran then she became aware that a tall young man in khaki was also standing before the shopwindow not looking at the titles of the books but eyeing her askance his face was fresh and open with a sort of kindly eagerness in his blue eyes mechanically she drooped her wet lashes raised them obliquely drooped them again and uttered a little sob  this young man captain in a certain regiment and discharged from hospital at six oclock that evening had entered queens hall at halfpast seven still rather brittle and sore from his wound he had treated himself to a seat in the grand circle and there had sat very still and dreamy the whole concert through it had been like eating after a long fastsomething of the sensation polar explorers must experience when they return to their first full meal for he was of the new army and before the war had actually believed in music art and all that sort of thing with a months leave before him he could afford to feel that life was extraordinarily joyful his own experiences particularly wonderful and coming out into the moonlight he had taken what can only be described as a great gulp of it for he was a young man with a sense of beauty when one has been long in the trenches lain out wounded in a shellhole twentyfour hours and spent three months in hospital beauty has such an edge of novelty such a sharp sweetness that it almost gives pain and london at night is very beautiful he strolled slowly towards the circus still drawing the moonlight deep into his lungs his cap tilted up a little on his forehead in that moment of unmilitary abandonment and whether he stopped before the bookshop window because the girls figure was in some sort a part of beauty or because he saw that she was crying he could not have made clear to any one  then somethingperhaps the scent of powder perhaps the yellow glove or the oblique flutter of the eyelidstold him that he was making what he would have called a blooming error unless he wished for company which had not been in his thoughts but her sob affected him and he said  whats the matter  again her eyelids fluttered sideways and she stammered  noting the beautiful eveningthats why  that a woman of what he now clearly saw to be a certain type should perceive what he himself had just been perceiving struck him forcibly and he said  cheer up  she looked up again swiftly cheer up you are not lonelee like me  for one of that sort she looked somehow honest her tearstreaked face was rather pretty and he murmured  well lets walk a bit and talk it over  they turned the corner and walked east along streets empty and beautiful with their dulled orangeglowing lamps and here and there the glint of some blue or violet light he found it queer and rather excitingfor an adventure of just this kind he had never had and he said doubtfully  how did you get into this isnt it an awfully hopeless sort of life  yees it ees her voice had a queer soft emphasis you are limpinghaf you been wounded  just out of hospital today  the horrible warall the misery is because of the war when will it end  he looked at her attentively and said  i saywhat nationality are you  rooshian  really i never met a russian girl  he was conscious that she looked at him then very quickly down and he said suddenly  is it as bad as they make out  she slipped her yellowgloved hand through his arm  not when i haf any one as nice as you i never haf yet though she smiledand her smile was like her speech slow confidingyou stopped because i was sad others stop because i am gay i am not fond of men at all when you know you are not fond of them  well you hardly know them at their best do you you should see them at the front by george theyre simply splendidofficers and men every blessed soul theres never been anything like itjust one long bit of jolly fine selfsacrifice its perfectly amazing  turning her bluegrey eyes on him she answered  i expect you are not the last at that you see in them what you haf in yourself i think  oh not a bityoure quite out i assure you when we made the attack where i got wounded there wasnt a single man in my regiment who wasnt an absolute hero the way they went innever thinking of themselvesit was simply superb  her teeth came down on her lower lip and she answered in a queer voice it is the same too perhaps withthe enemy  oh yes i know that  ah you are not a mean man how i hate mean men  oh theyre not mean reallythey simply dont understand  oh you are a babya good baby arent you  he did not quite like being called a baby and frowned but was at once touched by the disconcertion in her powdered face how quickly she was scared  she said clingingly  but i liike you for it it is so good to find a niice man  this was worse and he said abruptly  about being lonely havent you any russian friends  rooshian no then quickly added the town is so beeg haf you been in the concert  yes  i tooi love music  i suppose all russians do  she looked up at his face again and seemed to struggle to keep silent then she said quietly  i go there always when i haf the money  what are you so on the rocks  well i haf just one shilling now and she laughed  the sound of that little laugh upset himshe had a way of making him feel sorry for her every time she spoke  they had come by now to a narrow square east of gower street  this is where i lif she said come in  he had one long moment of violent hesitation then yielded to the soft tugging of her hand and followed the passagehall was dimly lighted and they went upstairs into a front room where the curtains were drawn and the gas turned very low opposite the window were other curtains dividing off the rest of the apartment as soon as the door was shut she put up her face and kissed himevidently formula what a room its green and beetroot colouring and the prevalence of cheap plush disagreeably affected him everything in it had that callous look of rooms which seem to be saying to their occupants youre here today and youll be gone tomorrow everything except one little plant in a common pot of maidenhair fern fresh and green looking as if it had been watered within the hour in this room it had just the same unexpected touchingness that peeped out of the girls matteroffact cynicism  taking off her hat she went towards the gas but he said quickly  no dont turn it up lets have the window open and the moonlight in he had a sudden dread of seeing anything plainlyit was stuffy too and pulling the curtains apart he threw up the window the girl had come obediently from the hearth and sat down opposite him leaning her arm on the windowsill and her chin on her hand the moonlight caught her cheek where she had just renewed the powder caught her fair crinkly hair it caught the plush of the furniture and his own khaki giving them all a touch of unreality  whats your name he said  may well i call myself that its no good askin yours  youre a distrustful little party arent you  i haf reason to be dont you think  yes i suppose youre bound to think us all brutes  well i haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time i am dreadfully nervous now i am not trusting anybody i suppose you haf been killing lots of germans  he laughed  we never know unless it happens to be hand to hand i havent come in for that yet  but you would be very glad if you had killed some  glad i dont think so were all in the same boat so far as thats concerned were not glad to kill each other we do our jobthats all  oh it is frightful i expect i haf my broders killed  dont you get any news ever  news no indeed no news of anybody in my country i might not haf a country all that i ever knew is gonefader moder sisters broders allnever any more i shall see them i suppose now the war it breaks and breaks it breaks hearts her little teeth fastened again on her lower lip in that sort of pretty snarl do you know what i was thinkin when you came up i was thinkin of my native town and the river there in the moonlight if i could see it again i would be glad were you ever homeseeck  yes i have beenin the trenches but ones ashamed with all the others  ah yees it came from her with a hiss yees you are all comrades there what is it like for me here do you think where everybody hates and despises me and would catch me and put me in prison perhaps  he could see her breast heaving with a quick breathing painful to listen to he leaned forward patting her knee and murmuring sorrysorry  she said in a smothered voice  you are the first who has been kind to me for so long i will tell you the truthi am not rooshian at alli am german  hearing that halfchoked confession his thought was does she really think we fight against women and he said  my dear girl who cares  her eyes seemed to search right into him she said slowly  another man said that to me but he was thinkin of other things you are a veree niice boy i am so glad i met you you see the good in people dont you that is the first thing in the worldbecause there is really not much good in people you know  he said smiling  youre a dreadful little cynic then thought of course she ispoor thing  cyneec how long do you think i would live if i was not a cyneec i should drown myself tomorrow perhaps there are good people but you see i dont know them  i know lots  she leaned forward eagerly  well nowsee niice boyyou haf never been in a hole haf you  i suppose not a real hole  no i should think not with your face well suppose i am still a good girl as i was once you know and you took me to some of your good people and said here is a little german girl that has no work and no money and no friends your good people they will say oh how sad a german girl and they will go and wash their hands  silence fell on him he saw his mother his sisters othersgood people he would swear and yet he heard their voices frank and clear and they seemed to be talking of the germans if only she were not german  you see he heard her say and could only mutter  im sure there are people  no they would not take a german even if she was good besides i dont want to be good any morei am not a humbugi have learned to be bad arent you going to kees me niice boy  she put her face close to his her eyes troubled him but he drew back he thought she would be offended or persistent but she was neither just looked at him fixedly with a curious inquiring stare and he leaned against the window deeply disturbed it was as if all clear and simple enthusiasm had been suddenly knocked endways as if a certain splendour of life that he had felt and seen of late had been dipped in cloud out there at the front over here in hospital life had been seeming soas it wereheroic and yet it held such mean and murky depths as well the voices of his men whom he had come to love like brothers crude burring voices cheery in trouble making nothing of it the voices of doctors and nurses patient quiet reassuring voices even his own voice infected by it all kept sounding in his ears all wonderful somehow and simple and nothing mean about it anywhere and now so suddenly to have lighted upon this and all that was behind itthis scared girl this base dark thoughtless use of her and the thought came to him i suppose my fellows wouldnt think twice about taking her on why im not even certain of myself if she insists and he turned his face and stared out at the moonlight he heard her voice  eesnt it light no air raid tonight when the zepps burnedwhat a horrible death and all the people cheeredit is natural do you hate us veree much  he turned round and said sharply  hate i dont know  i dont hate even the englishi despise them i despise my people tooperhaps more because they began this war oh yes i know that i despise all the peoples why haf they made the world so miserablewhy haf they killed all our liveshundreds and thousands and millions of livesall for noting they haf made a bad worldeverybody hating and looking for the worst everywhere they haf made me bad i know i believe no more in anything what is there to believe in is there a god no once i was teaching little english children their prayersisnt that funnee i was reading to them about christ and love i believed all those things now i believe noting at allno one who is not a fool or a liar can believe i would like to work in a hospital i would like to go and help poor boys like you because i am a german they would throw me out a hundred times even if i was good it is the same in germany and france and russia everywhere but do you think i will believe in love and christ and a god and all thatnot i i think we are animalsthats all oh yesyou fancy it is because my life has spoiled me it is not that at allthats not the worst thing in life those men are not niice like you but its their nature and she laughed they help me to live which is something for me anyway no it is the men who think themselves great and good and make the war with their talk and their hate killing us allkilling all the boys like you and keeping poor people in prison and telling us to go on hating and all those dreadful coldblooded creatures who write in the papersthe same in my country just the same it is because of all them that i think we are only animals  he got up acutely miserable he could see her following him with her eyes and knew she was afraid she had driven him away she said coaxingly dont mind me talking niice boy i dont know any one to talk to if you dont like it i can be quiet as a mouse  he muttered  oh go on talk away im not obliged to believe you and i dont  she was on her feet now leaning against the wall her dark dress and white face just touched by the slanting moonlight and her voice came again slow and soft and bitter  well look here niice boy what sort of a world is it where millions are being torturedhorribly tortured for no fault of theirs at all a beautiful world isnt it umbug silly rot as you boys call it you say it is all comrade and braveness out there at the front and people dont think of themselves well i dont think of myself veree much what does it matteri am lost now anyway but i think of my people at home how they suffer and grieve i think of all the poor people there and here who lose those they love and all the poor prisoners am i not to think of them and if i do how am i to believe it a beautiful world niice boy  he stood very still biting his lips  look here we haf one life each and soon it is over well i think that is lucky  he said resentfully  no theres more than that  ah she went on softly you think the war is fought for the future you are giving your lives for a better world arent you  we must fight till we win he said between his teeth  till you win my people think that too all the peoples think that if they win the world will be better but it will not you know it will be much worse anyway  he turned away from her and caught up his cap but her voice followed him  i dont care which win i despise them allanimalsanimalsanimals ah dont go niice boyi will be quiet now  he took some notes from his tunic pocket put them on the table and went up to her  goodnight  she said plaintively  are you really going dont you like me enough  yes i like you  it is because i am german then  no  then why wont you stay  he wanted to answer because you upset me so but he just shrugged his shoulders  wont you kees me once  he bent and put his lips to her forehead but as he took them away she threw her head back pressed her mouth to his and clung to him  he sat down suddenly and said  dont i dont want to feel a brute  she laughed you are a funny boy but you are veree good talk to me a little then no one talks to me i would much rather talk anyway tell me haf you seen many german prisoners  he sighedfrom relief or was it from regret  a good many  any from the rhine  yes i think so  were they very sad  some weresome were quite glad to be taken  did you ever see the rhine isnt it beaudiful it will be wonderful tonight the moonlight will be the same here as there in rooshia too and france everywhere and the trees will look the same as here and people will meet under them and make love just as here oh isnt it stupid the waras if it was not good to be alive  he wanted to say you cant tell how good it is to be alive till youre facing death because you dont live till then and when a whole lot of you feel like thatand are ready to give their lives for each other its worth all the rest of life put together but he couldnt get it out to this girl who believed in nothing  how were you wounded niice boy  attacking across open groundfour machinegun bullets got me at one go off  werent you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack no he had not been frightened just then and he shook his head and laughed  it was great we did laugh that morning they got me much too soon thougha swindle  she stared at him  you laughed  yes and what do you think was the first thing i was conscious of next morningmy old colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon if you knew my colonel youd still believe in things there is something you know behind all this evil after all you can only die once and if its for your country all the better  her face with intent eyes just touched with bistre had in the moonlight a most strange otherworld look her lips moved  no i believe in nothing my heart is dead  you think so but it isnt you know or you wouldnt have been crying when i met you  if it were not dead do you think i could live my lifewalking the streets every night pretending to like strange mennever hearing a kind wordnever talking for fear i will be known for a german soon i shall take to drinking then i shall be kaput very quick you see i am practical i see things clear tonight i am a little emotional the moon is funny you know but i live for myself only now i dont care for anything or anybody  all the same just now you were pitying your people and prisoners and that  yes because they suffer those who suffer are like mei pity myself thats all i am different from your englishwomen i see what i am doing i do not let my mind become a turnip just because i am no longer moral  nor your heart either  niice boy you are veree obstinate but all that about love is umbug we love ourselves nothing more  again at that intense soft bitterness in her voice he felt stifled and got up leaning in the window the air out there was free from the smell of dust and stale perfume he felt her fingers slip between his own and stay unmoving since she was so hard and cynical why should he pity her yet he did the touch of that hand within his own roused his protective instinct she had poured out her heart to hima perfect stranger he pressed it a little and felt her fingers crisp in answer poor girl this was perhaps a friendlier moment than she had known for years and after all fellowfeeling was bigger than principalities and powers fellowfeeling was allpervading as this moonlight which she had said would be the same in germanyas this white ghostly glamour that wrapped the trees making the orange lamps so quaint and decoratively useless out in the narrow square where emptiness and silence reigned he looked around into her facein spite of bistre and powder and the faint rouging on her lips it had a queer unholy touching beauty and he had suddenly the strangest feeling as if they stood therethe two of themproving that kindness and human fellowship were stronger than lust stronger than hate proving it against meanness and brutality and the sudden shouting of newspaper boys in some neighbouring street their cries passionately vehement clashed into each other and obscured the wordswhat was it they were calling his head went up to listen he felt her hand rigid within his armshe too was listening the cries came nearer hoarser more shrill and clamorous the empty moonlight seemed of a sudden crowded with footsteps voices and a fierce distant cheering great victorygreat victory official british defeat of the uns many thousand prisoners so it sped by intoxicating filling him with a fearful joy and leaning far out he waved his cap and cheered like a madman and the whole night seemed to him to flutter and vibrate and answer then he turned to rush down into the street struck against something soft and recoiled the girl she stood with hands clenched her face convulsed panting and even in the madness of his joy he felt for her to hear thisin the midst of enemies all confused with the desire to do something he stooped to take her hand and the dusty reek of the tablecloth clung to his nostrils she snatched away her fingers swept up the notes he had put down and held them out to him  take themi will not haf your english moneytake them and suddenly she tore them across twice three times let the bits flutter to the floor and turned her back to him he stood looking at her leaning against the plushcovered table which smelled of dust her head down a dark figure in a dark room with the moonlight sharpening her outlinehardly a moment he stayed then made for the door  when he was gone she still stood there her chin on her breastshe who cared for nothing believed in nothingwith the sound in her ears of cheering of hurrying feet and voices stood in the centre of a pattern made by fragments of the tornup notes staring out into the moonlight seeing not this hated room and the hated square outside but a german orchard and herself a little girl plucking apples a big dog beside her a hundred other pictures too such as the drowning see her heart swelled she sank down on the floor laid her forehead on the dusty carpet and pressed her body to it  she who did not carewho despised all peoples even her ownbegan mechanically to sweep together the scattered fragments of the notes assembling them with the dust into a little pile as of fallen leaves and dabbling in it with her fingers while the tears ran down her cheeks for her country she had torn them her country in defeat she who had just one shilling in this great town of enemies who wrung her stealthy living out of the embraces of her foes and suddenly in the moonlight she sat up and began to sing with all her mightdie wacht am rhein  1916     iii  flotsam and jetsam  a reminiscence   the tides of the war were washing up millions of wrecked lives on all the shores what mattered the flotsam of a conscripted deepsea breton fisherman slowly pining away for lack of all he was accustomed to or the jetsam of a tall glassblower from the invaded countries drifted into the hospitalno one quite knew whyprisoner for twenty months with the boches released at last because of his halfparalysed tonguewhat mattered they what mattered anything or any one in days like those  corporal mignan wrinkling a thin parchmenty face full of suffering and kindly cynicism used to call them mes deux phénomènes riddled to the soul by gastritis he must have found them trying roommates with the tricks and manners of sick and naughty children towards a longsuffering nurse to understand all is to forgive all they say but though he had suffered enough to understand much mignan was tempted at times to deliver judgmentfor example when roche the breton fisherman rose from his bed more than ten times in the night and wandered out into the little courtyard of the hospital to look at the stars because he could not keep still within four wallsso unreasonable of the type or when gray the tall glassblowerhis grandfather had been englishrefused with all the tenacity of a british workman to wear an undervest with the thermometer below zero centigrade  they inhabited the same room flotsam and jetsam but never spoke to one another and yet in all that hospital of french soldiers they were the only two who in a manner of speaking had come from england fourteen hundred years have passed since the briton ancestors of roche crossed in their shallow boats yet he was as hopelessly unfrench as a welshman of the hills is to this day unenglish his dark face shy as a wild animals his peatbrown eyes and the rare strangelysweet smile which once in a way strayed up into them his creased brown hands always trying to tie an imaginary cord the tobacco pouched in his brown cheek his improperlybuttoned blue trousers his silence eternal as the stars themselves his habit of climbing treesall marked him out as no true frenchman indeed that habit of climbing trees caused every soul who saw him to wonder if he ought to be at large monkeys alone pursue this pastime and yetsurely one might understand that trees were for roche the masts of his faroff fishing barque each handgrip on the branch of plane or pinetree solace to his overmastering hunger for the sea up there he would cling or stand with hands in pockets and look out far over the valley and the yellowishgreypink of the pantiled townroofs a mile away far into the mountains where snow melted not far over this foreign land of midi trois quarts to an imagined breton coast and the seas that roll from there to cape breton where the cod are since he never spoke unless spoken tono not onceit was impossible for his landsmen comrades to realise why he got up those trees and they would summon each other to observe this phénomène this human ourangoutang who had not their habit of keeping firm earth beneath their feet they understood his other eccentricities better for instance he could not stay still even at his meals but must get up and slip out because he chewed tobacco and since the hospital regulations forbade his spitting on the floor he must naturally go and spit outside for ces typesla to chew and drink waslife to the presence of tobacco in the cheek and the absence of drink from the stomach they attributed all his unfrench ways save just that one mysterious one of climbing trees  and graythough only onefourth englishhow utterly british was that arrogant civilian as the poilus called him even his clothes somehow were britishno one knew who had given them to him his short grey workmans jacket brown dingy trousers muffler and checked cap his long idle walk his absolute sansgêne regardless of any one but himself his tall loose figure with a sort of grace lurking somewhere in its slow wandering movements and long thin fingers that wambling independent form might surely be seen any day outside a thousand british publichouses in time of peace his face with its dustcoloured hair projecting ears grey eyes with something of the child in them and something of the mule and something of a soul trying to wander out of the forest of misfortune his little tiptilted nose that never grew on pureblooded frenchman under a scant moustache his thick lips disfigured by infirmity of speech whence passed so continually a dribble of salivasick british workman was stamped on him yet he was passionately fond of washing himself his teeth his head his clothes into the frigid winter he would go and stand at the source half an hour at a time washing and washing it was a cause of constant irritation to mignan that his phénomène would never come to time on account of this disastrous habit the hospital corridors resounded almost daily with the importuning of those shapeless lips for something cleana shirt a pair of drawers a bath a handkerchief he had a fixity of purpose not too much purpose but so fixedyes he was english  for les deux phénomènes the soldiers the servants and the powers of the hospitalall were sorry yet they could not understand to the point of quite forgiving their vagaries the twain were outcast wandering each in a dumb world of his own each in the endless circle of one or two hopeless notions it was ironyor the french systemwhich had ordered the breton roche to get well in a place whence he could see nothing flatter than a mountain smell no sea eat no fish and god knows what had sent gray there his story was too vaguely understood for his stumbling speech simply could not make it plain les bochesils vont en payer cherles boches muttered fifty times a day was the burden of his song those boches had come into his village early in the war torn him from his wife and his petite fille since then he had had fear been hungry been cold eaten grass eyeing some fat little dog he would leer and mutter jai mangé cela cest bon and with fierce triumph add ils ont faim les boches the arrogant civilian had never done his military service for his infirmity it seemed had begun before the war  dumb each in his own way and differing in every mortal thing except the reality of their misfortunes never were two beings more lonely their quasinurse corporal mignan was no doubt right in his estimate of their characters for him so patient in the wintry days with his deux phénomènes they were divested of all that halo which misfortune sets round the heads of the afflicted he had too much to do with them and saw them as they would have been if undogged by fate of roche he would say il nest pas mon rêve je naime pas ces types taciturnes quand même il nest pas mauvais il est marinles marins and he would shrug his shoulders as who should say those poor devilswhat can you expect mais ce grayit was one bitter day when gray had refused absolutely to wear his greatcoat during a motor drivecest un mauvais type il est malinil sait très bien ce quil veut cest un egoiste an egoist poor gray no doubt he was instinctively conscious that if he did not make the most of what little personality was left within his wandering form it would slip and he would be no more even a winter fly is mysteriously anxious not to become dead that he was malincunningbecame the accepted view about gray not so malin that he could cut three paws off a duck as the old grey territorial grandpère poirot would put it but malin enough to know very well what he wanted and how by sticking to his demand to get it mignan typically french did not allow enough for the essential englishman in gray besides one must be malin if one has only the power to say about onetenth of what one wants and then not be understood once in twenty times gray did not like his greatcoata fine old frenchblue military thing with brass buttonsthe arrogant civilian would have none of it it was easier to shift the boches on the western front than to shift an idea once in his head in the poor soil of his soul the following plants of thought alone now flourished hatred of the boches love of english tobaccoil est bonil est bon he would say tapping his virginian cigarette the wish to see again his petite fille to wash himself to drink a café natur and bottled beer every day after the midday meal and to go to lyons to see his uncle and work for his living and who shall say that any of these fixed ideas were evil in him  but back to flotsam whose fixed idea was brittany nostalgia is a long word and a malady from which the english do not suffer for they carry their country on their backs walk the wide world in a cloud of their own atmosphere making that world england the french have eyes to see and when not surrounded by houses that have flatness shutters and subtle colouringyellowish frenchgrey frenchgreenby cafés by planetrees by frenchwomen by scents of woodsmoke and coffee roasted in the streets by the wines and infusions of the herbs of france by the churches of france and the beautiful silly chiming of their bellswhen not surrounded by all these they know it feel it suffer but even they do not suffer so dumbly and instinctively so like a wild animal caged as that breton fisherman caged up in a world of hill and valleynot the world as he had known it they called his case shellshockfor the french system would not send a man to convalescence for anything so essentially civilian as homesickness even when it had taken a claustrophobic turn a system recognises only causes which you can see holes in the head hamstrung legs frostbitten feet with other of the legitimate consequences of war but it was not shellshock roche was really possessed by the feeling that he would never get out never get home smell fish and the sea watch the bottlegreen breakers roll in on his native shore the sun gleaming through wavecrests lifted and flying back in spray never know the accustomed heave and roll under his feet or carouse in a seaport cabaret or see his old motherla veuve roche and after all there was a certain foundation for his fear it was not as if this war could be expected to stop some day there they were in the trenches they and the enemy set over against each other like china dogs in the words of grandpère poirot and there they would be so far as roches ungeared nerves could grasp for ever and while like china dogs they sat he knew that he would not be released not allowed to go back to the sea and the smells and the sounds thereof for he had still all his limbs and no bullethole to show under his thick dark hair no wonder he got up the trees and looked out for sight of the waves and fluttered the weak nerves of the hospital powers till they saw themselves burying him with a broken spine at the expense of the subscribers nothing to be done for the poor fellow except to take him motordrives and to insist that he stayed in the diningroom long enough to eat some food  then one bright day a power watching his hands conceived the idea of giving him two balls of string one blue the other buff and all that afternoon he stayed up a single tree and came down with one of his rare sweet smiles and a little net half blue half buff with a handle covered with a twist of turkeyred twillsuch a thing as one scoops up shrimps with he was paid for it and his eyes sparkled you see he had no moneythe poilu seldom has and money meant drink and tobacco in his cheek they gave him more string and for the next few days it rained little nets beautifully if simply made they thought that his salvation was in sight it takes an eye to tell salvation from damnation sometimes in any case he no longer roamed from tree to tree but sat across a single branch netting the powers began to speak of him as rather a dear for it is characteristic of human nature to take interest only in that which by some sign of progress makes you feel that you are doing good  next sunday a distinguished doctor came and when he had been fed some one conceived the notion of interesting him too in flotsam a learned kindly influential manwellfedsomething might come of it even that réforme that sending home which all agreed was what poor roche needed to restore his brain he was brought in therefore amongst the chattering party and stood dark shy his head down like the man in millets angelus his hands folded on his cap in front of his unspeakably buttoned blue baggy trousers as though in attitude of prayer to the doctor who uniformed and greybearded like an old somnolent goat beamed on him through spectacles with a sort of shrewd benevolence the catechism began so he had something to ask had he a swift shy lift of the eyes yes what then to go home to go home what for to get married a swift shy smile fair or dark no answer only a shift of hands on his cap what was there no oneno ladies at home ce nest pas ça qui manque at the laughter greeting that dim flicker of wit the uplifted face was cast down again that lonely lost figure must suddenly have struck the doctor for his catechism became a long embarrassed scrutiny and with an eh bien mon vieux nous verrons ended nothing came of it of course cas de réforme oh certainly if it had depended on the learned kindly doctor but the systemand all its doors to be unlocked why by the time the last door was prepared to open the first would be closed again so the powers gave roche more stringso good you know to see him interested in something it does take an eye to tell salvation from damnation for he began to go down now of an afternoon into the little old townnot smelless but most quaintall yellowishgrey with rosytiled roofs once it had been roman once a walled city of the middle ages never would it be modern the dogs ran muzzled from a firstfloor a goat munching green fodder hung his devilish black beard above your head and through the main street the peasant farmers above military age looking old as sundried roots in their dark pélerines drove their wives and produce in little slow carts parched oleanders in pots one would pass and old balconies with wilting flowers hanging down over the stone and perhaps an umbrella with a little silver handle set out to dry roche would go in by the back way where the old town gossips sat on a bench in the winter sunshine facing the lonely cross shining gold on the high hilltop opposite placed there in days when there was some meaning in such things past the little place with the old fountain and the brown planetrees in front of the mairie past the church so ancient that it had fortunately been forgotten and remained unfinished and beautiful did roche breton that he washalf the loveladies in paris they sayfalsely no doubtare bretonnesever enter the church in passing some rascal had tried to burn down its beautiful old door from the inside and the flames had left on all that high western wall smears like the fingermarks of hell or the background of a velasquez crucifixion did he ever enter and stand knotting his knot which never got knotted in the dark loveliness of that grave building where in the deep silence a dustygold little angel blows on his horn from the top of the canopied pulpit and a dim carved christ of touching beauty looks down on his fellowmen from above some dry chrysanthemums and a tall candle burned quiet and lonely here and there and the flags of france hung above the altar that men might know how godthough restingwas with them and their country perhaps but more likely he passed it with its great bell riding high and open among scrolls of ironwork andbreton that he wasentered the nearest cabaret kept by the woman who would tell you that her soldier husband had passed within two fingers of death one cannot spend ones earnings in a church nor appease there the inextinguishable longings of a sailor  and loon christmas day roche came back so drunk that his nurse mignan took him to his bedroom and turned the key of the door on him but you must not do this to a breton fisherman full of drink and claustrophobia it was one of those errors even frenchmen may make to the after sorrow of their victims one of the female powers standing outside heard a roar the crash of a foot against the panel of a door and saw roche like a great cat come slithering through the hole he flung his arm out brushed the power back against the wall cried out fiercely la boîteje ne veux pas la boîte and rushed for the stairs here were other female powers he dashed them aside and passed down but in the bureau at the foot was a young corporal of the legion etrangèrea spaniard who had volunteered for francegreat france he ran out took roche gently by the arm and offered to drink with him and so they sat those two in the little bureau drinking black coffee while the young corporal talked like an angel and roche like a wild manabout his mother about his dead brother who had been sitting on his bed as he said about la boîte and the turning of that key and slowly he became himselfor so they thoughtand all went in to supper ten minutes later one of the powers looking for the twentieth time to make sure he was eating saw an empty place he had slipped out like a shadow and was gone again a big cavalryman and the corporal retrieved him that night from a café near the station they had to use force at times to bring him in two days later he was transferred to a town hospital where discipline would not allow him to get drunk or climb trees for the powers had reasoned thus to climb trees is bad to get drunk is bad but to do both puts on us too much responsibility he must go they had in fact been scared and so he passed away to a room under the roof of a hospital in the big town miles awayla boîte indeedwhere for liberty he must use a courtyard without trees and but little tobacco came to his cheek and there he eats his heart out to this day perhaps but some say he had no heartonly the love of drink and climbing yet on that last evening to one who was paying him for a little net he blurted out some day i will tell you somethingnot nowin a years time vous êtes le seul what did he mean by that if he had no heart to eat the night after he had gone a little black dog strayed up and among the trees barked and barked at some portent or phantom ah the camel ah the pig i had him on my back all night grandpère poirot said next morning that was the very last of flotsam  and now to jetsam it was on the day but one after roche left that gray was reported missing for some time past he had been getting stronger clearer in speech they began to say of him its wonderfulthe improvement since he camewonderful his salvation also seemed in sight but from the words hes rather a dear all recoiled for as he grew stronger he became more stubborn and more irritablecunning egoist that he was according to the men he was beginning to show himself in his true colours he had threatened to knife any one who played a joke on himthe arrogant civilian on the day that he was missing it appears that after the midday meal he had asked for a café natur and for some reason had been refused before his absence was noted it was night already clear and dark all day something as of spring had stirred in the air the corporal and a power set forth down the wooded hill into the town to scour the cafés and hang over the swift shallow river to see if by any chance gray had been overtaken by another paralytic stroke and was down there on the dark sand the sleepy gendarmes too were warned and given his description but the only news next morning was that he had been seen walking on the main road up the valley two days later he was found twenty miles away wandering towards italy perdu was his only explanation but it was not believed for now began that continual demand je voudrais aller à lyon voir mon oncletravailler as the big cavalryman put it he is bored here it was considered unreasonable by soldiers who found themselves better off than in other hospitals even the powers considered it ungrateful almost see what he had been like when he camea mere trembling bag of bones only too fearful of being sent away and yet who would not be bored crouching all day long about the stoves staunching his poor dribbling mouth rolling his inevitable cigarette or wandering down lonely to hang over the bridge parapet having thoughts in his head and for ever unable to express them his state was worse than dumbness for the dumb have resigned hope of conversation gray would have liked to talk if it had not taken about five minutes to understand each thing he saidexcept the refrain which all knew by heart les bochesils vont en payer cherles boches the idea that he could work and earn his living was fantastic to those who watched him dressing himself or sweeping the courtyard pausing every few seconds to contemplate some invisible difficulty or do over again what he had just not done but with that new access of strength or perhaps the open weatheras if spring had come before its timehis fixed idea governed him completely he began to threaten to kill himself if he could not go to work and see his uncle at lyon and every five days or so he had to be brought back from far up some hill road the situation had become so ridiculous that the powers said in despair very well my friend your uncle says he cant have you and you cant earn your own living yet but you shall go and see for yourself and go he did a little solemn now that it had come to his pointin specially bought yellow bootshe refused blackand a specially bought overcoat with sleeveshe would have none of a pélerine the arrogant civilian no more than of a military capote for a week the hospital knew him not deep winter set in two days before he went and the whole land was wrapped in snow the huge disconsolate crows seemed all the life left in the valley and poplartrees against the rare blue sky were dowered with miraculous snowblossoms beautiful as any blossom of spring and still in the winter sun the town gossips sat on the bench under the wall and the cross gleamed out and the church bell riding high in its whitened ironwork tolled almost every day for the passing of some wintered soul and long processions very black in the white street followed it followed ithome then came a telegram from grays uncle impossible to keep aristide the name of the arrogant civilian takes the evening train tomorrow albert gray so jetsam was coming back what would he be like now that his fixed idea had failed him well he came at midday thinner more claycoloured in the face with a bad cold but he ate as heartily as ever and at once asked to go to bed at four oclock a power going up to see found him sleeping like a child he slept for twenty hours on end no one liked to question him about his time away all that he saidand bitterlywas they wouldnt let me work but the second evening after his return there came a knock on the door of the little room where the powers were sitting after supper and there stood gray long and shadowy holding on to the screen smoothing his jawbone with the other hand turning eyes like a childs from face to face while his helpless lips smiled one of the powers said what do you want my friend  je voudrais aller à paris voir ma petite fille  yes yes after the war your petite fille is not in paris you know  non the smile was gone it was seen too plainly that gray was not as he had been the access of vigour stirring of new strength improvement had departed but the beat of it while there must have broken him as the beat of some toostrong engine shatters a frail frame his improvement had driven him to his own undoing with the failure of his pilgrimage he had lost all hope all egoism it takes an eye indeed to tell salvation from damnation he was truly jetsam nowterribly thin and ill and sad and coughing yet he kept the independence of his spirit in that bitter cold nothing could prevent him stripping to the waist to wash nothing could keep him lying in bed or kill his sense of the proprieties he would not wear his overcoatit was invalidish he would not wear his new yellow boots and keep his feet dry except on sundays ils sont bons he would say and before he would profane their goodness his old wornout shoes had to be reft from him he would not admit that he was ill that he was cold that he wasanything but at night a power would be awakened by groans and hurrying to his room find him huddled nose to knees moaning and now every evening as though craving escape from his own company he would come to the little sittingroom and stand with that deprecating smile smoothing his jawbone until some one said sit down my friend and have some coffee merci ma soeuril est bon il est bon and down he would sit and roll a cigarette with his long fingers tapering as any artists while his eyes fixed themselves intently on anything that moved but soon they would stray off to another world and he would say thickly sullenly fiercely les bochesils vont en payer cherles boches on the walls were some trophies from the war of seventy his eyes would gloat over them and he would get up and finger a long pistol or old papiermaché helmet never was a man who so lacked gêneat home in any company it inspired reverence that independence of his which had survived twenty months of imprisonment with those who it is said make their victims salute themto such a depth has their civilisation reached one night he tried to tell about the fright he had been given the bochesit seemedhad put him and two others against a wall and shot those other two holding up two tapering fingers he mumbled assassinsassassins ils vont en payer cherles boches but sometimes there was something almost beautiful in his face as if his soul had rushed from behind his eyes to answer some little kindness done to him or greet some memory of the days before he was done forfoutu as he called it  one day he admitted a pain about his heart and time too for at moments he would look like death itself his nurse corporal mignan had long left his deux phénomènes having drifted away on the tides of the system till he should break down again and drag through the hospitals once more gray had a room to himself now the arrogant civilians groaning at night disturbed the others yet if you asked him in the morning if he had slept well he answered invariably ouiouitoujours toujours for according to him you see he was still strong and he would double his arm and tap his very little muscle to show that he could work but he did not believe it now for one day a power dusting the mens writingroom saw a letter on the blotter and with an ashamed eye read these words       cher oncle       jai eu la rage contre toi mais cest passé maintenant je      veux seulement me reposer je ne

diningroom or the avenue of pines will be seen his long noiseless lonely figure or be heard his thick stumbling cry  les bochesils vont en payer cherles boches  1917     iv  the bright side   a little englishwoman married to a german had dwelt with him eighteen years in humble happiness and the district of putney where her husband worked in the finer kinds of leather he was a harmless busy little man with the gift for turning his hand to anything which is bred into the peasants of the black forest who on their upland farms make all the necessaries of daily lifetheir coarse linen from homegrown flax their leather gear from the hides of their beasts their clothes from the wool thereof their furniture from the pine logs of the forest their bread from homegrown flour milled in simple fashion and baked in the homemade ovens their cheese from the milk of their own goats why he had come to england he probably did not rememberit was so long ago but he would still know why he had married dora the daughter of the putney carpenter she being as it were salt of the earth one of those cockney women deeply sensitive beneath a wellnigh impermeable mask of humour and philosophy who quite unselfconsciously are always doing things for others in their little grey putney house they had dwelt those eighteen years without perhaps ever having had time to move though they had often had the intention of doing so for the sake of the children of whom they had three a boy and two girls mrs gerhardtshe shall be called for her husband had a very german name and there is more in a name than shakespeare dreamed ofmrs gerhardt was a little woman with large hazel eyes and dark crinkled hair in which there were already a few threads of grey when the war broke out her boy david the eldest was fourteen at that date and her girls minnie and violet were eight and five rather pretty children especially the little one gerhardt perhaps because he was so handy had never risen his firm regarded him as indispensable and paid him fair wages but he had no push having the craftsmans temperament and employing his spare time in little neat jobs for his house and his neighbours which brought him no return they made their way therefore without that provision for the future which necessitates the employment of ones time for ones own ends but they were happy and had no enemies and each year saw some mild improvements in their studiously clean house and tiny back garden mrs gerhardt who was cook seamstress washerwoman besides being wife and mother was almost notorious in that street of semidetached houses for being at the disposal of any one in sickness or trouble she was not strong in body for things had gone wrong when she bore her first but her spirit had that peculiar power of seeing things as they were and yet refusing to be dismayed which so embarrasses fate she saw her husbands defects clearly and his good qualities no less distinctlythey never quarrelled she gauged her childrens characters too with an admirable precision which left however loopholes of wonder as to what they would become  the outbreak of the war found them on the point of going to margate for bank holiday an almost unparalleled event so that the importance of the world catastrophe was brought home to them with a vividness which would otherwise have been absent from folks so simple domestic and farremoved from that atmosphere in which the egg of war is hatched over the origin and merits of the struggle beyond saying to each other several times that it was a dreadful thing mr and mrs gerhardt held but one little conversation lying in their iron bed with an immortal brown eiderdown patterned with red wriggles over them they agreed that it was a cruel wicked thing to invade that little belgium and there left a matter which seemed to them a mysterious and insane perversion of all they had hitherto been accustomed to think of as life reading their papersa daily and a weekly in which they had as much implicit faith as a million other readersthey were soon duly horrified by the reports therein of hun atrocities so horrified that they would express their condemnation of the kaiser and his militarism as freely as if they had been british subjects it was therefore with an uneasy surprise that they began to find these papers talking of the huns at large in our midst of spies and the national danger of nourishing such vipers they were deeply conscious of not being vipers and such sayings began to awaken in both their breasts a humble sense of injustice as it were this was more acute in the breast of little mrs gerhardt because of course the shafts were directed not at her but at her husband she knew her husband so well knew him incapable of anything but homely kindly busyness and that he should be lumped into the category of huns and spies and tarred with the brush of mass hatred amazed and stirred her indignation or would have if her cockney temperament had allowed her to take it very seriously as for gerhardt he became extremely silent so that it was ever more and more difficult to tell what he was feeling the patriotism of the newspapers took a considerable time to affect the charity of the citizens of putney and so long as no neighbour showed signs of thinking that little gerhardt was a monster and a spy it was fairly easy for mrs gerhardt to sleep at night and to read her papers with the feeling that the remarks in them were not really intended for gerhardt and herself but she noticed that her man had given up reading them and would push them away from his eyes if in the tiny sittingroom with the heavilyflowered walls they happened to rest beside him he had perhaps a closer sense of impending fate than she the boy david went to his first work and the girls to their school and so things dragged on through that first long war winter and spring mrs gerhardt in the intervals of doing everything knitted socks for our poor cold boys in the trenches but gerhardt no longer sought out little jobs to do in the houses of his neighbours mrs gerhardt thought that he fancied they would not like it it was early in that spring that she took a deaf aunt to live with them the wife of her mothers brother no bloodrelation but the poor woman had nowhere else to go so david was put to sleep on the horsehair sofa in the sittingroom because she couldnt refuse the poor thing and then of an april afternoon while she was washing the household sheets her neighbour mrs clirehugh a little spare woman all eyes cheekbones hair and decision came in breathless and burst out  oh mrs gerhardt ave you eard theyve sunk the loositania has i said to will isnt it horful  mrs gerhardt with her round arms dripping soapsuds answered what a dreadful thing the poor drowning people dear oh dear  oh those huns id shoot the lot i would  they are wicked mrs gerhardt echoed that was a dreadful thing to do  but it was not till gerhardt came in at five oclock white as a sheet that she perceived how this dreadful catastrophe affected them  i have been called a german were the first words he uttered dollee i have been called a german  well so you are my dear said mrs gerhardt  you do not see he answered with a heat and agitation which surprised her i tell you this lusitania will finish our business they will have me they will take me away from you all already the papers have intern all the huns he sat down at the kitchen table and buried his face in hands still grimy from his leather work mrs gerhardt stood beside him her eyes unnaturally big  but max she said what has it to do with you you couldnt help it max  gerhardt looked up his white face broad in the brow and tapering to a thin chin seemed all distraught  what do they care for that is my name max gerhardt what do they care if i hate the war i am a german thats enough you will see  oh murmured mrs gerhardt they wont be so unjust  gerhardt reached up and caught her chin in his hand and for a moment those two pairs of eyes gazed straining into each other then he said  i dont want to be taken dollee what shall i do away from you and the children i dont want to be taken dollee  mrs gerhardt with a feeling of terror and a cheerful smile answered  you mustnt go fancyin things max ill make you a nice cup of tea cheer up old man look on the bright side  but gerhardt lapsed into the silence which of late she had begun to dread  that night some shop windows were broken some german names effaced the gerhardts had no shop no name painted up and they escaped in press and parliament the cry against the huns in our midst rose with a fresh fury but for the gerhardts the face of fate was withdrawn gerhardt went to his work as usual and their laborious and quiet existence remained undisturbed nor could mrs gerhardt tell whether her mans everdeepening silence was due to his fancying things or to the demeanour of his neighbours and fellow workmen one would have said that he like the derelict aunt was deaf so difficult to converse with had he become his length of sojourn in england and his value to his employers for he had real skill had saved him for the time being but behind the screen fate twitched her grinning chaps  not till the howl which followed some air raids in 1916 did they take off gerhardt with a variety of other elderly men whose crime it was to have been born in germany they did it suddenly and perhaps it was as well for a prolonged sight of his silent misery must have upset his family till they would have been unable to look on that bright side of things which mrs gerhardt had as it were always up her sleeve when in charge of a big and sympathetic constable he was gone taking all she could hurriedly get together for him she hastened to the police station they were friendly to her there she must cheer up missis ed be all right she neednt worry ah she could go down to the ome office if she liked and see what could be done but they eld out no ope mrs gerhardt waited till the morrow having the little violet in bed with her and crying quietly into her pillow then putting on her sunday best she went down to a building in whitehall larger than any she had ever entered two hours she waited sitting unobtrusive with big anxious eyes and a line between her brows at intervals of half an hour she would get up and ask the messenger cheerfully i ope they havent forgotten me sir perhaps youd see to it and because she was cheerful the messenger took her under his protection and answered all right missis theyre very busy but ill wangle you in someow  when at length she was wangled into the presence of a grave gentleman in eyeglasses realisation of the utter importance of this moment overcame her so that she could not speak oh dearshe thought while her heart fluttered like a birdhell never understand ill never be able to make him she saw her husband buried under the leaves of despair she saw her children getting too little food the deaf aunt now bedridden neglected in the new pressure of work that must fall on the only breadwinner left and choking a little she said  im sure im very sorry to take up your time sir but my usbands been taken to the palace and weve been married over twenty years and hes been in england twentyfive and hes a very good man and a good workman and i thought perhaps they didnt understand that and weve got three children and a relation thats bedridden and of course we understand that the germans have been very wicked gerhardt always said that himself and it isnt as if he was a spy so i thought if you could do something for us sir i being english myself  the gentleman looking past her at the wall answered wearily  gerhardtill look into it we have to do very hard things mrs gerhardt  little mrs gerhardt with big eyes almost starting out of her head for she was no fool and perceived that this was the end said eagerly  of course i know that theres a big outcry and the papers are askin for it but the people in our street dont mind im sir hes always done little things for them so i thought perhaps you might make an exception in his case  she noticed that the gentlemans lips tightened at the word outcry and that he was looking at her now  his case was before the committee no doubt but ill inquire goodmorning  mrs gerhardt accustomed to not being troublesome rose a tear rolled down her cheek and was arrested by her smile  thank you sir im sure goodmorning sir  and she went out meeting the messenger in the corridor and hearing his well missis she answered i dont know i must look on the bright side goodbye and thank you for your trouble and she turned away feeling as if she had been beaten all over  the bright side on which she looked did not include the return to her of little gerhardt who was duly detained for the safety of the country obedient to economy and with a dim sense that her favourite papers were in some way responsible for this she ceased to take them in and took in sewing instead it had become necessary to do so for the allowance she received from the government was about a quarter of gerhardts weekly earnings in spite of its inadequacy it was something and she felt she must be grateful but curiously enough she could not forget that she was english and it seemed strange to her that in addition to the grief caused by separation from her husband from whom she had never been parted not even for a night she should now be compelled to work twice as hard and eat half as much because that husband had paid her country the compliment of preferring it to his own but after all many other people had much worse trouble to grieve over so she looked on the bright side of all this especially on those days once a week when alone or accompanied by the little violet she visited that palace where she had read in her favourite journals to her great comfort that her husband was treated like a prince since he had no money he was in what they called the battalion and their meetings were held in the bazaar where things which the princes made were exposed for sale here mr and mrs gerhardt would stand in front of some doll some blottingbook calendar or walkingstick which had been fashioned by one of the princes there they would hold each others hands and try to imagine themselves unsurrounded by other men and wives while the little violet would stray and return to embrace her fathers leg spasmodically standing there mrs gerhardt would look on the bright side and explain to gerhardt how well everything was going and he mustnt fret about them and how kind the police were and how auntie asked after him and minnie would get a prize and how he oughtnt to mope but eat his food and look on the bright side and gerhardt would smile the smile which went into her heart just like a sword and say  all right dollee im getting on fine then when the whistle blew and he had kissed little violet they would be quite silent looking at each other and she would say in a voice so matteroffact that it could have deceived no one  well i must go now goodbye old man  and he would say  goodbye dollee kiss me  they would kiss and holding little violets hand very hard she would hurry away in the crowd taking care not to look back for fear she might suddenly lose sight of the bright side but as the months went on became a year eighteen months two years and still she went weekly to see her prince in his palace that visit became for her the hardest experience of all her hard weeks doings for she was a realist as well as a heroine and she could see the lines of despair not only in her mans heart but in his face for a long time he had not said im getting on fine dollee his face had a beaten look his figure had wasted he complained of his head  its so noisy he would say constantly oh its so noisynever a quiet momentnever alonenevernevernevernever and not enough to eat its all reduced now dollee  she learned to smuggle food into his hands but it was very little for they had not enough at home either with the price of living ever going up and her depleted income ever stationary they hadher man told hermade a fuss in the papers about their being fed like turkeycocks while the huns were sinking the ships gerhardt always a spare little man had lost eighteen pounds she naturally well covered was getting thin herself but that she did not notice too busy all day long and too occupied in thinking of her man to watch him week by week more hopeless as the months dragged on was an acute torture to disguise which was torture even more acute she had long seen that there was no bright side but if she admitted that she knew she would go down so she did not and she carefully kept from gerhardt such matters as davids overgrowing his strength because she could not feed him properly the completely bedridden nature of auntie and worse than these the growing coldness and unkindness of her neighbours perhaps they did not mean to be unkind perhaps they did for it was not in their nature to withstand the pressure of mass sentiment the continual personal discomfort of having to stand in queues the fear of air raids the cumulative indignation caused by stories of atrocities true and untrue in spite of her record of kindliness towards them she became tarred with the brush at last for her nerves had given way once or twice and she had said it was a shame to keep her man like that gettin iller and iller who had never done a thing even her reasonablenessand she was very reasonablesuccumbed to the strain of that weekly sight of him till she could no longer allow for the difficulties which mrs clirehugh assured her the government had to deal with then one day she used the words fair play and at once it became current that she had german sympathies from that time on she was somewhat doomed those who had received kindnesses from her were foremost in showing her coldness being wounded in their selfesteem to have received little benefits such as being nursed when they were sick from one who had german sympathies was too much for the pride which is in every human being however humble an inhabitant of putney mrs gerhardts cockney spirit could support this for herself but she could not bear it for her children david came home with a black eye and would not say why he had got it minnie missed her prize at school though she had clearly won it that was just after the last german offensive began but mrs gerhardt refused to see that this was any reason little violet twice put the heartrending question to her arent i english mummy  she was answered yes my dear of course  but the child obviously remained unconvinced in her troubled mind  and then they took david for the british army it was that which so upset the applecart in mrs gerhardt that she broke out to her last friend mrs clirehugh  i do think its hard eliza they take his father and keep him there for a dangerous hun year after year like that and then they take his boy for the army to fight against him and how im to get on without him i dont know  little mrs clirehugh who was scotch with a gloucestershire accent replied  well weve got to beat them theyre such a wicked lot i daresay its ard on you but weve got to beat them  but we never did nothing cried mrs gerhardt it isnt us thats wicked we never wanted the war its nothing but ruin to him they did ought to let me have my man or my boy one or the other  you should ave some feeling for the government dora they ave to do ard things  mrs gerhardt with a quivering face had looked at her friend  i have she said at last in a tone which implanted in mrs clirehughs heart the feeling that dora was bitter  she could not forget it and she would flaunt her head at any mention of her former friend it was a blow to mrs gerhardt who had now no friends except the deaf and bedridden aunt to whom all things were the same war or no war germans or no germans so long as she was fed  about then it was that the tide turned and the germans began to know defeat even mrs gerhardt who read the papers no longer learned it daily and her heart relaxed that bright side began to reappear a little she felt they could not feel so hardly towards her man now as when they were all in fear and perhaps the war would be over before her boy went out but gerhardt puzzled her he did not brighten up the iron seemed to have entered his soul too deeply and one day in the bazaar passing an open doorway mrs gerhardt had a glimpse of why there stretching before her astonished eyes was a great as it were encampment of brown blankets slung and looped up anyhow dividing from each other countless sordid beds which were almost touching and a whiff of huddled humanity came out to her keen nostrils and a hum of sound to her ears so that was where her man had dwelt these thirty months in that dirty crowded noisy place with dirtylooking men such as those she could see lying on the beds or crouching by the side of them over their work he had kept neat somehow at least on the days when she came to see himbut that was where he lived alone again for she no longer brought the little violet to see her german father she grieved all the way home whatever happened to him now even if she got him back she knew he would never quite get over it  and then came the morning when she came out of her door like the other inhabitants of putney at sound of the maroons thinking it was an air raid and catching the smile on the toothless mouth of one of her old neighbours hearing the cheers of the boys in the school round the corner knew that it was peace her heart overflowed then and withdrawing hastily she sat down on a shiny chair in her little empty parlour her face crumpled suddenly the tears came welling forth she cried and cried alone in the little cold room she cried from relief and utter thankfulness it was overover at last the long waitingthe long miserythe yearning for her manthe grieving for all those poor boys in the mud and the dreadful shell holes and the fighting the growing terror of anxiety for her own boyover all over now they would let max out now david would come back from the army and people would not be unkind and spiteful to her and the children any more  for all she was a cockney hers was a simple soul associating peace with goodwill drying her tears she stood up and in the little cheap mirror above the empty grate looked at her face it was lined and she was grey for more than two years her man had not seen her without her hat what ever would he say and she rubbed and rubbed her cheeks trying to smooth them out then her conscience smote her and she ran upstairs to the back bedroom where the deaf aunt lay taking up the little amateur ear trumpet which gerhardt himself had made for auntie before he was taken away she bawled into it  peace auntie its peace think of that its peace  whats that answered the deaf woman  its peace auntie peace  the deaf lady roused herself a little and some meaning came into the lacklustre black eyes of her long leathery face you dont say she said in her wooden voice im so hungry dolly isnt it time for my dinner  i was just goin to get it dearie replied mrs gerhardt and hurried back downstairs with her brain teeming to make the deaf womans bowl of bread pepper salt and onions  all that day and the next and the next she saw the bright side of things with almost dazzling clearness waiting to visit her prince in his palace she found him in a strange and pitiful state of nerves the news had produced too intense and varied emotions among those crowded thousands of men buried away from normal life so long she spent all her hour and a half trying desperately to make him see the bright side but he was too full of fears and doubts and she went away smiling but utterly exhausted slowly in the weeks which followed she learned that nothing was changed in the fond hope that gerhardt might be home now any day she was taking care that his slippers and some clothes of davids were ready for him and the hip bath handy for him to have a lovely hot wash she had even bought a bottle of beer and some of his favourite pickle saving the price out of her own food and was taking in the paper again letting bygones be bygones but he did not come and soon the paper informed her that the english prisoners were returningmany in wretched state poor things so that her heart bled for them and made her fiercely angry with the cruel men who had treated them so but it informed her too that if the paper had its way no huns would be tolerated in this country for the future send them all back were the words it used she did not realise at first that this applied to gerhardt but when she did she dropped the journal as if it had been a living coal of fire not let him come back to his home and family not let him stay after all theyd done to him and he never did anything to them not let him stay but send him out to that dreadful country which he had almost forgotten in these thirty years and he with an english wife and children in this new terror of utter dislocation the bright side so slipped from her that she was obliged to go out into the back garden in the dark where a souwesterly wind was driving the rain there lifting her eyes to the evening sky she uttered a little moan it couldnt be true and yet what they said in her paper had always turned out true like the taking of gerhardt away and the reduction of his food and the face of the gentleman in the building at whitehall came before her out of the long past with his lips tightening and his words we have to do very hard things mrs gerhardt why had they to do them her man had never done no harm to no one a flood bitter as sea water surged in her and seemed to choke her very being those gentlemen in the paperswhy should they go on like that had they no hearts no eyes to see the misery they brought to humble folk i wish them nothing worse than what theyve brought to him and me she thought wildly nothing worse  the rain beat on her face wetted her grey hair cooled her eyeballs i mustnt be spiteful she thought and bending down in the dark she touched the glass of the tiny conservatory built against the warm kitchen wall and heated by the cunning little hotwater pipe her man had put there in his old handy days under it were one little monthly rose which still had blossoms and some straggly small chrysanthemums she had been keeping them for the feast when he came home but if he wasnt to come what should she do she raised herself above the wet roofs skyrack was passing wild and dark but in a little cleared space one or two stars shone the brighter for the blackness below i must look on the bright side she thought or i cant bear myself and she went in to cook the porridge for the evening meal  the winter passed for her in the most dreadful anxiety repatriate the huns that cry continued to spurt up in her paper like a terrible face seen in some recurrent nightmare and each week that she went to visit gerhardt brought solid confirmation to her terror he was taking it hard so that sometimes she was afraid that something was happening in him this was the utmost she went towards defining what doctors might have diagnosed as incipient softening of the brain he seemed to dread the prospect of being sent to his native country  i couldnt stick it dollee he would say what should i dowhatever should i do i havent a friend i havent a spot to go to i should be lost im afraid dollee how could you come out there you and the children i couldnt make a living for you i couldnt make one for myself now  and she would say cheer up old man look on the bright side think of the others for though those others were not precisely the bright side the mental picture of their sufferings all those poor princes and their families somehow helped her to bear her own but he shook his head  no i should never see you again  id follow you she answered never fear max wed work in the fieldsme and the children wed get on somehow bear up my dearie itll soon be over now ill stick to you max never you fear but they wont send you they never will  and then like a lump of ice pressed on her breast came the thought but if they do auntie my boy my girls however shall i manage if they do  then long lists began to appear and in great batches men were shovelled wholesale back to the country whose speech some of them had wellnigh forgotten little gerhardts name had not appeared yet the lists were hung up the day after mrs gerhardts weekly visit but she urged him if his name did appear to appeal against repatriation it was with the greatest difficulty that she roused in him the energy to promise look on the bright side max she implored him youve got a son in the british army theyll never send you they wouldnt be so cruel never say die old man  his name appeared but was taken out and the matter hung again in awful suspense while the evil face of the recurrent nightmare confronted mrs gerhardt out of her favourite journal she read that journal again because so far as in her gentle spirit lay she hated it it was slowly killing her man and all her chance of future happiness she hated it and read it every morning to the monthly rose and straggly little brownred chrysanthemums in the tiny hothouse there had succeeded spring flowersa few hardy january snowdrops and one by one blue scillas and the little pale daffodils called angels tears  peace tarried but the flowers came up long before their time in their tiny hothouse against the kitchen flue and then one wonderful day there came to mrs gerhardt a strange letter announcing that gerhardt was coming home he would not be sent to germanyhe was coming home today that very dayany moment he might be with her when she received it who had long received no letters save the weekly letters of her boy still in the army she was spreading margarine on aunties bread for breakfast and moved beyond all control she spread it thick wickedly wastefully thick then dropped the knife sobbed laughed clasped her hands on her breast and without rhyme or reason began singing hark the herald angels sing the girls had gone to school already auntie in the room above could not hear her no one heard her nor saw her drop suddenly into the wooden chair and with her bare arms stretched out one on either side of the plate of bread and margarine cry her heart out against the clean white table coming home coming home coming home the bright side the little white stars  it was a quarter of an hour before she could trust herself to answer the knocking on the floor which meant that auntie was missing her breakfast hastily she made the tea and went up with it and the bread and margarine the womans dim long face gleamed greedily when she saw how thick the margarine was spread but little mrs gerhardt said no word of the reason for that feast she just watched her only friend eating it while a little moisture still trickled out from her big eyes on to her flushed cheeks and the words still hummed in her brain   peace on earth and mercy mild  jesus christ a little child  then still speaking no word she ran out and put clean sheets on her and her mans bed she was on wires she could not keep still and all the morning she polished polished about noon she went out into her garden and from under the glass plucked every flower that grew theresnowdrops scillas angels tears quite two dozen blossoms she brought them into the little parlour and opened its window wide the sun was shining and fell on the flowers strewn on the table ready to be made into the nosegay of triumphant happiness while she stood fingering them delicately breaking half an inch off their stalks so that they should last the longer in water she became conscious of someone on the pavement outside the window and looking up saw mrs clirehugh the past the sense of having been deserted by her friends left her and she called out  come in eliza look at my flowers  mrs clirehugh came in she was in black her cheekbones higher her hair looser her eyes bigger mrs gerhardt saw tears starting from those eyes wetting those high cheekbones and cried out  why whats the matter dear  mrs clirehugh choked my baby  mrs gerhardt dropped an angels tear and went up to her  whatevers happened she cried  dead replied mrs clirehugh dead o the influenza es to be buried today i canti canti cant wild choking stopped her utterance mrs gerhardt put an arm round her and drew her head on to her shoulder  i canti cant sobbed mrs clirehugh i cant find any flowers its seein yours made me cry  there there cried mrs gerhardt have them im sure youre welcome dearie have themim so sorry  i dont know choked mrs clirehugh i avent deserved them mrs gerhardt gathered up the flowers  take them she said i couldnt think of it your poor little baby take them there there hes spared a lot of trouble you must look on the bright side dearie  mrs clirehugh tossed up her head  youre an angel thats what you are she said and grasping the flowers she hurried out a little black figure passing the window in the sunlight  mrs gerhardt stood above the emptied table thinking poor dearim glad she had the flowers it was a mercy i didnt call out that max was coming and from the floor she picked up one angels tear she had dropped and set it in a glass of water where the sunlight fell she was still gazing at it pale slender lonely in that coarse tumbler when she heard a knock on the parlour door and went to open it there stood her man with a large brownpaper parcel in his hand he stood quite still his head a little down the face very grey she cried out max but the thought flashed through her he knocked on the door its his doorhe knocked on the door  dollee he said with a sort of question in his voice  she threw her arms round him drew him into the room and shutting the door looked hard into his face yes it was his face but in the eyes something wanderedlit up went out lit up  dollee he said again and clutched her hand  she strained him to her with a sob  im not well dollee he murmured  no of course not my dearie man but youll soon be all right nowhome again with me cheer up cheer up  im not well he said again  she caught the parcel out of his hand and taking the angels tear from the tumbler fixed it in his coat  heres a spring flower for you max out of your own little hothouse youre home again home again my dearie aunties upstairs and the girlsll be coming soon and well have dinner  im not well dollee he said  terrified by that reiteration she drew him down on the little horsehair sofa and sat on his knee youre home max kiss me theres my man and she rocked him to and fro against her yearning yet fearing to look into his face and see that something wander therelight up go out light up look dearie she said ive got some beer for you youd like a glass of beer  he made a motion of his lips a sound that was like the ghost of a smack it terrified her so little life was there in it  he clutched her close and repeated feebly  yes all right in a day or two they let me comeim not well dollee he touched his head  straining him to her rocking him she murmured over and over again like a cat purring to its kitten  its all right my deariesoon be wellsoon be well we must look on the bright sidemy man     v  cafard   the soldier jean liotard lay face to the earth by the bank of the river drôme he lay where the grass and trees ended and between him and the shrivelled green current was much sandy foreshore for summer was at height and the snows had long finished melting and passing down the burning sun had sucked up all moisture the earth was parched but today a cool breeze blew willow and aspen leaves were fluttering and hissing as if millions of tiny kisses were being given up there and a few swathes of white cloud were drawn it seemednot drivenalong the blue the soldier jean liotard had fixed his eyes on the ground where was nothing to see but a few dry herbs he had cafard for he was due to leave the hospital tomorrow and go up before the military authorities for prolongation there he would answer perfunctory questions and be told at once au dépôt or have to lie naked before them that some major might prod his ribs to find out whether his heart displaced by shellshock had gone back sufficiently to normal position he had received one prolongation and so wherever his heart now was he felt sure he would not get another au dépôt was the fate before him fixed as that river flowing down to its death in the sea he had cafardthe little black beetle in the brain which gnaws and eats and destroys all hope and heaven in a man it had been working at him all last week and now he was at a monstrous depth of evil and despair to begin again the cursed barrackround the driven life until in a month perhaps packed like bleating sheep in the trooptrain he made that journey to the fighting line againÀ la hachetteà la hachette  he had stripped off his red flannel jacket and lay with shirt opened to the waist to get the breeze against his heart in his brown goodlooking face the hazel eyes which in these three goddeserted years had acquired a sort of startled gloom stared out like a dogs rather prominent seeing only the thoughts within himthoughts and images swirling round and round in a dark whirlpool drawing his whole being deeper and deeper he was unconscious of all the summer hum and rustlethe cooing of the dove up in that willow tree the winged enamelled fairies floating past the chirr of the cicadas that little brown lizard among the pebbles almost within reach seeming to listen to the beating of summers heart so motionless it lay unconscious as though in verity he were again deep in some stifling trench with german shells whining over him and the smell of muck and blood making foetid the air he was in the mood which curses god and dies for he was devouta catholic and still went to mass and god had betrayed the earth and jean liotard all the enormities he had seen in his two years at the frontthe mouthless mangled faces the human ribs whence rats would steal the frenzied tortured horses with leg or quarter rent away still living the rotted farms the dazed and hopeless peasants his innumerable suffering comrades the desert of nomans land and all the thunder and moaning of war and the reek and the freezing of war and the drivingthe callous perpetual driving by some great force which shovelled warm human hearts and bodies warm human hopes and loves by the million into the furnace and over all dark sky without a break without a gleam of blue or lift anywhereall this enclosed him lying in the golden heat so that not a glimmer of life or hope could get at him back into it all again back into it he who had been through forty times the hell that the majors ever endured five hundred times the hell ever glimpsed at by those députés safe with their fat salaries and their gabble about victory and the lost provinces and the future of the worldthe canaille let them allow the soldiers whose lives they spent like waterles camarades on both sidespoor devils who bled and froze and starved and sweatedlet them suffer these to make the peace ah what a peace that would beits first condition all the sacred politicians and pressmen hanging in rows in every country the mouth fighters the pen fighters the fighters with other mens blood those comfortable citizens would never rest till there was not a young man with whole limbs left in france had he not killed enough boches that they might leave him and his tired heart in peace he thought of his first charge of how queer and soft that boche body felt when his bayonet went through and another and another ah he had joliment done his duty that day and something wrenched at his ribs they were only boches but their wives and children their mothersfaces questioning faces pleading for thempleading with whom ah not with him who was he that had taken those lives and others since but a poor devil without a life himself without the right to breathe or move except to the orders of a force which had no mind which had no heart had nothing but a blind will to go on it knew not why if only he survivedit was not possiblebut if only he survived and with his millions of comrades could come back and hold the reckoning some scarethecrows then would waggle in the wind the butterflies would perch on a few mouths empty at last the flies enjoy a few silent tongues then slowly his fierce unreasoning rancour vanished into a mere awful pity for himself was a fellow never again to look at the sky and the good soil the fruit the wheat without this dreadful black cloud above him never again make love among the trees or saunter down a lighted boulevard or sit before a café never again attend mass without this black dog of disgust and dread sitting on his shoulders riding him to death angels of pity was there never to be an end one was going mad under ityes mad and the face of his mother came before him as he had seen her last just three years ago when he left his home in the now invaded country to join his regimenthis mother who with all his family was in the power of the boche he had gone gaily and she had stood like stone her hand held over her eyes in the sunlight watching him while the train ran out usually the thought of the cursed boches holding in their heavy hands all that was dear to him was enough to sweep his soul to a clear definite hate which made all this nightmare of war seem natural and even right but now it was not enoughhe had cafard he turned on his back the sky above the mountains might have been black for all the joy its blue gave him the butterflies those drifting flakes of joy passed unseen he was thinking no rest no end except by walking over bodies dead mangled bodies of poor devils like himself poor hunted devils who wanted nothing but never to lift a hand in combat again so long as they lived who wantedas he wantednothing but laughter and love and rest quelle vie a carnival of leaping demonry a dreamunutterably bad and when i go back to it all he thought i shall go all shaven and smart and wave my hand as if i were going to a wedding as we all do vive la france ah what mockery cant a poor devil have a dreamless sleep he closed his eyes but the sun struck hot on them through the lids and he turned over on his face again and looked longingly at the riverthey said it was deep in midstream it still ran fast there what was that down by the water was he really mad and he uttered a queer laugh there was his black dogthe black dog off his shoulders the black dog which rode him yea which had become his very self just going to wade in and he called out  hé le copain it was not his dog for it stopped drinking tucked its tail in and cowered at the sound of his voice then it came from the water and sat down on its base among the stones and looked at him a real dog was it what a guy what a thin wretch of a little black dog it sat and stareda mongrel who might once have been pretty it stared at jean liotard with the pathetic gaze of a dog so thin and hungry that it earnestly desires to go to men and get fed once more but has been so kicked and beaten that it dare not it seemed held in suspense by the equal overmastering impulses fear and hunger and jean liotard stared back the lost as it were despairing look of the dog began to penetrate his brain he held out his hand and said viens but at the sound the little dog only squirmed away a few paces then again sat down and resumed its stare again jean liotard uttered that queer laugh if the good god were to hold out his hand and say to him viens he would do exactly as that little beast he would not come not he what was he too but a starved and beaten doga driven wretch kicked to hell and again as if experimenting with himself he held out his hand and said viens and again the beast squirmed a little further away and again sat down and stared jean liotard lost patience his head drooped till his forehead touched the ground he smelt the parched herbs and a faint sensation of comfort stole through his nerves he lay unmoving trying to fancy himself dead and out of it all the hum of summer the smell of grasses the caress of the breeze going over he pressed the palms of his outstretched hands on the warm soil as one might on a womans breast if only it were really death how much better than life in this butchers shop but death his death was waiting for him away over there under the moaning shells under the whining bullets at the end of a steel pronga mangled foetid death deathhis death had no sweet scent and no caresssave the kisses of rats and crows life and death what were they nothing but the preying of creatures the one on the othernothing but that and love the blind instinct which made these birds and beasts of prey bon sang de bon sang the christ hid his head finely nowadays that cross up there on the mountain top with the sun gleaming on itthey had been right to put it up where no man lived and not even a dog roamed to be pitied fairy tales fairy tales he thought those who drive and those who are driven those who eat and those who are eatenwe are all poor devils together there is no pity no god and the flies drummed their wings above him and the sun boring into his spine through his thin shirt made him reach for his jacket there was the little dog still sitting on its base twenty yards away it cowered and dropped its ears when he moved and he thought poor beast someone has been doing the devils work on you not badly there were some biscuits in the pocket of his jacket and he held one out the dog shivered and its thin pink tongue lolled out panting with desire and fear jean liotard tossed the biscuit gently about half way the dog cowered back a step or two crept forward three and again squatted then very gradually it crept up to the biscuit bolted it and regained its distance the soldier took out another this time he threw it five paces only in front of him again the little beast cowered slunk forward seized the biscuit devoured it but this time it only recoiled a pace or two and seemed with panting mouth and faint wagging of the tail to beg for more jean liotard held a third biscuit as far out in front of him as he could and waited the creature crept forward and squatted just out of reach there it sat with saliva dripping from its mouth seemingly it could not make up its mind to that awful venture the soldier sat motionless his outstretched hand began to tire but he did not budgehe meant to conquer its fear at last it snatched the biscuit jean liotard instantly held out a fourth that too was snatched but at the fifth he was able to touch the dog it cowered almost into the ground at touch of his fingers and then lay still trembling violently while the soldier continued to stroke its head and ears and suddenly his heart gave a twitter the creature had licked his hand he took out his last biscuit broke it up and fed the dog slowly with the bits talking all the time when the last crumb was gone he continued to murmur and crumple its ears softly he had become aware of something happening within the dogsomething in the nature of conversion as if it were saying o my master my new masteri worship i love you the creature came gradually closer quite close then put up its sharp black nose and began to lick his face its little hot rough tongue licked and licked and with each lick the soldiers heart relaxed just as if the licks were being given there and something licked away he put his arms round the thin body and hugged it and still the creature went on feverishly licking at his face and neck and chest as if trying to creep inside him the sun poured down the lizards rustled and whisked among the pebbles the kissing never ceased up there among the willow and aspen leaves and every kind of flying thing went past drumming its wings there was no change in the summer afternoon god might not be there but pity had come back jean liotard no longer had cafard he put the little dog gently off his lap got up and stretched himself voyons mon brave faut aller voir les copains tu es à moi the little dog stood up on its hind legs scratching with its forepaws at the soldiers thigh as if trying to get at his face again as if begging not to be left and its tail waved feverishly half in petition half in rapture the soldier caught the paws set them down and turned his face for home making the noises that a man makes to his dog and the little dog followed close as he could get to those moving ankles lifting his snout and panting with anxiety and love  1917     vi  recorded   just as the train was going out the compartment was stormed by a figure in khaki with a rifle a bad cold a wife a basket a small bundle and two babies setting his rifle down in the corner he said  didnt think we shud ever a caught it  his lean face was streaming with perspiration and when he took off his overcoat there rose the sweetish sourish scent of a hot goatskin waistcoat it reached below his waist and would have kept cold out from a man standing in a blizzard and he had been carrying a baby a rifle a bundle a basket and running on a warmish day  grand things these he said and took it off he also took off his cap and sat down with the elder baby in a howling draught  proper cold ive caught comin over here he added  his wife quite a girl broadfaced freshcoloured with small grey eyes and a wonderfully placid comely face on which a faint shadow seemed printed sat beside him with the younger baby a real hairless one as could be seen when its white knitted cap slipped the elder baby perhaps two years old began whimpering a little he jigged it gently and said  we ad a lot o trouble wi this one yesterday the doctor didnt think er fit to travel but i got to see the old people down there before i go back out across come over sunday nightonly got a weeks leave so here we are and he laughed  what is your corps i asked  engineers  join since the war  he looked at me as if to say what a question  twelve years service been everywhereindia south africa egypt come over to the front from egypt  where ypres  beg pardon wipers no labassy  rough time  he winked proper rough time  he looked straight at me and his eyescelticgrey with a good deal of light in themstared wide and fixed at things beyond me as only do the eyes of those who have seen much death there was a sort of burntgunpowder look about their rims and lashes and a fixity that nothing could have stared down  the kazer he says itll all be over by april he laughed abandoning the whole of him to enjoyment of that joke  he was thin as a rail his head with its thick brown hair was narrow his face narrowish too he had irregular ears and no feature that could be called good but his expression was utterly genuine and unconscious of itself when he sat quiet his face would be held a little down his eyes would be looking at somethingor was it at nothingfaroff in a kind of frowning dream but if he glanced at his babies his rather thick mouth became all smiles and he would make a remark to his wife about them once or twice she looked at him softly but i could never catch him responding to that his life was rather fuller than hers just now presently she took from him the elder baby which whimpering again was quieted at once by her broad placidity the younger baby she passed to him and having secured it on his knee he said  this ones a proper little gem never makes a sound shes a proper little gem never cude stand hearin a baby cry it certainly was an admirable baby whether her little garments were lifted so that you saw portions of herscarlet from being held too tight whether the shawl was wrapped over her too much or too little or her little knitted trousers seemed about to fall off for both these babies were elegantly dressed and so was the mother with a small blue hat and a largechecked blouse over her broad bosom and a blue skirt all crumbs and baby it was pleasant to see that he had ceased to stream with perspiration now and some one at the other end of the carriage having closed the window he and the babies no longer sat in a howling draughtnot that they had ever noticed it  yes he said suddenly proper rough time we ad of it at first terribleyu cude ardly stick it we engineers ad the worst of it tu but must laugh you know if yure goin to cop it next minutemust laugh and he did but his eyes didnt quite lose that stare  how did you feel the first day under fire  he closed one eye and shook his head  not very grandnot very grandnot for two or three days soon get used to it though only things i dont care about now are those jack johnsons long toms out in south africanow jack johnsonsfunny names and he went into a roar then leaning forward and to make sure of ones attention sawing the air with a hand that held perhaps the longest used handkerchief ever seen i seen em make a hole where you could ave put two underd and fifty horses dont think i shall ever get to like em yu dont take no notice o rifle fire after a littlenot a bit o notice i was out once with a sapper and two o the devons fixin up barbed wirebullets strikin everywhere just like rain one o the devons he was sittin on a biscuittin singin the fields were white wi daisiessinging all of a sudden he goes like this and giving a queer dull sumph of a sound he jerked his body limp towards his kneesgone dig a hole put im in your turn tomorrow perhaps pals an all yu get so as yu dont take no notice  on the face of the broad placid girl with the baby against her breast the shadow seemed printed a little deeper but she did not wince the tiny baby on his knees woke up and crowed faintly he smiled  since i been out there ive often wished i was a little un again like this well i made up my mind when first i went for a soldier that id like to ave a medal out of it some day now ill get it if they dont get me and he laughed again ah ive ad some good times an ive ad some bad times  but never a time like this  yes i reckon this has about put the top hat on it and he nodded his head above the babys about put the top hat on oh ive seen thingsenough to make your eart bleed ive seen a lot of them country people cruel it is women old men little children armless peopleenough to make your eart bleed i used to think of the folk over ere dont think english womend stand what the french and belgian women do those poor women over therewonderful they are there yull see em sittin outside their omes just a heap o ruinsclingin to em wonderful brave and patientmake your eart bleed to see em things ive seen theres some proper brutes among the germansmust be yu dont feel very kind to em when yuve seen what ive seen we ave some games with em thoughhe laughed again very nervous people the germans if we stop firin in our lines up they send the star shells rockets and all to see whats goin onthink were goin to attackregular lumination o fireworksvery nervous people then we send up some rockets on our sidejust to ave some funproper display o fireworks he went off into a roar must ave a bit o fun you know  is it true they cant stand the bayonet  yes thats righttheyll tell yu so themselvesvery sensitive nervous people  and after that a silence fell the elder babe was still fretful and the mothers face had on it that most moving phenomenon of this worldthe strange selfless utterly absorbed look mouth just loosened eyes off where we cannot follow the whole being wrapped in warmth of her baby against her breast and he with the tiny placid baby had gone off into another sort of dream with his slightly frowning faraway look what was it all aboutnothing perhaps a great quality to be able to rest in vacancy  he stirred and i offered him the paper but he shook his head  thank yu dont care about lookin at em they dont know half what we do out therefrom what ive seen of em since i come back i dont seem to ave any use for em the pictures too he shrugged and shook his head we ave the real news ysee they dont keep nothin from us but were not allowed to say when we advance therell be some lives lost i tell yu  he nodded thinking for a second perhaps of his own cant be helped once we get em on the run we shant give em much time just then the baby on his knee woke up and directed on him the full brunt of its wideopen bright grey eyes its rosy cheeks were so broad and fat that its snub nose seemed but a button its mouth too tiny one would think for use smiled seeing that smile he said  well what do yu want proper little gem aint yu and suddenly looking up at me he added with a sort of bashful glee my old peoplell go fair mad when they see mego fair mad they will he seemed to dwell on the thought and i saw the wife give him a long soft smiling look he added suddenly  ill ave to travel back though saturdaycatch the six oclock from victoria sundayto cross over there  very soon after that we arrived at where he changed and putting on his goatskin his cap and overcoat he got out behind his wife carrying with the utmost care those queer companions his baby and his rifle  where is he now alive dead who knows  1915     vii  the recruit   several times since that fateful fourth of august he had said i shll ave to go  and the farmer and his wife would look at him he with a sort of amusement she with a queer compassion in her heart and one or the other would reply smiling thats all right tom theres plenty germans yet yu wait a bit  his mother too who came daily from the lonely cottage in the little combe on the very edge of the big hill to work in the kitchen and farm dairy would turn her dark taciturn head with still plentiful black hair towards his face which for all its tan was so weirdly reminiscent of a withered baby pinkish and lightlashed with forelock and fair hair thin and rumpled and small blue eyes and she would mutter  dont yu never fret boy theyll come for ee fast enough when they want ee no one least of all perhaps his mother could take quite seriously that little square shortfooted man born when she was just seventeen sure of work because he was firstrate with every kind of beast he was yet not looked on as being quite all there he could neither read nor write had scarcely ever been outside the parish and then only in a shandrydan on a club treat and he knew no more of the world than the native of a small south sea island his life from school age on had been passed year in year out from dawn till dark with the cattle and their calves the sheep the horses and the wild moor ponies except when hay or corn harvest or any exceptionally exacting festival absorbed him for the moment from shyness he never went into the bar of the inn and so had missed the greater part of village education he could of course read no papers a map was to him but a mystic mass of marks and colours he had never seen the sea never a ship no water broader than the parish streams until the war had never met anything more like a soldier than the constable of the neighbouring village but he had once seen a royal marine in uniform what sort of creatures these germans were to himwho knows they were cruelhe had grasped that something noxious perhaps like the adders whose backs he broke with his stick something dangerous like the chained dog at shapton farm or the big bull at vannacombe when the war first broke out and they had called the younger blacksmith a reservist and noted village marksman back to his regiment the little cowman had smiled and said wait till regiment gets to front fredll soon shoot em up  but weeks and months went by and it was always the germans the germans fred had clearly not yet shot them up and now one and now another went off from the village and two from the farm itself and the great fred returned slightly injured for a few weeks rest and full of whisky from morning till night made the village ring and finally went off again in a mood of manifest reluctance all this weighed dumbly on the mind of the little cowman the more heavily that because of his inarticulate shyness he could never talk that weight away nor could anyone by talk relieve him no premises of knowledge or vision being there from sheer physical contagion he felt the grizzly menace in the air and a sense of being left behind when others were going to meet that menace with their fists as it were there was something proud and sturdy in the little man even in the look of him for all that he was poor old tom who brought a smile to the lips of all he was passionate too if rubbed up the wrong way but it needed the malevolence and ingenuity of human beings to annoy himwith his beasts he never lost his temper so that they had perfect confidence in him he resembled indeed herdsmen of the alps whom one may see in dumb communion with their creatures up in those high solitudes for he too dwelt in a high solitude cut off from real fellowship with men and women by lack of knowledge and by the supercilious pity in them living in such a remote world his talkwhen he did say somethinghad ever the surprising quality attaching to the thoughts of those by whom the normal proportions of things are quite unknown his short square figure hatless and rarely coated in any weather dotting from foot to foot a bit of stick in one hand and often a straw in the mouthhe did not smokewas familiar in the yard where he turned the handle of the separator or in the fields and cowsheds from daybreak to dusk save for the hours of dinner and tea which he ate in the farm kitchen making sparse and surprising comments to his peculiar whistles and calls the cattle and calves for all their rumination and stubborn shyness were amazingly responsive it was a pretty sight to see them pushing against each other round himfor after all he was as much the source of their persistence especially through the scanty winter months as a mother starling to her unfledged young  when the government issued their request to householders to return the names of those of military age ready to serve if called on he heard of it and stopped munching to say in his abrupt fashion ill gofight the germans but the farmer did not put him down saying to his wife  poor old tom twidden be ardly fairtheyd be makin game of un  and his wife her eyes shining with motherliness answered poor lad hes not fitlike  the months went onwinter passing to springand the slow decking of the trees and fields began with leaves and flowers with butterflies and the songs of birds how far the little cowman would notice such a thing as that no one could ever have said devoid as he was of the vocabulary of beauty but like all the world his heart must have felt warmer and lighter under his old waistcoat and perhaps more than most hearts for he could often be seen standing stockstill in the fields his browning face turned to the sun  less and less he heard talk of germansdogged acceptance of the state of war having settled on that far countrysidethe beggars were not beaten and killed off yet but they would be in good time it was unpleasant to think of them more than could be helped once in a way a youth went off and listed but though the parish had given more perhaps than the average a good few of military age still clung to life as they had known it then some bright spirit conceived the notion that a county regiment should march through the remoter districts to rouse them up  the cuckoo had been singing five days the lanes and fields the woods and the village green were as josephs coat so varied and so bright the foliage from golden oakbuds to the brilliant little limetree leaves the feathery green shoots of larches and the already darkening bunches of the sycamores the earth was dryno rain for a fortnightwhen the cars containing the brownclad men and a recruiting band drew up before the inn here were clustered the farmers the innkeeper the greyhaired postman by the church gate and before the schoolyard were knots of girls and children schoolmistress schoolmaster parson and down on the lower green a group of likely youths an old labourer or two and apart from human beings as was his wont the little cowman in brown corduroys tied below the knee and an old waistcoat the sleeves of his blue shirt dotted with pink rolled up to the elbows of his brown arms so he stood his brown neck and shavenlooking head quite bare with his bit of stick wedged between his waist and the ground staring with all his lightlashed waterblue eyes from under the thatch of his forelock  the speeches rolled forth glib the khakiclad men drank their second fill that morning of coffee and cider the little cowman stood straight and still his head drawn back two figuresofficers men who had been at the frontdetached themselves and came towards the group of likely youths these wavered a little were silent sniggered stood their groundthe khakiclad figures passed among them hackneyed words jests the touch of flattery changing swiftly to chaffall the customary performance hollow and pathetic and then the two figures reemerged their hands clenched their eyes shifting here and there their lips drawn back in fixed smiles they had failed and were trying to hide it they must not show contemptthe young slackers might yet come in when the band played  the cars were filled again the band struck up its a long long way to tipperary  and at the edge of the green within two yards of the cars dusty passage the little cowman stood apart and stared his face was red behind him they were cheeringthe parson and farmers school children girls even the group of youths he alone did not cheer but his face grew still more red when the dust above the road and the distant blare of tipperary had dispersed and died he walked back to the farm dotting from one to other of his short feet all that afternoon and evening he spoke no word but the flush seemed to have settled in his face for good and all he milked some cows but forgot to bring the pails up two of his precious cows he left unmilked till their distressful lowing caused the farmers wife to go down and see there he was standing against a gate moving his brown neck from side to side like an animal in pain oblivious seemingly of everything she spoke to him  whats matter tom all he could answer was  ise goin ise goin she milked the cows herself  for the next three days he could settle to nothing leaving his jobs half done speaking to no one save to say  ise goin ise got to go even the beasts looked at him surprised  on the saturday the farmer having consulted with his wife said quietly  well tom ef yu want to go yu shall ill drive ee down monday us wont du nothin to keep yu back  the little cowman nodded but he was restless as ever all through that sunday eating nothing  on monday morning arrayed in his best clothes he got into the dogcart there without goodbye to anyone not even to his beasts he sat staring straight before him square and jolting up and down beside the farmer who turned on him now and then a dubious almost anxious eye  so they drove the eleven miles to the recruiting station he got down entered the farmer with him  well my lad they asked him what dyou want to join  royal marines  it was a shock coming from the short square figure of such an obvious landsman the farmer took him by the arm  why yum a devon man tom better take county regiment ant they gude enough for yu  shaking his head he answered royal marines  was it the glamour of the words or the royal marine he had once seen that moved him to wish to join that outlandish corps who shall say there was the wish immovable they took him to the recruiting station for the royal marines  stretching up his short square body and blowing out his cheeks to increase his height he was put before the reading board his eyes were splendid little that passed in hedgerows or the heaven in woods or on the hillsides could escape them they asked him to read the print  staring he answered l  no my lad youre guessing  l  the farmer plucked at the recruiting officers sleeve his face was twitching and he whispered hoarsely  e don know is alphabet  the officer turned and contemplated that short square figure with the browned face so reminiscent of a withered baby and the little blue eyes staring out under the dusty forelock then he grunted and going up to him laid a hand on his shoulder  your hearts all right my lad but you cant pass  the little cowman looked at him turned and went straight out an hour later he sat again beside the farmer on the way home staring before him and jolting up and down  they wont get me he said suddenly i can fight but ise not goin a fire of resentment seemed to have been lit within him that evening he ate his tea and next day settled down again among his beasts but whenever now the war was mentioned he would look up with his puckered smile which seemed to have in it a resentful amusement and say  they ant got me yet  his dumb sacrifice passing their comprehension had been rejectedor so it seemed to him he could not understand that they had spared him why he was as good as they his pride was hurt no they should not get him now  1916     viii  the peace meeting   colin wilderton coming from the west on his way to the peace meeting fell in with john rudstock coming from the north and they walked on together after they had commented on the news from russia and the inflation of money rudstock said abruptly  we shall have a queer meeting i expect  god knows answered wilderton  and both smiled conscious that they were uneasy but predetermined not to show it under any circumstances their smiles were different for rudstock was a blackbrowed man with dark beard and strong thick figure and wilderton a very lightbuilt greyhaired man with kindly eyes and no health he had supported the war an immense time and had only recently changed his attitude in common with all men of warm feelings he had at first been profoundly moved by the violation of belgium the horrors of the german advance through that little country and through france to which he was temperamentally attached had stirred in him a vigorous detestation freely expressed in many ways extermination he had felt all those early months was hardly good enough for brutes who could commit such crimes against humanity and justice and his sense of the need for signal defeat of a noxious force riding roughshod over the hardwon decency of human life had survived well into the third year of the war he hardly knew himself when his feeling had begunnot precisely to change but to run as it were in a different channel a man of generous instincts artistic tastes and unsteady nerves too thinly coated with that godgiven assurance which alone fits a man for knowing what is good for the world he had become gradually haunted by the thought that he was not laying down his own life but only the lives of his own and other peoples sons and the consideration that he was laying them down for the benefit of their own future had lost its grip on him at moments he was still able to see that the war he had so long supported had not yet attained sufficient defeat of the prussian military machine to guarantee that future but his pity and distress for all these young lives cut down without a chance to flower had grown till he had become as it were a gambler what goodhe would thinkto secure the future of the young in a europe which would soon have no young every country was suffering hideouslythe criminal country not least thank god suppose the war were to go on for another year two three years and then stop from sheer exhaustion of both sides while all the time these boys were being killed and maimed for nothing more perhaps than could be obtained today what then true the government promised victory but they never promised it within a year governments did not die what if they were to go on promising it a year hence till everybody else was dead did history ever show that victory in the present could guarantee the future and even if not so openly defeated as was desirable this damnable prussianism had got such a knock that it could never again do what it had in the past these last however were but side reflections toning down for him the fact that his nerves could no longer stand this vicarious butchery of youth and so he had gradually become that traitor to his country a weakkneed peace by negotiation man physically his knees really were weak and he used to smile a wry smile when he read the expression  john rudstock of vigorous physique had opposed the war on principle from the start not because any more than wilderton he approved of prussianism but because as an essentially combative personality he opposed everything that was supported by a majority the greater the majority the more bitterly he opposed it and no one would have been more astonished than he at hearing that this was his principle he preferred to put it that he did not believe in opposing force by force in peacetime he was a stalwart in wartime a renegade  the street leading to the chapel which had been engaged seemed quiet enough designed to make an impression on public opinion every care had been taken that the meeting should not attract the public eye gods protection had been enlisted but two policemen also stood at the entrance and half a dozen others were suspiciously near by a thin trickle of persons mostly women were passing through the door colin wilderton making his way up the aisle to the platform wrinkled his nose thinking stuffy in here it had always been his misfortune to love his neighbours individually but to dislike them in a bunch on the platform some fifteen men and women were already gathered he seated himself modestly in the back row while john rudstock less retiring took his place at the chairmans right hand the speakers began with a precipitancy hardly usual at a public meeting wilderton listened and thought dreadfully cliché why cant someone say straight out that boys enough have been killed he had become conscious of a muttering noise too as of the tide coming in on a heavy wind it broke suddenly into component partshuman voices clamouring outside he heard blows raining on the door saw sticks smashing in the windows the audience had risen to its feet some rushing to defend the doors others standing irresolute john rudstock was holding up the chair he had been sitting on wilderton had just time to think i thought so when a knot of young men in khaki burst into the chapel followed by a crowd he knew he was not much good in a scrimmage but he placed himself at once in front of the nearest woman at that moment however some soldiers pouring through a sidedoor invaded the platform from behind and threw him down the steps he arrived at the bottom with a bump and was unable to get up because of the crowd around him someone fell over him it was rudstock swearing horribly he still had the chair in his hand for it hit wilderton a nasty blow the latter saw his friend recover his feet and swing the weapon and with each swing down went some friend or foe until he had cleared quite a space round him wilderton still weak and dizzy from his fall sat watching this homeric battle chairs books stools sticks were flying at rudstock who parried them or diverted their course so that they carried on and hit wilderton or crashed against the platform he heard rudstock roar like a lion and saw him advance swinging his chair down went two young men in khaki down went a third in mufti a very tall young soldier also armed with a chair dashed forward and the two fought in single combat wilderton had got on his feet by now and adjusting his eyeglass for he could see little without he caught up a hymnbook and flinging it at the crowd with all his force shouted hoobloodyray and followed with his fists clenched one of them encountered what must have been the jaw of an australian it was so hard against his hand he received a vicious punch in the ribs and was again seated on the ground he could still hear his friend roaring and the crash of chairs meeting in midair something fell heavily on him it was rudstockhe was insensible there was a momentary lull and peering up as best he could from underneath the body wilderton saw that the platform had been cleared of all its original inhabitants and was occupied mainly by youths in navyblue and khaki a voice called out  order silence  rubbing rudstocks temples with brandy from a flask which he had had the foresight to slip into his pocket he listened as best he could with the feet of the crowd jostling his anatomy  here we are boys the voice was saying and here well always be when these treacherous blighters try their games on no peace no peace at any price weve got to show them that we wont have it leave the women alonethough they ought to be ashamed of themselves but for the menthe skunksshootings too good for them let them keep off the course or well make them weve broken up this meeting and well break up every meeting that tries to talk of peace three cheers for the old flag  during the cheers which followed wilderton was discovering signs of returning consciousness in his friend rudstock had begun to breathe heavily and pouring some brandy into his mouth he propped him up as best he could against a wooden structure which he suddenly perceived to be the chapels modest pulpit a thought came to his dazed brain if he could get up into that as if he had dropped from heaven they might almost listen to him he disengaged his legs from under rudstock and began crawling up the steps on hands and knees once in the pulpit he sat on the floor below the level of visibility getting his breath and listening to the cheers then smoothing his hair he rose and waited for the cheers to stop he had calculated rightly his sudden appearance his grey hair eyeglass and smile deceived them for a moment there was a hush  boys he said listen to me a second i want to ask you something what on earth do you think we came here for simply and solely because we cant bear to go on seeing you killed day after day month after month year after year thats all and its christs truth amen  a strange gasp and mutter greeted this little speech then a dull voice called out  progerman  wilderton flung up his hand  the germans to hell he said simply  the dull voice repeated  progerman and the speaker on the platform called out come out of that when we want you to beg us off well let you know  wilderton spun round to him  youre all wonderful he began but a hymnbook hit him fearfully on the forehead and he sank down into the bottom of the pulpit this last blow coming on the top of so many others had deprived him of intelligent consciousness he was but vaguely aware of more speeches cheers and tramplings then of a long hush and presently found himself walking out of the chapel door between rudstock and a policeman it was not the door by which they had entered and led to an empty courtyard  can you walk said the policeman  wilderton nodded  then walk off said the policeman and withdrew again into the house of god  they walked holding each others arms a little unsteadily at first rudstock had a black eye and a cut on his ear the blood from which had stained his collar and matted his beard wildertons coat was torn his forehead bruised his cheek swollen and he had a pain in his back which prevented him from walking very upright they did not speak but in an archway did what they could with pins and handkerchiefs and by turning up rudstocks coat collar to regain something of respectability when they were once more under way rudstock said coldly  i heard you you should have spoken for yourself i came as you know because i dont believe in opposing force by force at the next peace meeting we hold i shall make that plainer  wilderton murmured  yes yes i saw youim sure you will i apologise i was carried away  rudstock went on in a deep voice  as for those young devils they may die to a man if they like take my advice and let them alone  wilderton smiled on the side which was not swollen  yes he said sadly it does seem difficult to persuade them to go on living ah well  ah well he said again five minutes later theyre wonderfulpoor young beggars im very unhappy rudstock  im not said rudstock ive enjoyed it in a way goodnight  they shook hands screwing up their mouths with pain for their fists were badly bruised and parted rudstock going to the north wilderton to the west  1917     ix  the dog it was that died   until the great war was over i had no idea that some of us who stayed at home made the great sacrifice  my friend harburn is or rather was a northumbrian or some kind of northerner a stocky man of perhaps fifty with closeclipped grizzled hair and moustache and a deepcoloured face he was a neighbour of mine in the country and we had the same kind of dogsairedales never less than three at a time so that for breeding purposes we were useful to each other we often too went up to town by the same train his occupation was one which gave him opportunity of prominence in public life but until the war he took little advantage of this sunk in a kind of bluff indifferentism which was almost cynical i used to look on him as a typically goodnatured blunt englishman rather enjoying his cynicism and appreciating his openair tendenciesfor he was a devotee of golf and fond of shooting when he had the chance a good companion too with an open hand to people in distress he was unmarried and dwelled in a bungalowlike house not far from mine and next door to a german family called holsteig who had lived in england nearly twenty years i knew them pretty well alsoa very united trio father mother and one son the father who came from hanover was something in the city the mother was scotch and the sonthe one i knew best and liked mosthad just left his public school this youth had a frank open blueeyed face and thick light hair brushed back without a partinga very attractive slightly norwegianlooking type his mother was devoted to him she was a real west highlander slight with dark hair going grey high cheekbones a sweet but rather ironical smile and those grey eyes which have second sight in them i several times met harburn at their house for he would go in to play billiards with holsteig in the evenings and the whole family were on very friendly terms with him  the third morning after we had declared war on germany harburn holsteig and i went up to town in the same carriage harburn and i talked freely but holsteig a fair wellsetup man of about fifty with a pointed beard and blue eyes like his son sat immersed in his paper till harburn said suddenly  i say holsteig is it true that your boy was going off to join the german army  holsteig looked up  yes he said he was born in germany hes liable to military service but thank heaven it isnt possible for him to go  but his mother said harburn she surely wouldnt have let him  she was very miserable of course but she thought duty came first  duty good godmy dear man half british and living in this country all his life i never heard of such a thing holsteig shrugged his shoulders  in a crisis like this what can you do except follow the law strictly he is of military age and a german subject we were thinking of his honour but of course were most thankful he cant get over to germany  well im damned said harburn you germans are too bally conscientious altogether  holsteig did not answer  i travelled back with harburn the same evening and he said to me  once a german always a german didnt that chap holsteig astonish you this morning in spite of living here so long and marrying a british wife his sympathies are dead german you see  well i replied put yourself in his place  i cant i could never have lived in germany i wonder he added reflectively i wonder if the chaps all right cumbermere  of course hes all right which was the wrong thing to say to harburn if one wanted to reestablish his confidence in the holsteigs as i certainly did for i liked them and was sure of their good faith if i had said of course hes a spyi should have rallied all harburns confidence in holsteig for he was naturally contradictious  i only mention this little passage to show how early harburns thoughts began to turn to the subject which afterwards completely absorbed and inspired him till he died for his country  i am not sure what paper first took up the question of interning all the huns but i fancy the point was raised originally rather from the instinct deeply implanted in so many journals for what would please the public than out of any deep animus at all events i remember meeting a subeditor who told me he had been opening letters of approval all the morning never said he have we had a stunt catch on so quickly why should that bally german round the corner get my custom and so forth britain for the british  rather bad luck i said on people whove paid us the compliment of finding this the best country to live in  bad luck no doubt he replied mais la guerre cest la guerre you know harburn dont you did you see the article he wrote by jove he pitched it strong  when next i met harburn himself he began talking on this subject at once  mark my words cumbermere ill have every german out of this country his grey eyes seemed to glint with the snap and spark as of steel and flint and tinder and i felt i was in the presence of a man who had brooded so over the german atrocities in belgium that he was possessed by a sort of abstract hate  of course i said there have been many spies but  spies and ruffians he cried the whole lot of them  how many germans do you know personally i asked him  thank god not a dozen  and are they spies and ruffians  he looked at me and laughed but that laugh was uncommonly like a snarl  you go in for fairness he said and all that slop take em by the throatits the only way  it trembled on the tip of my tongue to ask him whether he meant to take the holsteigs by the throat but i swallowed it for fear of doing them an injury i was feeling much the same general abhorrence myself and had to hold myself in all the time for fear it should gallop over my commonsense but harburn i could see was giving it full rein his whole manner and personality somehow had changed he had lost geniality and that goodhumoured cynicism which had made him an attractive companion he was as if gnawed at inwardlyin a word he already had a fixed idea  now a cartoonist like myself has got to be interested in the psychology of men and things and i brooded over harburn for it seemed to me remarkable that one whom i had always associated with good humour and bluff indifference should be thus obsessed and i formed this theory about him herei said to myselfis one of cromwells ironsides born out of his age in the slack times of peace he discovered no outlet for the grim within himhis fire could never be lighted by love therefore he drifted in the waters of indifferentism now suddenly in this grizzly time he has found himself a new man girt and armed by this new passion of hate stung and uplifted as it were by the sight of that which he can smite with a whole heart its deeply interestingi said to myselfwho could have dreamed of such a reincarnation for what on the surface could possibly be less alike than an ironside and harburn as ive known him up to now and i used his face for the basis of a cartoon which represented a human weathervane continually pointing to the east no matter from what quarter the wind blew he recognised himself and laughed when he saw merather pleased in fact but in that laugh there was a sort of truculence as if the man had the salt taste of blood at the back of his mouth  ah he said you may joke about it but ive got my teeth into them all right the swine  and there was no doubt he hadthe man had become a force unhappy germans a few of them spies no doubt but the great majority as certainly innocent were being wrenched from their trades and families and piled into internment camps all day and every day and the faster they were piled in the higher grew his stock as a servant of his country im sure he did not do it to gain credit the thing was a crusade to him something sacredhis bit but i believe he also felt for the first time in his life that he was really living getting out of life the full of its juice was he not smiting hip and thigh he longed i am sure to be in the thick of the actual fighting but age debarred him and he was not of that more sensitive type which shrinks from smiting the defenceless if it cannot smite anything stronger i remember saying to him once  harburn do you ever think of the women and children of your victims  he drew his lips back and i saw how excellent his teeth were  the women are worse than the men i believe he said id put them in too if i could as for the children theyre all the better for being without fathers of that kidney  he really was a little mad on the subject no more so of course than any other man with a fixed idea but certainly no less  in those days i was here there and everywhere and had let my country cottage so i saw nothing of the holsteigs and indeed had pretty well forgotten their existence but coming back at the end of 1917 from a long spell with the red cross i found among my letters one from mrs holsteig        dear mr cumbermere       you were always so friendly to us that i have summoned up      courage to write this letter you know perhaps that my      husband was interned over a year ago and repatriated last      september he has lost everything of course but so far he      is well and able to get along in germany harold and i have      been jogging on here as best we can on my own little      incomehuns in our midst as we are we see practically      nobody what a pity we cannot all look into each others      hearts isnt it i used to think we were a fairplay      people but i have learned the bitter truththat there is no      such thing when pressure comes its much worse for harold      than for me he feels his paralysed position intensely and      would im sure really rather be doing his bit as an      interned than be at large subject to everyones suspicion      and scorn but i am terrified all the time that they will      intern him you used to be intimate with mr harburn we have      not seen him since the first autumn of the war but we know      that he has been very active in the agitation and is very      powerful in this matter i have wondered whether he can      possibly realise what this indiscriminate internment of the      innocent means to the families of the interned could you not      find a chance to try and make him understand if he and a few      others were to stop hounding on the government it would      cease for the authorities must know perfectly well that all      the dangerous have been disposed of long ago you have no      notion how lonely one feels in ones native land nowadays if      i should lose harold too i think i might go under though      that has never been my habit       believe me dear mr cumbermere      most truly yours      helen holsteig    on receiving this letter i was moved by compassion for it required no stretch of imagination to picture the life of that lonely british mother and her son and i thought very carefully over the advisability of speaking to harburn and consulted the proverbs speech is silver but silence is goldenwhen in doubt play trumps second thoughts are besthe who hesitates is lost look before you leapdelays are dangerous they balanced so perfectly that i had recourse to commonsense which told me to abstain but meeting harburn at the club a few days later and finding him in a genial mood i let impulse prevail and said  by the way harburn you remember the holsteigs i had a letter from poor mrs holsteig the other day she seems terrified that theyll intern her son that particularly nice boy dont you think its time you let up on these unhappy people  the moment i reached the word holsteig i saw i had made a mistake and only went on because to have stopped at that would have been worse still the hair had bristled up on his back as it were and he said  holsteig that young pup who was off to join the german army if he could by george is he at large still this government will never learn ill remember him  harburn i stammered i spoke of this in confidence the boy is half british and a friend of mine i thought he was a friend of yours too  of mine he said no thank you no mongrels for me as to confidence cumbermere theres no such thing in war time over what concerns the countrys safety  good god i exclaimed you really are crazy on this subject that boywith his bringingup  he grinned were taking no risks he said and making no exceptions the british army or an internment camp ill see that he gets the alternatives  if you do i said rising we cease to be friends i wont have my confidence abused  oh hang it all he grumbled sit down we must all do our duty  you once complained to holsteig himself of that german peculiarity  he laughed i did he said i rememberin the train ive changed since then that pup ought to be in with all the other swinehounds but let it go  there the matter rested for he had said let it go and he was a man of his word it was however a lesson to me not to meddle with men of temperament so different from my own i wrote to young holsteig and asked him to come and lunch with me he thanked me but could not of course being confined to a fivemile radius really anxious to see him i motorbiked down to their house i found a very changed youth moody and introspective thoroughly forced in upon himself and growing bitter he had been destined for his fathers business and marooned as he was by his nationality had nothing to do but raise vegetables in their garden and read poetry and philosophynot occupations to take a young man out of himself mrs holsteig whose nerves were evidently at cracking point had become extremely bitter and lost all power of seeing the war as a whole all the ugly human qualities and hard people which the drive and pressure of a great struggle inevitably bring to the top seemed viewed by her now as if they were the normal character of her fellow countrymen and she made no allowance for the fact that those fellow countrymen had not commenced this struggle nor for the certainty that the same ugly qualities and hard people were just as surely to the fore in every other of the fighting countries the certainty she felt about her husbands honour had made her regard his internment and subsequent repatriation as a personal affront as well as a wicked injustice her tall thin figure and highcheekboned face seemed to have been scorched and withered by some inner flame she could not have been a wholesome companion for her boy in that house empty even of servants i spent a difficult afternoon in muzzling my sense of proportion and journeyed back to town sore but very sorry  i was off again with the red cross shortly after and did not return to england till august of 1918 i was unwell and went down to my cottage now free to me again the influenza epidemic was raging and there i developed a mild attack when i was convalescent my first visitor was harburn who had come down to his bungalow for a summer holiday he had not been in the room five minutes before he was off on his favourite topic my nerves must have been on edge from illness for i cannot express the disgust with which i listened to him on that occasion he seemed to me just like a dog who mumbles and chews a mouldy old bone with a sort of fury there was a kind of triumph about him too which was unpleasant though not surprising for he was more of a force than ever god save me from the fixed idea i thought when he was gone that evening i asked my old housekeeper if she had seen young mr holsteig lately  oh no she said hes been put away this five month mrs olsteig goes up once a week to see im olsteig shes nigh out of her mind poor ladythe baker says that fierce she is about the goverment  i confess i could not bring myself to go and see her  about a month after the armistice had been signed i came down to my cottage again harburn was in the same train and he gave me a lift from the station he was more like his old goodhumoured self and asked me to dinner the next day it was the first time i had met him since the victory we had a most excellent repast and drank the health of the future in some of his oldest port only when we had drawn up to the blazing wood fire in that softly lighted room with our glasses beside us and two airedales asleep at our feet did he come round to his hobby  what do you think he said suddenly leaning towards the flames some of these blazing sentimentalists want to release our huns but ive put my foot on it they wont get free till theyre out of this country and back in their precious germany and i saw the familiar spark and smoulder in his eyes  harburn i said moved by an impulse which i couldnt resist i think you ought to take a pill  he stared at me  this way madness lies i went on hate is a damned insidious disease mens souls cant stand very much of it without going pop you want purging  he laughed  hate i thrive on it the more i hate the brutes the better i feel heres to the death of every cursed hun  i looked at him steadily i often think i said that there could have been no more unhappy men on earth than cromwells ironsides or the red revolutionaries in france when their work was over and done with  whats that to do with me he said amazed  they too smote out of sheer hate and came to an end of their smiting when a mans occupations gone  youre drivelling he said sharply  far from it i answered nettled yours is a curious case harburn most of our professional hunhaters have found it a good stunt or are merely weak sentimentalists they can drop it easily enough when it ceases to be a good stunt or a parrots warcry you cant with you its mania religion when the tide ebbs and leaves you high and dry  he struck his fist on the arm of his chair upsetting his glass and awakening the airedale at his feet  i wont let it ebb he said im going on with thismark me  remember canute i muttered may i have some more port i had got up to fill my glass when i saw to my astonishment that a woman was standing in the long window which opened on to the verandah she had evidently only just come in for she was still holding the curtain in her hand it was mrs holsteig with her fine grey hair blown about her face looking strange and almost ghostly in a grey gown harburn had not seen her so i went quickly towards her hoping to get her to go out again as silently and speak to me on the verandah but she held up her hand with a gesture as if she would push me back and said  forgive my interrupting i came to speak to that man  startled by the sound of her voice harburn jumped up and spun round towards it  yes she repeated quite quietly i came to speak to you i came to put my curse on you many have put their curses on you silently i do so to your face my son lies between life and death in your prisonyour prison whether he lives or dies i curse you for what you have done to poor wives and mothersto british wives and mothers be for ever accursed goodnight  she let the curtain fall and had vanished before harburn had time to reach the window she vanished so swiftly and silently she had spoken so quietly that both he and i stood rubbing our eyes and ears  a bit theatrical he said at last  perhaps i answered slowly but you have been cursed by a live scotswoman look at those dogs  the two airedales were standing stockstill with the hair bristling on their backs  harburn suddenly laughed and it jarred the whole room  by george he said i believe thats actionable  but i was not in that mood and said tartly  if it is we are all food for judges  he laughed again this time uneasily slammed the window to bolted it and sat down again in his chair  hes got the flue i suppose he said she must think me a prize sort of idiot to have come here with such tomfoolery  but our evening was spoiled and i took my leave almost at once i went out into the roupy raw december night pondering deeply harburn had made light of it and though i suppose no man likes being cursed to his face in the presence of a friend i felt his skin was quite thick enough to stand it besides it was too cheap and crude a way of carrying on anybody can go into his neighbours house and curse himand no bones broken and yetwhat she had said was no doubt true hundreds of womenof his fellow countrywomenmust silently have put their curse on one who had been the chief compeller of their misery still he had put his curse on the huns and their belongings and i felt he was man enough to take what he had given no i thought she has only fanned the flame of his hate but by jove thats just it her curse has fortified my prophecy it was of his own state of mind that he would perish and she had whipped and deepened that state of mind and odd as it may seem i felt quite sorry for him as one is for a poor dog that goes mad does what harm he can and dies i lay awake that night a long time thinking of him and of that unhappy halfcrazed mother whose son lay between life and death  next day i went to see her but she was up in london hovering round the cage of her son no doubt i heard from her however some days later thanking me for coming and saying he was out of danger but she made no allusion to that evening visit perhaps she was ashamed of it perhaps she was demented when she came and had no remembrance thereof  soon after this i went to belgium to illustrate a book on reconstruction and found such subjects that i was not back in town till the late summer of 1919 going into my club one day i came on harburn in the smokingroom the curse had not done him much harm it seemed for he looked the picture of health  well how are you i said you look at the top of your form  never better he replied  do you remember our last evening together  he uttered a sort of gusty grunt and did not answer  that boy recovered i said whats happened to him and his mother since  the ironical young brute ive just had this from him and he handed me a letter with the hanover post mark        dear mr harburn       it was only on meeting my mother here yesterday that i      learned of her visit to you one evening last december i      wish to apologise for it since it was my illness which      caused her to so forget herself i owe you a deep debt of      gratitude for having been at least part means of giving me      the most wonderful experience of my life in that camp of      sorrowwhere there was sickness of mind and body such as i      am sure you have never seen or realised such endless      hopeless mental anguish of poor huddled creatures turning and      turning on themselves year after yeari learned to forget      myself and to do my little best for them and i learned and      i hope i shall never forget it that feeling for ones fellow      creatures is all that stands between man and death i was      going fast the other way before i was sent there i thank you      from my heart and beg to remain       very faithfully yours      harold holsteig    i put it down and said  thats not ironical he means it  bosh said harburn with the old spark and smoulder in his eyes hes pulling my legthe swinelet hun  he is not harburn i assure you  harburn got up he is i tell you he is ah those brutes well i havent done with them yet  and i heard the snap of his jaw and saw his eyes fixed fiercely on some imaginary object i changed the subject hurriedly and soon took my departure but going down the steps an old jingle came into my head and has hardly left it since   the man recovered from the bite  the dog it was that died  1919     x  in heaven and earth   we were yarning after dinner and whether because three of us were fishermen or simply that we were all english our yarns were taking a competitive turn the queerest thing seen during the war was the subject of our tongues and it was not till after several titbits had been digested that mallinson the painter ill and ironical blueeyed and with a fair pointed beard took his pipe out of his mouth and said  well you chaps what i saw last week down in kent takes some beating id been sketching in a hayfield and was just making back along the top hedge to the lane when i heard a sound from the other side like a mans crying i put my eye to a gap and there about three yards in was a greyhaired bloke in a norfolk jacket and flannel trousers digging like a fiend and crying like a babyblowing and gasping and sobbing tears and sweat rolling down into his beard like rivers hed plunge his pick in scratch and shovel and hack at the roots as if for dear lifehe was making the hole too close to the hedge of courseand all the time carrying on like that i thought he must be digging his own grave at least suddenly he put his pick down and there just under the hedge i saw a dead brown dog lying on its side all limp i never see a dead animal myself you know without a bit of a choke theyre so soft and lissom the peace and the pitya sort of look of whywhywhen i was so alive well this elderly johnny took a good squint at it to see if the hole was big enough then off he went again sobbing and digging like a fiend it was really a bit too weird and i mouched off but when id gone about half a mile i got an attack of the wanttoknows came back and sneaked along the hedge there he was still but he had finished and was having a mop round and putting the last touches to a heap of stones i strolled up and said  hot work sir digging this weather  he was a goodlooking old greybeard with an intellectual face high forehead and all that  im not used to it he said looking at his blisters  been burying a dog horrid job thatfavourite im afraid  he seemed in two minds whether to shut me up and move off but he didnt  yes he said its cut me up horribly i never condemned a creature to death before and dogs seem to know  ah theyre pretty uncanny i said for i wasnt going to let on of course that i had seen him  i wouldnt have done it but for the war he muttered but she stole eggs poor thing you couldnt break her of it she ate three times as much as any other dog too and in spite of it was always a perfect skeletonsomething wrong inside the sort of dog you know no one would take or treat decently if they did bad habits of every kind poor dear i bought her because she was being starved but she trusted me thats why i feel so like a murderer when the vet and i were in the yard discussing her she knew there was something wrongshe kept looking at my face i very nearly went back on it only having got him out on purpose i was ashamed to we brought her down here and on the way she found the remains of a rabbit about a week oldthat was one of her accomplishmentsbringing me the most fearful offal she brought it up wagging her tailas much as to say seei am some use the vet tied her up here and took his gun she wagged her tail at that too and i ran away when the shot came my own little spaniel fawned on methey are uncannylicked me all over never was so gushing seemed saying what awful power you have i do love you you wouldnt do that to me would you weve got rid of that other one though when i came back here to bury the poor thing and saw her lying on her side so still i made a real fool of myself i was patting her an hour ago talking to her as if she were a human being judas  mallinson put his pipe back into his mouth just think of it he said the same creatures who are blowing each other to little bits all the time bombing babies roasting fellow creatures in the air and cheering while they roast working day and night to inflict every imaginable kind of horror on other men exactly like themselvesthese same chaps are capable of feeling like that about shooting a wretched ill cur of a dog no good to anybody there are more things in heaven and earth and he relit his pipe which had gone out  his yarn took the prize  1917     xi  the mother stone   it was after dinner and five elderly englishmen were discussing the causes of the war  well said travers a big freshcoloured greybeard with little twinkling eyes and very slow speech you gentlemen know more about it than i do but i bet you i can lay my finger on the cause of the war at any minute  there was an instant clamour of jeering but a man called askew who knew travers well laughed and said come lets have it travers turned those twinkling little eyes of his slowly round the circle and with heavy hesitating modesty began  well mr askew it was in 67 or 68 that this happened to a great big feller of my acquaintance named rayone of those fellers you know that are always on the lookout to make their fortunes and never do this ray was coming back south one day after a huntin trip hed been in whats now called bechuanaland and he was in a pretty bad way when he walked one evenin into the camp of one of those wanderin boers that class of boer has disappeared now they had no farms of their own but just moved on with their stock and their boys and when they came to good pasture theyd outspan and stay there till theyd cleared it outand then trek on again well this old boer told ray to come right in and take a meal and heaven knows what it was made of for those old boers theyd eat the devil himself without onion sauce and relish him after the meal the old boer and ray sat smokin and yarnin in the door of the tent because in those days these wanderin boers used tents right close by in the front the children were playin in the dust a game like marbles with three or four round stones and theyd pitch em up to another stone they called the moerklip or motherstoneone two and pick uptwo three and pick upyou know the game of marbles well the sun was settin and presently ray noticed this moerklip that they were pitchin em up to shinin and he looked at it and he said to the old boer whats that stone the children are playin with and the old boer looked at him and looked at the stone and said its just a stone and went on smokin  well ray went down on his knees and picked up the stone and weighed it in his hand about the size of a hazelnut it was and lookedwell it looked like a piece of alum but the more he looked at it the more he thought by jove i believe its a diamond  so he said to the old boer where did the children get this stone and the old boer said oh the shepherd picked it up somewhere and ray said where did he pick it up and the old boer waved his hand and said over the kopje there beyond the river how should i know brothera stone is a stone so ray said you let me take this stone away with me and the old boer went on smokin and he said one stones the same as another take it brother and ray said if its what i think ill give you half the price i get for it  the old boer smiled and said thats all right brother take it take it  the next morning ray left this old boer and when he was going he said to him well he said i believe this is a valuable stone and the old boer smiled because he knew one stone was the same as another  the first place ray came to was c and he went to the hotel and in the evenin he began talkin about the stone and they all laughed at him because in those days nobody had heard of diamonds in south africa so presently he lost his temper and pulled out the stone and showed it round but nobody thought it was a diamond and they all laughed at him the more then one of the fellers said if its a diamond it ought to cut glass  ray took the stone and by jove he cut his name on the window and there it isive seen iton the bar window of that hotel well next day you bet he travelled straight back to where the old boer told him the shepherd had picked up the stone and he went to a native chief called jointje and said to him jointje he said i go a journey while i go you go about and send all your boys about and look for all the stones that shine like this one and when i come back if you find me plenty i give you gun and jointje said that all right boss  and ray went down to cape town and took the stone to a jeweller and the jeweller told him it was a diamond of about 30 or 40 carats and gave him five hundred pound for it so he bought a waggon and a span of oxen to give to the old boer and went back to jointje the niggers had collected skinfuls of stones of all kinds and out of all the skinfuls ray found three or four diamonds so he went to work and got another feller to back him and between them they made the government move the rush began and they found that place near kimberley and after that they found de beers and after that kimberley itself  travers stopped and looked around him  ray made his fortune i suppose  no mr askew the unfortunate feller made next to nothin he was one of those fellers that never do any good for themselves  but what has all this to do with the war  again travers looked round and more slowly than ever said  without that game of marbles would there have been a moerklipwithout the moerklip would there have been a kimberleywithout kimberley would there have been a rhodeswithout a rhodes would there have been a raidwithout a raid would the boers have started arminif the boers hadnt armed would there have been a transvaal war and if there hadnt been the transvaal war would there have been the incident of those two german ships we held up and all the general feelin in germany that gave the kaiser the chance to start his navy programme in 1900 and if the germans hadnt built their navy would their heads have swelled till they challenged the world and should we have had this war  he slowly drew a hand from his pocket and put it on the table on the little finger was blazing an enormous diamond  my father he said bought it of the jeweller  the motherstone glittered and glowed and the five englishmen fixed their eyes on it in silence some of them had been in the boer war and three of them had sons in this at last one of them said  well thats seeing god in a dewdrop with a vengeance what about the old boer  traverss little eyes twinkled  well he said ray told me the old feller just looked at him as if he thought hed done a damn silly thing to give him a waggon and he nodded his old head and said laughin in his beard wish you good luck brother with your stone you couldnt humbug that old boer he knew one stone was the same as another  1914     xii  poirot and bidan  a recollection   coming one dark december evening out of the hospital courtyard into the corridor which led to my little workroom i was conscious of two new arrivals there were several men round the stove but these two were sitting apart on a bench close to my door we used to get men in all stages of decrepitude but i had never seen two who looked so completely under the weather they were the extremesin age in colouring in figure in everything and they sat there not speaking with every appearance of apathy and exhaustion the one was a boy perhaps nineteen with a sunken hairless greywhite face under his peaked capnever surely was face so grey he sat with his long greyblue overcoat open at the knees and his long emaciated hands nervously rubbing each other between them intensely forlorn he looked and i remember thinking that boys dying this was bidan  the others face in just the glimpse i had of it was as if carved out of wood except for that something you see behind the masks of driven bullocks deeply resentful his cap was off and one saw he was greyhaired his cheeks stretched over cheekbones solid as doorhandles were a purplishred his grey moustache was damp his light blue eyes stared like a codfishs he reminded me queerly of those parisian cochers one still sees under their shining hats wearing an expression of being your enemy his short stocky figure was dumped stolidly as if he meant never to move again on his thick legs and feet he wore mufflings of cloth boot into which his patched and stained greyblue trousers were tucked one of his gloved hands was stretched out stiff on his knee this was poirot  two more dissimilar creatures were never blown together into our haven so far as i remember they had both been in hospital about six months and their ailments were roughly speaking youth and age bidan had not finished his training when his weak constitution gave way under it poirot was a territorial who had dug behind the front till rheumatism claimed him for its own bidan who had fair hair and rather beautiful brown eyes over which the lids could hardly keep up came from aixenprovence in the very south poirot from nancy in the northeast i made their acquaintance the next morning  the cleaning of old poirot took literally speaking days to accomplish such an encrusted case we had never seen nor was it possible to go otherwise than slowly against his prejudices one who unless taken exactly the right way considered everyone leagued with nature to get the better of him he had reached that state when the soul sticks its toes in and refuses to budge a coachmanin civil lifea socialist a freethinker a wit he was the apex ofshall we saydetermination his moral being was encrusted with perversity as his poor hands and feet with dirt oil was the only thing for him and i for one used oil on him morally and physically for months he was a character his left handwhich he was never tired of saying the majors had ruined ah les cochons by leaving it alonewas stiff in all its joints so that the fingers would not bend and the little finger of the right hand le petit le coquin lempereur as he would severally call it was embellished by chalky excrescences the old fellow had that peculiar artfulness which comes from lifelong dealing with horses and he knew exactly how far and how quickly it was advisable for him to mend in health about the third day he made up his mind that he wished to remain with us at least until the warm weather came for that it would be necessaryhe concludedto make a cheering amount of progress but not too much and this he set himself to do he was convinced one could see that after peace had been declared and compensation assured him he would recover the use of his hand even if lempereur remained stiff and chalky as a matter of fact i think he was mistaken and will never have a supple left hand again but his arms were so brawny his constitution so vigorous and his legs improved so rapidly under the necessity of taking him down into the little town for his glass of an afternoon that one felt he might possibly be digging again sooner than he intended  ah les cochons he would say while one finger does not move they shall pay me he was very bitter against all majors save one who it seemed had actually sympathised with him and all députés who for him constituted the powers of darkness drawing their salaries and sitting in their chairs ah les chameaux  though he was several years younger than oneself one always thought of him as old poirot indeed he was soon called le grandpère though no more confirmed bachelor ever inhabited the world he was a regular miller of dee caring for nobody and yet he was likeable that humorous old stoic who suffered from gallstones and bore horrible bouts of pain like a hero in spite of all his disabilities his health and appearance soon became robust in our easygoing hospital where no one was harried the food excellent and the air good he would tell you that his father lived to eighty and his grandfather to a hundred both strong men though not so strong as his old master the squire of whose feats in the huntingfield he would give most staggering accounts in an argot which could only be followed by instinct a great narrator he would describe at length life in the town of nancy where when the war broke out he was driving a market cart and distributing vegetables which had made him an authority on municipal reform though an incorrigible joker his stockfish countenance would remain perfectly grave except for an occasional hoarse chuckle you would have thought he had no more power of compassion than a cat no more sensibility than a chinese idol but this was not so in his wooden shrewd distrustful way he responded to sympathy and was even sorry for others i used to like very much his attitude to the young stablecompanion who had arrived with him he had no contempt such as he might easily have felt for so weakly a creature but rather a real indulgence towards his feebleness ah he would say at first he wont make old bonesthat one but he seemed extremely pleased when in a fortnight or so he had to modify that view for bidan prosper prospered more rapidly even than himself that grey look was out of the boys face within three weeks it was wonderful to watch him come back to life till at last he could say with his dreadful provençal twang that he felt très biang a most amiable youth he had been a cook and his chief ambition was to travel till he had attained the summit of mortal hopes and was cooking at the ritz in london when he came to us his limbs seemed almost to have lost their joints they wambled so he had no muscle at all utter anæmia had hold of all his body and all but a corner of his french spirit round that unquenchable gleam of gaiety the rest of him slowly rallied with proper food and air and freedom he began to have a faint pink flush in his chinawhite cheeks his lids no longer drooped his limbs seemed to regain their joints his hands ceased to swell he complained less and less of the pains about his heart when of a morning he was finished with and le grandpère was having his hands done they would engage in lively reparteeoblivious of ones presence we began to feel that this grey ghost of a youth had been well named after all when they called him prosper so lyrical would he wax over the constitution and cooking of bouillabaisse over the south and the buildings of his native aixenprovence in all france you could not have found a greater contrast than those two who had come to us so under the weather nor in all france two better instances of the way men can regain health of body and spirit in the right surroundings  we had a tremendous fall of snow that winter and had to dig ourselves out of it poirot and bidan were of those who dug it was amusing to watch them bidan dug easily without afterthought le grandpère dug with half an eye at least on his future in spite of those stiff fingers he shifted a lot of snow but he rested on his shovel whenever he thought you could see himfor he was full of human nature  to see him and bidan set off for town together bidan pale and wambling a little still but gay with a kind of birdlike detachment le grandpère stocky wooden planting his huge feet rather wide apart and regarding his companion the frosted trees and the whole wide world with his humorous stare  once i regret to say when spring was beginning to come bidanprosper returned on le grandpères arm with the utmost difficulty owing to the presence within him of a liquid called clairette de die no amount of which could subdue le grandpères power of planting one foot before the other bidanprosper arrived hilarious revealing to the world unsuspected passions he awoke next morning sad pale penitent poirot au contraire was morose the whole evening and awoke next morning exactly the same as usual in such different ways does the gift of the gods affect us  they had their habits so diverse their constitutions and their dreamsalas not yet realised i know not where they may be now bidanprosper cannot yet be cooking at the ritz in london town but grandpère poirot may perchance be distributing again his vegetables in the streets of nancy driving his two good little horsesdes gaillardswith the reins hooked round lempereur good friendsgood luck     xiii  the muffled ship   it was cold and grey but the band on shore was playing and the flags on shore were fluttering and the long doubletiered wharf crowded with welcomers in each of its open gaps when our great ship slowly drew alongside packed with cheering chattering crowds of khaki figures letting go all the pentup excitement of getting home from the war the air was full of songs and laughter of cheers and shouted questions the hooting of the launches sirens the fluttering flags and hands and handkerchiefs and there were faces of old women and of girls intent expectant and the white gulls were floating against the grey sky when our ship listed slightly by those thousands of figures straining towards the land which had bred them gently slurred up against the high wharf and was made fast  the landing went on till night had long fallen and the band was gone at last the chatter the words of command the snatches of song and that most favourite chorus me and my girl died away and the wharf was silent and the ship silent and a wonderful clear dark beauty usurped the spaces of the sky by the light of the stars and a half moon the far harbour shores were just visible the huddled buildings on the near shore the spiring masts and feathery appanage of ropes on the moored ship and one bloodred light above the black water the night had all that breathless beauty which steeps the soul in a quivering quiet rapture  then it was that clearly as if i had been a welcomer standing on land in one of the wharf gaps i saw her comeslow slow creeping up the narrow channel in beside the wharf a great grey silent ship at first i thought her utterly empty deserted possessed only by the thick coiled cables forward the huge rusty anchors the piledup machinery of structure and funnel and mast weird in the blue darkness a lantern on the wharf cast a bobbing golden gleam deep into the oily water at her side gungrey perfectly mute she ceased to move coming to rest against the wharf and then with a shiver i saw that something clung round her a grey film or emanation which shifted and hovered like the invisible wings of birds in a thick mist gradually to my straining eyes that filmy emanation granulated and became faces attached to grey filmy forms thousands on thousands and every face bent towards the shore staring as it seemed through me at all that was behind me slowly very slowly i made them outfaces of helmeted soldiers bulky with the gear of battle their arms outstretched and the lips of every one opened so that i expected to hear the sound of cheering but no sound came now i could see their eyes they seemed to beseechlike the eyes of a little eager boy who asks his mother something she cannot tell him and their outstretched hands seemed trying to reach her lovingly desperately trying to reach her and those opened lips how terribly they seemed trying to speak mother mother canada as if i had heard i knew they were sayingthose opened lips which could speak no more mother mother canada home home  and then away down the wharf some one chanted me and my girl and silent as she had come the muffled ship vanished in all her length with those grey forms and those mute faces and i was standing again in the bows beside a huge hawser below me the golden gleam bobbing deep in the oily water and above me the cold start in beauty shining     xiv  heritage  an impression   from that garden seat one could see the old low house of pinkish brick with a path of queershaped flagstones running its length and the tall grey chapel from which came the humming and chanting and organ drone of the confirmation service but for that and the voices of two gardeners working below us among the fruits and flowers the july hush was complete and suddenly one became aware of being watched  that thin white windmill on the hill  away past the house perhaps six hundred yards it stood ghostly with a face like that of a darkeyed white owl made by the crossing of its narrow sails with a black companiona yewtree cut to pyramid form on the central point of sussexit was watching us for though one must presume it built of old time by man it looked up there against the sky with its owls face and its cross like a christopagan presence  what exactly paganism was we shall never know what exactly christianism is we are as little likely to discover but here and there the two principles seem to dwell together in amity for paganism believed in the healthy and joyful body and christianism in the soul superior thereto and where we were sitting that summer day was the home of bodies wrecked yet learning to be joyful and of souls not above the process  we moved from the greywood seat and came on tiptoe to where house and chapel formed a courtyard the doors were open and we stood unseen listening from the centre of a square stone fountain a little bubble of water came up and niched along one high wall a number of white pigeons were preening their feathers silent and almost motionless as though attending to the service  the sheer emotion of church sounds will now and then steal away reason from the unbeliever and take him drugged and dreaming defend o lord this thy child so it came out to us in the dream and drowse of summer which the little bubble of water cooled  in his robescardinal and white and violetthe good bishop stood in full sunlight speaking to the crippled and the airraid children in their drilled rows under the shade of the doves wall and one felt far from this age as if one had strayed back into that time when the builders of the old house laid slow brick on brick wetting their whistles on mead and knowing not tobacco  and then out by the chapel porch moved three forms in blue with red neckties and we were again in this new age watching the faces of those listening children the good bishop was making them feel that he was happy in their presence and that made them happy in his for the great thing about life is the goingout of friendliness from being to being and if a place be beautiful and friendliness ever on the peacepath there what more can we desire and yethow ironical this place of healing this beautiful heritage verily a heritage of our modern civilisation which makes all this healing necessary if life were the offspring of friendliness and beautys long companionship there would be no crippled children no airraid children none of those good fellows in blue with red ties and maimed limbs and the colony to which the bishop spoke standing greyheaded in the sun would be dissolved friendliness seems so natural beauty so appropriate to this earth but in this torn world they are as fugitives who nest together here and there yet stumbling by chance on their dovecotes and fluttering happiness one makes a little golden note which does not fade off the tablet                                       how entrancing it is to look at a number of faces never seen beforeand how exasperatingstamped coins of lives quite separate quite different from every other masks pallid sunburned smooth or crumpled to peep behind which one longs as a lover looking for his lady at carnival or a man aching at summer beauty which he cannot quite fathom and possess if one had a thousand lives and time to know and sympathy to understand the heart of every creature met with one would wanta million may life make us all intuitive strip away selfconsciousness and give us sunshine and unknown faces  what were they all feeling and thinkingthose little cripples doing their drill on crutches those airraid waifs swelling their cockney chests rising on their toes puffing their cheeks out in anxiety to do their best those soldiers in their blue slops with a hand gone there and a leg gone here and this and that grievous disability all carrying on so cheerfully  values are queer in this world we are accustomed to exalt those who can say bo to a goose but that gift of expression which twines a halo round a lofty brow is no guarantee of goodness in the wearer the really good are those plucky folk who plod their silent often suffering generally exploited ways from birth to death out of reach of the music of mans praise  the first thing each child cripple makes here is a little symbolic ladder in making it he climbs a rung on the way to his sky of selfsupport and when at last he leaves this home he steps off the top of it into the blue andso they saywalks there upright and undismayed as if he had never suffered at fates hands but what do he and shefor many are of the pleasant sexthink of the sky when they get there that dusty and smokeladen sky of the industrialism which begat them how can they breathe in it coming from this place of flowers and fresh air of clean bright workshops and elegant huts which they on crutches built for themselves  masters of british industry and leaders of the men and women who slave to make its wheels go round make a pilgrimage to this spot and learn what foul disfigurement you have brought on the land of england these last five generations the natural loveliness in this heritage is no greater than the loveliness that used to be in a thousand places which you have blotted out of the book of beauty with your smuts and wheels your wires and welter and to what end to manufacture crippled children and pale peaky little cockneys whose nerves are gone and to be sure the railways and motor cars which will bring you here to see them coming to life once more in sane and natural surroundings blind and deaf and dumb industrialism is the accursed thing in this land and in all others  if only we could send all our crippled soldiers to relearn life in places such as this if instead of some forty or fifty forty or fifty thousand could begin again under the gaze of that white windmill if they could slough off here not only those last horrors but the dinge and drang of their upbringing in towns where wheels go round lights flare streets reek and no larks sing save some little blinded victim in a cage poor william blake   i will not cease from fighting nor shall my sword sleep in my hand  till we have built jerusalem in englands green and pleasant land  a long vigil his sword is keeping while the clock strikes every hour of the twentyfour we have not yet even laid jerusalems foundation stone ask one of those maimed soldier boys i like it here oh yes its very pleasant for a change but he hastens to tell you that he goes in to brighton every day to his training school as if that saved the situation almost surprised he seems that beauty and peace and good air are not intolerable to his townbred soul the towns have got usnearly all not until we let beauty and the quiet voice of the fields and the scent of clover creep again into our nerves shall we begin to build jerusalem and learn peacefulness once more the countryman hates strife it breaks his dream and life should have its covering of dreambirds flight birds song wind in the ashtrees and the corn tall lilies glistening the evening shadows slanting out the night murmuring of waters there is no other genuine dream without it to sweeten all life is harsh and shrill and eastwind dry and evil overruns her more quickly than blight begums the rosetree or frost blackens fern of a cold june night we elders are past remaking england but our children even these crippled children here may yet take a hand  we left the tinies to the lastall montessorians and some of them little cripples too but with cheeks so red that they looked as if the colour must come off they lived in a house past the white mill across the common and they led us by the hand down spotless corridors into white dormitories the smile of the prettiest little maid of them all was the last thing one saw leaving that heritage of print frocks and childrens faces of flowers and nightingales under the lee of a group of pines the only dark beauty in the long sunlight     xv  a green hill far away   was it indeed only last march or in another life that i climbed this green hill on that day of dolour the sunday after the last great german offensive began a beautiful sunwarmed day it was when the wild thyme on the southern slope smelled sweet and the distant sea was a glitter of gold lying on the grass pressing my cheek to its warmth i tried to get solace for that new dread which seemed so cruelly unnatural after four years of warmisery  if only it were all over i said to myself and i could come here and to all the lovely places i know without this awful contraction of the heart and this knowledge that at every tick of my watch some human body is being mangled or destroyed ah if only i could will there never be an end  and now there is an end and i am up on this green hill once more in december sunlight with the distant sea a glitter of gold and there is no cramp in my heart no miasma clinging to my senses peace it is still incredible no more to hear with the ears of the nerves the ceaseless roll of gunfire or see with the eyes of the nerves drowning men gaping wounds and death peace actually peace the war has gone on so long that many of us have forgotten the sense of outrage and amazement we had those first days of august 1914 when it all began but i have not forgotten nor ever shall  in some of usi think in many who could not voice itthe war has left chiefly this feeling if only i could find a country where men cared less for all that they seem to care for where they cared more for beauty for nature for being kindly to each other if only i could find that green hill far away of the songs of theocritus of the life of st francis there is no more among the nations than there is of dew on grass in an east wind if we ever thought otherwise we are disillusioned now yet there is peace again and the souls of men freshmurdered are not flying into our lungs with every breath we draw  each day this thought of peace becomes more real and blessed i can lie on this green hill and praise creation that i am alive in a world of beauty i can go to sleep up here with the coverlet of sunlight warm on my body and not wake to that old dull misery i can even dream with a light heart for my fair dreams will not be spoiled by waking and my bad dreams will be cured the moment i open my eyes i can look up at that blue sky without seeing trailed across it a mirage of the long horror a film picture of all the things that have been done by men to men at last i can gaze up at it limpid and blue without a dogging melancholy and i can gaze down at that far gleam of sea knowing that there is no murk of murder on it any more  and the flight of birds the gulls and rooks and little brown wavering things which flit out and along the edge of the chalkpits is once more refreshment to me utterly untempered a merle is singing in a bramble thicket the dew has not yet dried off the bramble leaves a feather of a moon floats across the sky the distance sends forth homely murmurs the sun warms my cheeks and all of this is pure joy no hawk of dread and horror keeps swooping down and bearing off the little birds of happiness no accusing conscience starts forth and beckons me away from pleasure everywhere is supreme and flawless beauty whether one looks at this tiny snail shell marvellously chased and marked a very elfs horn whose open mouth is coloured rose or gazes down at the flat land between here and the sea wandering under the smile of the afternoon sunlight seeming almost to be alive hedgeless with its many watching trees and silver gulls hovering above the mushroomcoloured ploughs and fields green in manifold hues whether one muses on this little pink daisy born so out of time or watches that valley of brownrosegrey woods under the drifting shadows of lowhanging chalky cloudsall is perfect as only nature can be perfect on a lovely day when the mind of him who looks on her is at rest  on this green hill i am nearer than i have been yet to realisation of the difference between war and peace in our civilian lives hardly anything has been changedwe do not get more butter or more petrol the garb and machinery of war still shroud us journals still drip hate but in our spirits there is all the difference between gradual dying and gradual recovery from sickness  at the beginning of the war a certain artist so one heard shut himself away in his house and garden taking in no newspaper receiving no visitors listening to no breath of the war seeing no sight of it so he lived buried in his work and his flowersi know not for how long was he wise or did he suffer even more than the rest of us who shut nothing away can man indeed shut out the very quality of his firmament or bar himself away from the general misery of his species  this gradual recovery of the worldthis slow reopening of the great flower lifeis beautiful to feel and see i press my hand flat and hard down on those blades of grass then take it away and watch them very slowly raise themselves and shake off the bruise so it is and will be with us for a long time to come the cramp of war was deep in us as an iron frost in the earth of all the countless millions who have fought and nursed and written and spoken and dug and sewn and worked in a thousand other ways to help on the business of killing hardly any have laboured in real love of war ironical indeed that perhaps the most beautiful poem written these four years julian grenfells into battle was in heartfelt praise of fighting but if one could gather the deep curses breathed by man and woman upon war since the first bugle was blown the dirge of them could not be contained in the air which wraps this earth  and yet the green hill where dwell beauty and kindliness is still far away will it ever be nearer men have fought even on this green hill where i am lying by the rampart markings on its chalk and grass it has surely served for an encampment the beauty of day and night the larks song the sweetscented growing things the rapture of health and of pure air the majesty of the stars and the gladness of sunlight of song and dance and simple friendliness have never been enough for men we crave our turbulent fate can wars then ever cease look in mens faces read their writings and beneath masks and hypocrisies note the restless creeping of the tiger spirit there has never been anything to prevent the millennium except the nature of the human being there are not enough lovers of beauty among men it all comes back to that not enough who want the green hill far awaywho naturally hate disharmony and the greed ugliness restlessness cruelty which are its parents and its children  will there ever be more lovers of beauty in proportion to those who are indifferent to beauty who shall answer that question yet on the answer depends peace men may have a mint of sterling qualitiesbe vigorous adventurous brave upright and selfsacrificing be preachers and teachers keen coolheaded just industriousif they have not the love of beauty they will still be making wars man is a fighting animal with sense of the ridiculous enough to know that he is a fool to fight but not sense of the sublime enough to stop him ah well we have peace  it is happiness greater than i have known for four years and four months to lie here and let that thought go on its wings quiet and free as the wind stealing soft from the sea and blessed as the sunlight on this green hill  1918      part ii   of peacetime      i   spindleberries   the celebrated painter scudamorewhose studies of nature had been hung on the line for so many years that he had forgotten the days when not yet in the scudamore manner they depended from the skystood where his cousin had left him so abruptly his lips between comely grey moustache and comely pointed beard wore a mortified smile and he gazed rather dazedly at the spindleberries fallen on to the flagged courtyard from the branch she had brought to show him why had she thrown up her head as if he had struck her and whisked round so that those dullpink berries quivered and lost their raindrops and four had fallen he had but said charming id like to use them and she had answered god and rushed away alicia really was crazed who would have thought that once she had been so adorable he stooped and picked up the four berriesa beautiful colour that dull pink and from below the coatings of success and the scudamore manner a little thrill came up the stir of emotional vision paint what good how express he went across to the low wall which divided the courtyard of his expensively restored and beautiful old house from the first flood of the river arun wandering silvery in pale winter sunlight yes indeed how express nature its translucence and mysterious unities its mood never the same from hour to hour those browntufted rushes over there against the gold grey of light and waterthose restless hovering white gulls a kind of disgust at his own celebrated manner welled up within himthe disgust akin to alicias god beauty what usehow express it had she been thinking the same thing  he looked at the four pink berries glistening on the grey stone of the wall and memory stirred what a lovely girl she had been with her greygreen eyes shining under long lashes the rosepetal colour in her cheeks and the toofine dark hairnow so very greyalways blowing a little wild an enchanting enthusiastic creature he remembered as if it had been but last week that day when they started from arundel station by the road to burpham when he was twentynine and she twentyfive both of them painters and neither of them fameda day of showers and sunlight in the middle of march and nature preparing for full spring how they had chattered at first and when their arms touched how he had thrilled and the colour had deepened in her wet cheeks and then gradually they had grown silent a wonderful walk which seemed leading so surely to a more wonderful end they had wandered round through the village and down past the chalkpit and jacobs ladder onto the field path and so to the riverbank and he had taken her ever so gently round the waist still silent waiting for that moment when his heart would leap out of him in words and hershe was surewould leap to meet it the path entered a thicket of blackthorn with a few primroses close to the little river running full and gentle the last drops of a shower were falling but the sun had burst through and the sky above the thicket was cleared to the blue of speedwell flowers suddenly she had stopped and cried look dick oh look its heaven a high bush of blackthorn was lifted there starry white against the blue and that bright cloud it seemed to sing it was so lovely the whole of spring was in it but the sight of her ecstatic face had broken down all his restraint and tightening his arm round her he had kissed her lips he remembered still the expression of her face like a childs startled out of sleep she had gone rigid gasped started away from him quivered and gulped and broken suddenly into sobs then slipping from his arm she had fled he had stood at first amazed and hurt utterly bewildered then recovering a little had hunted for her full half an hour before at last he found her sitting on wet grass with a stony look on her face he had said nothing and she nothing except to murmur lets go on we shall miss our train and all the rest of that day and the day after until they parted he had suffered from the feeling of having tumbled down off some high perch in her estimation he had not liked it at all it had made him very angry never from that day to this had he thought of it as anything but a piece of wanton prudery had ithad it been something else  he looked at the four pink berries and as if they had uncanny power to turn the wheel of memory he saw another vision of his cousin five years later he was married by then and already hung on the line with his wife he had gone down to alicias country cottage a summer night just dark and very warm after many exhortations she had brought into the little drawingroom her last finished picture he could see her now placing it where the light fell her tall slight form already rather sharp and meagre as the figures of some women grow at thirty if they are not married the nervous fluttering look on her charming face as though she could hardly bear this inspection the way she raised her shoulder just a little as if to ward off an expected blow of condemnation no need it had been a beautiful thing a quite surprisingly beautiful study of night he remembered with what a really jealous ache he had gazed at ita better thing than he had ever done himself and frankly he had said so her eyes had shone with pleasure  do you really like it i tried so hard  the day you show that my dear he had said your names made she had clasped her hands and simply sighed oh dick he had felt quite happy in her happiness and presently the three of them had taken their chairs out beyond the curtains on to the dark verandah had talked a little then somehow fallen silent a wonderful warm black grapebloom night exquisitely gracious and inviting the stars very high and white the flowers glimmering in the gardenbeds and against the deep dark blue roses hanging unearthly stained with beauty there was a scent of honeysuckle he remembered and many moths came fluttering by towards the tall narrow chink of light between the curtains alicia had sat leaning forward elbows on knees ears buried in her hands probably they were silent because she sat like that once he heard her whisper to herself lovely lovely oh god how lovely his wife feeling the dew had gone in and he had followed alicia had not seemed to notice but when she too came in her eyes were glistening with tears she said something about bed in a queer voice they had taken candles and gone up next morning going to her little studio to give her advice about that picture he had been literally horrified to see it streaked with lines of chinese whitealicia standing before it was dashing her brush in broad smears across and across she heard him and turned round there was a hard red spot in either cheek and she said in a quivering voice it was blasphemy thats all and turning her back on him she had gone on smearing it with chinese white without a word he had turned tail in simple disgust indeed so deep had been his vexation at that wanton destruction of the best thing she had ever done or was ever likely to do that he had avoided her for years he had always had a horror of eccentricity to have planted her foot firmly on the ladder of fame and then deliberately kicked it away to have wantonly foregone this chance of making moneyfor she had but a mere pittance it had seemed to him really too exasperating a thing only to be explained by tapping ones forehead every now and then he still heard of her living down there spending her days out in the woods and fields and sometimes even her nights they said and steadily growing poorer and thinner and more eccentric becoming in short impossibly difficult as only englishwomen can people would speak of her as such a dear and talk of her charm but always with that shrug which is hard to bear when applied to ones relations what she did with the productions of her brush he never inquired too disillusioned by that experience poor alicia  the pink berries glowed on the grey stone and he had yet another memory a family occasion when uncle martin scudamore departed this life and they all went up to bury him and hear his will the old chap whom they had looked on as a bit of a disgrace moneygrubbing up in the little grey yorkshire town which owed its rise to his factory was expected to make amends by his death for he had never marriedtoo sunk in industry apparently to have the time by tacit agreement his nephews and nieces had selected the inn at bolton abbey nearest beauty spot for their stay they had driven six miles to the funeral in three carriages alicia had gone with him and his brother the solicitor in her plain black clothes she looked quite charming in spite of the silver threads already thick in her fine dark hair loosened by the moor wind she had talked of painting to him with all her old enthusiasm and her eyes had seemed to linger on his face as if she still had a little weakness for him he had quite enjoyed that drive they had come rather abruptly on the small grimy town clinging to the riverbanks with old martins long yellowbrick house dominating it about two hundred yards above the mills suddenly under the rug he felt alicias hand seize his with a sort of desperation for all the world as if she were clinging to something to support her indeed he was sure she did not know it was his hand she squeezed the cobbled streets the muddylooking water the dingy staring factories the yellow staring house the little darkclothed dreadfully plain workpeople all turned out to do a last honour to their creator the hideous new grey church the dismal service the brandnew tombstonesand all of a glorious autumn day it was inexpressibly sordidtoo ugly for words afterwards the will was read to them seated decorously on bright mahogany chairs in the yellow mansion a very satisfactory will distributing in perfectly adjusted portions to his own kinsfolk and nobody else a very considerable wealth scudamore had listened to it dreamily with his eyes fixed on an oily picture thinking my god what a thing and longing to be back in the carriage smoking a cigar to take the reek of black clothes and sherrysherryout of his nostrils he happened to look at alicia her eyes were closed her lips always sweetlooking quivered amusedly and at that very moment the will came to her name he saw those eyes open wide and marked a beautiful pink flush quite like that of old days come into her thin cheeks splendid he had thought its really jolly for her i am glad now she wont have to pinch splendid he shared with her to the full the surprised relief showing in her still beautiful face  all the way home in the carriage he felt at least as happy over her good fortune as over his own which had been substantial he took her hand under the rug and squeezed it and she answered with a long gentle pressure quite unlike the clutch when they were driving in that same evening he strolled out to where the river curved below the abbey the sun had not quite set and its last smoky radiance slanted into the burnished autumn woods some whitefaced herefords were grazing in lush grass the river rippled and gleamed all over golden scales about that scene was the magic which has so often startled the hearts of painters the wistful goldthe enchantment of a dream for some minutes he had gazed with delight which had in it a sort of despair a little crisp rustle ran along the bushes the leaves fluttered then hung quite still and he heard a voicealiciasspeaking my lovely lovely world and moving forward a step he saw her standing on the riverbank braced against the trunk of a birchtree her head thrown back and her arms stretched wide apart as though to clasp the lovely world she had apostrophised to have gone up to her would have been like breaking up a lovers interview and he turned round instead and went away  a week later he heard from his brother that alicia had refused her legacy i dont want it her letter had said simply i couldnt bear to take it give it to those poor people who live in that awful place really eccentricity could go no further they decided to go down and see her such mad neglect of her own good must not be permitted without some effort to prevent it they found her very thin and charming humble but quite obstinate in her refusal oh i couldnt really i should be so unhappy those poor little stunted people who made it all for him that little awful town i simply couldnt be reminded dont talk about it please im quite all right as i am they had threatened her with lurid pictures of the workhouse and a destitute old age to no purpose she would not take the money she had been forty when she refused that aid from heavenforty and already past any hope of marriage for though scudamore had never known for certain that she had ever wished or hoped for marriage he had his theorythat all her eccentricity came from wasted sexual instinct this last folly had seemed to him monstrous enough to be pathetic and he no longer avoided her indeed he would often walk over to tea in her little hermitage with uncle martins money he had bought and restored the beautiful old house over the river arun and was now only five miles from alicias across country she too would come tramping over at all hours floating in with wild flowers or ferns which she would put into water the moment she arrived she had ceased to wear hats and had by now a very doubtful reputation for sanity about the countryside this was the period when watts was on every painters tongue and he seldom saw alicia without a disputation concerning that famous symbolist personally he had no use for watts resenting his faulty drawing and crude allegories but alicia always maintained with her extravagant fervour that he was great because he tried to paint the soul of things she especially loved a painting called irisa female symbol of the rainbow which indeed in its floating eccentricity had a certain resemblance to herself of course he failed she would say he tried for the impossible and went on trying all his life oh i cant bear your rules and catchwords dick whats the good of them beautys too big too deep poor alicia she was sometimes very wearing  he never knew quite how it came about that she went abroad with them to dauphiné in the autumn of 1904a rather disastrous businessnever again would he take anyone travelling who did not know how to come in out of the cold it was a painters country and he had hired a little chateau in front of the glandaz mountainhimself his wife their eldest girl and alicia the adaptation of his famous manner to that strange scenery its browns and french greys and filmy blues so preoccupied him that he had scant time for becoming intimate with these hills and valleys from the little gravelled terrace in front of the annex out of which he had made a studio there was an absorbing view over the pantiled old town of die it glistened below in the early or late sunlight flatroofed and of pinkishyellow with the dim blue river drôme circling one side and cut dark cypresstrees dotting the vineyarded slopes and he painted it continually what alicia did with herself they none of them very much knew except that she would come in and talk ecstatically of things and beasts and people she had seen one favourite haunt of hers they did visit a ruined monastery high up in the amphitheatre of the glandaz mountain they had their lunch up there a very charming and remote spot where the watercourses and ponds and chapel of the old monks were still visible though converted by the farmer to his use alicia left them abruptly in the middle of their praises and they had not seen her again till they found her at home when they got back it was almost as if she had resented laudation of her favourite haunt she had brought in with her a great bunch of golden berries of which none of them knew the name berries almost as beautiful as these spindleberries glowing on the stone of the wall and a fourth memory of alicia came  christmas eve a sparkling frost and every tree round the little chateau rimed so that they shone in the starlight as though dowered with cherry blossoms never were more stars in clear black sky above the whitened earth down in the little town a few faint points of yellow light twinkled in the mountain wind keen as a razors edge a fantastically lovely nightquite japanese but cruelly cold five minutes on the terrace had been enough for all of them except alicia sheunaccountable crazy creaturewould not come in twice he had gone out to her with commands entreaties and extra wraps the third time he could not find her she had deliberately avoided his onslaught and slid off somewhere to keep this mad vigil by frozen starlight when at last she did come in she reeled as if drunk they tried to make her really drunk to put warmth back into her no good in two days she was down with double pneumonia it was two months before she was up againa very shadow of herself there had never been much health in her since then she floated like a ghost through life a crazy ghost who still would steal away goodness knew where and come in with a flush in her withered cheeks and her grey hair wild blown carrying her spoilsome flower some leaf some tiny bird or little soft rabbit she never painted now never even talked of it they had made her give up her cottage and come to live with them literally afraid that she would starve herself to death in her forgetfulness of everything these spindleberries even why probably she had been right up this morning to that sunny chalkpit in the lew of the downs to get them seven miles there and back when you wouldnt think she could walk seven hundred yards and as likely as not had lain there on the dewy grass looking up at the sky as he had come on her sometimes poor alicia and once he had been within an ace of marrying her a life spoiled by what if not by love of beauty but who would have ever thought that the intangible could wreck a woman deprive her of love marriage motherhood of fame of wealth of health and yetby georgeit had  scudamore flipped the four pink berries off the wall the radiance and the meandering milky waters that swan against the brown tufted rushes those far filmy downsthere was beauty beauty but damn it allmoderation moderation and turning his back on that prospect which he had painted so many times in his celebrated manner he went in and up the expensively restored staircase to his studio it had great windows on three sides and perfect means for regulating light unfinished studies melted into walls so subdued that they looked like atmosphere there were no completed picturesthey sold too fast as he walked over to his easel his eye was caught by a spray of colourthe branch of spindleberries set in water ready for him to use just where the pale sunlight fell so that their delicate colour might glow and the few tiny drops of moisture still clinging to them shine for a second he saw alicia herself as she must have looked setting them there her transparent hands hovering her eyes shining that grey hair of hers all fine and loose the vision vanished but what had made her bring them after that horrified god when he spoke of using them was it her way of saying forgive me for being rude really she was pathetic that poor devotee the spindleberries glowed in their silverlustre jug sprayed up against the sunlight they looked triumphantas well they might who stood for that which had ruinedor was it saveda life alicia she had made a pretty mess of it and yet who knew what secret raptures she had felt with her subtle lover beauty by starlight and sunlight and moonlight in the fields and woods on the hilltops and by riverside flowers and the flight of birds and the ripple of the wind and all the shifting play of light and colour which made a man despair when he wanted to use them she had taken them hugged them to her with no afterthought and been happy who could say that she had missed the prize of life who could say it spindleberries a bunch of spindleberries to set such doubts astir in him why what was beauty but just the extra value which certain forms and colours blended gave to thingsjust the extra value in the human market nothing else on earth nothing and the spindleberries glowed against the sunlight delicate remote  taking his palette he mixed crimson lake white and ultramarine what was that who sighed away out there behind him nothing  damn it all he thought this is childish this is as bad as alicia and he set to work to paint in his celebrated mannerspindleberries  1918     ii  expectations   not many years ago a couple were living in the south of england whose name was wotchettralph and eileen wotchett a curious name derived ralph asserted from a saxon thegn called otchar mentioned in domesday or at all eventswhen search of the book had proved vainon the edge of that substantial record  hepossibly the thirtieth descendant of the thegnwas close on six feet in height and thin with thirsty eyes and a smile which had fixed itself in his cheeks so on the verge of appearing was it his hair waved and was of a dusty shade bordering on grey his wife of the same age and nearly the same height as himself was of sanguine colouring and a cornish family which had held land in such a manner that it had nearly melted in their grasp all that had come to eileen was a reversion on the mortgageable value of which she and ralph had been living for some time ralph wotchett also had expectations by profession he was an architect but perhaps because of his expectations he had always had bad luck the involutions of the reasons why his clients died became insolvent abandoned their projects or otherwise failed to come up to the scratch were followed by him alone in the full of their mazelike windings the house they inhabited indeed was one of those he had designed for a client but the fat chough had refused to go into it for some unaccountable reason he and eileen were only perching there however on the edge of settling down in some more permanent house when they came into their expectations  considering the vicissitudes and disappointments of their life together it was remarkable how certain they remained that they would at last cross the bar and reach the harbour of comfortable circumstance they had one may suppose expectations in their blood the germ of getting something for nothing had infected their systems so that though they were not selfish or greedy people and well knew how to rough it they dreamed so of what they had not that they continually got rid of what they had in order to obtain more of it if for example ralph received an order he felt so strongly that this was the chance of his life if properly grasped that he would almost as a matter of course increase and complicate the project till it became unworkable or in his zeal omit some vital calculation such as a rise in the price of bricks nor would anyone be more surprised than he at this or more certain that all connected with the matter had been fat choughs excepthimself on such occasions eileen would get angry but if anyone suggested that ralph had overreached himself she would get still angrier she was very loyal and fortunately rather flyaway both in mind and body before long she always joined him in his feeling that the whole transaction had been just the usual skingame on the part of providence to keep them out of their expectations it was the same in domestic life if ralph had to eat a breakfast which would be almost every morning he had so many and such imaginative ways of getting from it a better breakfast than was in it that he often remained on the edge of it as it were he had special methods of cooking so as to extract from everything a more than ordinary flavour and these took all the time that he would have to eat the results in coffee he would make with a whole egg shell and all stirred in it had to be left on the hob for an incomparable time and he would start to catch his train with his first cup in his hand eileen would have to run after him and take it away they were in fact rather like a kitten which knows it has a tail and will fly round and round all day with the expectation of catching that desirable appendage sometimes indeed by sheer perseverance of which he had a great deal in a roundabout way ralph would achieve something but when this happened something else not foreseen by him had always happened first which rendered that accomplishment nugatory and left it expensive on his hands nevertheless they retained their faith that some day they would get ahead of providence and come into their own  in view of not yet having come into their expectations they had waited to have children but two had rather unexpectedly been born the babes had succumbed however one to preparation for betterment too ingenious to be fulfilled the other to fulfilment itself a special kind of food having been treated so ingeniously that it had undoubtedly engendered poison and they remained childless  they were about fifty when ralph received one morning a solicitors letter announcing the death of his godmother aunt lispeth when he read out the news they looked at their plates a full minute without speaking their expectations had matured at last they were to come into something in return for nothing aunt lispeth who had latterly lived at ipswich in a house which he had just not built for her was an old maid they had often discussed what she would leave themthough in no mean or grasping spirit for they did not grudge the poor old girl her few remaining years however they might feel that she was long past enjoying herself the chance would come to them some time and when it did of course must be made the best of then eileen said  you must go down at once ralph  donning black ralph set off hurriedly and just missed his train he caught one however in the afternoon and arrived that evening in ipswich it was october drizzling and dark the last cab moved out as he tried to enter it for he had been detained by his ticket which he had put for extra readiness in his glove and forgottenas if the ticket collector couldnt have seen it there the fat chough he walked up to his aunts house and was admitted to a mansion where a dinnerparty was going on it was impossible to persuade the servant that this was his aunts so he was obliged to retire to a hotel and wire to eileen to send him the right addressthe fat choughs in the street did not seem to know it he got her answer the following midday and going to the proper number found the darkened house the two servants who admitted him described the manner of their mistresss death and showed him up into her room aunt lispeth had been laid out daintily ralph contemplated her with the smile which never moved from his cheeks and with a sort of awe in his thirsty eyes the poor old girl how thin how white it had been time she went a little stiffened twist in her neck where her lean head had fallen to one side at the last had not been set quite straight and there seemed the ghost of an expression on her face almost cynical by looking closer he saw that it came from a gap in the white lashes of one eye giving it an air of not being quite closed as though she were trying to wink at him he went out rather hastily and ascertaining that the funeral was fixed for noon next day paid a visit to the solicitor  there he was told that the lawyer himself was sole executor and heralphresiduary legatee he could not help a feeling of exultation for he and eileen were at that time particularly hard pressed he restrained it however and went to his hotel to write to her he received a telegram in answer next morning at ten oclock for goodness sake leave all details to lawyer eileen which he thought very peculiar he lunched with the lawyer after the funeral and they opened his aunts will it was quite short and simple made certain specific bequests of lace and jewellery left a hundred pounds to her executor the lawyer and the rest of her property to her nephew ralph wotchett the lawyer proposed to advertise for debts in the usual way and ralph with considerable control confined himself to urging all speed in the application for probate and disposal of the estate he caught a late train back to eileen she received his account distrustfully she was sure he had put his finger in the pie and if he had it would all go wrong well if he hadnt he soon would it was really as if loyalty had given way in her now that their expectations were on the point of being realised  they had often discussed his aunts income but they went into it again that night to see whether it could not by fresh investment be increased it was derived from norwich and birmingham corporation stocks and ralph proved that by going into industrial concerns the four hundred a year could quite safely be made into six eileen agreed that this would be a good thing to do but nothing definite was decided now that they had come into money they did not feel so inclined to move their residence though both felt that they might increase their scale of living which had lately been at a distressingly low ebb they spoke too about the advisability of a small car ralph knew of onea secondhand fordto be had for a song they ought nothe thoughtto miss the chance he would take occasion to meet the owner casually and throw out a feeler it would not do to let the fellow know that there was any money coming to them or he would put the price up for a certainty in fact it would be better to secure the car before the news got about he secured it a few days later for eighty pounds including repairs which would take about a month a letter from the lawyer next day informed them that he was attending to matters with all speed and the next five weeks passed in slowly realising that at last they had turned the corner of their lives and were in smooth water they ordered among other things the materials for a fowlhouse long desired which ralph helped to put up and a considerable number of fowls for feeding which he had a design which would enable them to lay a great many more eggs in the future than could reasonably be expected from the amount of food put into the fowls he also caused an old stable to be converted into a garage he still went to london two or three times a week to attend to business which was not as a rule there on his way from st pancras to red lion square where his office was he had long been attracted by an emerald pendant with pearl clasp in a jewellers shop window he went in now to ask its price fiftyeight poundsemeralds were a rising market the expression rankled in him and going to hatton garden to enquire into its truth he found the statement confirmed the chief advantage of having money he thought is to be able to buy at the right moment he had not given eileen anything for a long time and this was an occasion which could hardly be passed over he bought the pendant on his way back to st pancras the draft in payment absorbing practically all his balance eileen was delighted with it they spent that evening in the nearest approach to festivity that they had known for several years it was as it were the crown of the long waiting for something out of nothing all those little acerbities which creep into the manner of two married people who are always trying to round the corner fell away and they sat together in one large chair talking and laughing over the countless tricks which providencethat fat choughhad played them they carried their lightheartedness to bed  they were awakened next morning by the sound of a car the ford was being delivered with a request for payment ralph did not pay it would be all right he said he stabled the car and wrote to the lawyer that he would be glad to have news and an advance of £100 on his return from town in the evening two days later he found eileen in the diningroom with her hair wild and an opened letter before her she looked up with the word here and ralph took the letter        lodgers  wayburn solicitors ipswich       dear mr wotchett       in answer to yours of the fifteenth i have obtained probate      paid all debts and distributed the various legacies the      sale of furniture took place last monday i now have pleasure      in enclosing you a complete and i think final account by      which you will see that there is a sum in hand of £43 due to      you as residuary legatee i am afraid this will seem a      disappointing result but as you were doubtless aware though      i was not when i had the pleasure of seeing you the greater      part of your aunts property passed under a deed of      settlement and it seems she had been dipping heavily into      the capital of the remainder for some years past       believe me      faithfully yours      edward lodgers    for a minute the only sounds were the snapping of ralphs jaws and eileens rapid breathing then she said  you never said a word about a settlement i suppose you got it muddled as usual  ralph did not answer too deep in his anger with the old woman who had left that fat chough a hundred pounds to provide himralphwith fortythree  you always believe what you want to believe cried eileen i never saw such a man  ralph went to ipswich on the morrow after going into everything with the lawyer he succeeded in varying the account by fifteen shillings considerably more than which was absorbed by the fee for this interview his fare and hotel bill the conduct of his aunt in having caused him to get it into his head that there was no settlement and in living on her capital gave him pain quite beyond the power of expression and more than once he recalled with a shudder that slightly quizzical look on her dead face he returned to eileen the following day with his brain racing round and round getting up next morning he said  i believe i can get a hundred for that car ill go up and see about it  take this too said eileen handing him the emerald pendant ralph took it with a grunt  lucky he muttered emeralds are a rising market i bought it on purpose  he came back that night more cheerful he had sold the car for £65 and the pendant for £42a good price for emeralds were now on the fall with the cheque for £43 which represented his expectations he proved that they would only be £14 out on the whole business when the fowls and fowlhouse had been paid for and they would have the fowlsthe price of eggs was going up eileen agreed that it was the moment to develop poultrykeeping they might expect good returns and holding up her face she said  give me a kiss dear ralph  ralph gave it with his thirsty eyes fixed expectant on something round the corner of her head and the smile which never moved on his cheeks  after all there was her reversion they would come into it some day  1919     iii  manna   i  the petty sessions court at linstowe was crowded miracles do not happen every day nor are rectors frequently charged with larceny the interest roused would have relieved all those who doubt the vitality of our ancient church people who never went outside their farms or plots of garden had walked as much as three miles to see the show mrs gloyn the sandyhaired little keeper of the shop where soap and herrings cheese matches bootlaces bullseyes and the other luxuries of a countryside could be procured remarked to mrs redland the farmers wife tis quite a gatherin like to which mrs redland replied most like church of a sunday  more women it is true than men were present because of their greater piety and because most of them had parted with pounds of butter chickens ducks potatoes or some such offertory in kind during the past two years at the instance of the rector they had a vested interest in this matter and were present accompanied by their grief at value unreceived from trover their little village on the top of the hill two miles from linstowe with the squat churchtower beautifully untouched and ruined by the perfect restoration of the body of the building they had trooped in some even coming from the shore of the atlantic a mile beyond across the downs whence other upland square churchtowers could be viewed on the skyline against the grey january heavens the occasion was in a sense unique and its piquancy strengthened by that rivalry which is the essence of religion  for there was no love lost between church and chapel in trover and the rectors flock had long been fortified in their power of parting by fear lest chapel also present that day in court should mock at his impecuniousness not that his flock approved of his poverty it had seemed sillylike ever since the news had spread that his difficulties had been caused by a faith in shares to improve a secure if moderate position by speculation would not have seemed wrong if he had not failed instead and made himself dependent on their butter their potatoes their eggs and chickens in that parish as in others the saying nothing succeeds like success was true nor had the villagers any abnormal disposition to question the titledeeds of affluence  but it is equally true that nothing irritates so much as finding that one of whom you have the right to beg is begging of you this was why the rectors tall thin black figure down which a ramrod surely had been passed at birth his narrow hairless white and wasted face with red eyebrows over eyes that seemed now burning and now melting his grizzled red hair under a hat almost green with age his abrupt and dictatorial voice his abrupt and mirthless laughall were on their nerves his barkedout utterances i want a pound of butterpay you monday i want some potatoespay you soon had sounded too often in the ears of those who had found his repayments so far purely spiritual now and then one of the more cynical would remark ah i told un my butter was all to market or the man cant ave no principleshe didnt get no chicken out o me and yet it was impossible to let him and his old mother die on themit would give too much pleasure over the way and they never dreamed of losing him in any other manner because they knew his living had been purchased money had passed in that transaction the whole fabric of the church and of society was involved his professional conduct too was flawless his sermons long and fiery he was always ready to perform those supernumerary dutiesweddings baptisms and burialswhich yielded him what revenue he had now that his income from the living was mortgaged up to the hilt their loyalty held as the loyalty of people will when some great institution of which they are members is endangered  gossip said that things were in a dreadful way at the rectory the external prosperity of that redbrick building surrounded by laurels which did not flower heightened ironically the conditions within the old lady his mother eighty years of age was reported never to leave her bed this winter because they had no coal she lay there with her three birds flying about dirtying the room for neither she nor her son would ever let a cagedoor be shutdeplorable state of things the one servant was supposed never to be paid the tradesmen would no longer leave goods because they could not get their money most of the furniture had been sold and the dust made you sneeze fit to bust yourself like  with a little basket on his arm the rector collected for his household three times a week pursuing a kind of method always in the apparent belief that he would pay on monday and observing the sabbath as a day of rest his mind seemed ever to cherish the faith that his shares were on the point of recovery his spirit never to lose belief in his divine right to be supported it was extremely difficult to refuse him the postman had twice seen him standing on the railway line that ran past just below the village with is at off as if he was in two mindslike this vision of him close to the shining metals had powerfully impressed many good souls who loved to make flesh creep they would say i wouldn never be surprised if something appened to im one of these days others less romantic shook their heads insisting that he wouldn never do nothin while his old mother lived others again more devout maintained that he wouldn never go against the scriptures settin an example like that   ii  the petty sessions court that morning resembled church on the occasion of a wedding for the villagers of trover had put on their black clothes and grouped themselves according to their religious faithschurch in the right chapel in the lefthand aisle they presented all that rich variety of type and monotony of costume which the remoter country still affords to the observer their mouths were almost all a little open and their eyes fixed with intensity on the bench the three magistratessquire pleydell in the chair dr becket on his left and the honble calmady on his rightwere by most seen for the first time in their judicial capacity and curiosity was divided between their proceedings and observation of the rectors prosecutor a small baker from the town whence the village of trover derived its necessaries the face of this fellow like that of a white walrus and the back of his bald head were of interest to everyone until the case was called and the rector himself entered in his thin black overcoat he advanced and stood as if a little dazed then turning his ravaged face to the bench he jerked out  good morning lot of people  a constable behind him murmured  into the dock sir please  moving across he entered the wooden edifice  quite like a pulpit he said and uttered his barking laugh  through the court ran a stir and shuffle as it might be of sympathy with his lost divinity and every eye was fixed on that tall lean figure with the shaven face and red greystreaked hair  entering the witnessbox the prosecutor deposed as follows  last tuesday afternoon your honours i appened to be drivin my cart meself up through trover on to the cottages just above the dip and id gone in to mrs oneys the laundress leavin

a deathly little silence then the baker said slowly  whats more i say he ate it imself i call two witnesses to that  the chairman passing his hand over his hard alert face that of a master of hounds asked  did you see any dirt on the loaf be careful  the baker answered stolidly  not a speck  dr becket a slight man with a short grey beard and eyes restive from having to notice painful things spoke  had your horse moved  e never moves  ha ha came the rectors laugh  the chairman said sharply  well stand down call the next witnesscharles stodder carpenter very well go on and tell us what you know  but before he could speak the rector called out in a loud voice chapel  hsssh sir but through the body of the court had passed a murmur of challenge as it were from one aisle to the other  the witness a square man with a red face grey hair whiskers and moustache and lively excitable dark eyes watering with anxiety spoke in a fast soft voice  tuesday afternoon your worships it might be about four oclock i was passin up the village an i saw the rector at his gate with a loaf in is and  show us how  the witness held his black hat to his side with the rounded top outwards  was the loaf clean or dirty  sweetening his little eyes the witness answered  i should say twas clean  lie  the chairman said sternly  you mustnt interrupt siryou didnt see the bottom of the loaf  the witnesss little eyes snapped  not eggzactly  did the rector speak to you  the witness smiled the rector wouldn never stop me if i was passin i collects the rates  the rectors laugh so like a desolate dogs bark killed the bubble of gaiety rising in the court and again that deathly little silence followed  then the chairman said  do you want to ask him anything  the rector turned why d you tell lies  the witness screwing up his eyes said excitedly  what lies ave i told please  you said the loaf was clean  so twas clean so far as i see  come to church and you wont tell lies  reckon i can learn truth faster in chapel  the chairman rapped his desk  thatll do thatll do stand down next witnessemily bleaker yes what are you cook at the rectory very well what do you know about the affair of this loaf last

old missus ate et for dinner i see the plate after there wasnt ony crumbs on et  if you never saw the loaf how do you know they ate it  because ther warnt nothin else in the ouse  the rectors voice barked out  quite right  the chairman looked at him fixedly  do you want to ask her anything  the rector nodded  you been paid your wages  noa i asnt  dyou know why  noa  very sorryno money to pay you thats all  this closed the prosecutors case and there followed a pause during which the bench consulted together and the rector eyed the congregation nodding to one here and there then the chairman turning to him said  now sir do you call any witnesses  yes my bellringer hes a good man you can believe him  the bellringer samuel bevis who took his place in the witnessbox was a kind of elderly bacchus with permanently trembling hands he deposed as follows  when i passed rector tuesday arternoon he calls after me see this e says and up e held it bit o dirrty bread e says do for my burrds then on he goes walkin  did you see whether the loaf was dirty  yaas i think twas dirrty  dont think do you know  yaas twas dirrty  which side  which saide i think twas dirrty on the bottom  are you

words  all chapelwant to see me down  the chairman said stonily  never mind that come to the facts please  certainly out for a walkpassed the bakers cartsaw a loaf fallen in the mudpicked it updo for my birds  what birds  magpie and two starlings quite freenever shut the cagedoor well fed  the baker charges you with taking it from his cart  lie underneath the cart in a puddle  you heard what your cook said about your eating it did you  yes birds couldnt eat allnothing in the housemother and ihungry  hungry  no money hard upvery often hungry ha ha  again through the court that queer rustle passed the three magistrates gazed at the accused then the honble calmady said  you say you found the loaf under the cart didnt it occur to you to put it back you could see it had fallen how else could it have come there  the rectors burning eyes seemed to melt  from the sky manna staring round the court he added hungrygods electto the manna born and throwing back his head he laughed it was the only sound in a silence as of the grave  the magistrates spoke together in low tones the rector stood motionless gazing at them fixedly the people in the court sat as if at a play then the chairman said  case dismissed  thank you  jerking out that short thanksgiving the rector descended from the dock and passed down the centre aisle followed by every eye   iii  from the petty sessions court the congregation wended its way back to trover by the muddy lane church and chapel arguing the case to dim the triumph of the church the fact remained that the baker had lost his loaf and had not been compensated the loaf was worth money no money had passed it was hard to be victorious and yet reduced to silence and dark looks at girding adversaries the nearer they came to home the more angry with chapel did they grow then the bellringer had his inspiration assembling his three assistants he hurried to the belfry and in two minutes the little old tower was belching forth the merriest and maddest peal those bells had ever furnished out it swung in the still air of the grey winter day away to the very sea  a stranger issuing from the inn hearing that triumphant sound and seeing so many blackclothed people about said to his driver  what is ita wedding  no zurr they say tis for the rector like heve a just been acquitted for larceny                                       on the tuesday following the rectors ravaged face and redgrey hair appeared in mrs gloyns doorway and his voice creaking like a saw said  can you let me have a pound of butter pay you soon  what else could he do not even to gods elect does the sky always send down manna  1916     iv  a strange thing   not very long ago during a sojourn in a part of the west country never yet visited by me i went out one fine but rather cold march morning for a long ramble i was in one of those disillusioned moods that come to writers bankrupt of ideas bankrupt of confidence a prey to that recurrent despair the struggle with which makes the profession of the penas a friend once said to mea manly one yesi was thinking for all that the air was so brisk and the sun so brightnothing comes to me nowadays no flashes of light none of those suddenly shaped visions that bring cheer and warmth to a poor devils heart and set his brain and pen to driving on a bad bad business and my eyes wandering over the dip and rise the woods the moor the rocks of that fine countryside took in the loveliness thereof with the profound discontent of one who seeing beauty feels that he cannot render it the high lanebanks had just been pollarded one could see right down over the fields and gorse and bare woods tinged with that rosy brown of beech and birch twigs and the dusty saffron of the larches and suddenly my glance was arrested by something vivid a sort of black and white excitement in the air aha i thought a magpie two three good is it an omen the birds had risen at the bottom of a field their twining fluttering voyagemost decorative of all bird flightswas soon lost in the wood beyond but something it had left behind in my heart i felt more hopeful less inclined to think about the failure of my spirit better able to give myself up to this new country i was passing through over the next rise in the very winding lane i heard the sound of brisk church bells and not three hundred yards beyond came to a village green where knots of men dressed in the dark clothes light ties and bowler hats of village festivity and of women smartened up beyond belief were gathered chattering round the yard of an old grey squaretowered church  whats going on i thought its not sunday not the birthday of a potentate and surely they dont keep saint days in this manner it must be a wedding yestheres a favour lets go in and see and passing the expectant groups i entered the church and made my way up the aisle there was already a fair sprinkling of folk all turned round towards the door and the usual licensed buzz and whisper of a wedding congregation the church as seems usual in remote parishes had been built all those centuries ago to hold a population in accordance with the expectations of its tenet be fruitful and multiply but the whole population could have been seated in a quarter of its space it was lofty and unwarmed save by excitement and the smell of bearsgrease there was certainly more animation than i had ever seen or savoured in a truly rural district  the bells which had been ringing with a sort of languid joviality fell now into the hurried crashing which marks the approach of a bride and the people i had passed outside came thronging in i perceived a young manlittle more than a boy who by his semidetachment the fumbling of his gloved hands and the sheepishness of the smile on his goodlooking open face was obviously the bridegroom i liked the looks of hima cut above the usual village bumpkinsomething free and kind about his face but no one was paying him the least attention it was for the bride they were waiting and i myself began to be excited what would this young thing be like just the ordinary village maiden with tight cheeks and dress coarse veil high colour and eyes like a rabbits or somethingsomething like that little welsh girl on the hills whom i once passed and whose peer i have never since seen bending forward i accosted an applefaced woman in the next pew can you tell me who the bride is  regarding me with the grey round defensive glance that one bestows on strangers she replied  aw dont ee know tes gwenny maraprettiest brightest maid in these parts and jerking her thumb towards the neglected bridegroom she added hes a lucky young chap shem a sunny maid for sure and a gude maid tu  somehow the description did not reassure me and i prepared for the worst  a bubble a stir a rustle  like everyone else i turned frankly round she was coming up the aisle on the arm of a hardfaced rather gipsylooking man dressed in a farmers very best  i can only tell you that to see her coming down the centre of that grey church amongst all those darkclothed people was like watching the dance of a sunbeam never had i seen a face so happy sweet and radiant smiling eager just lost enough to her surroundings her hair unconquerably golden through the coarse veil her dancing eyes clear and dark as a peat poolshe was the prettiest sight one could only think of a young appletree with the spring sun on its blossom she had that kind of infectious brightness which comes from very simple goodness it was quite a relief to have taken a fancy to the young mans face and to feel that she was passing into good hands  the only flowers in the church were early daffodils but those first children of the sun were somehow extraordinarily appropriate to the wedding of this girl when she came out she was pelted with them and with that miserable confetti without which not even the simplest souls can pass to bliss it seems there are things in life which make one feel goodsunshine most music all flowers many children some animals clouds mountains birdsongs blue sky dancing and here and there a young girls face and i had the feeling that all of us there felt good for the mere seeing of her  when she had driven away i found myself beside a lame old man with whiskers and delightful eyes who continued to smile after the carriage had quite vanished noticing perhaps that i too was smiling he said tes a funny thing tu when a maid like that gets marriedmakes you go all of a trembleso it du and to my nod he added brave bit o sunshinewell miss her hereabout not a doubt of it we aint got another one like that  was that her father i asked for the want of something to say with a sharpish look at my face he shook his head  no she ant got no parents mr mara bein her uncle as you may say no she ant got no parents he repeated and there was something ill at ease yet juicy about his voice as though he knew things that he would not tell  since there was nothing more to wait for i went up to the little inn and ordered bread and cheese the male congregation was whetting its whistle noisily within but as a stranger i had the verandah to myself and finishing my simple lunch in the march sunlight i paid and started on taking at random one of the three lanes that debouched from the bottom of the green i meandered on between high banks happy in the consciousness of not knowing at all where it would lead methat essential of a country ramble except one cottage in a bottom and one farm on a rise i passed nothing nobody the spring was late in these parts the buds had hardly formed as yet on any trees and now and then between the bursts of sunlight a few fine specks of snow would come drifting past me on the wind close to a group of pines at a high corner the lane dipped sharply down to a long farmhouse standing back in its yard where three carts were drawn up and an empty waggonette with its shafts in the air and suddenly by some broken daffodils on the seats and confetti on the ground i perceived that i had stumbled on the brides home where the wedding feast was no doubt in progress  gratifying but by no means satisfying my curiosity by gazing at the lichened stone and thatch of the old house at the pigeons pigs and hens at large between it and the barns i passed on down the lane which turned up steeply to the right beside a little stream to my left was a long larch wood to my right rough fields with many trees the lane finished at a gate below the steep moorside crowned by a rocky tor i stood there leaning on the top bar debating whether i should ascend or no the bracken had most of it been cut in the autumn and not a hundred yards away the furze was being swaled the little bloodred flames and the blue smoke the yellow blossoms of the gorse the sunlight and some flecks of drifting snow were mingled in an amazing tangle of colour  i had made up my mind to ascend the tor and was pushing through the gate when suddenly i saw a woman sitting on a stone under the wall bordering the larch wood she was holding her head in her hands rocking her body to and fro and her eyes were evidently shut for she had not noticed me she wore a blue serge dress her hat reposed beside her and her dark hair was straggling about her face that face all blowsy and flushed was at once wild and stupefied a face which has been beautiful coarsened and swollen by life and strong emotion is a pitiful enough sight her dress hat and the way her hair had been done were redolent of the town and of that unnameable something which clings to women whose business it is to attract men and yet there was a gipsyish look about her as though she had not always been of the town  the sight of a womans unrestrained distress in the very heart of untouched nature is so rare that one must be peculiar to remain unmoved and there i stood not knowing what on earth to do she went on rocking herself to and fro her stays creaking and a faint moaning sound coming from her lips and suddenly she drooped over her lap her hands fallen to her sides as though she had gone into a kind of coma how go on and leave her thus yet how intrude on what did not seem to me mere physical suffering  in that quandary i stood and watched this corner was quite sheltered from the wind the sun almost hot and the breath of the swaling reached one in the momentary calms for three full minutes she had not moved a finger till beginning to think she had really fainted i went up to her from her drooped body came a scent of heat and of stale violet powder and i could see though the east wind had outraddled them traces of rouge on her cheeks and lips their surface had a sort of swollen defiance but underneath as it were a wasted look her breathing sounded faint and broken  mustering courage i touched her on the arm she raised her head and looked up her eyes were the best things she had left they must have once been very beautiful bloodshot now from the wind their wild stupefied look passed after a moment into the peculiar halfbold halffurtive stare of women of a certain sort she did not speak and in my embarrassment i drew out the flask of port i always take with me on my rambles and stammered  i beg your pardonare you feeling faint would you care and unscrewing the top i held out the flask she stared at it a moment blankly then taking it said  thats kind of you i feel to want it tu and putting it to her lips she drank tilting back her head perhaps it was the telltale softness of her us perhaps the naturally strong lines of her figure thus bent back but somehow the plumage of the town bird seemed to drop off her suddenly  she handed back the flask as empty as it had ever been and said with a hard smile  i dare say you thought me funny sittin ere like that  i thought you were ill  she laughed without the faintest mirth and muttered  i did go on didnt i then almost fiercely added i got some reason too seein the old place again after all these years her dark eyes which the wine seemed to have cleared and boldened swept me up and down taking me in making sure perhaps whether or no she had ever seen me and what sort of a brute i might be then she said i was born here are you from these parts i shook my headno from the other side of the county  she laughed then after a moments silence said abruptly  i been to a weddinfirst ive seen since i was a girl  some instinct kept me silent  my own daughters weddin but nobody didnt know menot likely  i had dropped down under the shelter of the wall on to a stone opposite and at those words looked at her with interest indeed shethis coarsened wasted suspiciously scented woman of the townthe mother of that sweet sunny child i had just seen married and again instinctively silent about my own presence at the wedding i murmured  i thought i saw some confetti in that farmyard as i came up the lane  she laughed again  confettithats the little pink and white and blue thingsplenty o that and she added fiercely my own brother didn know melet alone my girl how should shei havent seen her since she was a babyshe was a laughin little thing and she gazed past me with that look in the eyes as of people who are staring back into the bygone i guess we was laughin when we got her twas just heresummertime i ad the moon in my blood that night right enough then turning her eyes on my face she added thats what a girl will ave you know once in a while and like as not itll du for her only thirtyfive now i am an pretty nigh the end o my tether what can you expectim a gay woman did for me right enough her fathers dead tu  do you mean i said because of your child  she nodded i suppose you can say that they made me bring an order against him he wouldnt pay up so he went and enlisted an in tu years e was dead in the boer warso it killed him right enough but there she is a sweet sprig if ever there was one thats a strange thing isnt it and she stared straight before her in a sudden silence nor could i find anything to say slowly taking in the strangeness of this thing that girl so like a sunbeam of whom the people talked as though she were a blessing in their livesher coming into life to have been the ruin of the two who gave her being  the woman went on dully funny how i knew she was goin to be marriedtwas a farmer told mecomes to me regular when he goes to exeter market i always knew he came from near my old home theres a weddin on tuesday e says id like to be the bridegroom at prettiest sunniest maid you ever saw an he told me where she come from so i knew he found me a bit funny that afternoon but he dont know who i am though he used to go to school with me id never tell not for worlds she shook her head vehemently i dont know why i told you im not meself today and thats a fact at her halfsuspicious halfappealing look i said quickly  i dont know a soul about here its all right  she sighed it was kind of you and i feel to want to talk sometimes well after he was gone i said to myself ill take a holiday and go an see my daughter married she laughedi never had no pink and white and blue little things myself that was all done up for me that night i had the moon in me blood ah my father was a proper hard man twas bad enough before i had my baby but after when i couldnt get the father to marry me an he cut an run proper life they led me him and stepmother cry didn i cryi was a softhearted thingnever went to sleep with me eyes drynever tis a cruel thing to make a young girl cry  i said quietly did you run away then  she nodded bravest thing i ever did nearly broke my eart to leave my baby but twas that or drownin myself i was soft then i went off with a young fellowbookmaker that used to come over to the sports meetin wild about mebut he never married meagain she uttered her hard laughknew a thing worth tu o that lifting her hand towards the burning furze she added i used to come up here an help em light that when i was a little girl and suddenly she began to cry it was not so painful and alarming as her first distress for it seemed natural now  at the side of the carttrack by the gate was an old boot thrown away and it served me for something to keep my eyes engaged the dilapidated black object among the stones and wild plants on that day of strange mixed beauty was as incongruous as this unhappy woman herself revisiting her youth and there shot into my mind a vision of this spot as it might have been that summer night when she had the moon in her bloodqueer phraseand those two young creatures in the tall soft fern in the warmth and the darkened loneliness had yielded to the impulse in their blood a brisk fluttering of snowflakes began falling from the sky still blue drifting away over our heads towards the bloodred flames and smoke they powdered the womans hair and shoulders and with a sob and a laugh she held up her hand and began catching them as a child might  tis a funny day for my girls weddin she said then with a sort of fierceness added shell never know her mothershes in luck there tu and grabbing her feathered hat from the ground she got up i must be gettin back for my train else ill be late for an appointment  when she had put her hat on rubbed her face dusted and smoothed her dress she stood looking at the burning furze restored to her town plumage to her wonted bravado she was more than ever like that old discarded boot incongruous  im a fool ever to have come she said only upset meand you dont want no more upsettin than you get thats certain goodbye and thank you for the drinkit lusened my tongue praaper didnt it she gave me a looknot as a professionalbut a human puzzled look i told you my baby was a laughin little thing im glad shes still like that im glad ive seen her her lips quivered for a second then with a faked jauntiness she nodded so long and passed through the gate down into the lane  i sat there in the snow and sunlight some minutes after she was gone then getting up i went and stood by the burning furze the blowing flames and the blue smoke were alive and beautiful but behind them they were leaving blackened skeleton twigs  yes i thought but in a week or two the little green grassshoots will be pushing up underneath into the sun so the world goes out of destruction its a strange thing  1916     v  two looks   the old director of the yew trees cemetery walked slowly across from his house to see that all was ready  he had seen pass into the square of earth committed to his charge so many to whom he had been in the habit of nodding so many whose faces even he had not known to him it was the everyday event yet this funeral one more in the countless tale disturbed hima sharp reminder of the passage of time  for twenty years had gone by since the death of septimus godwin the cynical romantic doctor who had been his greatest friend by whose cleverness all had sworn of whose powers of fascination all had gossiped and now they were burying his son  he had not seen the widow since for she had left the town at once but he recollected her distinctly a tall dark woman with bright brown eyes much younger than her husband and only married to him eighteen months before he died he remembered her slim figure standing by the grave at that longpast funeral and the look on her face which had puzzled him so terriblya look ofa most peculiar look  he thought of it even now walking along the narrow path towards his old friends gravethe handsomest in the cemetery commanding from the topmost point the whitened slope and river that lay beyond he came to its little private garden spring flowers were blossoming the railings had been freshly painted and by the door of the grave wreaths awaited the new arrival all was in order  the old director opened the mausoleum with his key below seen through a thick glass floor lay the shining coffin of the father beneath on the lower tier would rest the coffin of the son  a gentle voice close behind him said  can you tell me sir what they are doing to my old doctors grave  the old director turned and saw before him a lady well past middle age he did not know her face but it was pleasant with faded roseleaf cheeks and silvered hair under a shady hat  madam there is a funeral here this afternoon  ah can it be his wife  madam his son a young man of only twenty  his son at what time did you say  at two oclock  thank you you are very kind  with uplifted hat he watched her walk away it worried him to see a face he did not know  all went off beautifully but dining that same evening with his friend a certain doctor the old director asked  did you see a lady with grey hair hovering about this afternoon  the doctor a tall man with a beard still yellow drew his guests chair nearer to the fire  i did  did you remark her face a very odd expressiona sort ofwhat shall i call itvery odd indeed who is she i saw her at the grave this morning  the doctor shook his head  not so very odd i think  come what do you mean by that  the doctor hesitated then taking the decanter he filled his old friends glass and answered  well sir you were godwins greatest chumi will tell you if you like the story of his death you were away at the time if you remember  it is safe with me said the old director  septimus godwin began the doctor slowly died on a thursday about three oclock and i was only called in to see him at two i found him far gone but conscious now and then it was a case ofbut you know the details so i neednt go into that his wife was in the room and on the bed at his feet lay his pet doga terrier you may recollect perhaps he had a special breed i hadnt been there ten minutes when a maid came in and whispered something to her mistress mrs godwin answered angrily see him go down and say she ought to know better than to come here at such a time the maid went but soon came back could the lady see mrs godwin for just a moment mrs godwin answered that she could not leave her husband the maid looked frightened and went away again she came back for the third time the lady had said she must see dr godwin it was a matter of life and death deathindeed exclaimed mrs godwin shameful go down and tell her if she doesnt go immediately i will send for the police  the poor maid looked at me i offered to go down and see the visitor myself i found her in the dining room and knew her at once never mind her name but she belongs to a county family not a hundred miles from here a beautiful woman she was then but her face that day was quite distorted  for gods sake doctor she said is there any hope  i was obliged to tell her there was none  then i must see him she said  i begged her to consider what she was asking but she held me out a signet ring just like godwinwasnt itthat sort of byronism eh  he sent me this she said an hour ago it was agreed between us that if ever he sent that i must come if it were only myself i could bear ita woman can bear anything but hell die thinking i wouldnt come thinking i didnt careand i would give my life for him this minute  now a dying mans request is sacred i told her she should see him i made her follow me upstairs and wait outside his room i promised to let her know if he recovered consciousness i have never been thanked like that before or since  i went back into the bedroom he was still unconscious and the terrier whining in the next room a child was cryingthe very same young man we buried today mrs godwin was still standing by the bed  have you sent her away  i had to say that godwin really wished to see her at that she broke out  i wont have her herethe wretch  i begged her to control herself and remember that her husband was a dying man  but im his wife she said and flew out of the room  the doctor paused staring at the fire he shrugged his shoulders and went on id have stopped her fury if i could a dying man is not the same as the live animal that he must needs be wrangled over and sufferings sacred even to us doctors i could hear their voices outside heaven knows what they said to each other and there lay godwin with his white face and his black hairdeathly stillfinelooking fellow he always was then i saw that he was coming to the women had begun again outsidefirst the wife sharp and scornful then the other hushed and slow i saw godwin lift his finger and point it at the door i went out and said to the woman dr godwin wishes to see you please control yourself  we went back into the room the wife followed but godwin had lost consciousness again they sat down those two and hid their faces i can see them now one on each side of the bed their eyes covered with their hands each with her claim on him all murdered by the others presence each with her torn love hm what they must have suffered then and all the time the child cryingthe child of one of them that might have been the others  the doctor was silent and the old director turned towards him his whitebearded ruddy face with a look as if he were groping in the dark  just then i remember the doctor went on suddenly the bells of st judes close by began to peal out for the finish of a wedding that brought godwin back to life he just looked from one woman to the other with a queer miserable sort of smile enough to make your heart break and they both looked at him the face of the wifepoor thingwas as bitter hard as a cut stone but she sat there without ever stirring a finger as for the other womani couldnt look at her he beckoned to me but i couldnt catch his words the bells drowned them a minute later he was dead  lifes a funny thing you wake in the morning with your foot firm on the ladderone touch and down you go you snuff out like a candle and its lucky when your flame goes out if only one womans flame goes out too  neither of those women cried the wife stayed there by the bed i got the other one away to her carriage down the streetand so she was there today that explains i think the look you saw  the doctor ceased and in the silence the old director nodded yes that explained the look he had seen on the face of that unknown woman the deep unseizable weird look that explained the look he had seen on the wifes face at the funeral twenty years ago  and peering wistfully he said  they lookedthey lookedalmost triumphant  then slowly he rubbed his hands over his knees with the secret craving of the old for warmth  1914     vi  fairyland   it was about three oclock this november afternoon when i rode down into fairyland as it is called about here the birchtrees there are more beautiful than any in the world and when the clouds are streaming over in raingrey and the sky soaring above in higher blue justseen those gold and silver creatures have such magical loveliness as makes the hearts of mortals ache the fairies who have been driven off the moor alone watch them with equanimity if they be not indeed the birchtrees themselvesespecially those little very golden ones which have strayed out into the heather on the far side of the glen revenge the fairies cried when a century ago those whom they do not exist just to amuse made the new road over the moor cutting right through the home of twilight that wood above the falls where till then they had always enjoyed inviolable enchantment they trooped forthwith in their multitudinous secrecy down into the glen to swarm about the old road in half a century or so they had it almost abandoned save for occasional horsemen and harmless persons seeking beauty for whom the fairies have never had much feeling of aversion and now after a hundred years it is all theirs the ground so golden with leaves and bracken that the old track is nothing but a vague hardness beneath a horses feet nothing but a runnel for the rains to gather in there is everywhere that glen scent of mouldering leaves so sweet when the wind comes down and stirs it and the sun frees and livens it not very many birds perhaps because hawks are fond of hovering here this was once the only road up to the village the only communication with all that lies to the south and east now the fairies have got it indeed they have witched to skeletons all the little bridges across the glen stream they have mossed and thinned the gates to wraiths with their dapplegold revelry in sunlight and their dance of pied beauty under the moon they have made all their own  i have ridden many times down into this glen and slowly up among the beeches and oaks into the lanes again hoping and believing that some day i should see a fairy take shape to my thick mortal vision and today at last i have seen  i heard it first about halfway up the wood a silvery voice piping out very true what seemed like mortal words not quite to be caught resolved not to miss it this time i got off quietly and tied my mare to a tree then tiptoeing in the damp leaves which did not rustle i stole up till i caught sight of it from behind an oak  it was sitting in yellow bracken as high as its head under a birchtree that had a few branches still goldfeathered it seemed to be clothed in blue and to be swaying as it sang there was something in its arms as it might be a creature being nursed cautiously i slipped from that tree to the next till i could see its face just like a childs fascinating very very delicate the little open mouth poised and shaped ever so neatly to the words it was singing the eyes wide apart and ever so wide open fixed on nothing mortal the song and the little body and the spirit in the eyes all seemed to swaysway together like a soft wind that goes soughsough swinging in the tops of the ferns and now it stretched out one arm and now the other beckoning in to it those to which it was singing so that one seemed to feel the invisible ones stealing up closer and closer  these were the words which came so silvery and slow through that little mouth children children hussh  it seemed as if the very rabbits must come and situp there the jays and pigeons settle above everything in all the wood gather even ones own heart seemed to be drawn in by those beckoning arms and the slow enchantment of that tinkling voice and the look in those eyes which lost in the unknown were seeing no mortal glen but only that mazed wood where friendly wild things come who have no sound to their padding no whirr to the movement of their wings whose gay whisperings have no noise whose eager shapes no colourthe fairy dreamwood of the unimaginable  children children hussh  for just a moment i could see that spirit company ghosts of the ferns and leaves of butterflies and bees and birds and fourfooted things innumerable ghosts of the wind the sunbeams and the raindrops and tiny flickering ghosts of moonrays for just a moment i saw what the fairys eyes were seeing without knowing what they saw  and then my mare trod on a dead branch and all vanished my fairy was gone and there was only little connemara as we called her nursing her doll and smiling up at me from the fern where she had come to practise her new schoolsong  1911     vii  the nightmare child   i set down here not precisely the words of my friend the country doctor but the spirit of them  you know there are certain creatures in this world whom one simply dare not take notice of however sorry one may be for them that has often been borne in on me i realised it i think before i met that little girl i used to attend her mother for varicose veinsone of those women who really ought not to have children since they havent the very least notion of how to bring them up the wife of a sussex agricultural labourer called alliner she was a stout person with most peculiar prominent epileptic eyes such eyes as one usually associates with men of letters or criminals and yet there was nothing in her she was just a lazy slatternly easygoing body rather given to drink her husband was a thin dirty lighthearted fellow who did his work and offended nobody her eldest daughter a pretty and capable girl was wild got into various kinds of trouble and had to migrate leaving two illegitimate children behind her with their grandparents the younger girl the child of this story who was called emmeline of all namespronounced emleen of coursewas just fifteen at the time of my visits to her mother she had eyes like a hares a mouth which readily fell open and brown locks caught back from her scared and knobby forehead she was thin and walked with her head poked a little forward and she so manoeuvred her legs and long feet of which one turned in rather and seemed trying to get in front of the other that there was something clodhopperish in her gait once in a way you would see her in curlpapers and then indeed she was plain poor child she seemed to have grown up without ever having had the least attention paid to her i dont think she was illtreatedshe was simply not treated at all at school they had been kind enough but had regarded her as almost deficient seeing that her father was paid about fifteen shillings a week that her mother had no conception of housekeeping and that there were two babies to be fed they were of course villainously poor and emleen was always draggletailed and badly shod one side of her tooshort dress seemed ever to hang lower than the other her stockings always had one hole at least and her hatsuch queer hatswould seem about to fly away i have known her type in the upper classes pass muster as eccentric or full of character and even in emleen there was a sort of smothered natural comeliness trying pathetically to push through and never getting a chance she always had a lostdog air and when her big hares eyes clung on your face it seemed as if she only wanted a sign to make her come trailing at your heels looking up for a pat or a bit of biscuit  she went to work of course the moment she left school her first place was in a small farm where they took lodgers and her duties were to do everything without of course knowing how to do anything she had to leave because she used to take soap and hairpins and food that was left over and was once seen licking a dish it was just about then that i attended her mother for those veins in her unwieldy legs and the child was at home waiting to secure some other fate it was impossible not to look at that little creature kindly and to speak to her now and then she would not exactly light up because her face was not made that way but she would hang towards you as if you were a magnet and you had at once the uncomfortable sensation that you might find her clinging impossible to shake off if one passed her in the village too or coming down from her blackberrying in the thickets on the downstheir cottage lay just below the south downsone knew that she would be lingering along looking back till you were out of sight somehow one hardly thought of her as a girl at all she seemed so far from all human hearts so wandering in a queer lost world of her own and to imagine what she could be thinking was as impossible as it is with animals once i passed her and her mother dawdling slowly in a lane then heard the dotandgoone footsteps pattering after me and the childish voice rather soft and timid say behind my shoulder would you please buy some blackberries sir she was almost pretty at that moment flushed and breathless at having actually spoken to me but her eyes hanging on my face brought a sort of nightmare feeling at once of being unable to get rid of her  isnt it a cruel thing when you come to think of it that there should be born into the world poor creatureschildren dogs cats horseswho want badly to love and be loved and yet whom no one can quite put up with much less feel affection for  well what happened to her is what will always happen to such as those one way or another in a world where the callous abound for however unlovable a woman or girl she has her use to a man just as a dog or a horse has to a master who cares nothing for it  soon after i bought those blackberries i went out to france on military duty i got my leave a year later and went home it was late september very lovely weather and i took a real holiday walking or lying about up on the downs and only coming down at sunset on one of those days when you really enter heaven so pure are the lines of the hills so cool the blue the green the chalkwhite colouring under the smile of the afternoon suni was returning down that same lane when i came on emleen sitting in a gap of the bank with her dishevelled hat beside her and her chin sunk on her hands my appearance seemed to drag her out of a heavy dreamher eyes awoke became startled rolled furtively she scrambled up dropped her little old school curtsey then all confused faced the bank as if she were going to climb it she was taller her dress longer her hair gathered up and it was very clear what was soon going to happen to her i walked on in a rage at her agebarely sixteen even yet i am a doctor and accustomed to most things but this particular crime against children of that helpless sort does make my blood boil nothing not even passion to excuse itwho could feel passion for that poor childnothing but the cold clumsy lust of some young ruffian yes i walked on in a rage and went straight to her mothers cottage that wretched woman was incapable of moral indignation or else the adventures of her elder daughter had exhausted her powers of expression yes she admitted emleen had got herself into trouble too but she would not tell she wouldnt say nothin against nobody it was a bad business surely an now there would be three o them an alliner was properly upset that he was that was all there was to be had out of her one felt that she knew or suspected more but her fingers had been so burned over the elder girl that anything to her was better than a fuss  i saw alliner he was a decent fellow though dirty distressed in his simple shallowpated way and more obviously ignorant than his wife i spoke to the schoolmistress a shrewd and kindly married woman  poor emmeline yes she had noticed it was very sad and wicked she hinted but would not do more than hint at the son of the miller but he was back again fighting in france now and after all her evidence amounted to no more than his reputation with girls besides one is very careful what one says in a country village i however was so angry that i should not have been careful if i could have got hold of anything at all definite  i did not see the child again before my leave was up the very next thing i heard of her was in a newspaperemmeline alliner sixteen had been committed for trial for causing the death of her illegitimate child by exposure i was on the sick list in january and went home to rest i had not been there two days before i received a visit from a solicitor of our assize town who came to ask me if i would give evidence at the girls trial as to the nature of her home surroundings i learned from him the details of the lugubrious business it seems that she had slipped out one bitter afternoon in december barely a fortnight after her confinement carrying her baby there was snow on the ground and it was freezing hard but the sun was bright and it was that perhaps which tempted her she must have gone up towards the downs by the lane where i had twice met her gone up and stopped at the very gap in the bank where she had been sitting lost in that heavy dream when i saw her last she appears to have subsided there in the snow for there she was found by the postman just as it was getting dark leaning over her knees as if stupefied with her chin buried in her handsand the baby stiff and dead in the snow beside her when i told the lawyer how i had seen her there ten weeks before and of the curious dazed state she had been in he said at once ah the exact spot thats very important it looks uncommonly as if it were there that she came by her misfortune what do you think its almost evident that shed lost sense of her surroundings baby and all i shall ask you to tell us about that at the trial shes a most peculiar child i cant get anything out of her i keep asking her for the name of the man or some indication of how it came about but all she says is nobodynobody another case of immaculate conception poor little creature shes very pathetic and thats her best chance who could condemn a child like that  and so indeed it turned out i spared no feelings in my evidence the mother and father were in court and i hope mrs alliner liked my diagnosis of her maternal qualities my description of how emleen was sitting when i met her in september tallied so exactly with the postmans account of how he met her that i could see the jury were impressed and then there was the figure of the child herself lonely there in the dock the french have a word hébétée surely there never was a human object to which it applied better she stood like a little tired pony whose head hangs down halfsleeping after exertion and those hare eyes of hers were glued to the judges face for all the world as if she were worshipping him it must have made him extraordinarily uncomfortable he summed up very humanely dwelling on the necessity of finding intention in her conduct towards the baby and he used some good strong language against the unknown man the jury found her not guilty and she was discharged the schoolmistress and i anticipating this had found her a refuge with some sisters of mercy who ran a sort of home not far away and to that we took her without a by your leave to the mother  when i came home the following summer i found an opportunity of going to look her up she was amazingly improved in face and dress but she had attached herself to one of the sistersa broad finelooking womanto such a pitch that she seemed hardly alive when out of her sight the sister spoke of it to me with real concern  i really dont know what to do with her she said she seems incapable of anything unless i tell her she only feels things through me its really quite trying and sometimes very funny poor little soul but its tragic for her if i told her to jump out of her bedroom window or lie down in that pond and drown shed do it without a moments hesitation she cant go through life like this she must learn to stand on her own feet we must try and get her a good place where she can learn what responsibility means and get a will of her own  i looked at the sister so broad so capable so handsome and so puzzled and i thought yes i know exactly shes on your nerves and where in the world will you find a place for her where she wont become a sort of nightmare to some one with her devotion or else get it taken advantage of again and i urged them to keep her a little longer they did for when i went home for good six months later i found that she had only just gone into a place with an old ladypatient of mine in a small villa on the outskirts of our village she used to open the door to me when i called there on my rounds once a week she retained vestiges of the neatness which had been grafted on her by the sister but her frock was already beginning to sag down on one side and her hair to look illtreated the old lady spoke to her with a sort of indulgent impatience and it was clear that the girls devotion was not concentrated upon her i caught myself wondering what would be its next object never able to help the feeling that if i gave a sign it would be myself you may be sure i gave no sign whats the good i hold the belief that people should not force themselves to human contacts or relationships which they cannot naturally and without irritation preserve ive seen these heroic attempts come to grief so often in fact i dont think ive ever seen one succeed not even between blood relations in the long run they merely pervert and spoil the fibre of the attempter without really benefiting the attemptee behind healthy relationships between human beings or even between human beings and animals there must be at least some rudimentary affinity thats the tragedy of poor little souls like emleen where on earth can they find the affinity which makes life good the very fact that they must worship is their destruction it was a soldieror so they saidwho had brought her to her first grief i had seen her adoring the judge at the trial then the handsome uniformed sister and i as the village doctor was a sort of tinpot deity in those parts so i was very careful to keep my manner to her robust and almost brusque  and then one day i passed her coming from the post office she was looking back her cheeks were flushed and she was almost pretty there by the inn a butchers cart was drawn up the young butcher new to our village he had a stiff knee and had been discharged from the army was taking out a leg of mutton he had a daredevil face and eyes that had seen much death he had evidently been chatting with her for he was still smiling and even as i passed him he threw her a jerk of the head  two sundays after that i was coming down past wileys copse at dusk and heard a mans coarse laugh there through a tiny gap in the nutbushes i saw a couple seated he had his leg stiffly stretched out and his arm round the girl who was leaning towards him her lips were parted and those hares eyes of hers were looking up into his face adoration  i dont know what it was my duty to have done i only know that i did nothing but slunk on with a lump in my throat  adoration there it was again hopeless incurable devotions to those who cared no more for her than for a slice of suetpudding to be eaten hot gulped down forgotten or loathed in the recollection and there they are these girls one to almost every village of this countrya nightmare to us all the look on her face was with me all that evening and in my dreams  i know no more for two days later i was summoned north to take up work in a military hospital  1917     viii  buttercupnight   why is it that in some places one has such a feeling of life being not merely a long pictureshow for human eyes but a single breathing glowing growing thing of which we are no more important a part than the swallows and magpies the foals and sheep in the meadows the sycamores and ashtrees and flowers in the fields the rocks and little bright streams or even than the long fleecy clouds and their softshouting drivers the winds  true we register these parts of being and theyso far as we knowdo not register us yet it is impossible to feel in such places as i speak of the busy dry complacent sense of being all that matters which in general we humans have so strongly  in these rare spots which are always in the remote country untouched by the advantages of civilisation one is conscious of an enwrapping web or mist of spiritis it perhaps the glamourous and wistful wraith of all the vanished shapes once dwelling there in such close comradeship  it was sunday of an early june when i first came on one such far down in the west country i had walked with my knapsack twenty miles and there being no room at the tiny inn of the very little village they directed me to a wicket gate through which by a path leading down a field i would come to a farmhouse where i might find lodging the moment i got into that field i felt within me a peculiar contentment and sat down on a rock to let the feeling grow in an old hollytree rooted to the bank about fifty yards away two magpies evidently had a nest for they were coming and going avoiding my view as much as possible yet with a certain stealthy confidence which made one feel that they had long prescriptive right to that dwellingplace around far as one could see was hardly a yard of level ground all hill and hollow long ago reclaimed from the moor and against the distant folds of the hills the farmhouse and its thatched barns were just visible embowered amongst beeches and some dark trees with a soft bright crown of sunlight over the whole a gentle wind brought a faint rustling up from those beeches and from a large limetree which stood by itself on this wind some little snowy clouds very high and fugitive in that blue heaven were always moving over but i was most struck by the buttercups never was field so lighted up by those tiny lamps those little bright pieces of flower china out of the great pottery they covered the whole ground as if the sunlight had fallen bodily from the sky in millions of gold patines and the fields below as well down to what was evidently a stream were just as thick with the extraordinary warmth and glory of them  leaving the rock at last i went towards the house it was long and low and rather sad standing in a garden all mossy grass and buttercups with a few rhododendrons and flowery shrubs below a row of fine old irish yews on the stone verandah a grey sheepdog and a very small goldenhaired child were sitting close together absorbed in each other a woman came in answer to my knock and told me in a pleasant soft slurring voice that i might stay the night and dropping my knapsack i went out again through an old gate under a stone arch i came on the farmyard quite deserted save for a couple of ducks moving slowly down a gutter in the sunlight and noticing the upper half of a stabledoor open i went across in search of something living there in a rough loosebox on thick straw lay a chestnut longtailed mare with the skin and head of a thoroughbred she was swathed in blankets and her face all cut about the cheeks and over the eyes rested on an ordinary humans pillow held by a bearded man in shirtsleeves while leaning against the whitewashed walls sat fully a dozen other men perfectly silent very gravely and intently gazing the mares eyes were halfclosed and what could be seen of them was dull and blueish as though she had been through a long time of pain save for her rapid breathing she lay quite still but her neck and ears were streaked with sweat and every now and then her hindlegs quivered seeing me at the door she raised her head uttering a queer halfhuman noise but the bearded man at once put his hand on her forehead and with a woa my dear woa my pretty pressed it down again while with the other hand he plumped up the pillow for her cheek and as the mare obediently let fall her head one of the men said in a low voice i never see anything so like a christian and the others echoed him in chorus like a christianlike a christian it went to ones heart to watch her and i moved off down the farm lane into an old orchard where the appletrees were still in bloom with beesvery small onesbusy on the blossoms whose petals were dropping on to the dock leaves and buttercups in the long grass climbing over the bank at the far end i found myself in a meadow the like of whichso wild and yet so lushi think i have never seen along one hedge of its meandering length were masses of pink mayflower and between two little running streams quantities of yellow water irisdaggers as they call themwere growing the printfrock orchis too was all over the grass and everywhere the buttercups great stones coated with yellowish moss were strewn among the ashtrees and dark hollies and through a grove of beeches on the far side such as corot might have painted a girl was running with a youth after her who jumped down over the bank and vanished thrushes blackbirds yaffles cuckoos and one other very monotonous little bird were in full song and this with the sound of the streams and the wind and the shapes of the rocks and trees the colours of the flowers and the warmth of the sun gave one a feeling of being lost in a very wilderness of nature some ponies came slowly from the far end tangled gipsyheaded little creatures stared and went off again at speed it was just one of those places where any day the spirit of all nature might start up in one of those white gaps which separate the trees and rocks but though i sat a long time waiting hopingpan did not come  they were all gone from the stable when i went back to the farm except the bearded nurse and one tall fellow who might have been the dying gaul as he crouched there in the straw and the mare was sleepingher head between her nurses knees  that night i woke at two oclock to find it bright as day almost with moonlight coming in through the flimsy curtains and smitten with the feeling which comes to us creatures of routine so rarelyof what beauty and strangeness we let slip by without ever stretching out hand to grasp iti got up dressed stole downstairs and out  never was such a night of frozen beauty never such dreamtranquillity the wind had dropped and the silence was such that one hardly liked to tread even on the grass from the lawn and fields there seemed to be a mist risingin truth the moonlight caught on the dewy buttercups and across this ghostly radiance the shadows of the yewtrees fell in dense black bars suddenly i bethought me of the mare how was she faring this marvellous night very softly opening the door into the yard i tiptoed across a light was burning in her box and i could hear her making the same halfhuman noise she had made in the afternoon as if wondering at her feelings and instantly the voice of the bearded man talking to her as one might talk to a child oover me darlin yuve abeen long enough o that side waay my swateyu let old jack turn u then then came a scuffling in the straw a thud again that halfhuman sigh and his voice putt your ead to piller thats my dandy gel old jack wouldn urt u no moren ef u was the queen then only her quick breathing could be heard and his cough and mutter as he settled down once more to his long vigil i crept very softly up to the window but she heard me at once and at the movement of her head the old fellow sat up blinking his eyes out of the bush of his grizzled hair and beard opening the door i said  may i come in  oo ay come in zurr if um a mind to  i sat down beside him on a sack and for some time we did not speak taking each other in one of his legs was lame so that he had to keep it stretched out all the time and awfully tired he looked greytired  youre a great nurse i said at last it must be hard work watching out here all night  his eyes twinkled they were of that bright grey kind through which the soul looks out  aw no he said ah dont grudge it vur a dumb animal poor thingsthey cant elp theirzelves manys the naight ahve zat up with orses and beasts tu tes en mecant bear to zee dumb creatures zuffer and laying his hand on the mares ears they zay orses avent no souls tes my belief theym gotten souls zame as us manys the christian ahve seen aint got the soul of an orse zame with the beastsan the sheep tes only they cant spake their minds  and where i said do you think they go to when they die he looked at me a little queerly fancying perhaps that i was leading him into some trap making sure too that i was a real stranger without power over him body or soulfor humble folk in the country must be careful then reassured and nodding in his bushy beard he answered knowingly  ah dont think they goes zo very far  why do you ever see their spirits  naw naw i never zeen none but for all they zay ah dont think none of us goes such a brave way off theres room for all dead or alive an theres christians ahve zeenwell ef theym not dead for gude then neither arent dumb animals for sure  and rabbits squirrels birds even insects how about them  he was silent as if i had carried him a little beyond the confines of his philosophy then shook his head  tes all a bit dimsylike but yu watch dumb animals zurr even the laste littlest one and yull zee they knows a lot moren what us thenks an they dus things tu that putts shame on a mans often as not theyve a got that in em as passes show and not noticing my stare at that unconscious plagiarism he added ahd zuuner zet up of a naight with an orse than with an uman theyve more zense and patience and stroking the mares forehead he added now my dear time for yu t ave yure bottle  i waited to see her take her draught and lay her head down once more on the pillow then hoping he would get a sleep i rose to go  aw tes nothin much he said this time o year not like in winter twill come day before yu know these buttercupnights and twinkling up at me out of his kindly bearded face he settled himself again into the straw i stole a look back at his rough figure propped against the sack with the mares head down beside his knee at her swathed chestnut body and the gold of the straw the white walls and dusky nooks and shadows of that old stable illumined by the dimsy light of the old lantern and with the sense of having seen something holy i crept away up into the field where i had lingered the day before and sat down on the same halfway rock close on dawn it was the moon still sailing wide over the moor and the flowers of this buttercupnight fast closed not taken in at all by her cold glory  most silent hour of all the twentyfourwhen the soul slips half out of sheath and hovers in the cool when the spirit is most in tune with what soon or late happens to all spirits hour when a man cares least whether or no he be alive as we understand the word none of us goes such a brave way offtheres room for all dead or alive though it was almost unbearably colourless and quiet there was warmth in thinking of those words of his in the thought too of the millions of living things snugly asleep all round warmth in realising that unanimity of sleep insects and flowers birds men beasts the very leaves on the treesaway in slumberland waiting for the first bird to chirrup one had perhaps even a stronger feeling than in daytime of the unity and communion of all life of the subtle brotherhood of living things that fall all together into oblivion and all together wake  when dawn comes while moonlight is still powdering the worlds face quite a long time passes before one realises how the quality of the light has changed and so it was day before i knew it then the sun came up above the hills dew began to sparkle and colour to stain the sky that first praise of the sun from every bird and leaf and blade of grass the tremulous flush and chime of dawn one has strayed far from the heart of things that it should come as something strange and wonderful indeed i noticed that the beasts and birds gazed at me as if i simply could not be there at this hour which so belonged to them and to me too they seemed strange and newwith that in them which passeth show and as of a world where man did not exist or existed only as just another sort of beast or bird  but just then began the crowning glory of that dawnthe opening and lighting of the buttercups not one did i actually see unclose yet of a sudden they were awake and the fields once more a blaze of gold
