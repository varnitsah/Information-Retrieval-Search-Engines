i should add a word of disclamation in my time there have been two ministers in that parish of the first i have a special reason to speak well even had there been any to think ill the second i have often met in private and long in the due phrase sat under in his church and neither here nor there have i heard an unkind or ugly word upon his lips the preacher of the text had thus no original in that particular parish but when i was a boy he might have been observed in many others he was then like the schoolmaster abroad and by recent advices it would seem he has not yet entirely disappeared       illustrators note   i am not certain of the particular parish stevenson had in his mind when he wrote this poem but i am certain that the description is typical of almost any scottish rural parish lowden that is lothian or other in illustrating the verses it has seemed to me therefore unnecessary to make portraits from any one locality i fancy the writer looked back to the period of his boyhood and to the people he knew in more than one part of his native country so i have tried to depict that period and that class of people as i remember them in various counties of his land and mine
