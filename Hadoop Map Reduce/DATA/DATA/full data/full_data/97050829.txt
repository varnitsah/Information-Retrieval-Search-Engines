97050829	fort desolation by rm ballantyne    chapter one  or solitude in the wilderness  the outskirter  to some minds solitude is depressing to others it is congenial  it was the former to our friend john robinson yet he had a large share of it in his chequered life  johnmore familiarly known as jackwas as romantic as his name was the reverse  to look at him you would have supposed that he was the most ordinary of commonplace men but if you had known him as we did you would have discovered that there was a deep silent but everflowing river of enthusiasm energy fervourin a word romancein his soul which seldom or never manifested itself in words and only now and then on rare occasions flashed out in a lightning glance or blazed up in a fiery countenance  for the most part jack was calm as a millpond deep as the atlantic straightforward and grave as an undertakers clerk and goodhumoured as an unspoilt and healthy child  jack never made a joke but certes he could enjoy one and he had a way of showing his enjoyment by a twinkle in his blue eye and a chuckle in his throat that was peculiarly impressive  jack was a type of a large class  he was what we may call an outskirter of the world  he was one of those who from the force of necessity or of selfwill or of circumstances are driven to the outer circle of this world to do as adam and eves family did battle with nature in her wildest scenes and moods to earn his bread literally in the sweat of his brow  jack was a middlesized man of strong make  he was not sufficiently large to overawe men by his size neither was he so small as to invite impertinence from big bullies of whom there were plenty in his neighbourhood  in short being an unpretending man and a plain man with a good nose and large chin and sandy hair he was not usually taken much notice of by strangers during his journeyings in the world but when vigorous action in cases of emergency was required jack robinson was the man to make himself conspicuous  it is not our intention to give an account of jacks adventurous life from beginning to end but to detail the incidents of a sojourn of two months at fort desolation in almost utter solitude in order to show one of the many phases of rough life to which outskirters are frequently subjected  in regard to his early life it may be sufficient to say that jack after being born created such perpetual disturbance and storm in the house that his worthy father came to look upon him as a perfect pest and as soon as possible sent him to a public school where he fought like a mameluke bey learned his lessons with the zeal of a philosopher and at the end of ten years ran away to sea where he became as sick as a dog and as miserable as a convicted felon  poor jack was honest of heart and generous of spirit but many a long hard year did he spend in the rugged parts of the earth ere he recovered if he ever did recover from the evil effects of this first false step  in course of time jack was landed in canada with only a few shillings in his pocket from that period he became an outskirter  the romance in his nature pointed to the backwoods he went thither at once and was not disappointed  at first the wild life surpassed his expectations but as time wore on the tinsel began to wear off the face of things and he came to see them as they actually were  nevertheless the romance of life did not wear out of his constitution  enthusiasm quiet but deep stuck to him all through his career and carried him on and over difficulties that would have disgusted and turned back many a colder spirit  jacks first success was the obtaining of a situation as clerk in the store of a general merchant in an outskirt settlement of canada  dire necessity drove him to this  he had been three weeks without money and nearly two days without food before he succumbed  having given in however he worked like a trojan and would certainly have advanced himself in life if his employer had not failed and left him minus a portion of his salary to try again  next he became an engineer on board one of the missouri steamers in which capacity he burst his boiler and threw himself and the passengers into the riverthe captain having adopted the truly yankee expedient of sitting down on the safetyvalve while racing with another boat  afterwards jack robinson became clerk in one of the ontario steamboats but growing tired of this life he went up the ottawa and became overseer of a sawmill  here being on the frontier of civilisation he saw the roughest of canadian life  the lumbermen of that district are a mixed racefrenchcanadians irishmen indians halfcastes etceteraand whatever good qualities these men might possess in the way of hewing timber and bushlife they were sadly deficient in the matters of morality and temperance  but jack was a man of tact and good temper and played his cards well  he jested with the jocular sympathised with the homesick doctored the ailing in a rough and ready fashion peculiarly his own and avoided the quarrelsome  thus he became a general favourite  of course it was not to be expected that he could escape an occasional broil and it was herein that his early education did him good service he had been trained in an english school where he became one of the best boxers  the lumberers on the ottawa were not practised in this science they indulged in that kicking tearing pommelling sort of mode which is so repugnant to the feelings of an englishman  the consequence was that jack had few fights but these were invariably with the largest bullies of the district and he in each case inflicted such tremendous facial punishment on his opponent that he became a noted man against whom few cared to pit themselves  there are none so likely to enjoy peace as those who are prepared for war  jack used sometimes to say with a smile that his few battles were the price he had to pay for peace  our hero was unlucky  the sawmill failedits master being a drunkard when that went down he entered the lumber trade where he made the acquaintance of a young scotchman of congenial mind and temperament who suggested the setting up of a store in a promising locality and proposed entering into partnership  murray and robinson was forthwith painted by the latter who was a bit of an artist over the door of a small loghouse and the store soon became well known and much frequented by the sparse population as well as by those engaged in the timber trade  but the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong  there must have been a screw loose somewhere for bad debts accumulated and losses were incurred which finally brought the firm to the ground and left its dissevered partners to begin the world over again  after this poor jack robinson fell into low spirits for a time but he soon recovered and bought a small piece of land at a nominal price in a region so wild that he had to cut his own road to it fell the trees with his own hand and in short reclaim it from the wilderness on the margin of which it lay  this was hard work but jack liked hard work and whatever work he undertook he always did it well  strange that such a man could not get on yet so it was that in a couple of years he found himself little better off than he had been when he entered on his new property  the region too was not a tempting one  no adventurous spirits had located themselves beside him and only a few had come within several miles of his habitation  this did not suit our heros sociable temperament and he began to despond very much  still his sanguine spirit led him to persevere and there is no saying how long he might have continued to spend his days and his energies in felling trees and sowing among the stumps and hoping for better days had not his views been changed and his thoughts turned into another channel by a letter    chapter two  the letter and its consequences  one fine spring morning jack was sitting smoking his pipe after breakfast at the door of his log cabin looking pensively out upon the treestumpencumbered field which constituted his farm  he had facetiously named his residence the mountain house in consequence of there being neither mountain nor hill larger than an inverted washhand basin within ten miles of him  he was wont to defend the misnomer on the ground that it served to keep him in remembrance of the fact that hills really existed in other parts of the world  jack was in a desponding mood  his pipe would not draw that morning and his mind had been more active than usual for a few days past revolving the past the present and the future  in short jack was cross  there could be no doubt whatever about it for he suddenly and without warning dashed his pipe to pieces against a log went into the house for another which he calmly filled as he resumed his former seat lit and continued to smoke for some time in sulky silence  we record this fact because it was quite contrary to jacks amiable and patient character and showed that some deep emotions were stirring within him  the second pipe drew well  probably it was this that induced him to give utterance to the expression  i wonder how long this sort of thing will last  just as long as youve a mind to let it and no longer answered a man clad in the garb of a trapper whose mocassin foot had given no indication of his approach until he was within a couple of paces of the door  is that you joe said jack looking up and pointing to a log which served as a seat on the other side of the doorway  its all thats of me replied joe  sit down and fill your pipe out of my pouch joe  its good baccy youll find  any news  i suppose not  there never is and if there was what would be the odds to me  in the blues remarked the hunter regarding jack with a peculiar smile through his first puff of smoke  rather said jack  grog inquired joe  havent tasted a drop for months replied jack  all square here inquired the hunter tapping his stomach  could digest gunflints and screw nails  the two smoked in silence for some time then joe drew forth a soiled letter which he handed to his companion saying  its bin lying at the postoffice for some weeks and as the postmaster knowd i was comin here he asked me to take it  ive a notion it may be an offer to buy your clearin for ive heerd two or three fellows speakin about it  now as i want to buy it myself if yer disposed to sell it i hereby make you the first offer  jack robinson continued to smoke in silence gazing abstractedly at the letter  since his mother had died a year before the date of which we write he had not received a line from any one insomuch that he had given up calling at the postoffice on his occasional visits to the nearest settlement  this letter therefore took him by surprise all the more that it was addressed in the handwriting of his former partner murray  breaking the seal he read as follows    fort kamenistaquoia april the somethingth    dear jackyoull be surprised to see my fist but not more   surprised than i was to hear from an old hunter just arrived that you   had taken to farming  its not your forte jack my boy  be advised   sell off the farm for what it will fetch and come and join me  my   antecedents are not in my favour i grant but facts are stubborn   things and it is a fact that i am making dollars here like stones   im a furtrader my boy  have joined a small company and up to this   time have made a good thing of it  you know something of the fur   trade if i mistake not  do come and join us we want such a man as   you at a new post we have established on the coast of labrador   shooting fishing hunting ad libitum  eating drinking sleeping   ad infinitum  what would you more  come like a good fellow and   be happy    ever thine j murray  ill sell the farm said jack robinson folding the letter  you will exclaimed joe  whats your price  come over it with me and look at the fixings before i tell you said jack  they went over it together and looked at every fence and stump and implement  they visited the live stock and estimated the value of the sprouting crop  then they returned to the house where they struck a bargain offhand  that evening jack bade adieu to the mountain house mounted his horse with his worldly goods at the pommel of the saddle and rode away leaving joe the trapper in possession  in process of time our hero rode through the settlements to montreal where he sold his horse purchased a few necessaries and made his way down the saint lawrence to the frontier settlements of the bleak and almost uninhabited north shore of the gulf  here he found some difficulty in engaging a man to go with him in a canoe towards the coast of labrador  an irishman in a fit of despondency at length agreed but on reaching a sawmill that had been established by a couple of adventurous yankees in a region that seemed to be the outskirts of creation paddy repented and vowed hed go no farther for love or money  jack robinson earnestly advised the faithless man to go home and help his grandmother thenceforth to plant murphies after which he embarked in his canoe alone and paddled away into the dreary north  camping out in the woods at night paddling all day and living on biscuit and salt pork with an occasional duck or gull by way of variety never seeing a human face from morn till night nor hearing the sound of any voice except his own jack pursued his voyage for fourteen days  at the end of that time he descried fort kamenistaquoia  it consisted of four small loghouses perched on a conspicuous promontory with a flagstaff in the midst of them  here he was welcomed warmly by his friend john murray and his colleagues and was entertained for three days sumptuously on fresh salmon salt pork pancakes and tea  intellectually he was regaled with glowing accounts of the fur trade and the salmon fisheries of that region  now jack said murray on the third day after his arrival while they walked in front of the fort smoking a morning pipe it is time that you were off to the new fort  one of our best men has built it but he is not a suitable person to take charge and as the salmon season has pretty well advanced we are anxious to have you there to look after the salting and sending of them to quebec  what do you call the new fort inquired jack  well it has not yet got a name  weve been so much in the habit of styling it the new fort that the necessity of another name has not occurred to us  perhaps as you are to be its first master we may leave the naming of it to you  very good said jack i am ready at a moments notice  shall i set off this forenoon  not quite so sharp as that replied murray laughing  tomorrow morning at daybreak will do  there is a small sloop lying in a creek about twenty miles below this  we beached her there last autumn youll go down in a boat with three men and haul her into deep water there will be spring tides in two days so with the help of tackle youll easily manage it  thence you will sail to the new fort forty miles farther along the coast and take charge  the three men you mean to give me know their work i presume said jack  of course they do  none of them have been at the fort however  oh  how then shall we find it inquired jack  by observation replied the other  keep a sharp look out as you coast along and you cant miss it  the idea of mists and darkness and storms occurred to jack robinson but he only answered very good  can any of the three men navigate the sloop he inquired  not that im aware of said murray but you know something of navigation yourself dont you  no nothing  pooh nonsense  have you never sailed a boat  yes occasionally  well its the same thing  if a squall comes keep a steady hand on the helm and a sharp eye to windard and youre safe as the bank  if its too strong for you loose the halyards let the sheets fly and down with the helm the easiest thing in the world if you only look alive and dont get flurried  very good said jack and as he said so his pipe went out so he knocked out the ashes and refilled it  next morning our hero rowed away with his three men and soon discovered the creek of which his friend had spoken  here he found the sloop a clumsy tub of about twenty tons burden and here jacks troubles began  the fairy as the sloop was named happened to have been beached during a very high tide  it now lay high and dry in what once had been mud on the shore of a landlocked bay or pond under the shadow of some towering pines  the spot looked like an inland lakelet on the margin of which one might have expected to find a bear or a moosedeer but certainly not a sloop  oh ye shall nevair git him off said francois xavier one of the three mena frenchcanadianon beholding the stranded vessel  well try said pierre another of the three men and a burly halfbreed  try exclaimed rollo the third of the three mena tall powerful illfavoured man who was somewhat of a bully who could not tell where he had been born and did not know who his father and mother had been having been forsaken by them in his infancy  try you might as well try to lift a mountain  ive a mind to go straight back to kamenistaquoia and tell mr murray that to his face  have you said jack robinson in a quiet peculiar tone accompanied by a gaze that had the effect of causing rollo to look a little confused  come along lads well begin at once he continued it will be full tide in an hour or so  get the tackle ready francois the rest of you set to work and clear away the stones and rubbish from under her sides  jack threw off his coat and began to work like a heroas he was  the others followed his example and the result was that when the tide rose to its full height the sloop was freed of all the rubbish that had collected round the hull the block tackle was affixed to the mast the rope attached to a tree on the opposite side of the creek and the party were ready to haul  but although they hauled until their sinews cracked and the large veins of their necks and foreheads swelled almost to bursting the sloop did not move an inch  the tide began to fall and in a few minutes that opportunity was gone  there were not many such tides to count on so jack applied all his energies and ingenuity to the work  by the time the next tide rose they had felled two large pines and applied them to the side of the vessel  two of the party swung at the ends of these the other two hauled on the blocktackle this time the sloop moved a little at the full flood but the moment of hope soon passed and the end was not yet attained  the next tide was the last high one  they worked like desperate men during the interval  the wedge was the mechanical power which prevailed at last  several wedges were inserted under the vessels side and driven home  thus the sloop was canted over a little towards the water when the tide was at the full one man hauled at the tackle two men swung at the ends of the levers and jack hammered home the wedges at each heave and pull thus securing every inch of movement  the result was that the sloop slid slowly down the bank into deep water  it is wonderful how small a matter will arouse human enthusiasm  the cheer that was given on the successful floating of the fairy was certainly as full of fervour if not of volume as that which followed the launching of the great eastern  setting sail down the gulf they ran before a fair breeze which speedily increased to a favouring gale  before night a small bay was descried with three loghuts on the shore  this was the new fort  they ran into the bay grazing a smooth rock in their passage which caused the fairy to tremble from stem to stern and cast anchor close to a wooden jetty  on the end of this a solitary individual apparently a maniac was seen capering and yelling wildly  what fort is this shouted jack  sorrow wan o me knows cried the maniac its niver been christened yet  faix if its a fort at all id call it fort disolation  och but its lonesome ive been these three daysniver a wan here but meself an the ghosts  come ashore darlints and comfort me  fort desolation indeed muttered jack robinson as he looked round him sadly not a bad name  ill adopt it  lower the boat lads  thus jack took possession of his new home    chapter three  domestic and personal matters  jack robinsons first proceeding on entering the new fort and assuming the command was to summon the man supposed to be a maniac named teddy odonel to his presence in the hall  your name is teddy odonel said jack  the same sir at your sarvice said teddy with a respectful pull at his forelock  they was used to call me mister odonel when i was in the army but ive guv that up long ago an dropped the title wid the commission  indeed then you were a commissioned officer inquired jack with a smile  be no manes  it was a slight longer title than that i had  they called me a noncommissioned officer  i niver could find in me heart to consociate wid them consaited commissionersthough there was wan or two of em as was desarvin o the three stripes  but i niver took kindly to sodgerin  it was in the howth militia i was  good enough boys they was in their way but i couldnt pull wid them no how  they made me a corpral for good conduct but faix the great review finished me for i got into that state of warlike feeling that i loaded me muskit five times widout firin an there was such a row round about that i didnt know the dirty thing had niver wint off till the fifth time when she bursted into smithereens an wint off intirely  no wan iver seed a scrag of her after that  an the worst was she carried away the small finger of bob rileys left hand  bob threw down his muskit an ran off the ground howlin so i picked the wipon up an blazed away at the inimy but bad luck to him bob had left his ramrod in and i sint it right through the flank of an owld donkey as was pullin an apple and orange cart  oh how that baste did kick up its heels to be sure and the apples and oranges they was flyin likewell wellthe long and the short was that i wint an towld the colonel i couldnt stop no longer in such a regiment  so i guv it up an comed out here  and became a furtrader said jack robinson with a smile  just so sur an fortbuilder to boot for being a jiner to trade and handy wid the tools mr murray sent me down here to build the place and take command but i spose im suppersheeded now  well i believe you are teddy but i hope that you will yet do good service as my lieutenant  the beaming smile on teddys face showed that he was well pleased to be relieved from the responsibilities of office  sure said he the throuble i have had wid the min an the salvages for the last six weeksits past belavin  an thin whin i sint the men down to the river to fushmore nor twinty miles offan whin the salvages wint away and left me alone wid only wan old salvage woman och  id not wish my worst inimy in me sitivation  then the savages have been giving you trouble have they  they have sur but not so much as the min  well teddy said jack go and fetch me something to eat and then you shall sit down and give me an account of things in general  but first give my men food  sure theyve got it replied teddy with a broad grin  that spalpeen they calls rollo axed for meat the first thing in a voice that made me think hed ait me up alive av he didnt git it  so i guv em the run o the pantry  whatll yer plaze to dhrink sur  what have you got  tay and coffee sur not to mintion wather  theres only flour an salt pork to ait for this is a bad place for game  ive not seed a bird or a bear for three weeks an the seals is too cute for me  but ill bring ye the best that weve got  teddy odonel hastened to the kitchen a small loghut in rear of the dwellinghouse and left jack robinson alone in the hall  jack rose thrust his hands deep into his pockets and walked to the window  it was glazed with parchment with the exception of the centre square which was of glass  pleasant uncommonly pleasant he muttered as he surveyed the landscape  in front lay a flat beach of sand with the gulf beyond the horizon being veiled in mist  up the river there was a flat beach with a hill beyond  it was a black ironlooking hill devoid of all visible verdure and it plunged abruptly down into the sea as if it were trying fiercely to drown itself  down the river there was a continuation of flat beach with apparently nothing whatever beyond  the only objects that enlivened the dreary expanse were the sloop at the end of the wooden jetty and a small flagstaff in front of the house from which a flag was flying in honour of the arrival of the new governor  at the foot of this flagstaff there stood an old iron cannon which looked pugnacious and cross as if it longed to burst itself and blow down all visible creation  jack robinsons countenance became a simple blank as he took the first survey of his new dominions  suddenly a gleam of hope flitted across the blank  perhaps the back is better he muttered opening the door that led to the rear of the premises  in order to get out he had to pass through the kitchen where he found his men busy with fried pork and flour cakes and his lieutenant teddy preparing coffee  what is that inquired jack pointing to a small heap of brown substance which teddy was roasting in a fryingpan  sure its coffee said the man  eh inquired jack  coffee sur repeated teddy with emphasis  what is it made of inquired jack  breadcrumbs sur  im used to make it of pais but it takes longer dye see for ive got to pound em in a cloth after theyre roasted the crumbs is amost as good as the pais an quicker made whin yer in a hurry  jacks first impulse was to countermand the crumbs and order tea but he refrained and went out to survey the back regions of his new home  he found that the point selected for the establishment of the fort was a plain of sand on which little herbage of any kind grew  in rear of the house there was a belt of stunted bushes which as he went onward into the interior became a wood of stunted firs  this seemed to grow a little more dense farther inland and finally terminated at the base of the distant and rugged mountains of the interior  in fact he found that he was established on a sandbank which had either been thrown up by the sea or at no very remote period had formed part of its bed returning home so as to enter by the front door he observed an enclosed space a few hundred yards distant from the fort  curious to know what it was he walked up to it and looking over the stockade beheld numerous little mounds of sand with wooden crosses at the head of them it was the burialground of the establishment  trade had been carried on here by a few adventurous white men before the fort was built  some of their number having died a space had been enclosed as a buryingground  the roman catholic indians afterwards used it and it was eventually consecrated with much ceremony by a priest  with a face from which every vestige of intelligence was removed jack robinson returned to the fort and sat down in solitary state in the hall  in the act of sitting down he discovered that the only armchair in the room was unsteady on its legs these being of unequal length there were two other chairs without arms and equally unsteady on their legs  these as well as everything in the room were made of firwood as yet unpainted  in the empty fireplace jack observed a piece of charcoal which he took up and began in an absent way to sketch on the white wall  he portrayed a raving maniac as large as life and then sitting down began insensibly to hum    i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls  in the midst of which he was interrupted by the entrance of his lieutenant with a tray of viands  ah yer a purty creatur exclaimed teddy pausing with a look of admiration before the maniac  come teddy sit down and lets have the news  what have we here said jack looking at three covered plates which were placed before him  salt pork fried said teddy removing the cover  and here  salt pork biled said the man removing the second cover an salt pork cold he added removing the third  you see sur i wasnt sure which way yed like it an ye was out whin i come to ax so i just did it up in three fashions  heres loaf bread an its not bad though i say it that made it  as jack cut down into the loaf he naturally remembered those lines of a wellknown writer    who has not tasted homemade bread   a heavy compound of putty and   lead  are these cakes he said as teddy presented another plate with something hot in it  ay pancakes they is made of flour an wather fried in grease an the best of aitin as yell findbut musha theyve all stuck together from some raison i hant yet diskivered but theyll be none the worse for that and theres plenty of good thick molasses to wash em down wid  and this said jack pointing to a battered tin kettle is the the  thats the coffee sur  ah well sit down teddy i have seen worse fare than this  lets be thankful for it  now then let me hear about the fishery  nothing pleased teddy odonel so much as being allowed to talk  he sat down accordingly and entertained his master for the next hour with a full true and particular account of every thing connected with fort desolation  we will not however inflict this on the reader  reduced to its narrowest limits his information was to the following effect  that the indians generally were well disposed towards the traders though difficult to please  that a good many furs had been already obtained and there was a report of more coming in  that the salmon fishery was situated on a river twenty miles below the fort and was progressing favourably but that the five men engaged there were a quarrelsome set and difficult to keep in order  teddy thought however that it was all owing to one of the men named ladoc a bully who kept the other four in bad humour  but the point on which poor teddy dilated most was his solitude  for some time he had been living with no other companions than an old indian woman and her halfcaste daughter and they having left him during the last three days he had been living entirely alone among the ghosts many of which he described minutely  this intelligence was brought to an abrupt close by a row among the men in the kitchen  rollo had been boasting of his walking powers to such an extent that pierre had become disgusted and spoke contemptuously of rollo whereupon the bully as usual began to storm and his wrath culminated when pierre asserted that mr robinson would bring him to his marrowbones ere long  jack robinson exclaimed rollo with contempt id walk him blind in two hours  just at that moment the door opened and jack stood before them  you are too noisy men said he in a quiet voice jack almost always spoke in a soft voice remember that this kitchen is within hearing of the hall  rollo go down to the beach and haul up the sloops boat i see the tide is making on her  rollo hesitated  you hear said jack still in a quiet tone but with a looknot a fierce look or a threatening look buta peculiar look which instantly took effect  one has often observed a cat when about to spring  it makes many pauses in its prowling towards its prey and occasional motions that lead one to expect a spring  but the motion which precedes the actual spring is always emphatic  it may not be violent it may be as slight as all the previous motions but there is that in it which tells irresistibly somehow of a fixed purpose  so is it doubtless with tigers so was it with jack robinson  his first remark to the men was a prowl his order to rollo was a pause with an intention his you hear softly said had a something in it which induced rollo to accord instant obedience  on returning to the hall jack paced up and down indignantly  so there are two bullies in the camp he soliloquised i must cure them bothbut softly jack  it wont do to fight if you can secure peace by other means  let blows be the last resource  thats my motto hell walk me blind  well we shall see tomorrow    chapter four  taming a bully  the morrow came and jack robinson rose with the sun  long before his men were astir he had inspected the few books and papers of the establishment had examined the condition of the fur and goods store and had otherwise made himself acquainted with the details of the fort having gone over its general features with teddy the day before  when the lieutenant arose he found indications of his new master having been everywhere before him and noted the fact  as teddy was by no means a man of orderalthough a good and trustworthy manthere was enough to be done before breakfast  jack purposely put rollo into the kitchen to prepare the morning meal this being comparatively light work  he himself worked with the other men in the stores  there was necessarily a great deal of lifting and shifting and clearing in all of which operations he took the heaviest part of the work and did his work better and more thoroughly than any of the others  teddy observed this also and noted the fact  at breakfast there was naturally a good deal of talk among the men and special mention was of course made of the energy of their master  breakfast over jack assembled the men and apportioned to each his days work  i myself said he mean to walk down to the fishery today and i leave odonel in charge i shall be back tomorrow  rollo you will prepare to accompany me  yes sir answered the man not knowing very well how to take this the others glanced at each other intelligently as they departed to their work  a few minutes sufficed for preparation and soon jack stood with his rifle on his shoulder in front of the house  rollo quickly made his appearance with an old trading gun  you can leave that we wont require it said jack besides i want to walk fast so it is well that you should be as light as possible  no fear but ill keep up with you sir said the man somewhat piqued  i do not doubt it replied jack but one gun is enough for us so put yours by and come along  rollo obeyed and resolved in his heart that he would give his new master a taste of his powers  jack started off at a good rattling pace somewhat over four miles an hour  for the first mile rollo allowed him to lead keeping about a foot behind  then he thought to himself now my friend ill try you and ranged up beside him keeping a few yards to one side however in order to avoid the appearance of racing  after a few minutes he pushed the pace considerably and even went ahead of his companion but ere long jack was alongside and the pace increased to nearly five miles an hour  only those who have tried it know or can fully appreciate what is meant by adding a mile an hour to ones pace  most active men go at four miles an hour when walking at a good smart pace  men never walk at five miles an hour except when in the utmost haste and then only for a short distance  anything beyond that requires a run in order to be sustained  it was curious to watch the progress of these two men  the aim of each was to walk at his greatest possible speed without allowing the slightest evidence of unwonted exertion to appear on his countenance or in his manner  they walked on the sands of the shorethere being no roads thereand at first the walking was good as the tide was out and the sand hard but before they had got half way to the fishery the sea came in and drove them to the soft sand which as nearly every one knows is terribly fatiguing and difficult to walk in  up to this point the two men had kept abreast going at a tremendous pace yet conversing quietly and keeping down every appearance of distress affecting in fact to be going at their usual and natural pace  many a sidelong glance did rollo cast however at his companion to see if he were likely to give in soon  but jack was as cool as a cucumber and wore a remarkably amiable expression of countenance  he even hummed snatches of one or two songs as though he were only sauntering on the beach  at last he took out his pipe filled it and began to smoke without slackening speed  this filled rollo with surprise and for the first time he began to entertain doubts as to the result of the struggle  as for jack he never doubted it for a moment  when they were compelled to take to the heavy sand and sank above the ankles at every step he changed his tactics  putting out his pipe he fell behind a few paces  ha thought rollo done up at last now ill give it you  the thought that he was sure of victory infused such spirit into the man that he braced himself to renewed exertion  this was just what jack wanted  he kept exactly a foot behind rollo yet when the other ventured to slacken his pace which was now too great to be kept up he pushed forward just enough to keep him at it without disheartening him as to result  in the midst of this they both came to a full stop on discovering a box made of birch bark which seemed to have been dropped by some passing indians  hallo what have we here cried jack stooping down to examine it  my blessin ont whatever it is thought rollo to whom the momentary relief from walking was of the greatest consequence  jack knew this and hastened his inspection  it was a box of bears fat  come not a bad thing in times like these observed jack will you carry this or the rifle my man  see the rifle is lighter take that  again they stepped out and the sand seemed to grow softer and deeper as they advanced  they were now five miles from the end of their journey so jack began to exert himself  he pushed on at a pace that caused rollo to pant and blow audibly  for some time jack pretended not to notice this but at last he turned round and said  you seem to be fatigued my man let me carry the rifle  rollo did not object and jack went forward with the box and rifle more rapidly than before  he was perspiring indeed at every pore profusely but wind and limb were as sound as when he started  he finally left rollo out of sight and arrived at the fishery without him  half an hour afterwards rollo arrived  he was a stout fellow and by taking a short rest had recovered sufficiently to come in with some degree of spirit nevertheless it was evident to all that he was used up for it is not the distance but the pace that kills  he found the fishermen at dinner buttering their cakes with the bears grease that had been discovered on the way down  jack robinson was sitting in the midst of them chatting quietly and smoking his pipe beside the fireplace of the hut  jack introduced him as one of the new men but made no reference to the walk from fort desolation  he felt however that he had conquered the man at least for that time and hoped that further and more violent methods would not be necessary  in this he was disappointed as the sequel will show  that night jack slept on a bed made of old salmonnets with a new salmonnet above him for a blanket  it was a peculiar and not a particularly comfortable bed but in his circumstances he could have slept on a bed of thorns  he gazed up at the stars through the hole in the roof that served for a chimney and listened to the chirping of the frogs in a neighbouring swamp to which the snoring of the men around him formed a roughandready bass  thus he lay gazing and listening till stars and strains alike melted away and left him in the sweet regions of oblivion    chapter five  the salmon fishery  next morning jack robinson went out at daybreak to inspect the salmon fishery  the river up which the fish went in thousands was broad deep and rapid  its banks were clothed with sprucefir and dense underwood there was little of the picturesque or the beautiful in the scenery  it was a bleak spot and unattractive  two of the four men who conducted the fishery were stationed at the mouth of the river  the other two attended to the nets about six miles farther up at a place where there was a considerable fall terminating in a long turbulent rapid  with his wonted promptitude and energy jack began to make himself master of his position long before the men were stirring  before ladoc who was superintendent had lighted his first pipe and strolled down to the boat to commence the operations of the day jack had examined the nets the salt boxes the curingvats the fish in pickle the casks and all the other materiel of the fishery with a critical eye  from what he saw he was convinced that ladoc was not the best manager that could be desired and remembering that ladoc was a bully he was strengthened in an opinion which he had long entertained namely that a bully is never a trustworthy man  he was in the act of forming this opinion when ladoc approached  good morning ladoc said he you rise early  oui sair mais you gits up more earlier  yes i am fond of morning air  the fishery prospers i see  it doos monsieur said ladoc accepting the remark as a compliment to himself ve have catch fifteen casks already and they is in most splendid condition  hum ejaculated jack with a doubtful look at a cask which was evidently leaking hum yes you are getting on pretty well but  here jack hummed again and looked pointedly at one of the large vats which was also leaking and around which there was a great deal of salt that had been scattered carelessly on the ground  raising big eyes to the roof of the low shed in which the saltboxes stood he touched with his stick a torn piece of its tarpaulin covering through which rain had found its way in bad weather  he hummed again but said nothing for he saw that ladoc was a little disconcerted  after some minutes jack turned to his companion with a bland smile and said  the next station ishow many miles did you say  six monsieur  ah six well let us go up and see it  you can show me the way  breakfast be ready ver soon said ladoc monsieur vill eat first praps  no we will breakfast at the upper station  ho rollo here i want you  rollo who issued from the hut at the moment with a view to examine the weather and light his pipe came forward  i am going with ladoc to the upper station said jack you will take his place here until we return  very well sir replied rollo fixing his eyes upon ladoc  at the same moment ladoc fixed his eyes on rollo  the two men seemed to read each others character in a single glance and then and there hurled silent defiance in each others teeth through their eyes  ladoc was annoyed at having been silently found fault with and superseded rollo was aggrieved at being left behind both men were therefore enragedfor it is wonderful how small a matter is sufficient to enrage a bullybut jack ordered ladoc to lead the way so the rivals or enemies parted company with another glance of defiance  that day jack robinson had a somewhat rough and remarkable experience of life  he began by overhauling the nets at the mouth of the river and these were so prolific that the small flatbottomed boat used by the fishermen was soon half filled with glittering salmon varying from ten to fifteen pounds in weight  in order to avoid having his mocassins and nether garments soiled jack who pulled the sculls sat with bare feet and tuckedup trousers  in less than an hour he rowed back to the landingplace literally up to the knees in salmon  among these were a few young seals that had got entangled in the nets while in pursuit of the fish and been drowned  these last were filled with water to such an extent that they resembled inflated bladders  breakfast is ready sir said one of the men as the boatparty leaped ashore  very good replied jack turning to ladoc now my man are you ready to start for the upper fishery  eh ahoui monsieur  there was a titter amongst the men at the expression of their big comrades face for ladoc was ravenously hungry and felt inclined to rebel at the idea of being obliged to start on a sixmiles walk without food but as his young master was about to do the same he felt that it was beneath his dignity to complain  besides there was a something peculiar about jacks manner that puzzled and overawed the man  the fact was that jack robinson wanted to know what his bullies were made of and took rather eccentric methods of finding it out  he accordingly set off at his best pace and pushed ladoc so hard that he arrived at the upper fishery in a state of profuse perspiration with a very red face and with a disagreeably vacuous feeling about the pit of his stomach  they found the men at the station just landing with a boatload of fish they were all cleanrun and shone in the bright sunshine like bars of burnished silver  now ladoc said jack get breakfast ready while i look over matters here  it need not be said that the man obeyed most willingly  his master went to examine into details  halfanhour sufficed to make him pretty well acquainted with the state of matters at the station and during breakfast he soon obtained from the men all the knowledge they possessed about the fishery the natives and the region  one of the men was a halfcaste a finelooking grave earnest fellow who spoke english pretty well  his name was marteau  the seals and the bears are our worst enemies sir said marteau in the course of conversation  indeed and which of the two are worst inquired jack  another slice of pork ladoc your appetite appears to be sharp this morning thank you go on marteau you were saying something about the bears and seals  its not easy to say which of them is worst sir  i think the bears is for the seals eat the bits that they bite out o the fish and so get some good of it but the bears they goes to the vats and pulls out the salt fish with their claws for you see sir they cant resist the smell but when they tries to eat emah you should see the faces they do make  you see they cant stand the salt so they dont eat much but they hauls about and tears up an uncommon lot of fish  it must make him ver tirsty observed ladoc swallowing a can of tea at a draught  it makes one thirsty to think of it said jack imitating ladocs example now lads well go and overhaul the nets  just as he spoke ladoc sprang from his seat seized jacks gun which leant against the wall shouted a bear and levelling the piece through the open doorway took aim at the bushes in front of the hut  at the same moment jack leaped forward struck up the muzzle of the gun just as it exploded and seizing ladoc by the collar hurled him with extraordinary violence considering his size against the wall  make yourself a better hunter said he sternly before you presume to lay hands again on my gun  look there  jack pointed as he spoke in the direction in which the man had fired where the object that had been mistaken for a bear appeared in the form of a man crawling out of the bushes on allfours  he seemed to move unsteadily as if he were in pain  running to his assistance they found that he was an indian and from the blood that bespattered his dress and hand it was evident that he had been wounded  he was a pitiable object in the last stage of exhaustion  when the party ran towards him he looked up in their faces with lustreless eyes and then sank fainting on the ground  poor fellow said jack as they carried him into the hut and placed him on one of the low beds he must have met with an accident for there is no warfare in this region among the indians to account for his being wounded  tis a strange accident said marteau when the mans clothes were stripped off and the wounds exposed  an accident sometimes puts one bullet through a man but seldom puts two  true said jack this looks bad here is a hole clean through the fleshy part of his right arm and another through his right thigh  an enemy must have done this  on farther examination it was found that the bone of the mans leg had been smashed by the bullet which after passing through to the other side of the limb was arrested by the skin  it was easily extracted and the wounds were dressed by jack who to his many useful qualities added a considerable knowledge of medicine and surgery  when the indian recovered sufficiently to give an account of himself to marteau who understood his language perfectly he told him to the surprise of all that his double wound was indeed the result of an accident and moreover that he had done the deed with his own hand doubtless it will puzzle the reader to imagine how a man could so twist himself that with an unusually long gun he could send a bullet at one shot through his right arm and right thigh  it puzzled jack and his men so much that they were half inclined to think the indian was not telling the truth until he explained that about a mile above the hut while walking through the bushes he tripped and fell  he was carrying the gun over his shoulder in the customary indian fashion that is by the muzzle with the stock behind him  he fell on his hands and knees the gun was thrown forward and struck against a tree so violently that it exploded in its flight it had turned completely round so that at the moment of discharge the barrel was in a line with the mans arm and leg and thus the extraordinary wound was inflicted  to crawl from the spot where the accident occurred took the poor fellow nearly twelve hours and he performed this trying journey during the night and morning over a rugged country and without food  the surgical operation engaged jacks attention the greater part of the forenoon  when it was completed and the indian made as comfortable as possible he went out with the men to visit the nets which were set at the rapids about two miles higher up the river    chapter six  jack has a desperate encounter  we never can tell what a day or an hour may bring forth  this is a solemn fact on which young and old might frequently ponder with advantage and on which we might enlarge to an unlimited extent but our space will not admit of moralising very much therefore we beg the reader to moralise on that for himor herself  the subject is none the less important that circumstances require that it should be touched on in a slight almost flippant manner  had jack robinson known what lay before him that evening he wouldhe would have been a wiser man  nothing more appropriate than that occurs to us at this moment  but to be more particular  when the party reached the nets jack left them to attend to their work and went off alone to the vats some of which measuring about six feet in diameter were nearly full of fish in pickle  as he walked along the slight track which guided him towards them he pondered the circumstances in which he then found himself and indulging in a habit which he had acquired in his frequent and prolonged periods of solitude began to mutter his thoughts aloud  so so jack you left your farm because you were tired of solitude and now you find yourself in the midst of society  pleasant society trulybullies and geese without a sympathetic mind to rub against humph a pleasant fix youve got into old fellow  jack was wrong in this to some extent as he afterwards came to confess to himself for among his men there were two or three minds worth cultivating noble and shrewd and deep too though not educated or refined  but at the time of which we write jack did not know this  he went on to soliloquise  yes youve got a pretty set to deal with elements that will cause you enough of trouble before you have done with them  well well dont give in old chap  never say die  if solitude is to be your lot meet it like a man  why they say that solitude of the worst kind is to be found where most people dwell  has it not been said that in the great city of london itself a man may be more solitary than in the heart of the wilderness  ive read it but i cant very well believe it  yet there may be something in it  humph  well well jack youre not a philosopher so dont try to go too deep take it easy and do the best you can  at this point jack came suddenly in sight of the vats  they stood in the centre of a cleared space in the forest  on the edge of the largest vat was perched an object which induced our hero to throw forward his fowlingpiece hastily  it was a black bear or rather the hindquarters of a black bear for the head and one paw and shoulder of the animal were far down in the vat  he was holding firmly to its edge by the hind legs and one foreleg while with the other he was straining his utmost to reach the fish  jacks first impulse was to fire but reflecting that the portion of the bear then in view was not a very vulnerable part he hesitated and finally crept behind a tree to consider feeling confident that whatever should occur he would be pretty sure of getting a favourable opportunity to fire with effect  quite unconscious of his danger bruin continued to reach down into the vat with unwearied determination  his efforts were rewarded with success for he presently appeared on the edge of the vat with a fine salmon in his embrace  now was jacks opportunity  he raised his piece but remembering marteaus remark about the bears difficulty in eating salt salmon he postponed the fatal shot until he should have studied this point in natural history  his forbearance met with a reward for the bear kept him during the next five minutes in such a state of suppressed laughter that he could not have taken a steady aim to have saved his life  its sense of smell was evidently gratified for on leaping to the ground it took a powerful snuff and then began to devour the salmon with immense gusto  but the first mouthful produced an expression of countenance that could not be misunderstood  it coughed spluttered and sneezed or at least gave vent to something resembling these sounds and drew back from the fish with a snarl then it snuffed again  there was no mistaking the smell it was delicious  bruin disbelieving his sense of taste and displaying unwise faith in his sense of smell made another attempt  he had tried the head first with some show of reason he now tried the tail  faugh it was worse than the other as salt as fire as we have heard it sometimes expressed  the spluttering at this point became excessive and it was clear that the bear was getting angry  once again with an amount of perseverance that deserved better fortune the bear snuffed heartily at the fish tore it to shreds with his claws and then tried another mouthful which it spat out instantly  displaying all its teeth and gums it shut its eyes and raising its head in the air fairly howled with disappointment  jack now deemed it prudent to bring the scene to a close so calming himself as well as he could he took a steady aim and watching his opportunity fired  the bear did not fall  it faced round in a moment and uttering a fierce growl very unlike to its previous tones rushed upon its enemy who fired his second barrel at the creatures breast  whether it was that jacks fit of laughter had shaken his nerves so as to render him incapable of taking a good aim is a matter of uncertainty but although both shots took effect the bear was not checked in his career  on it came  jack had no time to load  he turned to run when his quick eye observed a branch of a tree over his head within reach  dropping his gun he bounded upwards and caught it and being unusually powerful in the arms drew himself up and got astride of it just as the bear reached the spot  but bruin was not to be baulked so easily  he was a black bear and a good climber  finding that he could not at his utmost stretch obtain a nibble at jacks toes he rushed at the trunk of the tree and began to ascend rapidly  jack at once moved towards the end of the branch intending to drop to the ground recover his gun and run for it but the movement broke the branch off suddenly and he came down with such a crash that the bear stopped looked round and seeing his enemy on the ground began to descend  although somewhat stunned by the fall our hero was able to spring up and run in the direction of the hut  the bear was so close on his heels however that he had no chance of his reaching it  he felt this and as a last resource doubled on his track like a hare and made for the banks of the river which were twenty feet high at the place intending to leap into the rapid and take his chance  in this too he was foiled  his fall from the tree had partially disabled him and he could not run with his wonted agility  about ten yards from the edge of the bank the bear overtook him and it seemed as if poor jack robinsons troubles were at last about to be brought to an abrupt close  but jack was selfpossessed and brave as steel  on feeling the bears claws in his back he drew his knife wheeled round fell into its embrace and plunged the knife three or four times in its side  the thing was done in a moment and the two falling together rolled over the edge of the steep bank and went crashing down through the bushes amid a cloud of dust and stones into the raging flood below at the foot of the rapid marteau and one of the men happened to be rowing ashore with a load of fish  hallo whats that cried marteau  eh exclaimed his comrade  a bear shouted marteau backing his oar  and a man  what  i say  pull pull  next moment the boat was dancing on the foam and marteau had hold of the bears neck with one hand and jacks hair with the other  they were soon hauled to land the bear in its dying agonies and jack in a state of insensibility but it took the united strength of the two men to tear him from the tremendous grasp that he had fastened on the brute and his knife was found buried to the handle close alongside of bruins heart    chapter seven  solitude  on the day of his encounter with the bear jack robinson sent rollo up to the fort to fetch down all the men except odonel in order that the fishery might be carried on with vigour  of course it is unnecessary to inform the reader that jack speedily recovered from the effects of his adventure  it would be absurd to suppose that anything of an ordinary nature could kill or even do much damage to our hero  beyond five deep punctures on his back and five on his breast besides a bite in the shoulder jack had received no damage and was able to return on foot to fort desolation a few days after the event  on arriving he found his man teddy odonel sitting over the kitchen fire in the last stage of an attack of deep depression and home sickness  jacks sudden appearance wrought an instantaneous cure  ah said he grasping his masters hand and wringing it warmly its a blessed sight for sore eyes  sure ive bin all but dead sur since ye wint away  youve not been ill have you said jack looking somewhat earnestly in the mans face  ill  no not i the body if thats what ye mane but ive been awful bad i the mind  its the intellect as kills men more nor the body the sowl is what does it all  here teddy passed his hand across his forehead and looked haggard ah  mr robinson its myself asll niver do to live alone  i do belave that all the ghosts as iver lived have come and took up there abode in this kitchen  nonsense said jack sitting down on a stool beside the fire and filling his pipe youre too superstitious  supperstitious is it exclaimed the man with a look of intense gravity  faix if ye seed them yed change yer tune  its the noses of em as is wust  of all the noses for length and redness and for blowin like trumpets i ever did seewell well its no use conjicturin but i do wonder sometimes what guv the ghosts sitch noses  i suppose they knows that best themselves observed jack  praps they does replied teddy with a meditative gaze at the fire  but i rather suspect continued jack that as your own nose is somewhat long and red and as youve got a habit of squinting not to mention snoring teddy we may be justified in accounting for the  ah its no use jokin interrupted odonel yell niver joke me out o my belaif in ghosts  its no longer agone than last night after tay i laid me down on the floor beside the fire in sitch a state o moloncholly weakness that i really tried to die  its true for ye and i belave id have done it too av i hadnt wint off to slape by mistake an whin i awoke i was so cowld and hungry that i thought id pusspone dyin till after supper  i got better after supper but och its a hard thing to live all be yer lone like this  have no indians been here since i left  not wan sur  well teddy i will keep you company now  we shall be alone here together for a few weeks as i mean to leave all our lads at the fishery  meanwhile bestir yourself and let me have supper  during the next few weeks jack robinson was very busy  being an extremely active man he soon did every conceivable thing that had to be done about the fort and conceived as well as did a good many things that did not require to be done  while rummaging in the stores he discovered a handnet with which he waded into the sea and caught large quantities of small fish about four inches in length resembling herrings  these he salted and dried in the sun and thus improved his farefor having only salt pork and fresh salmon he felt the need of a little variety  indeed he had already begun to get tired of salmon insomuch that he greatly preferred salt pork  after that he scraped together a sufficient number of old planks and built therewith a flatbottomed boata vessel much wanted at the place but do what he would time hung very heavy on his hands even although he made as much of a companion of teddy odonel as was consistent with his dignity  the season for wild fowl had not arrived and he soon got tired of going out with his gun with the certainty of returning emptyhanded  at last there was a brief break in the monotony of the daily life at fort desolation  a band of indians came with a good supply of furs they were not a very high type of human beings had little to say and did not seem disposed to say it  but they wanted goods from jack and jack wanted furs from them so their presence during the two days and nights they stayed shed a glow of moral sunshine over the fort that made its inhabitants as lighthearted and joyful as though some unwonted piece of good fortune had befallen them  when the indians went away however the gloom was proportionally deeper jack and his man sounded lower depths of despair than they had ever before fathomed and the latter began to make frequent allusions to the possibility of making away with himself  indeed he did one evening while he and jack stood silently on the shore together propose that they should go into the bush behind the fort cover themselves over with leaves and perish at wance like the babes in the wood  things were in this gloomy condition when an event occurred which although not of great importance in itself made such a deep impression on the dwellers at fort desolation that it is worthy of a chapter to itself    chapter eight  horrors  one morning the sun rose with unwonted splendour on the broad bosom of the saint lawrence  the gulf was like a mirror in which the images of the seagulls were as perfect as the birds themselves and the warm hazy atmosphere was lighted up so brightly by the sun that it seemed as though the world were enveloped in delicate golden gauze  jack robinson stood on the shore with the exile of erin beside him strange to say the effect of this lovely scene on both was the reverse of gladdening  its very sad said jack slowly  true for ye observed the sympathising teddy supposing that his master had finished his remark  its very sad repeated jack to look abroad upon this lovely world and know that thousands of our fellowmen are enjoying it in each others society while we are selfexiled here  an so it is said teddy not to mintion our fellowwomen an our fellowchilders to boot  to be sure we have got each others society odonel continued jack and the society of the gulls  an the fush interposed teddy  and the fish assented jack for all of which blessings we have cause to be thankful but its my opinion that you and i are a couple of egregious asses for having forsaken our kind and come to vegetate here in the wilderness  thats just how it is sur  were both on us big asses an its a pint for investigation which on us is the biggestyou who ought to have knowd better or me as niver knowd anything amost to spake of  jack smiled  he was much too deeply depressed to laugh  for some minutes they stood gazing in silent despondency at the sea  whats that exclaimed jack with sudden animation pointing to an object which appeared at the moment near the extremity of a point of rocks not far from the spot where they stooda canoe  two of em cried odonel as another object came into view  the change which came over the countenances of the two men as they stood watching the approach of the two canoes would have been incomprehensible to any one not acquainted with the effect of solitude on the human mind  they did not exactly caper on the beach but they felt inclined to do so and their heaving bosoms and sparkling eyes told of the depth of emotion within  in about a quarter of an hour the canoes were within a short distance of the landingplace but no shout or sign of recognition came from the indians who paddled them  there was an indian in the bow and stern of each canoe and a woman in the middle of one of them  well boys what cheer said jack using a wellknown backwoods salutation as the men landed  the indians silently took the proffered hand of the trader and shook it replying in a low voice wachee as the nearest point they could attain to the pronunciation of what cheer  there was something so unusually solemn in the air and manner of the savages that jack glanced at the canoe in which the woman sat  there he saw what explained the mystery  in the bottom lay an object wrapped up in pieces of old cloth and birchbark which from its form was evidently a human body  a few words with the indians soon drew from them the information that this was one of their wives who had been ailing for a long time and at length had died  they were roman catholic converts and had come to bury the body in the graveyard of the fort which had been consecrated by a priest  to whatever pitch of excitement jack and his man had risen at the unexpected appearance of the indians their spirits fell to an immeasurably profounder depth than before when their errand was made known  everything connected with this burial was sad and repulsive yet jack and his man felt constrained out of mere sympathy to witness it all  the indians were shabby and squalid in the extreme and being destitute of the means of making a coffin had rolled the corpse up in such wretched materials as they happened to possess  one consequence of this was that it was quite supple  on being lifted out of the canoe the joints bent and a sort of noise was emitted from the mouth which was exceedingly horrible  had the dead face been visible the effect would not have been so powerful but its being covered tended to set the imagination free to conceive things still more dreadful  the grave was soon dug in the sand inside the graveyard which was not more than a hundred yards on one side of the fort  here without ceremony of any kind the poor form was laid and covered over  while being lowered into the grave the same doublingup of the frame and the same noise were observed  after all was over the indians returned to their canoe and paddled away silently as they had come not before jack however had gone to the store for a large piece of tobacco which he threw to them as they were pushing off  during the remainder of that day jack robinson and his man went about their vocations with hearts heavy as lead  but it was not till night that this depression of spirits culminated  for the first time in his life jack robinson became superstitiously nervous  as for teddy odonel he had seldom been entirely free from this condition during any night of his existence but he was much worse than usual on the present occasion  after sunset jack had his tea alone in the hall while odonel took hisalso of course alonein the kitchen  tea over jack sat down and wrote part of a journal which he was in the habit of posting up irregularly  then he went into the kitchen to give teddy his orders for the following day and stayed longer than usual  thereafter he read parts of one or two books which he had brought with him from the civilised world  but do what he would the image of the dead woman lying so near him invariably came between him and the page and obtruded itself on his mind obstinately  once he was so exasperated while reading that he jumped violently off his chair exclaiming this is childish nonsense  in doing so he tilted the chair over so that it balanced for an instant on its hind legs and then fell with an awful crash which caused him to leap at least three feet forward clench his fists and wheel round with a look of fury that would certainly have put to flight any real ghost in creation  jack gasped then he sighed after which he smiled and began to pace the hall slowly  at last he said half aloud i think ill smoke my pipe tonight with that poor fellow odonel  he must be lonely enough and i dont often condescend to be social  taking up his pipe and tobaccopouch he went towards the kitchen  now while his master was enduring those uncomfortable feelings in the hall teddy was undergoing torments in the kitchen that are past description  he had had a grandmotherwith no nose to speak of a mouth large enough for two four teeth and one eyewho had stuffed him in his youth with horrible stories as full as a doll is of sawdust that old ladys influence was now strong upon him  every gust of wind that rumbled in the chimney sent a qualm to his heart  every creak in the beams of his wooden kitchen startled his soul  every accidental noise that occurred filled him with unutterable horror  the door being clumsily made fitted badly in all its parts so that it shook and rattled in a perfectly heartrending manner  teddy resolved to cure this  he stuck bits of wood in the opening between it and the floor besides jamming several nails in at the sides and top  still the latch would rattle being complicated in construction and not easily checked in all its parts  but teddy was an ingenious fellow  he settled the latch by stuffing it and covering it with a mass of dough  in order further to secure things he placed a small table against the door and then sat down on a bench to smoke his pipe beside the door  it was at this point in the evening that jack resolved as we have said to be condescending  as he had hitherto very seldom smoked his pipe in the kitchen his footstep in the passage caused odonels very marrow to quake  he turned as pale as death and became rigid with terror so that he resembled nothing but an irish statue of very dirty and discoloured marble  when jack put his hand on the latch teddy gasped oncehe was incapable of more  the vision of the poor indian woman rose before his mental eye and hewell its of no use to attempt saying what he thought or felt  the obstruction in the latch puzzled jack not a little  he was surprised at its stiffness  the passage between the hall and kitchen was rather dark so that he was somewhat nervous and impatient to open the door  it happened that he had left the door by which he had quitted the hall partially open  a gust of wind shut this with a bang that sent every drop of blood into his heart whence it rebounded into his extremities  the impulse thus communicated to his hand was irresistible  the door was burst in as a matter of course the table was hurled into the middle of the kitchen where it was violently arrested by the stove  poor teddy odonel unable to stand it any longer toppled backwards over the bench with a hideous yell and fell headlong into a mass of pans kettles and firewood where he lay sprawling and roaring at the full power of his lungs and keeping up an irregular discharge of such things as came to hand at the supposed ghost who sheltered himself as he best might behind the stove  hold hard you frightened ass shouted jack as a billet of wood whizzed over his head  eh what  its you sur  o musha av i didnt belave it was the ghost at last  i tell you what my man said jack who was a good deal nettled at his reception i would advise you to make sure that it is a ghost next time before you shie pots and kettles about in that way  see what a smash you have made  why what on earth have you been doing to the door  sure i only stuffed up the kayhole to keep out the wind  humph and the ghosts i suppose  well see that you are up betimes tomorrow and have these salmon nets looked over and repaired  so saying jack turned on his heel and left the room feeling too much annoyed to carry out his original intention of smoking a pipe with his man  he spent the evening therefore in reading a pocket copy of shakespeare and retired to rest at the usual hour in a more composed frame of mind and rather inclined to laugh at his superstitious fears  it happened unfortunately that from his window as he lay on his bed jack could see the graveyard  this fact had never been noticed by him before although he had lain there nightly since his arrival and looked over the yard to the beach and the sea beyond  now the night being bright moonlight he could see it with appalling distinctness  sleep was banished from his eyes and although he frequently turned with resolution to the wall and shut them he was invariably brought back to his old position as if by a species of fascination  meanwhile teddy odonel lay absolutely quaking in the kitchen  unable to endure it he at last rose opened the door softly and creeping up as near us he dared venture to his masters door sat down there as he said for company  in course of time he fell asleep  jack being more imaginative remained awake  presently he saw a figure moving near the churchyard  it was whiteat least the upper half of it was  pshaw this is positive folly my digestion must be out of order muttered jack rubbing his eyes but the rubbing did not dissipate the figure which moved past the yard and approached the fort  at that moment teddy odonel gave vent to a prolonged snore  delivered as it was against the wooden step on which his nose was flattened it sounded dreadfully like a groan  almost mad with indignation and alarm jack robinson leaped from his bed and pulled on his trousers resolved to bring things to an issue of some sort  he threw open his chamber door with violence and descended the staircase noisily intending to arouse his man  he did arouse him effectually by placing his foot on the back of his head and crushing his face against the steps with such force as to produce a roar that would have put to shame the warwhoop of the wildest savage in america  in endeavouring to recover himself jack fell upon teddy and they rolled headoverheels down the steps together towards the door of the house which was opened at that instant by ladoc who had walked up to the fort clad only in his shirt and trousers the night being warm to give a report of the condition of things at the fishery where he and rollo had quarrelled and the men generally were in a state of mutiny    chapter nine  the bully receives a lesson  we regret to be compelled to chronicle the fact that jack robinson lost command of his temper on the occasion referred to in the last chapter he and teddy odonel rolled to the very feet of the amazed ladoc before the force of their fall was expended  they sprang up instantly and jack dealt the irishman an openhanded box on the ear that sent him staggering against one of the pillars of the verandah and resounded in the still night air like a pistolshot  poor teddy would have fired up under other circumstances but he felt so deeply ashamed of having caused the undignified mishap to his master that he pocketed the affront and quietly retired towards his kitchen  on his way thither however he was arrested by the tremendous tone in which jack demanded of ladoc the reason of his appearance at such an untimely hour  there was a slight dash of insolence in the mans reply  i come up monsieur said he to tell you if there be two masters at fishery i not be one of em  rollo tink he do vat him please mais i say no so ve quarrel  and so you take upon you to desert your post thundered jack  vraiment oui coolly replied ladoc  jack clenched his fist and sprang at the man as a bullterrier might leap on a mastiff  almost in the act of striking he changed his mind and instead of delivering one of those scientific blows with which he had on more than one occasion in his past history terminated a fight at its very commencement he seized ladoc by the throat tripped up his heels and hurled him to the ground with such force that he lay quite still for at least half a minute  leaving him there to the care of odonel who had returned jack went up to his bedroom shut the door thrust his hands into his pockets and began to pace the floor rapidly and to shake his head  gradually his pace became slower and the shaking of his head more sedate  presently he soliloquised in an undertone  this wont do john robinson  youve let off too much steam  quite against your principles to be so violentshame on you man  yet after all it was very provoking to be made such a fool of before that insolent fellow  poor teddyi wish i hadnt hit you such a slap  but after all you deserved it you superstitious blockhead  well well its of no use regretting  glad i didnt hit ladoc though its too soon for that  humph the time has come for action however  things are drawing to a point  they shall culminate tomorrow  let me see  here jacks tones became inaudible and he began to complete his toilette  his thoughts were busyto judge from his knitted brows and compressed lips  the decision of his motions at last showed that he had made up his mind to a course of action  it was with a cleared brow and a selfpossessed expression of countenance that he descended a few minutes later to the hall and summoned odonel  that worthy on making his appearance looked confused and began to stammer out  i beg parding sur butbut raally you knowit it was all owin to them abominable ghosts  jack smiled or rather tried to smile but owing to conflicting emotions the attempt resulted in a grin  let bygones be bygones he said and send ladoc here  ladoc entered with a defiant expression which was evidently somewhat forced  jack was seated at a table turning over some papers  without raising his head he said  be prepared to start for the fishery with me in halfanhour ladoc  monsieur exclaimed the man with a look of surprise  jack raised his head and looked at him  it was one of his peculiar looks  did you not understand me he said jumping up suddenly  ladoc vanished with an abrupt oui monsieur and jack proceeded with a real smile on his goodhumoured face to equip himself for the road  in half an hour the two were walking silently side by side at a smart pace towards the fishery while poor teddy odonel was left as he afterwards said all be his lone wid the ghost and the newly buried ooman in a state of mental agony which may perhaps be conceived by those who possess strong imaginations but which cannot by any possibility be adequately described    chapter ten  strangers and strange events  the monotony of the night march to the fishery was enlivened by the unexpected apparition of a boat  there was just enough of moonlight to render it dimly visible a few hundred yards from the shore  indians exclaimed ladoc breaking silence for the first time since they set out  the stroke is too steady and regular for indians said jack  boat ahoy  shore ahoy came back at once in the ringing tones of a seamans voice  pull in theres plenty of water shouted jack  ay ay was the response  in a few seconds the boats keel grated on the sand and an active sailor jumped ashore  there were five other men in the boat  where have you dropped from enquired jack  well the last place we dropped from answered the seaman was the port quarter davits of the good ship ontario captain jones from liverpool to quebec with a general cargo that was last night and ten minutes afterwards the ontario dropped to the bottom of the sea  wrecked exclaimed jack  just so  leastwise sprung a leak and gone to the bottom  no hands lost i hope  no all saved in the boats but we parted company in the night and havent seen each other since  is there any port hereabouts where we could get a bit o summat to eat  there is friend  just pull six miles farther along shore as you are going and youll come to the place that i have the honour and happiness to commandwe call it fort desolation  you and your party are heartily welcome to food and shelter there and youll find an irishman in charge who will be overjoyed i doubt not to act the part of host  tomorrow night i shall return to the fort  the shipwrecked mariners who were halfstarved received this news with a cheer and pushing off resumed their oars with fresh vigour while jack and his man continued their journey  they reached the fishery before dawn and without awakening the men retired at once to rest  before breakfast jack was up and went out to inspect the place  he found that his orders about repairing the roof of the outhouse and the clearing up had not been attended to  he said nothing at first but from the quiet settled expression of his face the men felt convinced that he did not mean to let it pass  he ordered ladoc to repair the roof forthwith and bade rollo commence a general clearingup  he also set the other men to various occupations and gave each to understand that when his job was finished he might return to breakfast  the result of this was that breakfast that morning was delayed till between eleven and twelve the fishery speedily assumed quite a new aspect and that the men ate a good deal more than usual when they were permitted to break their fast  after breakfast while they were seated outside the door of their hut smoking jack smoked his pipe alone by the margin of the river about fifty yards off  monsieur be meditating of something this morning observed little francois xavier glancing at rollo with a twinkle in his sharp grey eye  he may meditate on what he likes for all that i care said rollo with a scornful laugh  hell find it difficult to cow me as ill let him know before long  ladoc coughed and an unmistakable sneer curled his lip as he relighted his pipe  the flushed face of rollo showed what he felt but as nothing had been said he could not with propriety give vent to his passion  at that moment jack robinson hailed ladoc who rose and went towards him  jack said a few words to him which of course owing to the distance could not be heard by the men  immediately after ladoc was seen to walk away in the direction of an old indian buryingground which lay in the woods about a quarter of a mile from the fishery  five minutes later jack hailed rollo who obeyed the summons and after a few words with his master went off in the same direction as ladoc there seemed something mysterious in these movements  the mystery was deepened when jack hailed francois xavier and sent him after the other two and it culminated when jack himself after allowing five minutes more to elapse sauntered away in the same direction with a stout cudgel under his arm  he was soon lost to view in the woods  each of the three men had been told to go to the buryingground and to wait there until jack himself should arrive  ladoc was surprised on receiving the order but as we have seen obeyed it  he was more than surprised however when he saw rollo walk into the enclosure and still more astonished when francois followed in due course  none of the three spoke  they felt that jack would not keep them long in suspense and they were right  he soon appearedsmoking calmly  now lads said he come here  stand aside francois  i have brought you to this place to witness our proceedings and to carry back a true report to your comrades  ladoc and rollo here jacks face became suddenly very stern there was something intense though not loud in his voice you have kept my men in constant hot water by your quarrelling since you came together  i mean to put an end to this  you dont seem to be quite sure which of you is the best man  you shall settle that question this day on this spot and within this hour  so set to you rascals  fight or shake hands  i will see fair play  jack blazed up at this point and stepped up to the men with such a fierce expression that they were utterly cowed  fight i say or shake hands or here jack paused and his teeth were heard to grate harshly together  the two bullies stood abashed  they evidently did not feel inclined to come to the scratch  yet they saw by the peculiar way in which their master grasped his cudgel that it would be worse for both of them if they did not obey  well said ladoc turning with a somewhat candid smile to rollo is willin to shake hands if you be  he held out his hand to rollo who took it in a shamefaced sort of way and then dropped it  good said jack now you may go back to the hut but walk arm in arm  let your comrades see that you are friends  come no hesitation  the tone of command could not be resisted the two men walked down to the river arm in arm as if they had been the best of friends and little francois followedchuckling  next day a man arrived on foot with a letter to the gentlemen in charge of fort desolation  he and another man had conveyed it to the fort in a canoe from fort kamenistaquoia  what have we here said jack robinson sitting down on the gunwale of a boat and breaking the seal  the letter ran as follows    fort kamenistaquoia etcetera etcetera    my dear jack    i am sorry to tell you that the business has all gone to sticks and   stivers  we have not got enough of capital to compete with the   hudsons bay company and i may remark privately that if we had it   would not be worth while to oppose them on this desolate coast  the   trade therefore is to be given up and the posts abandoned  i have   sent a clerk to succeed you and wind up the business at fort   desolation as i want you to come here directly to consult as to   future plans    your loving but unfortunate friend    j murray  on reading this epistle jack heaved a deep sigh  adrift again he muttered  at that moment his attention was arrested by the sound of voices in dispute  presently the door of the mens house was flung open and rollo appeared with a large bundle on his shoulders  the bundle contained his little all  he was gesticulating passionately to his comrades  whats wrong now said jack to francois as the latter came towards him  rollo he go way said francois  there be an indian come in hims canoe and rollo make up his mind to go off vid him  oh has he said jack springing up and walking rapidly towards the hut  now it must be told here that a few days before the events we are describing jack had given rollo a new suit of clothes from the companys store with a view to gain his regard by kindness and attach him to the service if possible  rollo was clad in this suit at the time and he evidently meant to carry it off  jack crushed back his anger as he came up and said in a calm deliberate voice what now rollo  im going off said the man fiercely  ive had enough of you  there was something supernaturally calm and bland in jacks manner as he smiled and said  indeed  im very glad to hear it  do you go soon  ay at once  good  you had better change your dress before going  eh exclaimed the man  your clothes belong to the company put them off said jack strip you blackguard he shouted suddenly bringing his stick within three inches of rollos nose strip or ill break every bone in your carcase  the man hesitated but a nervous motion in jacks arm caused him to take off his coat somewhat promptly  ill go into the house said rollo humbly  no said jack sternly strip where you are  quick  rollo continued to divest himself of his garments until there was nothing left to remove  here francois said jack take these things away  now sir you may go  rollo took up his bundle and went into the hut thoroughly crestfallen to reclothe himself in his old garments while jack strolled into the woods to meditate on his strange fortunes  that was the end of rollo  he embarked in a canoe with an indian and went offno one knew whither  so the wicked and useless among men wander about this world to annoy their fellows for a timeto pass away and be forgotten  perhaps some of them through gods mercy return to their right minds  we cannot tell  according to instructions jack made over the charge of his establishment that day to the clerk who had been sent down to take charge and next morning set out for fort kamenistaquoia in the boat with the shipwrecked seamen  misfortune attended him even to the last minute  the new clerk who chanced to be an enthusiastic young man had resolved to celebrate his own advent and his predecessors departure by firing a salute from an old carronade which stood in front of the fort and which might possibly have figured at the battle of the nile  he overcharged this gun and just as the boat pushed off applied the match  the result was tremendous  the gun burst into a thousand pieces and the clerk was laid flat on the sand  of course the boat was run ashore immediately and jack sprang out and hastened to the scene of the disaster which he reached just as the clerk recovering from the effects of the shock managed to sit up  he presented a wonderful appearance  fortunately none of the flying pieces of the gun had touched him but a flat tin dish full of powder from which he had primed the piece had exploded in his face  this was now of a uniform bluishblack colour without eyelashes or eyebrows and surmounted by a mass of frizzled material that had once been the unfortunate youths hair  beyond this he had received no damage so jack remained just long enough to dress his hurts and make sure that he was still fit for duty  once more entering the boat jack pushed off  goodbye boys said he as the sailors pulled away  farewell teddy mind you find me out when you go up to quebec  bad luck to me av i dont cried the irishman whose eyes became watery in spite of himself  and dont let the ghosts get the better of you shouted jack  odonel shook his head  ah theyre a bad lot surbut sorrow wan o them was iver so ugly as him  he concluded this remark by pointing over his shoulder with his thumb in the direction of the house where the new clerk lay a hideous though not severely injured spectacle on his bed  a last farewell floated over the water as the boat passed round a point of land  jack waved his hand and a moment later fort desolation vanished from his eyes for ever  readers it is not our purpose here to detail to you the life and adventures of jack robinson  we have recalled and recounted this brief passage in his eventful history in order to give you some idea of what outskirters and wandering stars of humanity sometimes see and say and go through  doubtless jacks future career would interest you for his was a nature that could not be easily subdued  difficulties had the effect of stirring him up to more resolute exertions  opposition had the effect of drawing him on instead of keeping him back  cold water warmed him  wet blankets when thrown on him were dried and made hot  his energy was untiring his zeal red hot and when one effort failed he began another with as much fervour as if it were the first he had ever made  yet jack robinson did not succeed in life  it would be difficult to say why  perhaps his zeal and energy were frittered away on too many objects  perhaps if he had confined himself to one purpose and object in life he would have been a great man  yet no one could say that he was given to change until change was forced upon him  perchance want of judgment was the cause of all his misfortunes yet he was a clever fellow cleverer than the average of men  it may be that jacks selfreliance had something to do with it and that he was too apt to trust to his own strength and wisdom forgetting that there is one without whose blessing mans powers can accomplish no good whatever  we know not  we do not charge jack with this yet this is by no means an uncommon sin if we are to believe the confessions of multitudes of good men  be this as it may jack arrived at fort kamenistaquoia in due course and kindly but firmly refused to take part with his sanguine friend j murray who proposedto use his own languagethe gettingup of a great jointstock company to buy up all the sawmills on the ottawa  thereafter jack went to quebec where he was joined by teddy odonel with whom he found his way to the outskirt settlements of the far west there having purchased two horses and two rifles he mounted his steed and followed by his man galloped away into the prairie to seek his fortune  the end
