introduction   it has been the ambition of my literary life to write a book about the united states and i had made up my mind to visit the country with this object before the intestine troubles of the united states government had commenced  i have not allowed the division among the states and the breaking out of civil war to interfere with my intention but i should not purposely have chosen this period either for my book or for my visit  i say so much in order that it may not be supposed that it is my special purpose to write an account of the struggle as far as it has yet been carried  my wish is to describe as well as i can the present social and political state of the country  this i should have attempted with more personal satisfaction in the work had there been no disruption between the north and south but i have not allowed that disruption to deter me from an object which if it were delayed might probably never be carried out  i am therefore forced to take the subject in its present condition and being so forced i must write of the war of the causes which have led to it and of its probable termination  but i wish it to be understood that it was not my selected task to do so and is not now my primary object  thirty years ago my mother wrote a book about the americans to which i believe i may allude as a wellknown and successful work without being guilty of any undue family conceit  that was essentially a womans book  she saw with a womans keen eye and described with a womans light but graphic pen the social defects and absurdities which our near relatives had adopted into their domestic life  all that she told was worth the telling and the telling if done successfully was sure to produce a good result i am satisfied that it did so  but she did not regard it as a part of her work to dilate on the nature and operation of those political arrangements which had produced the social absurdities which she saw or to explain that though such absurdities were the natural result of those arrangements in their newness the defects would certainly pass away while the political arrangements if good would remain  such a work is fitter for a man than for a woman i am very far from thinking that it is a task which i can perform with satisfaction either to myself or to others  it is a work which some man will do who has earned a right by education study and success to rank himself among the political sages of his age  but i may perhaps be able to add something to the familiarity of englishmen with americans  the writings which have been most popular in england on the subject of the united states have hitherto dealt chiefly with social details and though in most cases true and useful have created laughter on one side of the atlantic and soreness on the other  if i could do anything to mitigate the soreness if i could in any small degree add to the good feeling which should exist between two nations which ought to love each other so well and which do hang upon each other so constantly i should think that i had cause to be proud of my work  but it is very hard to write about any country a book that does not represent the country described in a more or less ridiculous point of view  it is hard at least to do so in such a book as i must write  a de tocqueville may do it  it may be done by any philosophicopolitical or politicostatistical or statistico scientific writer but it can hardly be done by a man who professes to use a light pen and to manufacture his article for the use of general readers  such a writer may tell all that he sees of the beautiful but he must also tell if not all that he sees of the ludicrous at any rate the most piquant part of it  how to do this without being offensive is the problem which a man with such a task before him has to solve  his first duty is owed to his readers and consists mainly in this that he shall tell the truth and shall so tell that truth that what he has written may be readable but a second duty is due to those of whom he writes and he does not perform that duty well if he gives offense to those as to whom on the summing up of the whole evidence for and against them in his own mind he intends to give a favorable verdict  there are of course those against whom a writer does not intend to give a favorable verdict people and places whom he desires to describe on the peril of his own judgment as bad ill educated ugly and odious  in such cases his course is straightforward enough  his judgment may be in great peril but his volume or chapter will be easily written  ridicule and censure run glibly from the pen and form themselves into sharp paragraphs which are pleasant to the reader  whereas eulogy is commonly dull and too frequently sounds as though it were false  there is much difficulty in expressing a verdict which is intended to be favorable but which though favorable shall not be falsely eulogistic and though true not offensive  who has ever traveled in foreign countries without meeting excellent stories against the citizens of such countries  and how few can travel without hearing such stories against themselves  it is impossible for me to avoid telling of a very excellent gentleman whom i met before i had been in the united states a week and who asked me whether lords in england ever spoke to men who were not lords  nor can i omit the opening address of another gentleman to my wife  you like our institutions maam  yes indeed said my wife not with all that eagerness of assent which the occasion perhaps required  ah said he i never yet met the downtrodden subject of a despot who did not hug his chains  the first gentleman was certainly somewhat ignorant of our customs and the second was rather abrupt in his condemnation of the political principles of a person whom he only first saw at that moment  it comes to me in the way of my trade to repeat such incidents but i can tell stories which are quite as good against englishmen  as for instance when i was tapped on the back in one of the galleries of florence by a countryman of mine and asked to show him where stood the medical venus  nor is anything that one can say of the inconveniences attendant upon travel in the united states to be beaten by what foreigners might truly say of us  i shall never forget the look of a frenchman whom i found on a wet afternoon in the best inn of a provincial town in the west of england  he was seated on a horsehaircovered chair in the middle of a small dingy illfurnished private sittingroom  no eloquence of mine could make intelligible to a frenchman or an american the utter desolation of such an apartment  the world as then seen by that frenchman offered him solace of no description  the air without was heavy dull and thick  the street beyond the window was dark and narrow  the room contained mahogany chairs covered with horse hair a mahogany table rickety in its legs and a mahogany sideboard ornamented with inverted glasses and old cruetstands the frenchman had come to the house for shelter and food and had been asked whether he was commercial  whereupon he shook his head did he want a sittingroom  yes he did  he was a leetle tired and vanted to seet  whereupon he was presumed to have ordered a private room and was shown up to the eden i have described  i found him there at deaths door  nothing that i can say with reference to the social habits of the americans can tell more against them than the story of that frenchmans fate tells against those of our country  from which remarks i would wish to be understood as deprecating offense from my american friends if in the course of my book should be found aught which may seem to argue against the excellence of their institutions and the grace of their social life  of this at any rate i can assure them in sober earnestness that i admire what they have done in the world and for the world with a true and hearty admiration and that whether or no all their institutions be at present excellent and their social life all graceful my wishes are that they should be so and my convictions are that that improvement will come for which there may perhaps even yet be some little room  and now touching this war which had broken out between the north and south before i left england  i would wish to explain what my feelings were or rather what i believe the general feelings of england to have been before i found myself among the people by whom it was being waged  it is very difficult for the people of any one nation to realize the political relations of another and to chew the cud and digest the bearings of those external politics  but it is unjust in the one to decide upon the political aspirations and doings of that other without such understanding  constantly as the name of france is in our mouths comparatively few englishmen understand the way in which france is governed that is how far absolute despotism prevails and how far the power of the one ruler is tempered or as it may be hampered by the voices and influence of others  and as regards england how seldom is it that in common society a foreigner is met who comprehends the nature of her political arrangements  to a frenchmani do not of course include great men who have made the subject a studybut to the ordinary intelligent frenchman the thing is altogether incomprehensible language it may be said has much to do with that  but an american speaks english and how often is an american met who has combined in his mind the idea of a monarch so called with that of a republic properly so nameda combination of ideas which i take to be necessary to the understanding of english politics  the gentleman who scorned my wife for hugging her chains had certainly not done so and yet he conceived that he had studied the subject the matter is one most difficult of comprehension  how many englishmen have failed to understand accurately their own constitution or the true bearing of their own politics  but when this knowledge has been attained it has generally been filtered into the mind slowly and has come from the unconscious study of many years  an englishman handles a newspaper for a quarter of an hour daily and daily exchanges some few words in politics with those around him till drop by drop the pleasant springs of his liberty creep into his mind and water his heart and thus earlier or later in life according to the nature of his intelligence he understands why it is that he is at all points a free man  but if this be so of our own politics if it be so rare a thing to find a foreigner who understands them in all their niceties why is it that we are so confident in our remarks on all the niceties of those of other nations  i hope that i may not be misunderstood as saying that we should not discuss foreign politics in our press our parliament our public meetings or our private houses  no man could be mad enough to preach such a doctrine  as regards our parliament that is probably the best british school of foreign politics seeing that the subject is not there often taken up by men who are absolutely ignorant and that mistakes when made are subject to a correction which is both rough and ready  the press though very liable to error labors hard at its vocation in teaching foreign politics and spares no expense in letting in daylight  if the light let in be sometimes moonshine excuse may easily be made  where so much is attempted there must necessarily be some failure  but even the moonshine does good if it be not offensive moonshine  what i would deprecate is that aptness at reproach which we assume the readiness with scorn the quiet words of insult the instant judgment and condemnation with which we are so inclined to visit not the great outward acts but the smaller inward politics of our neighbors  and do others spare us will be the instant reply of all who may read this  in my counter reply i make bold to place myself and my country on very high ground and to say that we the older and therefore more experienced people as regards the united states and the better governed as regards france and the stronger as regards all the world beyond should not throw mud again even though mud be thrown at us  i yield the path to a small chimneysweeper as readily as to a lady and forbear from an interchange of courtesies with a billingsgate heroine even though at heart i may have a proud consciousness that i should not altogether go to the wall in such an encounter  i left england in august lastaugust 1861  at that time and for some months previous i think that the general english feeling on the american question was as follows this widespread nationality of the united states with its enormous territorial possessions and increasing population has fallen asunder torn to pieces by the weight of its own discordant partsas a congregation when its size has become unwieldy will separate and reform itself into two wholesome wholes  it is well that this should be so for the people are not homogeneous as a people should be who are called to live together as one nation  they have attempted to combine free soil sentiments with the practice of slavery and to make these two antagonists live together in peace and unity under the same roof but as we have long expected they have failed  now has come the period for separation and if the people would only see this and act in accordance with the circumstances which providence and the inevitable hand of the worlds ruler has prepared for them all would be well  but they will not do this  they will go to war with each other  the south will make her demands for secession with an arrogance and instant pressure which exasperates the north and the north forgetting that an equable temper in such matters is the most powerful of all weapons will not recognize the strength of its own position  it allows itself to be exasperated and goes to war for that which if regained would only be injurious to it thus millions on millions sterling will be spent  a heavy debt will be incurred and the north which divided from the south might take its place among the greatest of nations will throw itself back for half a century and perhaps injure the splendor of its ultimate prospects  if only they would be wise throw down their arms and agree to part  but they will not  this was i think the general opinion when i left england  it would not however be necessary to go back many months to reach the time when englishmen were saying how impossible it was that so great a national power should ignore its own greatness and destroy its own power by an internecine separation  but in august last all that had gone by and we in england had realized the probability of actual secession  to these feelings on the subject maybe added another which was natural enough though perhaps not noble  these western cocks have crowed loudly we said too loudly for the comfort of those who live after all at no such great distance from them  it is well that their combs should be clipped  cocks who crow so very loudly are a nuisance  it might have gone so far that the clipping would become a work necessarily to be done from without  but it is ten times better for all parties that it should be done from within and as the cocks are now clipping their own combs in gods name let them do it and the whole world will be the quieter  that i say was not a very noble idea but it was natural enough and certainly has done somewhat in mitigating that grief which the horrors of civil war and the want of cotton have caused to us in england  such certainly had been my belief as to the country  i speak here of my opinion as to the ultimate success of secession and the folly of the war repudiating any concurrence of my own in the ignoble but natural sentiment alluded to in the last paragraph  i certainly did think that the northern states if wise would have let the southern states go  i had blamed buchanan as a traitor for allowing the germ of secession to make any growth and as i thought him a traitor then so do i think him a traitor now  but i had also blamed lincoln or rather the government of which mr lincoln in this matter is no more than the exponent for his efforts to avoid that which is inevitable  in this i think that ior as i believe i may say we we englishmenwere wrong  i do not see how the north treated as it was and had been could have submitted to secession without resistance  we all remember what shakspeare says of the great armies which were led out to fight for a piece of ground not large enough to cover the bodies of those who would be slain in the battle but i do not remember that shakspeare says that the battle was on this account necessarily unreasonable  it is the old point of honor which till it had been made absurd by certain changes of circumstances was always grand and usually beneficent  these changes of circumstances have altered the manner in which appeal may be made but have not altered the point of honor  had the southern states sought to obtain secession by constitutional means they might or might not have been successful but if successful there would have been no war  i do not mean to brand all the southern states with treason nor do i intend to say that having secession at heart they could have obtained it by constitutional means  but i do intend to say that acting as they did demanding secession not constitutionally but in opposition to the constitution taking upon themselves the right of breaking up a nationality of which they formed only a part and doing that without consent of the other part opposition from the north and war was an inevitable consequence  it is i think only necessary to look back to the revolution by which the united states separated themselves from england to see this  there is hardly to be met here and there an englishman who now regrets the loss of the revolted american colonies who now thinks that civilization was retarded and the world injured by that revolt who now conceives that england should have expended more treasure and more lives in the hope of retaining those colonies it is agreed that the revolt was a good thing that those who were then rebels became patriots by success and that they deserved well of all coming ages of mankind  but not the less absolutely necessary was it that england should endeavor to hold her own  she was as the mother bird when the young bird will fly alone  she suffered those pangs which nature calls upon mothers to endure  as was the necessity of british opposition to american independence so was the necessity of northern opposition to southern secession  i do not say that in other respects the two cases were parallel  the states separated from us because they would not endure taxation without representationin other words because they were old enough and big enough to go alone  the south is seceding from the north because the two are not homogeneous they have different instincts different appetites different morals and a different culture  it is well for one man to say that slavery has caused the separation and for another to say that slavery has not caused it  each in so saying speaks the truth slavery has caused it seeing that slavery is the great point on which the two have agreed to differ  but slavery has not caused it seeing that other points of difference are to be found in every circumstance and feature of the two people  the north and the south must ever be dissimilar  in the north labor will always be honorable and because honorable successful  in the south labor has ever been servileat least in some senseand therefore dishonorable and because dishonorable has not to itself been successful  in the south i say labor ever has been dishonorable and i am driven to confess that i have not hitherto seen a sign of any change in the creators fiat on this matter  that labor will be honorable all the world over as years advance and the millennium draws nigh i for one never doubt  so much for english opinion about america in august last  and now i will venture to say a word or two as to american feeling respecting this english opinion at that period  it will of course be remembered by all my readers that at the beginning of the war lord russell who was then in the lower house declared as foreign secretary of state that england would regard the north and south as belligerents and would remain neutral as to both of them  this declaration gave violent offense to the north and has been taken as indicating british sympathy with the cause of the seceders  i am not going to explainindeed it would be necessary that i should first understandthe laws of nations with regard to blockaded ports privateering ships and men and goods contraband of war and all those seminautical semimilitary rules and axioms which it is necessary that all attorneysgeneral and such like should at the present moment have at their fingers end  but it must be evident to the most ignorant in those matters among which large crowd i certainly include myself that it was essentially necessary that lord john russell should at that time declare openly what england intended to do  it was essential that our seamen should know where they would be protected and where not and that the course to be taken by england should be defined  reticence in the matter was not within the power of the british government  it behooved the foreign secretary of state to declare openly that england intended to side either with one party or with the other or else to remain neutral between them  i had heard this matter discussed by americans before i left england and i have of course heard it discussed very frequently in america  there can be no doubt that the front of the offense given by england to the northern states was this declaration of lord john russells  but it has been always made evident to me that the sin did not consist in the fact of englands neutralityin the fact of her regarding the two parties as belligerentsbut in the open declaration made to the world by a secretary of state that she did intend so to regard them  if another proof were wanting this would afford another proof of the immense weight attached in america to all the proceedings and to all the feelings of england on this matter  the very anger of the north is a compliment paid by the north to england  but not the less is that anger unreasonable  to those in america who understand our constitution it must be evident that our government cannot take official measures without a public avowal of such measures  france can do so  russia can do so  the government of the united states can do so and could do so even before this rupture  but the government of england cannot do so  all men connected with the government in england have felt themselves from time to time more or less hampered by the necessity of publicity  our statesmen have been forced to fight their battles with the plan of their tactics open before their adversaries  but we in england are inclined to believe that the general result is good and that battles so fought and so won will be fought with the honestest blows and won with the surest results  reticence in this matter was not possible and lord john russell in making the open avowal which gave such offense to the northern states only did that which as a servant of england england required him to do  what would you in england have thought a gentleman of much weight in boston said to me if when you were in trouble in india we had openly declared that we regarded your opponents there are as belligerents on equal terms with yourselves  i was forced to say that as far as i could see there was no analogy between the two cases  in india an army had mutinied and that an army composed of a subdued if not a servile race  the analogy would have been fairer had it referred to any sympathy shown by us to insurgent negroes  but nevertheless had the army which mutinied in india been in possession of ports and seaboard had they held in their hands vast commercial cities and great agricultural districts had they owned ships and been masters of a widespread trade america could have done nothing better toward us than have remained neutral in such a conflict and have regarded the parties as belligerents  the only question is whether she would have done so well by us  but said my friend in answer to all this we should not have proclaimed to the world that we regarded you and them as standing on an equal footing  there again appeared the true gist of the offense  a word from england such as that spoken by lord john russell was of such weight to the south that the north could not endure to have it spoken  i did not say to that gentleman but here i may say that had such circumstances arisen as those conjectured and had america spoken such a word england would not have felt herself called upon to resent it  but the fairer analogy lies between ireland and the southern states  the monster meetings and oconnells triumphs are not so long gone by but that many of us can remember the first demand for secession made by ireland and the line which was then taken by american sympathies  it is not too much to say that america then believed that ireland would secure secession and that the great trust of the irish repealers was in the moral aid which she did and would receive from america  but our government proclaimed no sympathy with ireland said my friend  no  the american government is not called on to make such proclamations nor had ireland ever taken upon herself the nature and labors of a belligerent  that this anger on the part of the north is unreasonable i cannot doubt  that it is unfortunate grievous and very bitter i am quite sure  but i do not think that it is in any degree surprising  i am inclined to think that did i belong to boston as i do belong to london i should share in the feeling and rave as loudly as all men there have raved against the coldness of england when men have on hand such a job of work as the north has now undertaken they are always guided by their feelings rather than their reason  what two men ever had a quarrel in which each did not think that all the world if just would espouse his own side of the dispute  the north feels that it has been more than loyal to the south and that the south has taken advantage of that over loyalty to betray the north  we have worked for them and fought for them and paid for them says the north  by our labor we have raised their indolence to a par with our energy  while we have worked like men we have allowed them to talk and bluster  we have warmed them in our bosom and now they turn against us and sting us  the world sees that this is so  england above all must see it and seeing it should speak out her true opinion the north is hot with such thoughts as these and one cannot wonder that she should be angry with her friend when her friend with an expression of certain easy good wishes bids her fight out her own battles  the north has been unreasonable with england but i believe that every reader of this page would have been as unreasonable had that reader been born in massachusetts  mr and mrs jones are the dearlybeloved friends of my family  my wife and i have lived with mrs jones on terms of intimacy which have been quite endearing  jones has had the run of my house with perfect freedom and in mrs joness drawingroom i have always had my own armchair and have been regaled with large breakfastcups of tea quite as though i were at home  but of a sudden jones and his wife have fallen out and there is for awhile in jones hall a catanddog life that may endin one hardly dare to surmise what calamity  mrs jones begs that i will interfere with her husband and jones entreats the good offices of my wife in moderating the hot temper of his own  but we know better than that  if we interfere the chances are that my dear friends will make it up and turn upon us  i grieve beyond measure in a general way at the temporary break up of the joneshall happiness  i express general wishes that it may be temporary  but as for saying which is right or which is wrongas to expressing special sympathy on either side in such a quarrelit is out of the question  my dear jones you must excuse me  any news in the city today  sugars have fallen how are teas  of course jones thinks that im a brute but what can i do  i have been somewhat surprised to find the trouble that has been taken by american orators statesmen and logicians to prove that this secession on the part of the south has been revolutionary that is to say that it has been undertaken and carried on not in compliance with the constitution of the united states but in defiance of it  this has been done over and over again by some of the greatest men of the north and has been done most successfully but what then  of course the movement has been revolutionary and anticonstitutional  nobody no single southerner can really believe that the constitution of the united states as framed in 1787 or altered since intended to give to the separate states the power of seceding as they pleased  it is surely useless going through long arguments to prove this seeing that it is absolutely proved by the absence of any clause giving such license to the separate states  such license would have been destructive to the very idea of a great nationality  where would new england have been as a part of the united states if new york which stretches from the atlantic to the borders of canada had been endowed with the power of cutting off the six northern states from the rest of the union  no one will for a moment doubt that the movement was revolutionary and yet infinite pains are taken to prove a fact that is patent to every one  it is revolutionary but what then  have the northern states of the american union taken upon themselves in 1861 to proclaim their opinion that revolution is a sin  are they going back to the divine right of any sovereignty  are they going to tell the world that a nation or a people is bound to remain in any political status because that status is the recognized form of government under which such a people have lived  is this to be the doctrine of united states citizensof all people  and is this the doctrine preached now of all times when the king of naples and the italian dukes have just been dismissed from their thrones with such enchanting nonchalance because their people have not chosen to keep them  of course the movement is revolutionary and why not  it is agreed now among all men and all nations that any people may change its form of government to any other if it wills to do soand if it can do so  there are two other points on which these northern statesmen and logicians also insist and these two other points are at any rate better worth an argument than that which touches the question of revolution  it being settled that secession on the part of the southerners is revolution it is argued firstly that no occasion for revolution had been given by the north to the south and secondly that the south has been dishonest in its revolutionary tactics  men certainly should not raise a revolution for nothing and it may certainly be declared that whatever men do they should do honestly  but in that matter of the cause and ground for revolution it is so very easy for either party to put in a plea that shall be satisfactory to itself  mr and mrs jones each had a separate story  mr jones was sure that the right lay with him but mrs jones was no less sure  no doubt the north had done much for the south had earned money for it had fed it and had moreover in a great measure fostered all its bad habits  it had not only been generous to the south but overindulgent  but also it had continually irritated the south by meddling with that which the southerners believed to be a question absolutely private to themselves  the matter was illustrated to me by a new hampshire man who was conversant with black bears  at the hotels in the new hampshire mountains it is customary to find black bears chained to poles  these bears are caught among the hills and are thus imprisoned for the amusement of the hotel guests  them southerners said my friend are jist as one as that ere bear we feeds him and gives him a house and his belly is ollers full but then jist becase hes a black bear were ollers a poking him with sticks and a course the beast is a kinder riled  he wants to be back to the mountains  he wouldnt have his belly filled but hed have his own way  its jist so with them southerners  it is of no use proving to any man or to any nation that they have got all they should want if they have not got all that they do want  if a servant desires to go it is of no avail to show him that he has all he can desire in his present place  the northerners say that they have given no offense to the southerners and that therefore the south is wrong to raise a revolution  the very fact that the north is the north is an offence to the south as long as mr and mrs jones were one in heart and one in feeling having the same hopes and the same joys it was well that they should remain together  but when it is proved that they cannot so live without tearing out each others eyes sir cresswell cresswell the revolutionary institution of domestic life interferes and separates them  this is the age of such separations  i do not wonder that the north should use its logic to show that it has received cause of offense but given none but i do think that such logic is thrown away  the matter is not one for argument  the south has thought that it can do better without the north than with it and if it has the power to separate itself it must be conceded that it has the right  and then as to that question of honesty  whatever men do they certainly should do honestly  speaking broadly one may say that the rule applies to nations as strongly as to individuals and should be observed in politics as accurately as in other matters we must however confess that men who are scrupulous in their private dealings do too constantly drop those scruples when they handle public affairs and especially when they handle them at stirring moments of great national changes  the name of napoleon iii stands fair now before europe and yet he filched the french empire with a falsehood  the union of england and ireland is a successful fact but nevertheless it can hardly be said that it was honestly achieved  i heartily believe that the whole of texas is improved in every sense by having been taken from mexico and added to the southern states but i much doubt whether that annexation was accomplished with absolute honesty  we all reverence the name of cavour but cavour did not consent to abandon nice to france with clean hands  when men have political ends to gain they regard their opponents as adversaries and then that old rule of war is brought to bear deceit or valoreither may be used against a foe would it were not so  the rascally rulerascally in reference to all political contestsis becoming less universal than it was but it still exists with sufficient force to be urged as an excuse and while it does exist it seems almost needless to show that a certain amount of fraud has been used by a certain party in a revolution  if the south be ultimately successful the fraud of which it may have been guilty will be condoned by the world  the southern or democratic party of the united states had as all men know been in power for many years  either southern presidents had been elected or northern presidents with southern politics the south for many years had had the disposition of military matters and the power of distributing military appliances of all descriptions  it is now alleged by the north that a conspiracy had long been hatching in the south with the view of giving to the southern states the power of secession whenever they might think fit to secede and it is further alleged that president after president for years back has unduly sent the military treasure of the nation away from the north down to the south in order that the south might be prepared when the day should come  that a president with southern instincts should unduly favor the south that he should strengthen the south and feel that arms and ammunition were stored there with better effect than they could be stored in the north is very probable  we all understand what is the bias of a mans mind and how strong that bias may become when the man is not especially scrupulous  but i do not believe that any president previous to buchanan sent military materials to the south with the selfacknowledged purpose of using them against the union  that buchanan did so or knowingly allowed this to be done i do believe and i think that buchanan was a traitor to the country whose servant he was and whose pay he received  and now having said so much in the way of introduction i will begin my journey    chapter ii  newportrhode island   wethe we consisting of my wife and myselfleft liverpool for boston on the 24th august 1861 in the arabia one of cunards north american mail packets  we had determined that my wife should return alone at the beginning of winter when i intended to go to a part of the country in which under the existing circumstances of the war a lady might not feel herself altogether comfortable  i proposed staying in america over the winter and returning in the spring and this programme i have carried out with sufficient exactness  the arabia touched at halifax and as the touch extended from 11 am to 6 pm we had an opportunity of seeing a good deal of that colony not quite sufficient to justify me at this critical age in writing a chapter of travels in nova scotia but enough perhaps to warrant a paragraph  it chanced that a cousin of mine was then in command of the troops there so that we saw the fort with all the honors  a dinner on shore was i think a greater treat to us even than this  we also inspected sundry specimens of the gold which is now being found for the first time in nova scotia as to the glory and probable profits of which the nova scotians seemed to be fully alive  but still i think the dinner on shore took rank with us as the most memorable and meritorious of all that we did and saw at halifax  at seven oclock on the morning but one after that we were landed at boston  at boston i found friends ready to receive us with open arms though they were friends we had never known before  i own that i felt myself burdened with much nervous anxiety at my first introduction to men and women in boston  i knew what the feeling there was with reference to england and i knew also how impossible it is for an englishman to hold his tongue and submit to dispraise of england  as for going among a people whose whole minds were filled with affairs of the war and saying nothing about the war i knew that no resolution to such an effect could be carried out  if one could not trust ones self to speak one should have stayed at home in england  i will here state that i always did speak out openly what i thought and felt and that though i encountered very strongsometimes almost fierceopposition i never was subjected to anything that was personally disagreeable to me  in september we did not stay above a week in boston having been fairly driven out of it by the musquitoes  i had been told that i should find nobody in boston whom i cared to see as everybody was habitually out of town during the heat of the latter summer and early autumn but this was not so  the war and attendant turmoils of war had made the season of vacation shorter than usual and most of those for whom i asked were back at their posts  i know no place at which an englishman may drop down suddenly among a pleasanter circle of acquaintance or find himself with a more clever set of men than he can do at boston  i confess that in this respect i think that but few towns are at present more fortunately circumstanced than the capital of the bay state as massachusetts is called and that very few towns make a better use of their advantages  boston has a right to be proud of what it has done for the world of letters  it is proud but i have not found that its pride was carried too far  boston is not in itself a fine city but it is a very pleasant city  they say that the harbor is very grand and very beautiful it certainly is not so fine as that of portland in a nautical point of view and as certainly it is not as beautiful  it is the entrance from the sea into boston of which people say so much but i did not think it quite worthy of all i had heard  in such matters however much depends on the peculiar light in which scenery is seen  an evening light is generally the best for all landscapes and i did not see the entrance to boston harbor by an evening light  it was not the beauty of the harbor of which i thought the most but of the tea which had been sunk there and of all that came of that successful speculation  few towns now standing have a right to be more proud of their antecedents than boston  but as i have said it is not specially interesting to the eye what new town or even what simply adult town can be so  there is an atheneum and a state hall and a fashionable streetbeacon street very like piccadilly as it runs along the green parkand there is the green park opposite to this piccadilly called boston common  beacon street and boston common are very pleasant excellent houses there are and large churches and enormous hotels but of such things as these a man can write nothing that is worth the reading  the traveler who desires to tell his experience of north america must write of people rather than of things  as i have said i found myself instantly involved in discussions on american politics and the bearing of england upon those politics what do you think you in englandwhat do you believe will be the upshot of this war  that was the question always asked in those or other words  secession certainly i always said but not speaking quite with that abruptness  and you believe then that the south will beat the north  i explained that i personally had never so thought and that i did not believe that to be the general idea  mens opinions in england however were too divided to enable me to say that there was any prevailing conviction on the matter  my own impression was and is that the north will in a military point of view have the best of the contestwill beat the south but that the northerners will not prevent secession let their success be what it may  should the north prevail after a two years conflict the north will not admit the south to an equal participation of good things with themselves even though each separate rebellious state should return suppliant like a prodigal son kneeling on the floor of congress each with a separate rope of humiliation round its neck  such was my idea as expressed then and i do not know that i have since had much cause to change it  we will never give it up one gentleman said to meand indeed many have said the sametill the whole territory is again united from the bay to the gulf  it is impossible that we should allow of two nationalities within those limits  and do you think it possible i asked that you should receive back into your bosom this people which you now hate with so deep a hatred and receive them again into your arms as brothers on equal terms  is it in accordance with experience that a conquered people should be so treated and that too a people whose every habit of life is at variance with the habits of their presumed conquerors  when you have flogged them into a return of fraternal affection are they to keep their slaves or are they to abolish them  no said my friend it may not be practicable to put those rebellious states at once on an equality with ourselves  for a time they will probably be treated as the territories are now treated  the territories are vast outlying districts belonging to the union but not as yet endowed with state governments or a participation in the united states congress  for a time they must perhaps lose their full privileges but the union will be anxious to readmit them at the earliest possible period  and as to the slaves i asked again  let them emigrate to liberiaback to their own country  i could not say that i thought much of the solution of the difficulty  it would i suggested overtask even the energy of america to send out an emigration of four million souls to provide for their wants in a new and uncultivated country and to provide after that for the terrible gap made in the labor market of the southern states  the israelites went back from bondage said my friend  but a way was opened for them by a miracle across the sea and food was sent to them from heaven and they had among them a moses for a leader and a joshua to fight their battles  i could not but express my fear that the days of such immigrations were over  this plan of sending back the negroes to africa did not reach me only from one or from two mouths and it was suggested by men whose opinions respecting their country have weight at home and are entitled to weight abroad  i mention this merely to show how insurmountable would be the difficulty of preventing secession let which side win that may  we will never abandon the right to the mouth of the mississippi that in all such arguments is a strong point with men of the northern statesperhaps the point to which they all return with the greatest firmness  it is that on which mr everett insists in the last paragraph of the oration which he made in new york on the 4th of july 1861  the missouri and the mississippi rivers he says with their hundred tributaries give to the great central basin of our continent its character and destiny  the outlet of this system lies between the states of tennessee and missouri of mississippi and arkansas and through the state of louisiana  the ancient province so called the proudest monument of the mighty monarch whose name it bears passed from the jurisdiction of france to that of spain in 1763  spain coveted itnot that she might fill it with prosperous colonies and rising states but that it might stretch as a broad waste barrier infested with warlike tribes between the angloamerican power and the silver mines of mexico  with the independence of the united states the fear of a still more dangerous neighbor grew upon spain and in the insane expectation of checking the progress of the union westward she threatened and at times attempted to close the mouth of the mississippi on the rapidlyincreasing trade of the west  the bare suggestion of such a policy roused the population upon the banks of the ohio then inconsiderable as one man  their confidence in washington scarcely restrained them from rushing to the seizure of new orleans when the treaty of san lorenzo el real in 1795 stipulated for them a precarious right of navigating the noble river to the sea with a right of deposit at new orleans  this subject was for years the turningpoint of the politics of the west and it was perfectly well understood that sooner or later she would be content with nothing less than the sovereign control of the mighty stream from its headspring to its outlet in the gulf  and that is as true now as it was then  this is well put  it describes with force the desires ambition and necessities of a great nation and it tells with historical truth the story of the success of that nation  it was a great thing done when the purchase of the whole of louisiana was completed by the united statesthat cession by france however having been made at the instance of napoleon and not in consequence of any demand made by the states  the district then called louisiana included the present state of that name and the states of missouri and arkansasincluded also the right to possess if not the absolute possession of all that enormous expanse of country running from thence back to the pacific a huge amount of territory of which the most fertile portion is watered by the mississippi and its vast tributaries  that river and those tributaries are navigable through the whole center of the american continent up to wisconsin and minnesota  to the united states the navigation of the mississippi was we may say indispensable and to the states when no longer united the navigation will be equally indispensable  but the days are gone when any country such as spain was can interfere to stop the highways of the world with the all but avowed intention of arresting the progress of civilization  it may be that the north and the south can never again be friends as the component parts of one nation  such i take it is the belief of all politicians in europe and of many of those who live across the water  but as separate nations they may yet live together in amity and share between them the great water ways which god has given them for their enrichment  the rhine is free to prussia and to holland  the danube is not closed against austria  it will be said that the danube has in fact been closed against austria in spite of treaties to the contrary  but the faults of bad and weak governments are made known as cautions to the world and not as facts to copy  the free use of the waters of a common river between two nations is an affair for treaty and it has not yet come to that that treaties must necessarily be null and void through the falseness of politicians  and what will england do for cotton  is it not the fact that lord john russell with his professed neutrality intends to express sympathy with the southintends to pave the way for the advent of southern cotton  you ought to love us so say men in boston because we have been with you in heart and spirit for long long years  but your trade has eaten into your souls and you love american cotton better than american loyalty and american fellowship  this i found to be unfair and in what politest language i could use i said so  i had not any special knowledge of the minds of english statesmen on this matter but i knew as well as americans could do what our statesmen had said and done respecting it  that cotton if it came from the south would be made very welcome in liverpool of course i knew  if private enterprise could bring it it might be brought  but the very declaration made by lord john russell was the surest pledge that england as a nation would not interfere even to supply her own wants  it may easily be imagined what eager words all this would bring about but i never found that eager words led to feelings which were personally hostile  all the world has heard of newport in rhode island as being the brighton and tenby and scarborough of new england  and the glory of newport is by no means confined to new england but is shared by new york and washington and in ordinary years by the extreme south  it is the habit of americans to go to some wateringplace every summerthat is to some place either of sea water or of inland waters  this is done much in england more in ireland than in england but i think more in the states than even in ireland but of all such summer haunts newport is supposed to be in many ways the most captivating  in the first place it is certainly the most fashionable and in the next place it is said to be the most beautiful  we decided on going to newportled thither by the latter reputation rather than the former  as we were still in the early part of september we expected to find the place full but in this we were disappointeddisappointed i say rather than gratified although a crowded house at such a place is certainly a nuisance  but a house which is prepared to make up six hundred beds and which is called on to make up only twentyfive becomes after awhile somewhat melancholy  the natural depression of the landlord communicates itself to his servants and from the servants it descends to the twentyfive guests who wander about the long passages and deserted balconies like the ghosts of those of the summer visitors who cannot rest quietly in their graves at home  in england we know nothing of hotels prepared for six hundred visitors all of whom are expected to live in common  domestic architects would be frightened at the dimensions which are needed and at the number of apartments which are required to be clustered under one roof  we went to the ocean hotel at newport and fancied as we first entered the hall under a veranda as high as the house and made our way into the passage that we had been taken to a wellarranged barrack  have you rooms i asked as a man always does ask on first reaching his inn  rooms enough the clerk said we have only fifty here  but that fifty dwindled down to twentyfive during the next day or two  we were a melancholy set the ladies appearing to be afflicted in this way worse than the gentlemen on account of their enforced abstinence from tobacco  what can twelve ladies do scattered about a drawingroom so called intended for the accommodation of two hundred  the drawingroom at the ocean hotel newport is not as big as westminster hall but would i should think make a very good house of commons for the british nation  fancy the feelings of a lady when she walks into such a room intending to spend her evening there and finds six or seven other ladies located on various sofas at terrible distances all strangers to her  she has come to newport probably to enjoy herself and as in accordance with the customs of the place she has dined at two she has nothing before her for the evening but the society of that huge furnished cavern  her husband if she have one or her father or her lover has probably entered the room with her  but a man has never the courage to endure such a position long  he sidles out with some muttered excuse and seeks solace with a cigar  the lady after half an hour of contemplation creeps silently near some companion in the desert and suggests in a whisper that newport does not seem to be very full at present  we stayed there for a week and were very melancholy but in our melancholy we still talked of the war  americans are said to be given to bragging and it is a sin of which i cannot altogether acquit them  but i have constantly been surprised at hearing the northern men speak of their own military achievements with anything but selfpraise  weve been whipped sir and we shall be whipped again before weve done uncommon well whipped we shall be  we began cowardly and were afraid to send our own regiments through one of our own cities  this alluded to a demand that had been made on the government that troops going to washington should not be sent through baltimore because of the strong feeling for rebellion which was known to exist in that city  president lincoln complied with this request thinking it well to avoid a collision between the mob and the soldiers  we began cowardly and now were going on cowardly and darnt attack them  well when weve been whipped often enough then we shall learn the trade  now all thisand i heard much of such a naturecould not be called boasting  but yet with it all there was a substratum of confidence  i have heard northern gentlemen complaining of the president complaining of all his ministers one after another complaining of the contractors who were robbing the army of the commanders who did not know how to command the army and of the army itself which did not know how to obey but i do not remember that i have discussed the matter with any northerner who would admit a doubt as to ultimate success  we were certainly rather melancholy at newport and the empty house may perhaps have given its tone to the discussions on the war  i confess that i could not stand the drawingroomthe ladies drawingroom as such like rooms are always called at the hotels and that i basely deserted my wife  i could not stand it either here or elsewhere and it seemed to me that other husbandsay and even loverswere as hard pressed as myself  i protest that there is no spot on the earths surface so dear to me as my own drawing room or rather my wifes drawingroom at home that i am not a man given hugely to clubs but one rather rejoicing in the rustle of petticoats  i like to have women in the same room with me  but at these hotels i found myself driven awaypropelled as it were by some unknown forceto absent myself from the feminine haunts anything was more palatable than them even liquoring up at a nasty bar or smoking in a comfortless readingroom among a deluge of american newspapers  and i protest alsohoping as i do so that i may say much in this book to prove the truth of such protestationthat this comes from no fault of the american women they are as lovely as our own women  taken generally they are better instructed though perhaps not better educated  they are seldom troubled with mauvaise honte i do not say it in irony but begging that the words may be taken at their proper meaning  they can always talk and very often can talk well  but when assembled together in these vast cavernous wouldbe luxurious but in truth horribly comfortless hotel drawingrooms they are unapproachable i have seen lovers whom i have known to be lovers unable to remain five minutes in the same cavern with their beloved ones  and then the music  there is always a piano in a hotel drawing room on which of course some one of the forlorn ladies is generally employed  i do not suppose that these pianos are in fact as a rule louder and harsher more violent and less musical than other instruments of the kind  they seem to be so but that i take it arises from the exceptional mental depression of those who have to listen to them  then the ladies or probably some one lady will sing and as she hears her own voice ring and echo through the lofty corners and round the empty walls she is surprised at her own force and with increased efforts sings louder and still louder  she is tempted to fancy that she is suddenly gifted with some power of vocal melody unknown to her before and filled with the glory of her own performance shouts till the whole house rings  at such moments she at least is happy if no one else is so  looking at the general sadness of her position who can grudge her such happiness  and then the childrenbabies i should say if i were speaking of english bairns of their age but seeing that they are americans i hardly dare to call them children  the actual age of these perfectlycivilized and highlyeducated beings may be from three to four  one will often see five or six such seated at the long dinnertable of the hotel breakfasting and dining with their elders and going through the ceremony with all the gravity and more than all the decorum of their grandfathers  when i was three years old i had not yet as i imagine been promoted beyond a silver spoon of my own wherewith to eat my bread and milk in the nursery and i feel assured that i was under the immediate care of a nursemaid as i gobbled up my minced mutton mixed with potatoes and gravy  but at hotel life in the states the adult infant lisps to the waiter for everything at table handles his fish with epicurean delicacy is choice in his selection of pickles very particular that his beefsteak at breakfast shall be hot and is instant in his demand for fresh ice in his water  but perhaps his or in this case her retreat from the room when the meal is over is the chefdoeuvre of the whole performance  the little precocious fullblown beauty of four signifies that she has completed her mealor is through her dinner as she would express itby carefully extricating herself from the napkin which has been tucked around her  then the waiter ever attentive to her movements draws back the chair on which she is seated and the young lady glides to the floor  a little girl in old england would scramble down but little girls in new england never scramble  her father and mother who are no more than her chief ministers walk before her out of the saloon and then sheswims after them  but swimming is not the proper word  fishes in making their way through the water assist or rather impede their motion with no dorsal wriggle  no animal taught to move directly by its creator adopts a gait so useless and at the same time so graceless  many women having received their lessons in walking from a less eligible instructor do move in this way and such women this unfortunate little lady has been instructed to copy  the peculiar step to which i allude is to be seen often on the boulevards in paris  it is to be seen more often in secondrate french towns and among fourthrate french women  of all signs in women betokening vulgarity bad taste and aptitude to bad morals it is the surest  and this is the gait of going which american mothers some american mothers i should saylove to teach their daughters as a comedy at a hotel it is very delightful but in private life i should object to it  to me newport could never be a place charming by reason of its own charms  that it is a very pleasant place when it is full of people and the people are in spirits and happy i do not doubt  but then the visitors would bring as far as i am concerned the pleasantness with them  the coast is not fine  to those who know the best portions of the coast of wales or cornwallor better still the western coast of ireland of clare and kerry for instanceit would not be in any way remarkable  it is by no means equal to dieppe or biarritz and not to be talked of in the same breath with spezzia  the hotels too are all built away from the sea so that one cannot sit and watch the play of the waves from ones windows  nor are there pleasant rambling paths down among the rocks and from one short strand to another  there is excellent bathing for those who like bathing on shelving sand  i dont  the spot is about half a mile from the hotels and to this the bathers are carried in omnibuses  till one oclock ladies bathe which operation however does not at all militate against the bathing of men but rather necessitates it as regards those men who have ladies with them  for here ladies and gentlemen bathe in decorous dresses and are very polite to each other  i must say that i think the ladies have the best of it  my idea of sea bathing for my own gratification is not compatible with a full suit of clothing  i own that my tastes are vulgar and perhaps indecent but i love to jump into the deep clear sea from off a rock and i love to be hampered by no outward impediments as i do so  for ordinary bathers for all ladies and for men less savage in their instincts than i am the bathing at newport is very good  the private housesvilla residences as they would be termed by an auctioneer in englandare excellent  many of them are in fact large mansions and are surrounded with grounds which as the shrubs grow up will be very beautiful  some have large wellkept lawns stretching down to the rocks and these to my taste give the charm to newport  they extend about two miles along the coast should my lot have made me a citizen of the united states i should have had no objection to become the possessor of one of these villa residences but i do not think that i should have gone in for hotel life at newport  we hired saddlehorses and rode out nearly the length of the island  it was all very well but there was little in it remarkable either as regards cultivation or scenery  we found nothing that it would be possible either to describe or remember the americans of the united states have had time to build and populate vast cities but they have not yet had time to surround themselves with pretty scenery  outlying grand scenery is given by nature but the prettiness of home scenery is a work of art  it comes from the thorough draining of land from the planting and subsequent thinning of trees from the controlling of waters and constant use of minute patches of broken land  in another hundred years or so rhode island may be perhaps as pretty as the isle of wight  the horses which we got were not good  they were unhandy and badly mouthed and that which my wife rode was altogether ignorant of the art of walking  we hired them from an englishman who had established himself at new york as a ridingmaster for ladies and who had come to newport for the season on the same business  he complained to me with much bitterness of the saddle horses which came in his wayof course thinking that it was the special business of a country to produce saddlehorses as i think it the special business of a country to produce pens ink and paper of good quality  according to him riding has not yet become an american art and hence the awkwardness of american horses lord bless you sir they dont give an animal a chance of a mouth  in this he alluded only i presume to saddlehorses  i know nothing of the trotting horses but i should imagine that a fine mouth must be an essential requisite for a trotting match in harness  as regards riding at newport we were not tempted to repeat the experiment  the number of carriages which we saw there remembering as i did that the place was comparatively emptyand their general smartness surprised me very much  it seemed that every lady with a house of her own had also her own carriage these carriages were always open and the law of the land imperatively demands that the occupants shall cover their knees with a worked worsted apron of brilliant colors  these aprons at first i confess seemed tawdry but the eye soon becomes used to bright colors in carriage aprons as well as in architecture and i soon learned to like them  rhode island as the state is usually called is the smallest state in the union  i may perhaps best show its disparity to other states by saying that new york extends about two hundred and fifty miles from north to south and the same distance from east to west whereas the state called rhode island is about forty miles long by twenty broad independently of certain small islands  it would in fact not form a considerable addition if added on to many of the other states  nevertheless it has all the same powers of self government as are possessed by such nationalities as the states of new york and pennsylvania and sends two senators to the senate at washington as do those enormous states  small as the state is rhode island itself forms but a small portion of it  the authorized and proper name of the state is providence plantation and rhode island  roger williams was the first founder of the colony and he established himself on the mainland at a spot which he called providence  here now stands the city of providence the chief town of the state and a thriving comfortable town it seems to be full of banks fed by railways and steamers and going ahead quite as quickly as roger williams could in his fondest hopes have desired  rhode island as i have said has all the attributes of government in common with her stouter and more famous sisters  she has a governor and an upper house and a lower house of legislature and she is somewhat fantastic in the use of these constitutional powers for she calls on them to sit now in one town and now in another  providence is the capital of the state but the rhode island parliament sits sometimes at providence and sometimes at newport  at stated times also it has to collect itself at bristol and at other stated times at kingston and at others at east greenwich  of all legislative assemblies it is the most peripatetic  universal suffrage does not absolutely prevail in this state a certain property qualification being necessary to confer a right to vote even for the state representatives  i should think it would be well for all parties if the whole state could be swallowed up by massachusetts or by connecticut either of which lie conveniently for the feat but i presume that any suggestion of such a nature would be regarded as treason by the men of providence plantation  we returned back to boston by attleborough a town at which in ordinary times the whole population is supported by the jewelers trade  it is a place with a specialty upon which specialty it has thriven well and become a town  but the specialty is one ill adapted for times of war and we were assured that the trade was for the present at an end  what man could nowadays buy jewels or even what woman seeing that everything would be required for the war  i do not say that such abstinence from luxury has been begotten altogether by a feeling of patriotism  the direct taxes which all americans will now be called on to pay have had and will have much to do with such abstinence  in the mean time the poor jewelers of attleborough have gone altogether to the wall    chapter iii  maine new hampshire and vermont   perhaps i ought to assume that all the world in england knows that that portion of the united states called new england consists of the six states of maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut and rhode island  this is especially the land of yankees and none can properly be called yankees but those who belong to new england  i have named the states as nearly as may be in order from the north downward  of rhode island the smallest state in the union i have already said what little i have to say of these six states boston may be called the capital  not that it is so in any civil or political sense it is simply the capital of massachusetts  but as it is the athens of the western world as it was the cradle of american freedom as everybody of course knows that into boston harbor was thrown the tea which george iii would tax and that at boston on account of that and similar taxes sprang up the new revolution and as it has grown in wealth and fame and size beyond other towns in new england it may be allowed to us to regard it as the capital of these six northern states without guilt of lese majeste toward the other five  to me i confess this northern division of our onceunruly colonies is and always has been the dearest  i am no puritan myself and fancy that had i lived in the days of the puritans i should have been antipuritan to the full extent of my capabilities  but i should have been so through ignorance and prejudice and actuated by that love of existing rights and wrongs which men call loyalty  if the canadas were to rebel now i should be for putting down the canadians with a strong hand but not the less have i an idea that it will become the canadas to rebel and assert their independence at some future period unless it be conceded to them without such rebellion  who on looking back can now refuse to admire the political aspirations of the english puritans or decline to acknowledge the beauty and fitness of what they did  it was by them that these states of new england were colonized  they came hither stating themselves to be pilgrims and as such they first placed their feet on that hallowed rock at plymouth on the shore of massachusetts  they came here driven by no thirst of conquest by no greed for gold dreaming of no western empire such as cortez had achieved and raleigh had meditated  they desired to earn their bread in the sweat of their brow worshiping god according to their own lights living in harmony under their own laws and feeling that no master could claim a right to put a heel upon their necks and be it remembered that here in england in those days earthly masters were still apt to put their heels on the necks of men  the star chamber was gone but jeffreys had not yet reigned  what earthly aspirations were ever higher than these or more manly and what earthly efforts ever led to grander results  we determined to go to portland in maine from thence to the white mountains in new hampshirethe american alps as they love to call themand then on to quebec and up through the two canadas to niagara and this route we followed  from boston to portland we traveled by railroadthe carriages on which are in america always called cars  and here i beg once for all to enter my protest loudly against the manner in which these conveyances are conducted the one grand faultthere are other smaller faultsbut the one grand fault is that they admit but one class  two reasons for this are given  the first is that the finances of the companies will not admit of a divided accommodation and the second is that the republican nature of the people will not brook a superior or aristocratic classification of traveling  as regards the first i do not in the least believe in it  if a more expensive manner of railway traveling will pay in england it would surely do so here were a better class of carriages organized as large a portion of the population would use them in the united states as in any country in europe  and it seems to be evident that in arranging that there shall be only one rate of traveling the price is enhanced on poor travelers exactly in proportion as it is made cheap to those who are not poor  for the poorer classes traveling in america is by no means cheap the average rate being as far as i can judge fully three halfpence a mile  it is manifest that dearer rates for one class would allow of cheaper rates for the other and that in this manner general traveling would be encouraged and increased  but i do not believe that the question of expenditure has had anything to do with it  i conceive it to be true that the railways are afraid to put themselves at variance with the general feeling of the people  if so the railways may be right  but then on the other band the general feeling of the people must in such case be wrong  such a feeling argues a total mistake as to the nature of that liberty and equality for the security of which the people are so anxious and that mistake the very one which has made shipwreck so many attempts at freedom in other countries  it argues that confusion between social and political equality which has led astray multitudes who have longed for liberty fervently but who have not thought of it carefully  if a firstclass railway carriage should be held as offensive so should a firstclass house or a firstclass horse or a firstclass dinner  but first class houses firstclass horses and firstclass dinners are very rife in america  of course it may be said that the expenditure shown in these lastnamed objects is private expenditure and cannot be controlled and that railway traveling is of a public nature and can be made subject to public opinion  but the fault is in that public opinion which desires to control matters of this nature  such an arrangement partakes of all the vice of a sumptuary law and sumptuary laws are in their very essence mistakes  it is well that a man should always have all for which he is willing to pay  if he desires and obtains more than is good for him the punishment and thus also the preventive will come from other sources  it will be said that the american cars are good enough for all purposes  the seats are not very hard and the room for sitting is sufficient  nevertheless i deny that they are good enough for all purposes  they are very long and to enter them and find a place often requires a struggle and almost a fight  there is rarely any person to tell a stranger which car he should enter  one never meets an uncivil or unruly man but the women of the lower ranks are not courteous  american ladies love to lie at ease in their carriages as thoroughly as do our women in hyde park and to those who are used to such luxury traveling by railroad in their own country must be grievous  i would not wish to be thought a sybarite myself or to be held as complaining because i have been compelled to give up my seat to women with babies and bandboxes who have accepted the courtesy with very scanty grace  i have borne worse things than these and have roughed it much in my days from want of means and other reasons  nor am i yet so old but what i can rough it still  nevertheless i like to see things as well done as is practicable and railway traveling in the states is not well done  i feel bound to say as much as this and now i have said it once for all  few cities or localities for cities have fairer natural advantages than portland and i am bound to say that the people of portland have done much in turning them to account  this town is not the capital of the state in a political point of view augusta which is farther to the north on the kennebec river is the seat of the state government for maine  it is very generally the case that the states do not hold their legislatures and carry on their government at their chief towns  augusta and not portland is the capital of maine  of the state of new york albany is the capital and not the city which bears the states name  and of pennsylvania harrisburg and not philadelphia is the capital  i think the idea has been that oldfashioned notions were bad in that they were old fashioned and that a new people bound by no prejudices might certainly make improvement by choosing for themselves new ways  if so the american politicians have not been the first in the world who have thought that any change must be a change for the better  the assigned reason is the centrical position of the selected political capitals but i have generally found the real commercial capital to be easier of access than the smaller town in which the two legislative houses are obliged to collect themselves  what must be the natural excellence of the harbor of portland will be understood when it is borne in mind that the great eastern can enter it at all times and that it can lay along the wharves at any hour of the tide  the wharves which have been prepared for her and of which i will say a word further byandbyare joined to and in fact are a portion of the station of the grand trunk railway which runs from portland up to canada  so that passengers landing at portland out of a vessel so large even as the great eastern can walk at once on shore and goods can be passed on to the railway without any of the cost of removal  i will not say that there is no other harbor in the world that would allow of this but i do not know any other that would do so  from portland a line of railway called as a whole by the name of the canada grand trunk line runs across the state of maine through the northern parts of new hampshire and vermont to montreal a branch striking from richmond a little within the limits of canada to quebec and down the st lawrence to riviere du loup  the main line is continued from montreal through upper canada to toronto and from thence to detroit in the state of michigan  the total distance thus traversed is in a direct line about 900 miles  from detroit there is railway communications through the immense northwestern states of michigan wisconsin and illinois than which perhaps the surface of the globe affords no finer districts for purposes of agriculture  the produce of the two canadas must be poured forth to the eastern world and the men of the eastern world must throng into these lands by means of this railroad and as at present arranged through the harbor of portland  at present the line has been opened and they who have opened are sorely suffering in pocket for what they have done  the question of the railway is rather one applying to canada than to the state of maine and i will therefore leave it for the present  but the great eastern has never been to portland and as far as i know has no intention of going there  she was i believe built with that object  at any rate it was proclaimed during her building that such was her destiny and the portlanders believed it with a perfect faith  they went to work and built wharves expressly for her two wharves prepared to fit her two gangways or ways of exit and entrance  they built a huge hotel to receive her passengers  they prepared for her advent with a full conviction that a millennium of trade was about to be wafted to their happy port  sir the town has expended two hundred thousand dollars in expectation of that ship and that ship has deceived us  so was the matter spoken of to me by an intelligent portlander  i explained to that intelligent gentleman that two hundred thousand dollars would go a very little way toward making up the loss which the illfortuned vessel had occasioned on the other side of the water  he did not in words express gratification at this information but he looked it  the matter was as it were a partnership without deed of contract between the portlanders and the shareholders of the vessel and the portlanders though they also have suffered their losses have not had the worst of it  but there are still good days in store for the town  though the great eastern has not gone there other ships from europe more profitable if less in size must eventually find their way thither at present the canada line of packets runs to portland only during those months in which it is shut out from the st lawrence and quebec by ice  but the st lawrence and quebec cannot offer the advantages which portland enjoys and that big hotel and those new wharves will not have been built in vain  i have said that a good time is coming but i would by no means wish to signify that the present times in portland are bad  so far from it that i doubt whether i ever saw a town with more evident signs of prosperity  it has about it every mark of ample means and no mark of poverty  it contains about 27000 people and for that population covers a very large space of ground  the streets are broad and well built the main streets not running in those absolutely straight parallels which are so common in american towns and are so distressing to english eyes and english feelings all these except the streets devoted exclusively to business are shaded on both sides by trees generally if i remember rightly by the beautiful american elm whose drooping boughs have all the grace of the willow without its fantastic melancholy  what the poorer streets of portland may be like i cannot say  i saw no poor street  but in no town of 30000 inhabitants did i ever see so many houses which must require an expenditure of from six to eight hundred a year to maintain them  the place too is beautifully situated  it is on a long promontory which takes the shape of a peninsula for the neck which joins it to the mainland is not above half a mile across but though the town thus stands out into the sea it is not exposed and bleak  the harbor again is surrounded by land or so guarded and locked by islands as to form a series of saltwater lakes running round the town  of those islands there are of course three hundred and sixtyfive  travelers who write their travels are constantly called upon to record that number so that it may now be considered as a superlative in local phraseology signifying a very great many indeed  the town stands between two hills the suburbs or outskirts running up on to each of them  the one looking out toward the sea is called mountjoy though the obstinate americans will write it munjoy on their maps  from thence the view out to the harbor and beyond the harbor to the islands is i may not say unequaled or i shall be guilty of running into superlatives myself but it is in its way equal to anything i have seen  perhaps it is more like cork harbor as seen from certain heights over passage than anything else i can remember but portland harbor though equally landlocked is larger and then from portland harbor there is as it were a river outlet running through delicious islands most unalluring to the navigator but delicious to the eyes of an uncommercial traveler  there are in all four outlets to the sea one of which appears to have been made expressly for the great eastern  then there is the hill looking inward  if it has a name i forget it  the view from this hill is also over the water on each side and though not so extensive is perhaps as pleasing as the other  the ways of the people seemed to be quiet smooth orderly and republican  there is nothing to drink in portland of course for thanks to mr neal dow the father matthew of the state of maine the maine liquor law is still in force in that state  there is nothing to drink i should say in such orderly houses as that i selected  people do drink some in the town they say said my hostess to me and liquor is to be got  but i never venture to sell any  an illnatured person might turn on me and where should i be then  i did not press her and she was good enough to put a bottle of porter at my right hand at dinner for which i observed she made no charge  but they advertise beer in the shop windows i said to a man who was driving mescotch ale and bitter beer  a man can get drunk on them  waal yes  if he goes to work hard and drinks a bucketful said the driver perhaps he may  from which and other things i gathered that the men of maine drank pottle deep before mr neal dow brought his exertions to a successful termination  the maine liquor law still stands in maine and is the law of the land throughout new england but it is not actually put in force in the other states  by this law no man may retail wine spirits or in truth beer except with a special license which is given only to those who are presumed to sell them as medicines  a man may have what he likes in his own cellar for his own usesuch at least is the actual working of the lawbut may not obtain it at hotels and public houses  this law like all sumptuary laws must fail  and it is fast failing even in maine  but it did appear to me from such information as i could collect that the passing of it had done much to hinder and repress a habit of hard drinking which was becoming terribly common not only in the towns of maine but among the farmers and hired laborers in the country  but if the men and women of portland may not drink they may eat and it is a place i should say in which good living on that side of the question is very rife  it has an air of supreme plenty as though the agonies of an empty stomach were never known there  the faces of the people tell of three regular meals of meat a day and of digestive powers in proportion  o happy portlanders if they only knew their own good fortune  they get up early and go to bed early  the women are comely and sturdy able to take care of themselves without any fallal of chivalry and the men are sedate obliging and industrious  i saw the young girls in the streets coming home from their tea parties at nine oclock many of them alone and all with some basket in their hands which betokened an evening not passed absolutely in idleness  no fear there of unruly questions on the way or of insolence from the ill conducted of the other sex  all was or seemed to be orderly sleek and unobtrusive  probably of all modes of life that are allotted to man by his creator life such as this is the most happy  one hint however for improvement i must give even to portland it would be well if they could make their streets of some material harder than sand  i must not leave the town without desiring those who may visit it to mount the observatory  they will from thence get the best view of the harbor and of the surrounding land and if they chance to do so under the reign of the present keeper of the signals they will find a man there able and willing to tell them everything needful about the state of maine in general and the harbor in particular  he will come out in his shirt sleeves and like a true american will not at first be very smooth in his courtesy but he will wax brighter in conversation and if not stroked the wrong way will turn out to be an uncommonly pleasant fellow  such i believe to be the case with most of them  from portland we made our way up to the white mountains which lay on our route to canada  now i would ask any of my readers who are candid enough to expose their own ignorance whether they ever heard or at any rate whether they know anything of the white mountains  as regards myself i confess that the name had reached my ears that i had an indefinite idea that they formed an intermediate stage between the rocky mountains and the alleghanies and that they were inhabited either by mormons indians or simply by black bears  that there was a district in new england containing mountain scenery superior to much that is yearly crowded by tourists in europe that this is to be reached with ease by railways and stagecoaches and that it is dotted with huge hotels almost as thickly as they lie in switzerland i had no idea  much of this scenery i say is superior to the famed and classic lands of europe  i know nothing for instance on the rhine equal to the view from mount willard down the mountain pass called the notch  let the visitor of these regions be as late in the year as he can taking care that he is not so late as to find the hotels closed october no doubt is the most beautiful month among these mountains but according to the present arrangement of matters here the hotels are shut up by the end of september  with us august september and october are the holiday months whereas our rebel children across the atlantic love to disport themselves in july and august  the great beauty of the autumn or fall is in the brilliant hues which are then taken by the foliage  the autumnal tints are fine with us  they are lovely and bright wherever foliage and vegetation form a part of the beauty of scenery  but in no other land do they approach the brilliancy of the fall in america  the bright rose color the rich bronze which is almost purple in its richness and the glorious golden yellows must be seen to be understood  by me at any rate they cannot be described  they begin to show themselves in september and perhaps i might name the latter half of that month as the best time for visiting the white mountains  i am not going to write a guide book feeling sure that mr murray will do new england and canada including niagara and the hudson river with a peep into boston and new york before many more seasons have passed by  but i cannot forbear to tell my countrymen that any enterprising individual with a hundred pounds to spend on his holidaya hundred and twenty would make him more comfortable in regard to wine washing and other luxuriesand an absence of two months from his labors may see as much and do as much here for the money as he can see or do elsewhere  in some respects he may do more for he will learn more of american nature in such a journey than he can ever learn of the nature of frenchmen or americans by such an excursion among them  some three weeks of the time or perhaps a day or two over he must be at sea and that portion of his trip will cost him fifty pounds presuming that he chooses to go in the most comfortable and costly way but his time on board ship will not be lost  he will learn to know much of americans there and will perhaps form acquaintances of which he will not altogether lose sight for many a year  he will land at boston and staying a day or two there will visit cambridge lowell and bunker hill and if he be that way given will remember that here live and occasionally are to be seen alive men such as longfellow emerson hawthorne and a host of others whose names and fames have made boston the throne of western literature he will then if he take my advice and follow my track go by portland up into the white mountains  at gorham a station on the grand trunk line he will find a hotel as good as any of its kind and from thence he will take a light wagon so called in these countries  and here let me presume that the traveler is not alone he has his wife or friend or perhaps a pair of sisters and in his wagon he will go up through primeval forests to the glen house when there he will ascend mount washington on a pony  that is de rigueur and i do not therefore dare to recommend him to omit the ascent  i did not gain much myself by my labor  he will not stay at the glen house but will go on tojacksons i think they call the next hotel at which he will sleep  from thence he will take his wagon on through the notch to the crawford house sleeping there again and when here let him of all things remember to go up mount willard  it is but a walk of two hours up and down if so much  when reaching the top he will be startled to find that he looks down into the ravine without an inch of foreground  he will come out suddenly on a ledge of rock from whence as it seems he might leap down at once into the valley below  then going on from the crawford house he will be driven through the woods of cherry mount passing i fear without toll of custom the house of my excellent friend mr plaistead who keeps a hotel at jefferson sir said mr plaistead i have everything here that a man ought to want air sir that aint to be got better nowhere trout chickens beef mutton milkand all for a dollar a day  atop of that hill sir theres a view that aint to be beaten this side of the atlantic or i believe the other  and an echo sirweve an echo that comes back to us six times sir floating on the light wind and wafted about from rock to rock till you would think the angels were talking to you  if i could raise that echo sir every day at command id give a thousand dollars for it  it would be worth all the money to a house like this  and he waved his hand about from hill to hill pointing out in graceful curves the lines which the sounds would take  had destiny not called on mr plaistead to keep an american hotel he might have been a poet  my traveler however unless time were plenty with him would pass mr plaistead merely lighting a friendly cigar or perhaps breaking the maine liquor law if the weather be warm and would return to gorham on the railway  all this mountain district is in new hampshire and presuming him to be capable of going about the world with his mouth ears and eyes open he would learn much of the way in which men are settling themselves in this still sparselypopulated country  here young farmers go into the woods as they are doing far down west in the territories and buying some hundred acres at perhaps six shillings an acre fell and burn the trees and build their huts and take the first steps as far as mans work is concerned toward accomplishing the will of the creator in those regions  for such pioneers of civilization there is still ample room even in the longsettled states of new hampshire and vermont  but to return to my traveler whom having brought so far i must send on  let him go on from gorham to quebec and the heights of abraham stopping at sherbrooke that he might visit from thence the lake of memphra magog  as to the manner of traveling over this ground i shall say a little in the next chapter when i come to the progress of myself and my wife  from quebec he will go up the st lawrence to montreal  he will visit ottawa the new capital and toronto  he will cross the lake to niagara resting probably at the clifton house on the canada side  he will then pass on to albany taking the trenton falls on his way  from albany he will go down the hudson to west point  he cannot stop at the catskill mountains for the hotel will be closed  and then he will take the river boat and in a few hours will find himself at new york  if he desires to go into american city society he will find new york agreeable but in that case he must exceed his two months  if he do not so desire a short sojourn at new york will show him all that there is to be seen and all that there is not to be seen in that great city  that the cunard line of steamers will bring him safely back to liverpool in about eleven days i need not tell to any englishman or as i believe to any american  so much in the spirit of a guide i vouchsafe to all who are willing to take my counselthereby anticipating murray and leaving these few pages as a legacy to him or to his collaborateurs  i cannot say that i like the hotels in those parts or indeed the mode of life at american hotels in general  in order that i may not unjustly defame them i will commence these observations by declaring that they are cheap to those who choose to practice the economy which they encourage that the viands are profuse in quantity and wholesome in quality that the attendance is quick and unsparing and that travelers are never annoyed by that grasping greedy hunger and thirst after francs and shillings which disgrace in europe many english and many continental inns  all this is as must be admitted great praise and yet i do not like the american hotels  one is in a free country and has come from a country in which one has been brought up to hug ones chainsso at least the english traveler is constantly assuredand yet in an american inn one can never do as one likes  a terrific gong sounds early in the morning breaking ones sweet slumbers and then a second gong sounding some thirty minutes later makes you understand that you must proceed to breakfast whether you be dressed or no  you certainly can go on with your toilet and obtain your meal after half an hours delay  nobody actually scolds you for so doing but the breakfast is as they say in this country through  you sit down alone and the attendant stands immediately over you probably there are two so standing  they fill your cup the instant it is empty  they tender you fresh food before that which has disappeared from your plate has been swallowed  they begrudge you no amount that you can eat or drink but they begrudge you a single moment that you sit there neither eating nor drinking  this is your fate if youre too late and therefore as a rule you are not late  in that case you form one of a long row of eaters who proceed through their work with a solid energy that is past all praise  it is wrong to say that americans will not talk at their meals  i never met but few who would not talk to me at any rate till i got to the far west but i have rarely found that they would address me first  then the dinner comes earlyat least it always does so in new englandand the ceremony is much of the same kind you came there to eat and the food is pressed upon you ad nauseam but as far as one can see there is no drinking  in these days i am quite aware that drinking has become improper even in england we are apt at home to speak of wine as a thing tabooed wondering how our fathers lived and swilled  i believe that as a fact we drink as much as they did but nevertheless that is our theory i confess however that i like wine  it is very wicked but it seems to me that my dinner goes down better with a glass of sherry than without it  as a rule i always did get it at hotels in america  but i had no comfort with it  sherry they do not understand at all  of course i am only speaking of hotels  their claret they get exclusively from mr gladstone and looking at the quality have a right to quarrel even with mr gladstones price but it is not the quality of the wine that i hereby intend to subject to ignominy so much as the want of any opportunity for drinking it  after dinner if all that i hear be true the gentlemen occasionally drop into the hotel bar and liquor up  or rather this is not done specially after dinner but without prejudice to the hour at any time that may be found desirable  i also have liquored up but i cannot say that i enjoy the process i do not intend hereby to accuse americans of drinking much but i maintain that what they do drink they drink in the most uncomfortable manner that the imagination can devise  the greatest luxury at an english inn is ones tea ones fire and ones book  such an arrangement is not practicable at an american hotel  tea like breakfast is a great meal at which meat should be eaten generally with the addition of much jelly jam and sweet preserve but no person delays over his teacup  i love to have my teacup emptied and filled with gradual pauses so that time for oblivion may accrue and no exact record be taken  no such meal is known at american hotels  it is possible to hire a separate room and have ones meals served in it but in doing so a man runs counter to all the institutions of the country and a woman does so equally  a stranger does not wish to be viewed askance by all around him and the rule which holds that men at rome should do as romans do if true anywhere is true in america  therefore i say that in an american inn one can never do as one pleases  in what i have here said i do not intend to speak of hotels in the largest cities such as boston or new york  at them meals are served in the public room separately and pretty nearly at any or at all hours of the day but at them also the attendant stands over the unfortunate eater and drives him  the guest feels that he is controlled by laws adapted to the usages of the medes and persians he is not the master on the occasion but the slavea slave well treated and fattened up to the full endurance of humanity but yet a slave  from gorham we went on to island pond a station on the same canada trunk railway on a saturday evening and were forced by the circumstances of the line to pass a melancholy sunday at the place the cars do not run on sundays and run but once a day on other days over the whole line so that in fact the impediment to traveling spreads over two days  island pond is a lake with an island in it and the place which has taken the name is a small village about ten years old standing in the midst of uncut forests and has been created by the railway  in ten years more there will no doubt be a spreading town at island pond the forests will recede and men rushing out from the crowded cities will find here food and space and wealth  for myself i never remain long in such a spot without feeling thankful that it has not been my mission to be a pioneer of civilization  the farther that i got away from boston the less strong did i find the feeling of anger against england  there as i have said before there was a bitter animosity against the mother country in that she had shown no open sympathy with the north  in maine and new hampshire i did not find this to be the case to any violent degree  men spoke of the war as openly as they did at boston and in speaking to me generally connected england with the subject but they did so simply to ask questions as to englands policy what will she do for cotton when her operatives are really pressed will she break the blockade  will she insist on a right to trade with charleston and new orleans  i always answered that she would insist on no such right if that right were denied to others and the denial enforced  england i took upon myself to say would not break a veritable blockade let her be driven to what shifts she might in providing for her operatives  ah thats what we fear a very stanch patriot said to me if words may be taken as a proof of stauchness  if england allies herself with the southerners all our trouble is for nothing  it was impossible not to feel that all that was said was complimentary to england  it is her sympathy that the northern men desire to her cooperation that they would willingly trust on her honesty that they would choose to depend  it is the same feeling whether it shows itself in anger or in curiosity  an american whether he be embarked in politics in literature or in commerce desires english admiration english appreciation of his energy and english encouragement  the anger of boston is but a sign of its affectionate friendliness  what feeling is so hot as that of a friend when his dearest friend refuses to share his quarrel or to sympathize in his wrongs  to my thinking the men of boston are wrong and unreasonable in their anger but were i a man of boston i should be as wrong and as unreasonable as any of them  all that however will come right i will not believe it possible that there should in very truth be a quarrel between england and the northern states  in the guidance of those who are not quite au fait at the details of american government i will here in a few words describe the outlines of state government as it is arranged in new hampshire the states in this respect are not all alike the modes of election of their officers and periods of service being different  even the franchise is different in different states universal suffrage is not the rule throughout the united states though it is i believe very generally thought in england that such is the fact  i need hardly say that the laws in the different states may be as various as the different legislatures may choose to make them  in new hampshire universal suffrage does prevail which means that any man may vote who lives in the state supports himself and assists to support the poor by means of poor rates  a governor of the state is elected for one year only but it is customary or at any rate not uncustomary to reelect him for a second year  his salary is a thousand dollars a year or two hundred pounds  it must be presumed therefore that glory and not money is his object  to him is appended a council by whose opinions he must in a great degree be guided  his functions are to the state what those of the president are to the country and for the short period of his reign he is as it were a prime minister of the state with certain very limited regal attributes  he however by no means enjoys the regal attribute of doing no wrong  in every state there is an assembly consisting of two houses of elected representativesthe senate or upper house and the house of representatives so called  in new hampshire this assembly or parliament is styled the general court of new hampshire  it sits annually whereas the legislature in many states sits only every other year  both houses are reelected every year  this assembly passes laws with all the power vested in our parliament but such laws apply of course only to the state in question  the governor of the state has a veto on all bills passed by the two houses but after receipt of his veto any bill so stopped by the governor can be passed by a majority of twothirds in each house  the general court usually sits for about ten weeks  there are in the state eight judgesthree supreme who sit at concord the capital as a court of appeal both in civil and criminal matters and then five lesser judges who go circuit through the state  the salaries of these lesser judges do not exceed from 250 pounds to 300 pounds a year but they are i believe allowed to practice as lawyers in any counties except those in which they sit as judgesbeing guided in this respect by the same law as that which regulates the work of assistant barristers in ireland  the assistant barristers in ireland are attached to the counties as judges at quarter sessions but they practice or may practice as advocates in all counties except that to which they are so attached  the judges in new hampshire are appointed by the governor with the assistance of his council  no judge in new hampshire can hold his seat after he has reached seventy years of age  so much at the present moment with reference to the government of new hampshire    chapter iv  lower canada   the grand trunk railway runs directly from portland to montreal which latter town is in fact the capital of canada though it never has been so exclusively and as it seems never is to be so as regards authority government and official name  in such matters authority and government often say one thing while commerce says another but commerce always has the best of it and wins the game whatever government may decree  albany in this way is the capital of the state of new york as authorized by the state government but new york has made herself the capital of america and will remain so  so also montreal has made herself the capital of canada  the grand trunk railway runs from portland to montreal but there is a branch from richmond a township within the limits of canada to quebec so that travelers to quebec as we were are not obliged to reach that place via montreal  quebec is the present seat of canadian government its turn for that honor having come round some two years ago but it is about to be deserted in favor of ottawa a town which is in fact still to be built on the river of that name  the public edifices are however in a state of forwardness and if all goes well the governor the two councils and the house of representatives will be there before two years are over whether there be any town to receive them or no  who can think of ottawa without bidding his brothers to row and reminding them that the stream runs fast that the rapids are near and the daylight past  i asked as a matter of course whether quebec was much disgusted at the proposed change and i was told that the feeling was not now very strong  had it been determined to make montreal the permanent seat of government quebec and toronto would both have been up in arms  i must confess that in going from the states into canada an englishman is struck by the feeling that he is going from a richer country into one that is poorer and from a greater country into one that is less  an englishman going from a foreign land into a land which is in one sense his own of course finds much in the change to gratify him  he is able to speak as the master instead of speaking as the visitor  his tongue becomes more free and he is able to fall back to his national habits and national expressions  he no longer feels that he is admitted on sufferance or that he must be careful to respect laws which he does not quite understand  this feeling was naturally strong in an englishman in passing from the states into canada at the time of my visit english policy at that moment was violently abused by americans and was upheld as violently in canada  but nevertheless with all this i could not enter canada without seeing and hearing and feeling that there was less of enterprise around me there than in the states less of general movement and less of commercial success  to say why this is so would require a long and very difficult discussion and one which i am not prepared to hold  it may be that a dependent country let the feeling of dependence be ever so much modified by powers of selfgovernance cannot hold its own against countries which are in all respects their own masters few i believe would now maintain that the northern states of america would have risen in commerce as they have risen had they still remained attached to england as colonies  if this be so that privilege of selfrule which they have acquired has been the cause of their success  it does not follow as a consequence that the canadas fighting their battle alone in the world could do as the states have done  climate or size or geographical position might stand in their way  but i fear that it does follow if not as a logical conclusion at least as a natural result that they never will do so well unless some day they shall so fight their battle  it may be argued that canada has in fact the power of selfgovernance that she rules herself and makes her own laws as england does that the sovereign of england has but a veto on those laws and stands in regard to canada exactly as she does in regard to england  this is so i believe by the letter of the constitution but is not so in reality and cannot in truth be so in any colony even of great britain  in england the political power of the crown is nothing  the crown has no such power and nowadays makes no attempt at having any  but the political power of the crown as it is felt in canada is everything  the crown has no such power in england because it must change its ministers whenever called upon to do so by the house of commons  but the colonial minister in downing street is the crowns prime minister as regards the colonies and he is changed not as any colonial house of assembly may wish but in accordance with the will of the british commons  both the houses in canadathat namely of the representatives or lower houses and of the legislative council or upper houseare now elective and are filled without direct influence from the crown  the power of selfgovernment is as thoroughly developed as perhaps may be possible in a colony  but after all it is a dependent form of government and as such may perhaps not conduce to so thorough a development of the resources of the country as might be achieve under a ruling power of its own to which the welfare of canada itself would be the chief if not the only object  i beg that it may not be considered from this that i would propose to canada to set up for itself at once and declare itself independent  in the first place i do not wish to throw over canada and in the next place i do not wish to throw over england if such a separation shall ever take place i trust that it may be caused not by canadian violence but by british generosity  such a separation however never can be good till canada herself shall wish it  that she does not wish it yet is certain  if canada ever should wish it and should ever press for the accomplishment of such a wish she must do so in connection with nova scotia and new brunswick  if at any future time there be formed such a separate political power it must include the whole of british north america  in the mean time i return to my assertion that in entering canada from the states one clearly comes from a richer to a poorer country  when i have said so i have heard no canadian absolutely deny it though in refraining from denying it they have usually expressed a general conviction that in settling himself for life it is better for a man to set up his staff in canada than in the states  i do not know that we are richer a canadian says but on the whole we are doing better and are happier  now i regard the golden rules against the love of gold the aurum irrepertum et sic melius situm and the rest of it as very excellent when applied to individuals  such teaching has not much effect perhaps in inducing men to abstain from wealth but such effect as it may have will be good  men and women do i suppose learn to be happier when they learn to disregard riches  but such a doctrine is absolutely false as regards a nation  national wealth produces education and progress and through them produces plenty of food good morals and all else that is good  it produces luxury also and certain evils attendant on luxury  but i think it may be clearly shown and that it is universally acknowledged that national wealth produces individual wellbeing  if this be so the argument of my friend the canadian is naught  to the feeling of a refined gentleman or of a lady whose eye loves to rest always on the beautiful an agricultural population that touches its hat eats plain victuals and goes to church is more picturesque and delightful than the thronged crowd of a great city by which a lady and gentleman is hustled without remorse which never touches its hat and perhaps also never goes to church  and as we are always tempted to approve of that which we like and to think that that which is good to us is good altogether wethe refined gentlemen and ladies of england i meanare very apt to prefer the hat touchers to those who are not hat touchers  in doing so we intend and wish and strive to be philanthropical  we argue to ourselves that the dear excellent lower classes receive an immense amount of consoling happiness from that ceremony of hat touching and quite pity those who unfortunately for themselves know nothing about it  i would ask any such lady or gentleman whether he or she does not feel a certain amount of commiseration for the rudeness of the townbred artisan who walks about with his hands in his pockets as though he recognized a superior in no one  but that which is good and pleasant to us is often not good and pleasant altogether  every mans chief object is himself and the philanthropist should endeavor to regard this question not from his own point of view but from that which would be taken by the individuals for whose happiness he is anxious  the honest happy rustic makes a very pretty picture and i hope that honest rustics are happy  but the man who earns two shillings a day in the country would always prefer to earn five in the town  the man who finds himself bound to touch his hat to the squire would be glad to dispense with that ceremony if circumstances would permit  a crowd of greasycoated town artisans with grimy hands and pale faces is not in itself delectable but each of that crowd has probably more of the goods of life than any rural laborer  he thinks more reads more feels more sees more hears more learns more and lives more  it is through great cities that the civilization of the world has progressed and the charms of life been advanced  man in his rudest state begins in the country and in his most finished state may retire there  but the battle of the world has to be fought in the cities and the country that shows the greatest city population is ever the one that is going most ahead in the worlds history  if this be so i say that the argument of my canadian friend was naught  it may be that he does not desire crowded cities with dirty independent artisans that to view small farmers living sparingly but with content on the sweat of their brows are surer signs of a countrys prosperity than hives of men and smoking chimneys  he has probably all the upper classes of england with him in so thinking and as far as i know the upper classes of all europe  but the crowds themselves the thick masses of which are composed those populations which we count by millions are against him  up in those regions which are watered by the great lakes lake michigan lake huron lake erie lake ontarioand by the st lawrence the country is divided between canada and the states the cities in canada were settled long before those in the states quebec and montreal were important cities before any of the towns belonging to the states had been founded  but taking the population of three of each including the three largest canadian towns we find they are as follows in canada quebec has 60000 montreal 85000 toronto 55000  in the states chicago has 120000 detroit 70000 and buffalo 80000  if the population had been equal it would have shown a great superiority in the progress of those belonging to the states because the towns of canada had so great a start  but the numbers are by no means equal showing instead a vast preponderance in favor of the states there can be no stronger proof that the states are advancing faster than canada and in fact doing better than canada  quebec is a very picturesque town from its natural advantages almost as much so as any town i know  edinburgh perhaps and innspruck may beat it  but quebec has very little to recommend it beyond the beauty of its situation  its public buildings and works of art do not deserve a long narrative  it stands at the confluence of the st lawrence and st charles rivers the best part of the town is built high upon the rockthe rock which forms the celebrated plains of abram and the view from thence down to the mountains which shut in the st lawrence is magnificent  the best point of view is i think from the esplanade which is distant some five minutes walk from the hotels  when that has been seen by the light of the setting sun and seen again if possible by moonlight the most considerable lion of quebec may be regarded as done and may be ticked off from the list  the most considerable lion according to my taste  lions which roar merely by the force of association of ideas are not to me very valuable beasts  to many the rock over which wolfe climbed to the plains of abram and on the summit of which he fell in the hour of victory gives to quebec its chiefest charm  but i confess to being somewhat dull in such matters  i can count up wolfe and realize his glory and put my hand as it were upon his monument in my own room at home as well as i can at quebec  i do not say this boastingly or with pride but truly acknowledging a deficiency  i have never cared to sit in chairs in which old kings have sat or to have their crowns upon my head  nevertheless and as a matter of course i went to see the rock and can only say as so many have said before me that it is very steep  it is not a rock which i think it would be difficult for any ordinarily active man to climb providing of course that he was used to such work  but wolfe took regiments of men up there at night and that in face of enemies who held the summits  one grieves that he should have fallen there and have never tasted the sweet cup of his own fame  for fame is sweet and the praise of oness brother men the sweetest draught which a man can drain  but now and for coming ages wolfes name stands higher than it probably would have done had he lived to enjoy his reward  but there is another very worthy lion near quebecthe falls namely of montmorency  they are eight miles from the town and the road lies through the suburb of st roch and the long straggling french village of beauport  these are in themselves very interesting as showing the quiet orderly unimpulsive manner in which the french canadians live  such is their character although there have been such men as papineau and although there have been times in which english rule has been unpopular with the french settlers  as far as i could learn there is no such feeling now  these people are quiet contented and as regards a sufficiency of the simple staples of living sufficiently well to do  they are thrifty but they do not thrive  they do not advance and push ahead and become a bigger people from year to year as settlers in a new country should do  they do not even hold their own in comparison with those around them  but has not this always been the case with colonists out of france and has it not always been the case with roman catholics when they have been forced to measure themselves against protestants  as to the ultimate fate in the world of this people one can hardly form a speculation  there are as nearly as i could learn about 800000 of them in lower canada but it seems that the wealth and commercial enterprise of the country is passing out of their hands montreal and even quebec are i think becoming less and less french every day but in the villages and on the small farms the french still remain keeping up their language their habits and their religion  in the cities they are becoming hewers of wood and drawers of water  i am inclined to think that the same will ultimately be their fate in the country  surely one may declare as a fact that a roman catholic population can never hold its ground against one that is protestant  i do not speak of numbers for the roman catholics will increase and multiply and stick by their religion although their religion entails poverty and dependence as they have done and still do in ireland  but in progress and wealth the romanists have always gone to the wall when the two have been made to compete together  and yet i love their religion there is something beautiful and almost divine in the faith and obedience of a true son of the holy mother  i sometimes fancy that i would fain be a roman catholicif i could as also i would often wish to be still a childif that were possible  all this is on the way to the falls of montmorency  these falls are placed exactly at the mouth of the little river of the same name so that it may be said absolutely to fall into the st lawrence  the people of the country however declare that the river into which the waters of the montmorency fall is not the st lawrence but the charles  without a map i do not know that i can explain this  the river charles appears to and in fact does run into the st lawrence just below quebec  but the waters do not mix  the thicker browner stream of the lesser river still keeps the northeastern bank till it comes to the island of orleans which lies in the river five or six miles below quebec  here or hereabouts are the falls of the montmorency and then the great river is divided for twentyfive miles by the isle of orleans  it is said that the waters of the charles and the st lawrence do not mix till they meet each other at the foot of this island  i do not know that i am particularly happy at describing a waterfall and what little capacity i may have in this way i would wish to keep for niagara  one thing i can say very positively about montmorency and one piece of advice i can give to those who visit the falls  the place from which to see them is not the horrible little wooden temple which has been built immediately over them on that side which lies nearest to quebec  the stranger is put down at a gate through which a path leads to this temple and at which a woman demands from him twentyfive cents for the privilege of entrance  let him by all means pay the twentyfive cents  why should he attempt to see the falls for nothing seeing that this woman has a vested interest in the showing of them  i declare that if i thought that i should hinder this woman from her perquisites by what i write i would leave it unwritten and let my readers pursue their course to the templeto their manifest injury  but they will pay the twentyfive cents  then let them cross over the bridge eschewing the temple and wander round on the open field till they get the view of the falls and the view of quebec also from the other side  it is worth the twentyfive cents and the hire of the carriage also  immediately over the falls there was a suspension bridge of which the supporting or rather nonsupporting pillars are still to be seen  but the bridge fell down one day into the river andalas alaswith the bridge fell down an old woman and a boy and a carta cart and horseand all found a watery grave together in the spray  no attempt has been made since that to renew the suspension bridge but the present wooden bridge has been built higher up in lieu of it  strangers naturally visit quebec in summer or autumn seeing that a canada winter is a season with which a man cannot trifle but i imagine that the midwinter is the best time for seeing the falls of montmorency  the water in its fall is dashed into spray and that spray becomes frozen till a cone of ice is formed immediately under the cataract which gradually rises till the temporary glacier reaches nearly half way to the level of the higher river up this men climband ladies also i am toldand then descend with pleasant rapidity on sledges of wood sometimes not without an innocent tumble in the descent  as we were at quebec in september we did not experience the delights of this pastime  as i was too early for the ice cone under the montmorency falls so also was i too late to visit the saguenay river which runs into the st lawrence some hundred miles below quebec  i presume that the scenery of the saguenay is the finest in canada  during the summer steamers run down the st lawrence and up the saguenay but i was too late for them  an offer was made to us through the kindness of sir edmund head who was then the governorgeneral of the use of a steamtug belonging to a gentleman who carries on a large commercial enterprise at chicoutimi far up the saguenay but an acceptance of this offer would have entailed some delay at quebec and as we were anxious to get into the northwestern states before the winter commenced we were obliged with great regret to decline the journey  i feel bound to say that a stranger regarding quebec merely as a town finds very much of which he cannot but complain  the footpaths through the streets are almost entirely of wood as indeed seems to be general throughout canada  wood is of course the cheapest material and though it may not be altogether good for such a purpose it would not create animadversion if it were kept in tolerable order  but in quebec the paths are intolerably bad  they are full of holes  the boards are rotten and worn in some places to dirt  the nails have gone and the broken planks go up and down under the feet and in the dark they are absolutely dangerous  but if the paths are bad the roadways are worse  the street through the lower town along the quays is i think the most disgraceful thoroughfare i ever saw in any town  i believe the whole of it or at any rate a great portion has been paved with wood but the boards have been worked into mud and the ground under the boards has been worked into holes till the street is more like the bottom of a filthy ditch than a roadway through one of the most thickly populated parts of a city  had quebec in wolfes time been as it is now wolfe would have stuck in the mud between the river and the rock before he reached the point which he desired to climb  in the upper town the roads are not as bad as they are below but still they are very bad  i was told that this arose from disputes among the municipal corporations  everything in canada relating to roads and a very great deal affecting the internal government of the people is done by these municipalities it is made a subject of great boast in canada that the communal authorities do carry on so large a part of the public business and that they do it generally so well and at so cheap a rate  i have nothing to say against this and as a whole believe that the boast is true  i must protest however that the streets of the greater citiesfor montreal is nearly as bad as quebecprove the rule by a very sad exception  the municipalities of which i speak extend i believe to all canadathe two provinces being divided into counties and the counties subdivided into townships to which as a matter of course the municipalities are attached  from quebec to montreal there are two modes of travel  there are the steamers up the st lawrence which as all the world know is or at any rate hitherto has been the highroad of the canadas and there is the grand trunk railway  passengers choosing the latter go toward portland as far as richmond and there join the main line of the road passing from richmond on to montreal  we learned while at quebec that it behooved us not to leave the colony till we had seen the lake and mountains of memphremagog and as we were clearly neglecting our duty with regard to the saguenay we felt bound to make such amends as lay in our power by deviating from our way to the lake above named  in order to do this we were obliged to choose the railway and to go back beyond richmond to the station at sherbrooke  sherbrooke is a large village on the confines of canada and as it is on the railway will no doubt become a large town  it is very prettily situated on the meeting of two rivers it has three or four churches and intends to thrive  it possesses two newspapers of the prosperity of which i should be inclined to feel less assured  the annual subscription to such a newspaper published twice a week is ten shillings  a sale of a thousand copies is not considered bad  such a sale would produce 500 pounds a year and this would if entirely devoted to that purpose give a moderate income to a gentleman qualified to conduct a newspaper  but the paper and printing must cost something and the capital invested should receive its proper remuneration  and thensuch at least is the general ideathe getting together of news and the framing of intelligence is a costly operation  i can only hope that all this is paid for by the advertisements for i must trust that the editors do not receive less than the moderate sum above named  at sherbrooke we are still in lower canada  indeed as regards distance we are when there nearly as far removed from upper canada as at quebec  but the race of people here is very different  the french population had made their way down into these townships before the english and american war broke out but had not done so in great numbers  the country was then very unapproachable being far to the south of the st lawrence and far also fromany great line of internal communication toward the atlantic  but nevertheless many settlers made their way in here from the statesmen who preferred to live under british rule and perhaps doubted the stability of the new order of things  they or their children have remained here since and as the whole country has been opened up by the railway many others have flocked in  thus a better class of people than the french hold possession of the larger farms and are on the whole doing well  i am told that many americans are now coming here driven over the borders from maine new hampshire and vermont by fears of the war and the weight of taxation  i do not think that fears of war or the paying of taxes drive many individuals away from home  men who would be so influenced have not the amount of foresight which would induce them to avoid such evils or at any rate such fears would act slowly  laborers however will go where work is certain where work is well paid and where the wages to be earned will give plenty in return  it may be that work will become scarce in the states as it has done with those poor jewelers at attleborough of whom we spoke and that food will become dear  if this be so laborers from the states will no doubt find their way into canada  from sherbrooke we went with the mails on a pairhorse wagon to magog  crosscountry mails are not interesting to the generality of readers but i have a professional liking for them myself  i have spent the best part of my life in looking after and i hope in improving such mails and i always endeavor to do a stroke of work when i come across them  i learned on this occasion that the conveyance of mails with a pair of horses in canada costs little more than half what is paid for the same work in england with one horse and something less than what is paid in ireland also for one horse  but in canada the average pace is only five miles an hour  in ireland it is seven and the time is accurately kept which does not seem to be the case in canada  in england the pace is eight miles an hour  in canada and in ireland these conveyances carry passengers but in england they are prohibited from doing so in canada the vehicles are much better got up than they are in england and the horses too look better  taking ireland as a whole they are more respectable in appearance there than in england  from all which it appears that pace is the article that costs the highest price and that appearance does not go for much in the bill  in canada the roads are very bad in comparison with the english or irish roads but to make up for this the price of forage is very low  i have said that the crossmail conveyances in canada did not seem to be very closely bound as to time but they are regulated by clockwork in comparison with some of them in the united states are you going this morning i said to a maildriver in vermont i thought you always started in the evening  wall i guess i do but it rained some last night so i jist stayed at home  i do not know that i ever felt more shocked in my life and i could hardly keep my tongue off the man  the mails however would have paid no respect to me in vermont and i was obliged to walk away crestfallen  we went with the mails from sherbrooke to a village called magog at the outlet of the lake and from thence by a steamer up the lake to a solitary hotel called the mountain house which is built at the foot of the mountain on the shore and which is surrounded on every side by thick forest  there is no road within two miles of the house  the lake therefore is the only highway and that is frozen up for four months in the year  when frozen however it is still a road for it is passable for sledges  i have seldom been in a house that seemed so remote from the world and so little within reach of doctors parsons or butchers  bakers in this country are not required as all persons make their own bread  but in spite of its position the hotel is well kept and on the whole we were more comfortable there than at any other inn in lower canada  the mountain house is but five miles from the borders of vermont in which state the head of the lake lies  the steamer which brought us runs on to newport or rather from newport to magog and back again  and newport is in vermont  the one thing to be done at the mountain house is the ascent of the mountain called the owls head  the world there offers nothing else of active enterprise to the traveler unless fishing be considered an active enterprise  i am not capable of fishing therefore we resolved on going up the owls head  to dine in the middle of the day is absolutely imperative at these hotels and thus we were driven to select either the morning or the afternoon evening lights we declared were the best for all views and therefore we decided on the afternoon  it is but two miles but then as we were told more than once by those who had spoken to us on the subject those two miles are not like other miles  i doubt if the lady can do it one man said to me  i asked if ladies did not sometimes go up  yes young women do at times he said after that my wife resolved that she would see the top of the owls head or die in the attempt and so we started  they never think of sending a guide with one in these places whereas in europe a traveler is not allowed to go a step without one  when i asked for one to show us the way up mount washington i was told that there were no idle boys about that place  the path was indicated to us and off we started with high hopes  i have been up many mountains and have climbed some that were perhaps somewhat dangerous in their ascent  in climbing the owls head there is no danger  one is closed in by thick trees the whole way  but i doubt if i ever went up a steeper ascent  it was very hard work but we were not beaten  we reached the top and there sitting down thoroughly enjoyed our victory  it was then half past five oclock and the sun was not yet absolutely sinking  it did not seem to give us any warning that we should especially require its aid and as the prospect below us was very lovely we remained there for a quarter of an hour  the ascent of the owls head is certainly a thing to do and i still think in spite of our following misfortune that it is a thing to do late in the afternoon  the view down upon the lakes and the forests around and on the wooded hills below is wonderfully lovely  i never was on a mountain which gave me a more perfect command of all the country round  but as we arose to descend we saw a little cloud coming toward us from over newport  the little cloud came on with speed and we had hardly freed ourselves from the rocks of the summit before we were surrounded by rain  as the rain became thicker we were surrounded by darkness also or if not by darkness by so dim a light that it became a task to find our path  i still thought that the daylight had not gone and that as we descended and so escaped from the cloud we should find light enough to guide us  but it was not so  the rain soon became a matter of indifference and so also did the mud and briers beneath our feet  even the steepness of the way was almost forgotten as we endeavored to thread our path through the forest before it should become impossible to discern the track  a dog had followed us up and though the beast would not stay with us so as to be our guide he returned ever and anon and made us aware of his presence by dashing by us  i may confess now that i became much frightened  we were wet through and a night out in the forest would have been unpleasant to us  at last i did utterly lose the track it had become quite dark so dark that we could hardly see each other  we had succeeded in getting down the steepest and worst part of the mountain but we were still among dense forest trees and up to our knees in mud  but the people at the mountain house were christians and men with lanterns were sent hallooing after us through the dark night  when we were thus found we were not many yards from the path but unfortunately on the wrong side of a stream  through that we waded and then made our way in safety to the inn  in spite of which misadventure i advise all travelers in lower canada to go up the owls head  on the following day we crossed the lake to georgeville and drove around another lake called the massawhippi back to sherbrooke this was all very well for it showed us a part of the country which is comparatively well tilled and has been long settled but the massawhippi itself is not worth a visit  the route by which we returned occupies a longer time than the other and is more costly as it must be made in a hired vehicle  the people here are quiet orderly and i should say a little slow  it is manifest that a strong feeling against the northern states has lately sprung up this is much to be deprecated but i cannot but say that it is natural  it is not that the canadians have any special secession feelings or that they have entered with peculiar warmth into the questions of american politics but they have been vexed and acerbated by the braggadocio of the northern states  they constantly hear that they are to be invaded and translated into citizens of the union that british rule is to be swept off the continent and that the starspangled banner is to be waved over them in pity  the starspangled banner is in fact a fine flag and has waved to some purpose but those who live near it and not under it fancy that they hear too much of it  at the present moment the loyalty of both the canadas to great britain is beyond all question  from all that i can hear i doubt whether this feeling in the provinces was ever so strong and under such circumstances american abuse of england and american braggadocio is more than usually distasteful  all this abuse and all this braggadocio come to canada from the northern states and therefore the southern cause is at the present moment the more popular with them  i have said that the canadians hereabouts are somewhat slow  as we were driving back to sherbrooke it became necessary that we should rest for an hour or so in the middle of the day and for this purpose we stopped at a village inn  it was a large house in which there appeared to be three public sittingrooms of ample size one of which was occupied as the bar  in this there were congregated some six or seven men seated in armchairs round a stove and among these i placed myself  no one spoke a word either to me or to any one else  no one smoked and no one read nor did they even whittle sticks  i asked a question first of one and then of another and was answered with monosyllables  so i gave up any hope in that direction and sat staring at the big stove in the middle of the room as the others did  presently another stranger entered having arrived in a wagon as i had done  he entered the room and sat down addressing no one and addressed by no one after awhile however he spoke  will there be any chance of dinner here he said  i guess therell be dinner byandby answered the landlord and then there was silence for another ten minutes during which the stranger stared at the stove  is that dinner any way ready he asked again  i guess it is said the landlord  and then the stranger went out to see after his dinner himself  when we started at the end of an hour nobody said anything to us  the driver hitched on the horses as they call it and we started on our way having been charged nothing for our accommodation  that some profit arose from the horse provender is to be hoped  on the following day we reached montreal which as i have said before is the commercial capital of the two provinces  this question of the capitals is at the present moment a subject of great interest in canada but as i shall be driven to say something on the matter when i report myself as being at ottawa i will refrain now  there are two special public affairs at the present moment to interest a traveler in canada  the first i have named and the second is the grand trunk railway  i have already stated what is the course of this line  it runs from the western state of michigan to portland on the atlantic in the state of maine sweeping the whole length of canada in its route  it was originally made by three companies  the atlantic and st lawrence constructed it from portland to island pond on the borders of the states  the st lawrence and atlantic took it from the southeastern side of the river at montreal to the same point viz island pond  and the grand trunk company have made it from detroit to montreal crossing the river there with a stupendous tubular bridge and have also made the branch connecting the main line with quebec and riviere du loup  this latter company is now incorporated with the st lawrence and atlantic but has only leased the portion of the line running through the states  this they have done guaranteeing the shareholders an interest of six per cent  there never was a grander enterprise set on foot  i will not say there never was one more unfortunate for is there not the great eastern which by the weight and constancy of its failures demands for itself a proud preeminence of misfortune but surely the grand trunk comes next to it  i presume it to be quite out of the question that the shareholders should get any interest whatever on their shares for years  the company when i was at montreal had not paid the interest due to the atlantic and st lawrence company for the last year and there was a doubt whether the lease would not be broken  no party that had advanced money to the undertaking was able to recover what had been advanced  i believe that one firm in london had lent nearly a million to the company and is now willing to accept half the sum so lent in quittance of the whole debt  in 1860 the line could not carry the freight that offered not having or being able to obtain the necessary rolling stock and on all sides i heard men discussing whether the line would be kept open for traffic  the government of canada advanced to the company three millions of money with an understanding that neither interest nor principal should be demanded till all other debts were paid and all shareholders in receipt of six per cent  interest  but the three millions were clogged with conditions which though they have been of service to the country have been so expensive to the company that it is hardly more solvent with it than it would have been without it  as it is the whole property seems to be involved in ruin and yet the line is one of the grandest commercial conceptions that was ever carried out on the face of the globe and in the process of a few years will do more to make bread cheap in england than any other single enterprise that exists  i do not know that blame is to be attached to any one  i at least attach no such blame  probably it might be easy now to show that the road might have been made with sufficient accommodation for ordinary purposes without some of the more costly details  the great tubular bridge on which was expended 1300000 pounds might i should think have been dispensed with  the detroit end of the line might have been left for later time  as it stands now however it is a wonderful operation carried to a successful issue as far as the public are concerned and one can only grieve that it should be so absolute a failure to those who have placed their money in it  there are schemes which seem to be too big for men to work out with any ordinary regard to profit and loss  the great eastern is one and this is another  the national advantage arising from such enterprises is immense but the wonder is that men should be found willing to embark their money where the risk is so great and the return even hoped for is so small  while i was in canada some gentlemen were there from the lower provincesnova scotia that is and new brunswickagitating the subject of another great line of railway from quebec to halifax the project is one in favor of which very much may be said  in a national point of view an englishman or a canadian cannot but regret that there should be no winter mode of exit from or entrance to canada except through the united states  the st lawrence is blocked up for four or five months in winter and the steamers which run to quebec in the summer run to portland during the season of ice  there is at present no mode of public conveyance between the canadas and the lower provinces and an immense district of country on the borders of lower canada through new brunswick and into nova scotia is now absolutely closed against civilization which by such a railway would be opened up to the light of day  we all know how much the want of such a road was felt when our troops were being forwarded to canada during the last winter  it was necessary they should reach their destination without delay and as the river was closed and the passing of troops through the states was of course out of the question that long overland journey across nova scotia and new brunswick became a necessity  it would certainly be a very great thing for british interests if a direct line could be made from such a port as halifax a port which is open throughout the whole year up into the canadas  if these colonies belonged to france or to any other despotic government the thing would be done  but the colonies do not belong to any despotic government  such a line would in fact be a continuance of the grand trunk and who that looks at the present state of the finances of the grand trunk can think it to be on the cards that private enterprise should come forward with more moneywith more millions  the idea is that england will advance the money and that the english house of commons will guarantee the interest with some counterguarantee from the colonies that this interest shall be duly paid  but it would seem that if such colonial guarantee is to go for anything the colonies might raise the money in the money market without the intervention of the british house of commons  montreal is an exceedingly good commercial town and business there is brisk  it has now 85000 inhabitants  having said that of it i do not know what more there is left to say  yes one word there is to say of sir william logan the creator of the geological museum there and the head of all matters geological throughout the province  while he was explaining to me with admirable perspicuity the result of investigations into which he had poured his whole heart i stood by understanding almost nothing but envying everything  that i understood almost nothing i know he perceived that ever and anon with all his graciousness became apparent but i wonder whether he perceived also that i did envy everything i have listened to geologists by the hour beforehave had to listen to them desirous simply of escape  i have listened and understood absolutely nothing and have only wished myself away but i could have listened to sir william logan for the whole day if time allowed  i found even in that hour that some ideas found their way through to me and i began to fancy that even i could become a geologist at montreal  over and beyond sir william logan there is at montreal for strangers the drive round the mountain not very exciting and there is the tubular bridge over the st lawrence  this it must be understood is not made in one tube as is that over the menai straits but is divided into i think thirteen tubes  to the eye there appear to be twentyfive tubes but each of the six side tubes is supported by a pier in the middle  a great part of the expense of the bridge was incurred in sinking the shafts for these piers    chapter v  upper canada   ottawa is in upper canada but crossing the suspension bridge from ottawa into hull the traveler is in lower canada  it is therefore exactly in the confines and has been chosen as the site of the new government capital very much for this reason  other reasons have no doubt had a share in the decision  at the time when the choice was made ottawa was not large enough to create the jealousy of the more populous towns  though not on the main line of railway it was connected with it by a branch railway and it is also connected with the st lawrence by water communication  and then it stands nobly on a magnificent river with high overhanging rock and a natural grandeur of position which has perhaps gone far in recommending it to those whose voice in the matter has been potential  having the world of canada from whence to choose the site of a new town the choosers have certainly chosen well  it is another question whether or no a new town should have been deemed necessary  perhaps it may be well to explain the circumstances under which it was thought expedient thus to establish a new canadian capital  in 1841 when lord sydenham was governorgeneral of the provinces the two canadas separate till then were united under one government at that time the people of lower or french canada and the people of upper or english canada differed much more in their habits and language than they do now  i do not know that the english have become in any way gallicized but the french have been very materially anglicized  but while this has been in progress national jealousy has been at work and even yet that national jealousy is not at an end  while the two provinces were divided there were of course two capitals and two seats of government these were at quebec for lower canada and at toronto for upper canada both which towns are centrically situated as regards the respective provinces  when the union was effected it was deemed expedient that there should be but one capital and the small town of kingstown was selected which is situated on the lower end of lake ontario in the upper province  but kingstown was found to be inconvenient lacking space and accommodation for those who had to follow the government and the governor removed it and himself to montreal  montreal is in the lower province but is very central to both the provinces and it is moreover the chief town in canada this would have done very well but for an unforeseen misfortune  it will be remembered by most readers that in 1837 took place the mackenziepapineau rebellion of which those who were then old enough to be politicians heard so much in england  i am not going back to recount the history of the period otherwise than to say that the english canadians at that time in withstanding and combating the rebels did considerable injury to the property of certain french canadians and that when the rebellion had blown over and those in fault had been pardoned a question arose whether or no the government should make good the losses of those french canadians who had been injured  the english canadians protested that it would be monstrous that they should be taxed to repair damages suffered by rebels and made necessary in the suppression of rebellion  the french canadians declared that the rebellion had been only a just assertion of their rights that if there had been crime on the part of those who took up arms that crime had been condoned and that the damages had not fallen exclusively or even chiefly on those who had done so  i will give no opinion on the merits of the question but simply say that blood ran very hot when it was discussed  at last the houses of the provincial parliament then assembled at montreal decreed that the losses should be made good by the public treasury and the english mob in montreal when this decree became known was roused to great wrath by a decision which seemed to be condemnatory of english loyalty  it pelted lord elgin the governorgeneral with rotten eggs and burned down the parliament house  hence there arose not unnaturally a strong feeling of anger on the part of the local government against montreal and moreover there was no longer a house in which the parliament could be held in that town  for these conjoint reasons it was decided to move the seat of government again and it was resolved that the governor and the parliament should sit alternately at toronto in upper canada and at quebec in lower canada remaining four years at each place  they went at first to toronto for two years only having agreed that they should be there on this occasion only for the remainder of the term of the then parliament  after that they were at quebec for four years then at toronto for four and now again are at quebec  but this arrangement has been found very inconvenient  in the first place there is a great national expenditure incurred in moving old records and in keeping double records in moving the library and as i have been informed even the pictures  the government clerks also are called on to move as the government moves and though an allowance is made to them from the national purse to cover their loss the arrangement has nevertheless been felt by them to be a grievance as may be well understood  the accommodation also for the ministers of the government and for members of the two houses has been insufficient  hotels lodgings and furnished houses could not be provided to the extent required seeing that they would be left nearly empty for every alternate space of four years indeed it needs but little argument to prove that the plan adopted must have been a thoroughly uncomfortable plan and the wonder is that it should have been adopted  lower canada had undertaken to make all her leading citizens wretched providing upper canada would treat hers with equal severity  this has now gone on for some twelve years and as the system was found to be an unendurable nuisance it has been at last admitted that some steps must be taken toward selecting one capital for the country  i should here in justice to the canadians state a remark made to me on this matter by one of the present leading politicians of the colony  i cannot think that the migratory scheme was good but he defended it asserting that it had done very much to amalgamate the people of the two provinces that it had brought lower canadians into upper canada and upper canadians into lower canada teaching english to those who spoke only french before and making each pleasantly acquainted with the other  i have no doubt that somethingperhaps muchhas been done in this way but valuable as the result may have been i cannot think it worth the cost of the means employed  the best answer to the above argument consists in the undoubted fact that a migratory government would never have been established for such a reason  it was so established because montreal the central town had given offense and because the jealousy of the provinces against each other would not admit of the government being placed entirely at quebec or entirely at toronto  but it was necessary that some step should be taken and as it was found to be unlikely that any resolution should be reached by the joint provinces themselves it was loyally and wisely determined to refer the matter to the queen  that her majesty has constitutionally the power to call the parliament of canada at any town of canada which she may select admits i conceive of no doubt  it is i imagine within her prerogative to call the parliament of england where she may please within that realm though her lieges would be somewhat startled if it were called otherwhere than in london  it was therefore well done to ask her majesty to act as arbiter in the matter  but there are not wanting those in canada who say that in referring the matter to the queen it was in truth referring it to those by whom very many of the canadians were least willing to be guided in the matter to the governorgeneral namely and the colonial secretary  many indeed in canada now declare that the decision simply placed the matter in the hands of the governorgeneral  be that as it may i do not think that any unbiased traveler will doubt that the best possible selection has been made presuming always as we may presume in the discussion that montreal could not be selected  i take for granted that the rejection of montreal was regarded as a sine qua non in the decision  to me it appears grievous that this should have been so  it is a great thing for any country to have a large leading worldknown city and i think that the government should combine with the commerce of the country in carrying out this object  but commerce can do a great deal more for government than government can do for commerce  government has selected ottawa as the capital of canada but commerce has already made montreal the capital and montreal will be the chief city of canada let government do what it may to foster the other town the idea of spiting a town because there has been a row in it seems to me to be preposterous  the row was not the work of those who have made montreal rich and respectable  montreal is more centrical than ottawanay it is as nearly centrical as any town can be  it is easier to get to montreal from toronto than to ottawa and if from toronto then from all that distant portion of upper canada back of toronto  to all lower canada montreal is as a matter of course much easier of access than ottawa  but having said so much in favor of montreal i will again admit that putting aside montreal the best possible selection has been made  when ottawa was named no time was lost in setting to work to prepare for the new migration  in 1859 the parliament was removed to quebec with the understanding that it should remain there till the new buildings should be completed  these buildings were absolutely commenced in april 1860 and it was and i believe still is expected that they will be completed in 1863  i am now writing in the winter of 1861 and as is necessary in canadian winters the works are suspended  but unfortunately they were suspended in the early part of octoberon the first of october whereas they might have been continued as far as the season is concerned up to the end of november  we reached ottawa on the third of october and more than a thousand men had then been just dismissed  all the money in hand had been expended and the governmentso it was saidcould give no more money till parliament should meet again  this was most unfortunate  in the first place the suspension was against the contract as made with the contractors for the building in the next place there was the delay and then worst of all the question again became agitated whether the colonial legislature were really in earnest with reference to ottawa  many men of mark in the colony were still anxiousi believe are still anxiousto put an end to the ottawa scheme and think that there still exists for them a chance of success  and very many men who are not of mark are thus united and a feeling of doubt on the subject has been created  two hundred and twentyfive thousand pounds have already been spent on these buildings and i have no doubt myself that they will be duly completed and duly used  we went up to the new town by boat taking the course of the river ottawa  we passed st anns but no one at st anns seemed to know anything of the brothers who were to rest there on their weary oars  at maxwellstown i could hear nothing of annie laurie or of her trystingplace on the braes and the turnpike man at tara could tell me nothing of the site of the hall and had never even heard of the harp  when i go down south i shall expect to find that the negro melodies have not yet reached old virginie  this boat conveyance from montreal to ottawa is not all that could be wished in convenience for it is allied too closely with railway traveling  those who use it leave montreal by a railway after nine miles they are changed into a steamboat  then they encounter another railway and at last reach ottawa in a second steamboat but the river is seen and a better idea of the country is obtained than can be had solely from the railway cars  the scenery is by no means grand nor is it strikingly picturesque but it is in its way interesting  for a long portion of the river the old primeval forests come down close to the waters edge and in the fall of the year the brilliant coloring is very lovely  it should not be imagined as i think it often is imagined that these forests are made up of splendid trees or that splendid trees are even common when timber grows on undrained ground and when it is uncared for it does not seem to approach nearer to its perfection than wheat and grass do under similar circumstances  seen from a little distance the color and effect is good but the trees themselves have shallow roots and grow up tall narrow and shapeless  it necessarily is so with all timber that is not thinned in its growth  when fine forest trees are found and are left standing alone by any cultivator who may have taste enough to wish for such adornment they almost invariably die  they are robbed of the sickly shelter by which they have been surrounded the hot sun strikes the uncovered fibers of the roots and the poor solitary invalid languishes and at last dies  as one ascends the river which by its breadth forms itself into lakes one is shown indian villages clustering down upon the bank some years ago these indians were rich for the price of furs in which they dealt was high but furs have become cheaper and the beavers with which they used to trade are almost valueless  that a change in the fashion of hats should have assisted to polish these poor fellows off the face of creation must one may suppose be very unintelligible to them but nevertheless it is probably a subject of deep speculation  if the reading world were to take to sermons again and eschew their novels messrs thackeray dickens and some others would look about them and inquire into the causes of such a change with considerable acuteness  they might not perhaps hit the truth and these indians are much in that predicament  it is said that very few pureblooded indians are now to be found in their villages but i doubt whether this is not erroneous  the children of the indians are now fed upon baked bread and on cooked meat and are brought up in houses  they are nursed somewhat as the children of the white men are nursed and these practices no doubt have done much toward altering their appearance  the negroes who have been bred in the states and whose fathers have been so bred before them differ both in color and form from their brothers who have been born and nurtured in africa  i said in the last chapter that the city of ottawa was still to be built but i must explain lest i should draw down on my head the wrath of the ottawaites that the place already contains a population of 15000 inhabitants  as however it is being prepared for four times that numberfor eight times that number let us hopeand as it straggles over a vast extent of ground it gives one the idea of a city in an active course of preparation in england we know nothing about unbuilt cities  with us four or five blocks of streets together never assume that ugly unfledged appearance which belongs to the halffinished carcass of a house as they do so often on the other side of the atlantic  ottawa is preparing for itself broad streets and grand thoroughfares  the buildings already extend over a length considerably exceeding two miles and half a dozen hotels have been opened which if i were writing a guidebook in a complimentary tone it would be my duty to describe as first rate  but the half dozen firstrate hotels though open as yet enjoy but a moderate amount of custom  all this justifies me i think in saying that the city has as yet to get itself built  the manner in which this is being done justifies me also in saying that the ottawaites are going about their task with a worthy zeal  to me i confess that the nature of the situation has great charms regarding it as the site for a town  it is not on a plain and from the form of the rock overhanging the river and of the hill that falls from thence down to the water it has been found impracticable to lay out the place in rightangled parallelograms a rightangled parallelogramical city such as are philadelphia and the new portion of new york is from its very nature odious to me i know that much may be said in its favorthat drainage and gas pipes come easier to such a shape and that ground can be better economized  nevertheless i prefer a street that is forced to twist itself about  i enjoy the narrowness of temple bar and the misshapen curvature of picket street  the disreputable dinginess of hollowell street is dear to me and i love to thread my way up the olympic into covent garden  fifth avenue in new york is as grand as paint and glass can make it but i would not live in a palace in fifth avenue if the corporation of the city would pay my bakers and butchers bills  the town of ottawa lies between two waterfalls  the upper one or rideau fall is formed by the confluence of a small river with the larger one and the lower falldesignated as lower because it is at the foot of the hill though it is higher up the ottawa river is called the chaudiere from its resemblance to a boiling kettle this is on the ottawa river itself  the rideau fall is divided into two branches thus forming an island in the middle as is the case at niagara  it is pretty enough and worth visiting even were it farther from the town than it is but by those who have hunted out many cataracts in their travels it will not be considered very remarkable  the chaudiere fall i did think very remarkable  it is of trifling depth being formed by fractures in the rocky bed of the river but the waters have so cut the rock as to create beautiful forms in the rush which they make in their descent strangers are told to look at these falls from the suspension bridge and it is well that they should do so  but in so looking at them they obtain but a very small part of their effect  on the ottawa side of the bridge is a brewery which brewery is surrounded by a huge timberyard  this timber yard i found to be very muddy and the passing and repassing through it is a work of trouble but nevertheless let the traveler by all means make his way through the mud and scramble over the timber and cross the plank bridges which traverse the streams of the sawmills and thus take himself to the outer edge of the woodwork over the water  if he will then seat himself about the hour of sunset he will see the chaudiere fall aright  but the glory of ottawa will beand indeed already isthe set of public buildings which is now being erected on the rock which guards as it were the town from the river  how much of the excellence of these buildings may be due to the taste of sir edmund head the late governor i do not know  that he has greatly interested himself in the subject is well known and as the style of the different buildings is so much alike as to make one whole though the designs of different architects were selected and these different architects employed i imagine that considerable alterations must have been made in the original drawings  there are three buildings forming three sides of a quadrangle but they are not joined the vacant spaces at the corner being of considerable extent  the fourth side of the quadrangle opens upon one of the principal streets of the town  the center building is intended for the houses of parliament and the two side buildings for the government offices  of the first messrs fuller and jones are the architects and of the latter messrs stent and laver  i did not have the pleasure of meeting any of these gentlemen but i take upon myself to say that as regards purity of art and manliness of conception their joint work is entitled to the very highest praise  how far the buildings may be well arranged for the required purposeshow far they maybe economical in construction or specially adapted to the severe climate of the countryi cannot say but i have no hesitation in risking my reputation for judgment in giving my warmest commendation to them as regards beauty of outline and truthful nobility of detail  i shall not attempt to describe them for i should interest no one in doing so and should certainly fail in my attempt to make any reader understand me  i know no modern gothic purer of its kind or less sullied with fictitious ornamentation  our own houses of parliament are very fine but it is i believe generally felt that the ornamentation is too minute and moreover it may be questioned whether perpendicular gothic is capable of the highest nobility which architecture can achieve  i do not pretend to say that these canadian public buildings will reach that highest nobility  they must be finished before any final judgment can be pronounced but i do feel very certain that that final judgment will be greatly in their favor  the total frontage of the quadrangle including the side buildings is 1200 feet that of the center buildings is 475  as i have said before 225000 pounds have already been expended and it is estimated that the total cost including the arrangement and decoration of the ground behind the building and in the quadrangle will be half a million  the buildings front upon what will i suppose be the principal street of ottawa and they stand upon a rock looking immediately down upon the river  in this way they are blessed with a site peculiarly happy  indeed i cannot at this moment remember any so much so  the castle of edinburgh stands very well but then like many other castles it stands on a summit by itself and can only be approached by a steep ascent  these buildings at ottawa though they look down from a grand eminence immediately on the river are approached from the town without any ascent  the rock though it falls almost precipitously down to the water is covered with trees and shrubs and then the river that runs beneath is rapid bright and picturesque in the irregularity of all its lines  the view from the back of the library up to the chaudiere falls and to the sawmills by which they are surrounded is very lovely  so that i will say again that i know no site for such a set of buildings so happy as regards both beauty and grandeur  it is intended that the library of which the walls were only ten feet above the ground when i was there shall be an octagonal building in shape and outward character like the chapter house of a cathedral  this structure will i presume be surrounded by gravel walks and green sward  of the library there is a large model showing all the details of the architecture and if that model be ultimately followed this building alone will be worthy of a visit from english tourists  to me it was very wonderful to find such an edifice in the course of erection on the banks of a wild river almost at the back of canada  but if ever i visit canada again it will be to see those buildings when completed  and now like all friendly critics having bestowed my modicum of praise i must proceed to find fault  i cannot bring myself to administer my sugarplum without adding to it some bitter morsel by way of antidote  the building to the left of the quadrangle as it is entered is deficient in length and on that account appears mean to the eye  the two side buildings are brought up close to the street so that each has a frontage immediately on the street such being the case they should be of equal length or nearly so had the center of one fronted the center of the other a difference of length might have been allowed but in this case the side front of the smaller one would not have reached the street  as it is the space between the main building and the smaller wing is disproportionably large and the very distance at which it stands will i fear give to it that appearance of meanness of which i have spoken  the clerk of the works who explained to me with much courtesy the plan of the buildings stated that the design of this wing was capable of elongation and had been expressly prepared with that object  if this be so i trust that the defect will be remedied  the great trade of canada is lumbering and lumbering consists in cutting down pinetrees up in the far distant forests in hewing or sawing them into shape for market and getting them down the rivers to quebec from whence they are exported to europe and chiefly to england  timber in canada is called lumber those engaged in the trade are called lumberers and the business itself is called lumbering  after a lapse of time it must no doubt become monotonous to those engaged in it and the name is not engaging but there is much about it that is very picturesque  a sawmill worked by water power is almost always a pretty object and stacks of newcut timber are pleasant to the smell and group themselves not amiss on the waters edge  if i had the time and were a year or two younger i should love well to go up lumbering into the woods  the men for this purpose are hired in the fall of the year and are sent up hundreds of miles away to the pine forests in strong gangs  everything is there found for them  they make log huts for their shelter and food of the best and the strongest is taken up for their diet  but no strong drink of any kind is allowed nor is any within reach of the men  there are no publics no shebeen houses no grogshops  sobriety is an enforced virtue and so much is this considered by the masters and understood by the men that very little contraband work is done in the way of taking up spirits to these settlements  it may be said that the work up in the forests is done with the assistance of no stronger drink than tea and it is very hard work  there cannot be much work that is harder and it is done amid the snows and forests of a canadian winter  a convict in bermuda cannot get through his daily eight hours of light labor without an allowance of rum but a canadian lumberer can manage to do his daily task on tea without milk  these men however are by no means teetotalers  when they come back to the towns they break out and reward themselves for their longenforced moderation  the wages i found to be very various running from thirteen or fourteen dollars a month to twentyeight or thirty according to the nature of the work  the men who cut down the trees receive more than those who hew them when down and these again more than the under class who make the roads and clear the ground  these money wages however are in addition to their diet  the operation requiring the most skill is that of marking the trees for the axe  the largest only are worth cutting and form and soundness must also be considered  but if i were about to visit a party of lumberers in the forest i should not be disposed to pass a whole winter with them  even of a very good thing one may have too much i would go up in the spring when the rafts are being formed in the small tributary streams and i would come down upon one of them shooting the rapids of the rivers as soon as the first freshets had left the way open  a freshet in the rivers is the rush of waters occasioned by melting snow and ice  the first freshets take down the winter waters of the nearer lakes and rivers  then the streams become for a time navigable and the rafts go down  after that comes the second freshet occasioned by the melting of faroff snow and ice up in the great northern lakes which are little known  these rafts are of immense construction such as those which we have seen on the rhone and rhine and often contain timber to the value of two three and four thousand pounds  at the rapids the large rafts are as it were unyoked and divided into small portions which go down separately  the excitement and motion of such transit must i should say be very joyous  i was told that the prince of wales desired to go down a rapid on a raft but that the men in charge would not undertake to say that there was no possible danger whereupon those who accompanied the prince requested his royal highness to forbear  i fear that in these careful days crowned heads and their heirs must often find themselves in the position of sancho at the banquet  the sailor prince who came after his brother was allowed to go down a rapid and got as i was told rather a rough bump as he did so  ottawa is a great place for these timber rafts  indeed it may i think be called the headquarters of timber for the world  nearly all the best pinewood comes down the ottawa and its tributaries the other rivers by which timber is brought down to the st lawrence are chiefly the st maurice the madawaska and the saguenay but the ottawa and its tributaries water 75000 square miles whereas the other three rivers with their tributaries water only 53000  the timber from the ottawa and st maurice finds its way down the st lawrence to quebec where however it loses the whole of its picturesque character  the saguenay and the madawaska fall into the st lawrence below quebec  from ottawa we went by rail to prescott which is surely one of the most wretched little places to be found in any country immediately opposite to it on the other side of the st lawrence is the thriving town of ogdensburg  but ogdensburg is in the united states  had we been able to learn at ottawa any facts as to the hours of the river steamers and railways we might have saved time and have avoided prescott but this was out of the question had i asked the exact hour at which i might reach calcutta by the quickest route an accurate reply would not have been more out of the question  i was much struck at prescottand indeed all through canada though more in the upper than in the lower provinceby the sturdy roughness some would call it insolence of those of the lower classes of the people with whom i was brought into contact  if the words lower classes give offense to any reader i beg to apologizeto apologize and to assert that i am one of the last of men to apply such a term in a sense of reproach to those who earn their bread by the labor of their hands  but it is hard to find terms which will be understood and that term whether it give offense or no will be understood  of course such a complaint as that i now make is very common as made against the states  men in the states with horned hands and fustian coats are very often most unnecessarily insolent in asserting their independence  what i now mean to say is that precisely the same fault is to be found in canada  i know well what the men mean when they offend in this manner  and when i think on the subject with deliberation at my own desk i can not only excuse but almost approve them  but when one personally encounters this corduroy braggadocio when the man to whose services one is entitled answers one with determined insolence when one is bidden to follow that young lady meaning the chambermaid or desired with a toss of the head to wait for the gentleman who is coming meaning the boots the heart is sickened and the english traveler pines for the civilityfor the servility if my american friends choose to call it soof a wellordered servant  but the whole scene is easily construed and turned into english  a man is asked by a stranger some question about his employment and he replies in a tone which seems to imply anger insolence and a dishonest intention to evade the service for which he is paid  or if there be no question of service or payment the mans manner will be the same and the stranger feels that he is slapped in the face and insulted  the translation of it is this the man questioned who is aware that as regards coat hat boots and outward cleanliness he is below him by whom he is questioned unconsciously feels himself called upon to assert his political equality  it is his shibboleth that he is politically equal to the best that he is independent and that his labor though it earn him but a dollar a day by porterage places him as a citizen on an equal rank with the most wealthy fellowman that may employ or accost him  but being so inferior in that coat hat and boots matter he is forced to assert his equality by some effort  as he improves in externals he will diminish the roughness of his claim  as long as the man makes his claim with any roughness so long does he acknowledge within himself some feeling of external inferiority  when that has gonewhen the american has polished himself up by education and general wellbeing to a feeling of external equality with gentlemen he shows i think no more of that outward braggadocio of independence than a frenchman  but the blow at the moment of the stroke is very galling  i confess that i have occasionally all but broken down beneath it but when it is thought of afterward it admits of full excuse  no effort that a man can make is better than a true effort at independence  but this insolence is a false effort it will be said  it should rather be called a false accompaniment to a life long true effort  the man probably is not dishonest does not desire to shirk any service which is due from him is not even inclined to insolence  accept his first declaration of equality for that which it is intended to represent and the man afterward will be found obliging and communicative  if occasion offer he will sit down in the room with you and will talk with you on any subject that he may choose but having once ascertained that you show no resentment for this assertion of equality he will do pretty nearly all that is asked  he will at any rate do as much in that way as an englishman  i say thus much on this subject now especially because i was quite as much struck by the feeling in canada as i was within the states  from prescott we went on by the grand trunk railway to toronto and stayed there for a few days  toronto is the capital of the province of upper canada and i presume will in some degree remain so in spite of ottawa and its pretensions  that is the law courts will still be held there  i do not know that it will enjoy any other supremacy unless it be that of trade and population some few years ago toronto was advancing with rapid strides and was bidding fair to rival quebec or even perhaps montreal hamilton also another town of upper canada was going ahead in the true american style but then reverses came in trade and the towns were checked for awhile  toronto with a neighboring suburb which is a part of it as southwark is of london contains now over 50000 inhabitants  the streets are all parallelogramical and there is not a single curvature to rest the eye  it is built down close upon lake ontario and as it is also on the grand trunk railway it has all the aid which facility of traffic can give it  the two sights of toronto are the osgoode hall and the university the osgoode hall is to upper canada what the four courts are to ireland  the law courts are all held there  exteriorly little can be said for osgoode hall whereas the exterior of the four courts in dublin is very fine but as an interior the temple of themis at toronto beats hollow that which the goddess owns in dublin  in dublin the courts themselves are shabby and the space under the dome is not so fine as the exterior seems to promise that it should be  in toronto the courts themselves are i think the most commodious that i ever saw and the passages vestibules and hall are very handsome  in upper canada the commonlaw judges and those in chancery are divided as they are in england but it is as i was told the opinion of canadian lawyers that the work may be thrown together  appeal is allowed in criminal cases but as far as i could learn such power of appeal is held to be both troublesome and useless  in lower canada the old french laws are still administered  but the university is the glory of toronto  this is a gothic building and will take rank after but next to the buildings at ottawa  it will be the second piece of noble architecture in canada and as far as i know on the american continent  it is i believe intended to be purely norman though i doubt whether the received types of norman architecture have not been departed from in many of the windows  be this as it may the college is a manly noble structure free from false decoration and infinitely creditable to those who projected it  i was informed by the head of the college that it has been open only two years and here also i fancy that the colony has been much indebted to the taste of the late governor sir edmund head  toronto as a city is not generally attractive to a traveler  the country around it is flat and though it stands on a lake that lake has no attributes of beauty  large inland seas such as are these great northern lakes of america never have such attributes picturesque mountains rise from narrow valleys such as form the beds of lakes in switzerland scotland and northern italy but from such broad waters as those of lake ontario lake erie and lake michigan the shores shelve very gradually and have none of the materials of lovely scenery  the streets in toronto are framed with wood or rather planked as are those of montreal and quebec but they are kept in better order  i should say that the planks are first used at toronto then sent down by the lake to montreal and when all but rotted out there are again floated off by the st lawrence to be used in the thoroughfares of the old french capital  but if the streets of toronto are better than those of the other towns the roads around it are worse  i had the honor of meeting two distinguished members of the provincial parliament at dinner some few miles out of town and returning back a short while after they had left our hosts house was glad to be of use in picking them up from a ditch into which their carriage had been upset  to me it appeared all but miraculous that any carriage should make its way over that road without such misadventure  i may perhaps be allowed to hope that the discomfiture of these worthy legislators may lead to some improvement in the thoroughfare  i had on a previous occasion gone down the st lawrence through the thousand isles and over the rapids in one of those large summer steamboats which ply upon the lake and river  i cannot say that i was much struck by the scenery and therefore did not encroach upon my time by making the journey again  such an opinion will be regarded as heresy by many who think much of the thousand islands  i do not believe that they would be expressly noted by any traveler who was not expressly bidden to admire them  from toronto we went across to niagara reentering the states at lewiston in new york    chapter vi  the connection of the canadas with great britain   when the american war began troops were sent out to canada and when i was in the provinces more troops were then expected  the matter was much talked of as a matter of course in canada and it had been discussed in england before i left  i had seen much said about it in the english papers since and it also had become the subject of very hot question among the politicians of the northern states  the measure had at that time given more umbrage to the north than anything else done or said by england from the beginning of the war up to that time except the declaration made by lord john russell in the house of commons as to the neutrality to be preserved by england between the two belligerents  the argument used by the northern states was this if france collects men and material of war in the neighborhood of england england considers herself injured calls for an explanation and talks of invasion therefore as england is now collecting men and material of war in our neighborhood we will consider ourselves injured  it does not suit us to ask for an explanation because it is not our habit to interfere with other nations  we will not pretend to say that we think we are to be invaded  but as we clearly are injured we will express our anger at that injury and when the opportunity shall come will take advantage of having that new grievance  as we all know a very large increase of force was sent when we were still in doubt as to the termination of the trent affair and imagined that war was imminent  but the sending of that large force did not anger the americans as the first dispatch of troops to canada had angered them  things had so turned out that measures of military precaution were acknowledged by them to be necessary i cannot however but think that mr seward might have spared that offer to send british troops across maine and so also have all his countrymen thought by whom i have heard the matter discussed  as to any attempt at invasion of canada by the americans or idea of punishing the alleged injuries suffered by the states from great britain by the annexation of those provinces i do not believe that any saneminded citizens of the states believe in the possibility of such retaliation  some years since the americans thought that canada might shine in the union firmament as a new star but that delusion is i think over  such annexation if ever made must have been made not only against the arms of england but must also have been made in accordance with the wishes of the people so annexed  it was then believed that the canadians were not averse to such a change and there may possibly have then been among them the remnant of such a wish  there is certainly no such desire now not even a remnant of such a desire and the truth on this matter is i think generally acknowledged  the feeling in canada is one of strong aversion to the united states government and of predilection for selfgovernment under the english crown  a faineant governor and the prestige of british power is now the political aspiration of the canadians in general and i think that this is understood in the states  moreover the states have a job of work on hand which as they themselves are well aware is taxing all their energies  such being the case i do not think that england needs to fear any invasion of canada authorized by the states government  this feeling of a grievance on the part of the states was a manifest absurdity  the new reinforcement of the garrisons in canada did not when i was in canada amount as i believe to more than 2000 men  but had it amounted to 20000 the states would have had no just ground for complaint  of all nationalities that in modern days have risen to power they above all others have shown that they would do what they liked with their own indifferent to foreign counsels and deaf to foreign remonstrance do you go your way and let us go ours  we will trouble you with no question nor do you trouble us  such has been their national policy and it has obtained for them great respect  they have resisted the temptation of putting their fingers into the caldron of foreign policy and foreign politicians acknowledging their reserve in this respect have not been offended at the bristles with which their noli me tangere has been proclaimed  their intelligence has been appreciated and their conduct has been respected  but if this has been their line of policy they must be entirely out of court in raising any question as to the position of british troops on british soil  it shows us that you doubt us an american says with an air of injured honoror did say before that trent affair  and it is done to express sympathy with the south  the southerners understand it and we understand it also  we know where your hearts arenay your very souls  they are among the slave begotten cotton bales of the rebel south  then comes the whole of the long argument in which it seems so easy to an englishman to prove that england in the whole of this sad matter has been true and loyal to her friend  she could not interfere when the husband and wife would quarrel  she could only grieve and wish that things might come right and smooth for both parties  but the argument though so easy is never effectual  it seems to me foolish in an american to quarrel with england for sending soldiers to canada but i cannot say that i thought it was well done to send them at the beginning of the war  the english government did not i presume take this step with reference to any possible invasion of canada by the government of the states  we are fortifying portsmouth and portland and plymouth because we would fain be safe against the french army acting under a french emperor  but we sent 2000 troops to canada if i understand the matter rightly to guard our provinces against the filibustering energies of a mass of unemployed american soldiers when those soldiers should come to be disbanded  when this war shall be over a war during which not much if any under a million of american citizens will have been under armsit will not be easy for all who survive to return to their old homes and old occupations  nor does a disbanded soldier always make a good husbandman notwithstanding the great examples of cincinnatus and birdofreedom sawin  it may be that a considerable amount of filibustering energy will be afloat and that the then government of those who neighbor us in canada will have other matters in hand more important to them than the controlling of these unruly spirits  that as i take it was the evil against which we of great britain and of canada desired to guard ourselves  but i doubt whether 2000 or 10000 british soldiers would be any effective guard against such inroads and i doubt more strongly whether any such external guarding will be necessary  if the canadians were prepared to fraternize with filibusters from the states neither three nor ten thousand soldiers would avail against such a feeling over a frontier stretching from the state of maine to the shores of lake huron and lake erie  if such a feeling did existif the canadians wished the changein gods name let them go  it is for their sakes and not for our own that we would have them bound to us  but the canadians are averse to such a change with a degree of feeling that amounts to national intensity  their sympathies are with the southern states not because they care for cotton not because they are antiabolitionists not because they admire the hearty pluck of those who are endeavoring to work out for themselves a new revolution  they sympathize with the south from strong dislike to the aggression the braggadocio and the insolence they have felt upon their own borders  they dislike mr sewards weak and vulgar joke with the duke of newcastle  they dislike mr everetts flattering hints to his countrymen as to the one nation that is to occupy the whole continent  they dislike the monroe doctrine  they wonder at the meekness with which england has endured the vauntings of the northern states and are endued with no such meekness of their own  they would i believe be well prepared to meet and give an account of any filibusters who might visit them and i am not sure that it is wisely done on our part to show any intention of taking the work out of their hands  but i am led to this opinion in no degree by a feeling that great britain ought to grudge the cost of the soldiers  if canada will be safer with them in heavens name let her have them  it has been argued in many places not only with regard to canada but as to all our selfgoverned colonies that military service should not be given at british expense and with british men to any colony which has its own representative government and which levies its own taxes  while great britain absolutely held the reins of government and did as it pleased with the affairs of its dependencies such politicians say it was just and right that she should pay the bill  as long as her government of a colony was paternal so long was it right that the mother country should put herself in the place of a father and enjoy a fathers undoubted prerogative of putting his hand into his breeches pocket to provide for all the wants of his child  but when the adult son set up for himself in businesshaving received education from the parent and having had his apprentice fees duly paidthen that son should settle his own bills and look no longer to the paternal pocket such is the law of the world all over from little birds whose young fly away when fledged upward to men and nations  let the father work for the child while he is a child but when the child has become a man let him lean no longer on his fathers staff  the argument is i think very good but it proves not that we are relieved from the necessity of assisting our colonies with payments made out of british taxes but that we are still bound to give such assistance and that we shall continue to be so bound as long as we allow these colonies to adhere to us or as they allow us to adhere to them  in fact the young bird is not yet fully fledged  that illustration of the father and the child is a just one but in order to make it just it should be followed throughout  when the son is in fact established on his own bottom then the father expects that he will live without assistance  but when the son does so live he is freed from all paternal control  the father while he expects to be obeyed continues to fill the paternal office of paymasterof paymaster at any rate to some extent and so i think it must be with our colonies  the canadas at present are not independent and have not political power of their own apart from the political power of great britain  england has declared herself neutral as regards the northern and southern states and by that neutrality the canadas are bound and yet the canadas were not consulted in the matter  should england go to war with france canada must close her ports against french vessels if england chooses to send her troops to canadian barracks canada cannot refuse to accept them  if england should send to canada an unpopular governor canada has no power to reject his services  as long as canada is a colony so called she cannot be independent and should not be expected to walk alone  it is exactly the same with the colonies of australia with new zealand with the cape of good hope and with jamaica  while england enjoys the prestige of her colonies while she boasts that such large and now populous territories are her dependencies she must and should be content to pay some portion of the bill  surely it is absurd on our part to quarrel with caffre warfare with new zealand fighting and the rest of it  such complaints remind one of an ancient pater familias who insists on having his children and his grandchildren under the old paternal roof and then grumbles because the butchers bill is high  those who will keep large households and bountiful tables should not be afraid of facing the butchers bill or unhappy at the tonnage of the coal  it is a grand thing that power of keeping a large table but it ceases to be grand when the items heaped upon it cause inward groans and outward moodiness  why should the colonies remain true to us as children are true to their parents if we grudge them the assistance which is due to a child  they raise their own taxes it is said and administer them  true and it is well that the growing son should do something for himself  while the father does all for him the sons labor belongs to the father  then comes a middle state in which the son does much for himself but not all  in that middle state now stand our prosperous colonies  then comes the time when the son shall stand alone by his own strength and to that period of manly selfrespected strength let us all hope that those colonies are advancing  it is very hard for a mother country to know when such a time has come and hard also for the childcolony to recognize justly the period of its own maturity  whether or no such severance may ever take place without a quarrel without weakness on one side and pride on the other is a problem in the worlds history yet to be solved  the most successful child that ever yet has gone off from a successful parent and taken its own path into the world is without doubt the nation of the united states  their present troubles are the result and the proofs of their success  the people that were too great to be dependent on any nation have now spread till they are themselves too great for a single nationality  no one now thinks that that daughter should have remained longer subject to her mother  but the severance was not made in amity and the shrill notes of the old family quarrel are still sometimes heard across the waters  from all this the question arises whether that problem may ever be solved with reference to the canadas  that it will never be their destiny to join themselves to the states of the union i feel fully convinced  in the first place it is becoming evident from the present circumstances of the union if it had never been made evident by history before that different people with different habits living at long distances from each other cannot well be brought together on equal terms under one government  that noble ambition of the americans that all the continent north of the isthmus should be united under one flag has already been thrown from its saddle  the north and south are virtually separated and the day will come in which the west also will secede  as population increases and trades arise peculiar to those different climates the interests of the people will differ and a new secession will take place beneficial alike to both parties  if this be so if even there be any tendency this way it affords the strongest argument against the probability of any future annexation of the canadas  and then in the second place the feeling of canada is not american but british  if ever she be separated from great britain she will be separated as the states were separated she will desire to stand alone and to enter herself as one among the nations of the earth  she will desire to stand alone alone that is without dependence either on england or on the states  but she is so circumstanced geographically that she can never stand alone without amalgamation with our other north american provinces  she has an outlet to the sea at the gulf of st lawrence but it is only a summer outlet her winter outlet is by railway through the states and no other winter outlet is possible for her except through the sister provinces  before canada can be nationally great the line of railway which now runs for some hundred miles below quebec to riviere du loup must be continued on through new brunswick and nova scotia to the port of halifax  when i was in canada i heard the question discussed of a federal government between the provinces of the two canadas new brunswick and nova scotia  to these were added or not added according to the opinion of those who spoke the smaller outlying colonies of newfoundland and prince edwards island  if a scheme for such a government were projected in downing street all would no doubt be included and a clean sweep would be made without difficulty  but the project as made in the colonies appears in different guises as it comes either from canada or from one of the other provinces the canadian idea would be that the two canadas should form two states of such a confederation and the other provinces a third state  but this slight participation in power would hardly suit the views of new brunswick and nova scotia  in speaking of such a federal government as this i shall of course be understood as meaning a confederation acting in connection with a british governor and dependent upon great britain as far as the different colonies are now dependent  i cannot but think that such a confederation might be formed with great advantage to all the colonies and to great britain  at present the canadas are in effect almost more distant from nova scotia and new brunswick than they are from england  the intercourse between them is very slightso slight that it may almost be said that there is no intercourse  a few men of science or of political importance may from time to time make their way from one colony into the other but even this is not common beyond that they seldom see each other  though new brunswick borders both with lower canada and with nova scotia thus making one whole of the three colonies there is neither railroad nor stage conveyance running from one to the other  and yet their interests should be similar  from geographical position their modes of life must be alike and a close conjunction between them is essentially necessary to give british north america any political importance in the world  there can be no such conjunction no amalgamation of interests until a railway shall have been made joining the canada grand trunk line with the two outlying colonies  upper canada can feed all england with wheat and could do so without any aid of railway through the states if a railway were made from quebec to halifax  but then comes the question of the cost  the canada grand trunk is at the present moment at the lowest ebb of commercial misfortune and with such a fact patent to the world what company will come forward with funds for making four or five hundred miles of railway through a district of which onehalf is not yet prepared for population  it would be i imagine out of the question that such a speculation should for many years give any fair commercial interest on the money to be expended  but nevertheless to the coloniesthat is to the enormous regions of british north americasuch a railroad would be invaluable  under such circumstances it is for the home government and the colonies between them to see how such a measure may be carried out  as a national expenditure to be defrayed in the course of years by the territories interested the sum of money required would be very small  but how would this affect england  and how would england be affected by a union of the british north american colonies under one federal government  before this question can be answered he who prepares to answer it must consider what interest england has in her colonies and for what purpose she holds them  does she hold them for profit or for glory or for power or does she hold them in order that she may carry out the duty which has devolved upon her of extending civilization freedom and wellbeing through the new uprising nations of the world  does she hold them in fact for her own benefit or does she hold them for theirs  i know nothing of the ethics of the colonial office and not much perhaps of those of the house of commons but looking at what great britain has hitherto done in the way of colonization i cannot but think that the national ambition looks to the welfare of the colonists and not to home aggrandizement  that the two may run together is most probable  indeed there can be no glory to a people so great or so readily recognized by mankind at large as that of spreading civilization from east to west and from north to south  but the one object should be the prosperity of the colonists and not profit nor glory nor even power to the parent country  there is no virtue of which more has been said and sung than patriotism and none which when pure and true has led to finer results  dulce et decorum est pro patria mori  to live for ones country also is a very beautiful and proper thing  but if we examine closely much patriotism that is so called we shall find it going hand in hand with a good deal that is selfish and with not a little that is devilish  it was some fine fury of patriotic feeling which enabled the national poet to put into the mouth of every englishman that horrible prayer with regard to our enemies which we sing when we wish to do honor to our sovereign  it did not seem to him that it might be well to pray that their hearts should be softened and our own hearts softened also  national success was all that a patriotic poet could desire and therefore in our national hymn have we gone on imploring the lord to arise and scatter our enemies to confound their politics whether they be good or ill and to expose their knavish trickssuch knavish tricks being taken for granted  and then with a steady confidence we used to declare how certain we were that we should achieve all that was desirable not exactly by trusting to our prayer to heaven but by relying almost exclusively on george the third or george the fourth  now i have always thought that that was rather a poor patriotism  luckily for us our national conduct has not squared itself with our national anthem  any patriotism must be poor which desires glory or even profit for a few at the expense of the many even though the few be brothers and the many aliens  as a rule patriotism is a virtue only because mans aptitude for good is so finite that he cannot see and comprehend a wider humanity  he can hardly bring himself to understand that salvation should be extended to jew and gentile alike  the word philanthropy has become odious and i would fain not use it but the thing itself is as much higher than patriotism as heaven is above the earth  a wish that british north america should ever be severed from england or that the australian colonies should ever be so severed will by many englishmen be deemed unpatriotic  but i think that such severance is to be wished if it be the case that the colonies standing alone would become more prosperous than they are under british rule  we have before us an example in the united states of the prosperity which has attended such a rupture of old ties  i will not now contest the point with those who say that the present moment of an american civil war is ill chosen for vaunting that prosperity  there stand the cities which the people have built and their power is attested by the worldwide importance of their present contest  and if the states have so risen since they left their parents apronstring why should not british north america rise as high  that the time has as yet come for such rising i do not think but that it will soon come i do most heartily hope  the making of the railway of which i have spoken and the amalgamation of the provinces would greatly tend to such an event  if therefore england desires to keep these colonies in a state of dependency if it be more essential to her to maintain her own power with regard to them than to increase their influence if her main object be to keep the colonies and not to improve the colonies then i should say that an amalgamation of the canadas with nova scotia and new brunswick should not be regarded with favor by statesmen in downing street  but if as i would fain hope and do partly believe such ideas of national power as these are now out of vogue with british statesmen then i think that such an amalgamation should receive all the support which downing street can give it  the united states severed themselves from great britain with a great struggle and after heartburnings and bloodshed  whether great britain will ever allow any colony of hers to depart from out of her nest to secede and start for herself without any struggle or heartburnings with all furtherance for such purpose which an old and powerful country can give to a new nationality then first taking its own place in the worlds arena is a problem yet to be solved  there is i think no more beautiful sight than that of a mother still in all the glory of womanhood preparing the wedding trousseau for her daughter  the child hitherto has been obedient and submissive  she has been one of a household in which she has held no command  she has sat at table as a child fitting herself in all things to the behests of others  but the day of her power and her glory and also of her cares and solicitude is at hand she is to go forth and do as she best may in the world under that teaching which her old home has given her  the hour of separation has come and the mother smiling through her tears sends her forth decked with a bounteous hand and furnished with full stores so that all may be well with her as she enters on her new duties so is it that england should send forth her daughters  they should not escape from her arms with shrill screams and bleeding wounds with illomened words which live so long though the speakers of them lie cold in their graves  but this sending forth of a childnation to take its own political status in the world has never yet been done by great britain  i cannot remember that such has ever been done by any great power with reference to its dependency by any power that was powerful enough to keep such dependency within its grasp  but a man thinking on these matters cannot but hope that a time will come when such amicable severance may be effected  great britain cannot think that through all coming ages she is to be the mistress of the vast continent of australia lying on the other side of the globes surface that she is to be the mistress of all south africa as civilization shall extend northward that the enormous territories of british north america are to be subject forever to a veto from downing street  if the history of past empires does not teach her that this may not be so at least the history of the united states might so teach her  but we have learned a lesson from those united states the patriot will argue who dares to hope that the glory and extent of the british empire may remain unimpaired in saecula saeculorum  since that day we have given political rights to our colonies and have satisfied the political longings of their inhabitants  we do not tax their tea and stamps but leave it to them to tax themselves as they may please  true  but in political aspirations the giving of an inch has ever created the desire for an ell  if the australian colonies even now with their scanty population and still young civilization chafe against imperial interference will they submit to it when they feel within their veins all the full blood of political manhood  what is the cry even of the canadiansof the canadians who are thoroughly loyal to england  send us a faineant governor a king log who will not presume to interfere with us a governor who will spend his money and live like a gentleman and care little or nothing for politics  that is the canadian beau ideal of a governor  they are to govern themselves and he who comes to them from england is to sit among them as the silent representative of englands protection  if that be trueand i do not think that any who know the canadas will deny itmust it not be presumed that they will soon also desire a faineant minister in downing street  of course they will so desire  men do not become milder in their aspirations for political power the more that political power is extended to them  nor would it be well that they should be so humble in their desires  nations devoid of political power have never risen high in the worlds esteem  even when they have been commercially successful commerce has not brought to them the greatness which it has always given when joined with a strong political existence the greeks are commercially rich and active but greece and greek are bywords now for all that is mean  cuba is a colony and putting aside the cities of the states the havana is the richest town on the other side of the atlantic and commercially the greatest but the political villainy of cuba her daily importation of slaves her breaches of treaty and the bribery of her all but royal governor are known to all men  but canada is not dishonest canada is no byword for anything evil canada eats her own bread in the sweat of her brow and fears a bad word from no man  true  but why does new york with its suburbs boast a million of inhabitants while montreal has 85000  why has that babe in years chicago 120000 while toronto has not half the number  i do not say that montreal and toronto should have gone ahead abreast with new york and chicago  in such races one must be first and one last  but i do say that the canadian towns will have no equal chance till they are actuated by that feeling of political independence which has created the growth of the towns in the united states  i do not think that the time has yet come in which great britain should desire the canadians to start for themselves  there is the making of that railroad to be effected and something done toward the union of those provinces  canada could no more stand alone without new brunswick and nova scotia than could those latter colonies without canada  but i think it would be well to be prepared for such a coming day and that it would at any rate be well to bring home to ourselves and realize the idea of such secession on the part of our colonies when the time shall have come at which such secession may be carried out with profit and security to them  great britain should she ever send forth her child alone into the world must of course guarantee her security such guarantees are given by treaties and in the wording of them it is presumed that such treaties will last forever  it will be argued that in starting british north america as a political power on its own bottom we should bind ourself to all the expense of its defense while we should give up all right to any interference in its concerns and that from a state of things so unprofitable as this there would be no prospect of a deliverance  but such treaties let them be worded how they will do not last forever for a time no doubt great britain would be so hamperedif indeed she would feel herself hampered by extending her name and prestige to a country bound to her by ties such as those which would then exist between her and this new nation  such treaties are not everlasting nor can they be made to last even for ages  those who word them seem to think that powers and dynasties will never pass away  but they do pass away and the balance of power will not keep itself fixed forever on the same pivot  the time may come that it may not come soon we will all desirebut the time may come when the name and prestige of what we call british north america will be as serviceable to great britain as those of great britain are now serviceable to her colonies  but what shall be the new form of government for the new kingdom that is a speculation very interesting to a politician though one which to follow out at great length in these early days would be rather premature  that it should be a kingdomthat the political arrangement should be one of which a crowned hereditary king should form partnineteen out of every twenty englishmen would desire and as i fancy so would also nineteen out of every twenty canadians  a king for the united states when they first established themselves was impossible  a total rupture from the old world and all its habits was necessary for them  the name of a king or monarch or sovereign had become horrible to their ears even to this day they have not learned the difference between arbitrary power retained in the hand of one man such as that now held by the emperor over the french and such hereditary headship in the state as that which belongs to the crown in great britain and this was necessary seeing that their division from us was effected by strife and carried out with war and bitter animosities  in those days also there was a remnant though but a small remnant of the power of tyranny left within the scope of the british crown  that small remnant has been removed and to me it seems that no form of existing government no form of government that ever did exist gives or has given so large a measure of individual freedom to all who live under it as a constitutional monarchy in which the crown is divested of direct political power  i will venture then to suggest a king for this new nation and seeing that we are rich in princes there need be no difficulty in the selection  would it not be beautiful to see a new nation established under such auspices and to establish a people to whom their independence had been given to whom it had been freely surrendered as soon as they were capable of holding the position assigned to them    chapter vii  niagara   of all the sights on this earth of ours which tourists travel to seeat least of all those which i have seeni am inclined to give the palm to the falls of niagara  in the catalogue of such sights i intend to include all buildings pictures statues and wonders of art made by mens hands and also all beauties of nature prepared by the creator for the delight of his creatures  this is a long word but as far as my taste and judgment go it is justified  i know no other one thing so beautiful so glorious and so powerful  i would not by this be understood as saying that a traveler wishing to do the best with his time should first of all places seek niagara  in visiting florence he may learn almost all that modern art can teach  at rome he will be brought to understand the cold hearts correct eyes and cruel ambition of the old latin race  in switzerland he will surround himself with a flood of grandeur and loveliness and fill himself if he be capable of such filling with a flood of romance  the tropics will unfold to him all that vegetation in its greatest richness can produce  in paris he will find the supreme of polish the ne plus ultra of varnish according to the worlds capability of varnishing and in london he will find the supreme of power the ne plus ultra of work according to the worlds capability of working  any one of such journeys may be more valuable to a mannay any one such journey must be more valuable to a manthan a visit to niagara at niagara there is that fall of waters alone  but that fall is more graceful than giottos tower more noble than the apollo  the peaks of the alps are not so astounding in their solitude  the valleys of the blue mountains in jamaica are less green  the finished glaze of life in paris is less invariable and the full tide of trade round the bank of england is not so inexorably powerful  i came across an artist at niagara who was attempting to draw the spray of the waters  you have a difficult subject said i  all subjects are difficult he replied to a man who desires to do well  but yours i fear is impossible i said  you have no right to say so till i have finished my picture he replied  i acknowledged the justice of his rebuke regretted that i could not remain till the completion of his work should enable me to revoke my words and passed on  then i began to reflect whether i did not intend to try a task as difficult in describing the falls and whether i felt any of that proud selfconfidence which kept him happy at any rate while his task was in hand  i will not say that it is as difficult to describe aright that rush of waters as it is to paint it well  but i doubt whether it is not quite as difficult to write a description that shall interest the reader as it is to paint a picture of them that shall be pleasant to the beholder  my friend the artist was at any rate not afraid to make the attempt and i also will try my hand  that the waters of lake erie have come down in their courses from the broad basins of lake michigan lake superior and lake huron that these waters fall into lake ontario by the short and rapid river of niagara and that the falls of niagara are made by a sudden break in the level of this rapid river is probably known to all who will read this book  all the waters of these huge northern inland seas run over that breach in the rocky bottom of the stream and thence it comes that the flow is unceasing in its grandeur and that no eye can perceive a difference in the weight or sound or violence of the fall whether it be visited in the drought of autumn amid the storms of winter or after the melting of the upper worlds of ice in the days of the early summer  how many cataracts does the habitual tourist visit at which the waters fail him  but at niagara the waters never fail  there it thunders over its ledge in a volume that never ceases and is never diminishedas it has done from times previous to the life of man and as it will do till tens of thousands of years shall see the rocky bed of the river worn away back to the upper lake  this stream divides canada from the statesthe western or farthermost bank belonging to the british crown and the eastern or nearer bank being in the state of new york  in visiting niagara it always becomes a question on which side the visitor shall take up his quarters  on the canada side there is no town but there is a large hotel beautifully placed immediately opposite to the falls and this is generally thought to be the best locality for tourists in the state of new york is the town called niagara falls and here there are two large hotels which as to their immediate site are not so well placed as that in canada  i first visited niagara some three years since  i stayed then at the clifton house on the canada side and have since sworn by that position  but the clifton house was closed for the season when i was last there and on that account we went to the cataract house in the town on the other side  i now think that i should set up my staff on the american side if i went again  my advice on the subject to any party starting for niagara would depend upon their habits or on their nationality  i would send americans to the canadian side because they dislike walking but english people i would locate on the american side seeing that they are generally accustomed to the frequent use of their own legs  the two sides are not very easily approached one from the other  immediately below the falls there is a ferry which may be traversed at the expense of a shilling but the labor of getting up and down from the ferry is considerable and the passage becomes wearisome  there is also a bridge but it is two miles down the river making a walk or drive of four miles necessary and the toll for passing is four shillings or a dollar in a carriage and one shilling on foot as the greater variety of prospect can be had on the american side as the island between the two falls is approachable from the american side and not from the canadian and as it is in this island that visitors will best love to linger and learn to measure in their minds the vast triumph of waters before them i recommend such of my readers as can trust a littleit need be but a little to their own legs to select their hotel at niagara falls town  it has been said that it matters much from what point the falls are first seen but to this i demur  it matters i think very little or not at all  let the visitor first see it all and learn the whereabouts of every point so as to understand his own position and that of the waters and then having done that in the way of business let him proceed to enjoyment  i doubt whether it be not the best to do this with all sightseeing  i am quite sure that it is the way in which acquaintance may be best and most pleasantly made with a new picture  the falls as i have said are made by a sudden breach in the level of the river  all cataracts are i presume made by such breaches but generally the waters do not fall precipitously as they do at niagara and never elsewhere as far as the world yet knows has a breach so sudden been made in a river carrying in its channel such or any approach to such a body of water  up above the falls for more than a mile the waters leap and burst over rapids as though conscious of the destiny that awaits them  here the river is very broad and comparatively shallow but from shore to shore it frets itself into little torrents and begins to assume the majesty of its power  looking at it even here in the expanse which forms itself over the greater fall one feels sure that no strongest swimmer could have a chance of saving himself if fate had cast him in even among those petty whirlpools  the waters though so broken in their descent are deliciously green  this color as seen early in the morning or just as the sun has set is so bright as to give to the place one of its chiefest charms  this will be best seen from the farther end of the islandgoat island as it is calledwhich as the reader will understand divides the river immediately above the falls  indeed the island is a part of that precipitouslybroken ledge over which the river tumbles and no doubt in process of time will be worn away and covered with water  the time however will be very long  in the mean while it is perhaps a mile round and is covered thickly with timber  at the upper end of the island the waters are divided and coming down in two courses each over its own rapids form two separate falls  the bridge by which the island is entered is a hundred yards or more above the smaller fall  the waters here have been turned by the island and make their leap into the body of the river below at a right angle with itabout two hundred yards below the greater fall  taken alone this smaller cataract would i imagine be the heaviest fall of water known but taken in conjunction with the other it is terribly shorn of its majesty the waters here are not green as they are at the larger cataract and though the ledge has been hollowed and bowed by them so as to form a curve that curve does not deepen itself into a vast abyss as it does at the horseshoe up above  this smaller fall is again divided and the visitor passing down a flight of steps and over a frail wooden bridge finds himself on a smaller island in the midst of it  but we will go at once on to the glory and the thunder and the majesty and the wrath of that upper hell of waters  we are still let the reader remember on goat islandstill in the statesand on what is called the american side of the main body of the river advancing beyond the path leading down to the lesser fall we come to that point of the island at which the waters of the main river begin to descend  from hence across to the canadian side the cataract continues itself in one unabated line  but the line is very far from being direct or straight  after stretching for some little way from the shore to a point in the river which is reached by a wooden bridge at the end of which stands a tower upon the rockafter stretching to this the line of the ledge bends inward against the floodin and in and intill one is led to think that the depth of that horseshoe is immeasurable  it has been cut with no stinting hand  a monstrous cantle has been worn back out of the center of the rock so that the fury of the waters converges and the spectator as he gazes into the hollow with wishful eyes fancies that he can hardly trace out the center of the abyss  go down to the end of that wooden bridge seat yourself on the rail and there sit till all the outer world is lost to you  there is no grander spot about niagara than this  the waters are absolutely around you  if you have that power of eyecontrio which is so necessary to the full enjoyment of scenery you will see nothing but the water  you will certainly hear nothing else and the sound i beg you to remember is not an earcracking agonizing crash and clang of noises but is melodious and soft withal though loud as thunder  it fills your ears and as it were envelops them but at the same time you can speak to your neighbor without an effort  but at this place and in these moments the less of speaking i should say the better  there is no grander spot than this  here seated on the rail of the bridge you will not see the whole depth of the fall  in looking at the grandest works of nature and of art too i fancy it is never well to see all  there should be something left to the imagination and much should be half concealed in mystery  the greatest charm of a mountain range is the wild feeling that there must be strange unknown desolate worlds in those faroff valleys beyond  and so here at niagara that converging rush of waters may fall down down at once into a hell of rivers for what the eye can see  it is glorious to watch them in their first curve over the rocks  they come green as a bank of emeralds but with a fitful flying color as though conscious that in one moment more they would be dashed into spray and rise into air pale as driven snow  the vapor rises high into the air and is gathered there visible always as a permanent white cloud over the cataract but the bulk of the spray which fills the lower hollow of that horseshoe is like a tumult of snow  this you will not fully see from your seat on the rail  the head of it rises ever and anon out of that caldron below but the caldron itself will be invisible  it is ever so far downfar as your own imagination can sink it  but your eyes will rest full upon the curve of the waters  the shape you will be looking at is that of a horseshoe but of a horseshoe miraculously deep from toe to heel and this depth becomes greater as you sit there  that which at first was only great and beautiful becomes gigantic and sublime till the mind is at loss to find an epithet for its own use  to realize niagara you must sit there till you see nothing else than that which you have come to see  you will hear nothing else and think of nothing else  at length you will be at one with the tumbling river before you  you will find yourself among the waters as though you belonged to them  the cool liquid green will run through your veins and the voice of the cataract will be the expression of your own heart  you will fall as the bright waters fall rushing down into your new world with no hesitation and with no dismay and you will rise again as the spray rises bright beautiful and pure  then you will flow away in your course to the uncompassed distant and eternal ocean  when this state has been reached and has passed away you may get off your rail and mount the tower  i do not quite approve of that tower seeing that it has about it a gingerbread air and reminds one of those wellarranged scenes of romance in which one is told that on the left you turn to the ladys bower price sixpence and on the right ascend to the knights bed price sixpence more with a view of the hermits tomb thrown in  but nevertheless the tower is worth mounting and no money is charged for the use of it  it is not very high and there is a balcony at the top on which some half dozen persons may stand at ease  here the mystery is lost but the whole fall is seen  it is not even at this spot brought so fully before your eye made to show itself in so complete and entire a shape as it will do when you come to stand near to it on the opposite or canadian shore  but i think that it shows itself more beautifully  and the form of the cataract is such that here on goat island on the american side no spray will reach you although you are absolutely over the waters  but on the canadian side the road as it approaches the fall is wet and rotten with spray and you as you stand close upon the edge will be wet also the rainbows as they are seen through the rising cloudfor the suns rays as seen through these waters show themselves in a bow as they do when seen through rainare pretty enough and are greatly loved  for myself i do not care for this prettiness at niagara  it is there but i forget it and do not mind how soon it is forgotten  but we are still on the tower and here i must declare that though i forgive the tower i cannot forgive the horrid obelisk which has latterly been built opposite to it on the canadian side up above the fall built apparentlyfor i did not go to itwith some cameraobscura intention for which the projector deserves to be put in coventry by all good christian men and women  at such a place as niagara tasteless buildings run up in wrong places with a view to money making are perhaps necessary evils  it may be that they are not evils at all that they give more pleasure than pain seeing that they tend to the enjoyment of the multitude  but there are edifices of this description which cry aloud to the gods by the force of their own ugliness and malposition  as to such it may be said that there should somewhere exist a power capable of crushing them in their birth  this new obelisk or picturebuilding at niagara is one of such  and now we will cross the water and with this object will return by the bridge out of goat island on the main land of the american side  but as we do so let me say that one of the great charms of niagara consists in this that over and above that one great object of wonder and beauty there is so much little loveliness loveliness especially of water i mean  there are little rivulets running here and there over little falls with pendent boughs above them and stones shining under their shallow depths  as the visitor stands and looks through the trees the rapids glitter before him and then hide themselves behind islands  they glitter and sparkle in far distances under the bright foliage till the remembrance is lost and one knows not which way they run  and then the river below with its whirlpoolbut we shall come to that byandby and to the mad voyage which was made down the rapids by that mad captain who ran the gantlet of the waters at the risk of his own life with fifty to one against him in order that he might save another mans property from the sheriff  the readiest way across to canada is by the ferry and on the american side this is very pleasantly done  you go into a little house pay twenty cents take a seat on a wooden car of wonderful shape and on the touch of a spring find yourself traveling down an inclined plane of terrible declivity and at a very fast rate  you catch a glance of the river below you and recognize the fact that if the rope by which you are held should break you would go down at a very fast rate indeed and find your final restingplace in the river  as i have gone down some dozen times and have come to no such grief i will not presume that you will be less lucky below there is a boat generally ready  if it be not there the place is not chosen amiss for a rest of ten minutes for the lesser fall is close at hand and the larger one is in full view  looking at the rapidity of the river you will think that the passage must be dangerous and difficult  but no accidents ever happen and the lad who takes you over seems to do it with sufficient ease  the walk up the hill on the other side is another thing  it is very steep and for those who have not good locomotive power of their own will be found to be disagreeable  in the full season however carriages are generally waiting there  in so short a distance i have always been ashamed to trust to other legs than my own but i have observed that americans are always dragged up  i have seen single young men of from eighteen to twentyfive from whose outward appearance no story of idle luxurious life can be read carried about alone in carriages over distances which would be counted as nothing by any healthy english lady of fifty  none but the old invalids should require the assistance of carriages in seeing niagara but the trade in carriages is to all appearance the most brisk trade there  having mounted the hill on the canada side you will walk on toward the falls  as i have said before you will from this side look directly into the full circle of the upper cataract while you will have before you at your left hand the whole expanse of the lesser fall  for those who desire to see all at a glance who wish to comprise the whole with their eyes and to leave nothing to be guessed nothing to be surmised this no doubt is the best point of view  you will be covered with spray as you walk up to the ledge of rocks but i do not think that the spray will hurt you  if a man gets wet through going to his daily work cold catarrh cough and all their attendant evils may be expected but these maladies usually spare the tourist  change of air plenty of air excellence of air and increased exercise make these things powerless  i should therefore bid you disregard the spray  if however you are yourself of a different opinion you may hire a suit of oilcloth clothes for i believe a quarter of a dollar they are nasty of course and have this further disadvantage that you become much more wet having them on than you would be without them  here on this side you walk on to the very edge of the cataract and if your tread be steady and your legs firm you dip your foot into the water exactly at the spot where the thin outside margin of the current reaches the rocky edge and jumps to join the mass of the fall  the bed of white foam beneath is certainly seen better here than elsewhere and the green curve of the water is as bright here as when seen from the wooden rail across  but nevertheless i say again that that wooden rail is the one point from whence niagara may be best seen aright  close to the cataract exactly at the spot from whence in former days the table rock used to project from the land over the boiling caldron below there is now a shaft down which you will descend to the level of the river and pass between the rock and the torrent this table rock broke away from the cliff and fell as up the whole course of the river the seceding rocks have split and fallen from time to time through countless years and will continue to do till the bed of the upper lake is reached  you will descend this shaft taking to yourself or not taking to yourself a suit of oilclothes as you may think best  i have gone with and without the suit and again recommend that they be left behind  i am inclined to think that the ordinary payment should be made for their use as otherwise it will appear to those whose trade it is to prepare them that you are injuring them in their vested rights  some three years since i visited niagara on my way back to england from bermuda and in a volume of travels which i then published i endeavored to explain the impression made upon me by this passage between the rock and the waterfall  an author should not quote himself but as i feel myself bound in writing a chapter specially about niagara to give some account of this strange position i will venture to repeat my own words  in the spot to which i allude the visitor stands on a broad safe path made of shingles between the rock over which the water rushes and the rushing water  he will go in so far that the spray rising back from the bed of the torrent does not incommode him with this exception the farther he can go in the better but circumstances will clearly show him the spot to which he should advance  unless the water be driven in by a very strong wind five yards make the difference between a comparatively dry coat and an absolutely wet one  and then let him stand with his back to the entrance thus hiding the last glimmer of the expiring day  so standing he will look up among the falling waters or down into the deep misty pit from which they reascend in almost as palpable a bulk  the rock will be at his right hand high and hard and dark and straight like the wall of some huge cavern such as children enter in their dreams  for the first five minutes he will be looking but at the waters of a cataractat the waters indeed of such a cataract as we know no other and at their interior curves which elsewhere we cannot see  but byandby all this will change  he will no longer be on a shingly path beneath a waterfall but that feeling of a cavern wall will grow upon him of a cavern deep below roaring seas in which the waves are there though they do not enter in upon him or rather not the waves but the very bowels of the ocean  he will feel as though the floods surrounded him coming and going with their wild sounds and he will hardly recognize that though among them he is not in them and they as they fall with a continual roar not hurting the ear but musical withal will seem to move as the vast ocean waters may perhaps move in their internal currents  he will lose the sense of one continued descent and think that they are passing round him in their appointed courses  the broken spray that rises from the depths below rises so strongly so palpably so rapidly that the motion in every direction will seem equal  and as he looks on strange colors will show themselves through the mist the shades of gray will become green or blue with ever and anon a flash of white and then when some gust of wind blows in with greater violence the seagirt cavern will become all dark and black  oh my friend let there be no one there to speak to thee then no not even a brother  as you stand there speak only to the waters  two miles below the falls the river is crossed by a suspension bridge of marvelous construction  it affords two thoroughfares one above the other  the lower road is for carriages and horses and the upper one bears a railway belonging to the great western canada line  the view from hence both up and down the river is very beautiful for the bridge is built immediately over the first of a series of rapids  one mile below the bridge these rapids end in a broad basin called the whirlpool and issuing out of this the current turns to the right through a narrow channel overhung by cliffs and trees and then makes its way down to lake ontario with comparative tranquillity  but i will beg you to take notice of those rapids from the bridge and to ask yourself what chance of life would remain to any ship craft or boat required by destiny to undergo navigation beneath the bridge and down into that whirlpool  heretofore all men would have said that no chance of life could remain to so illstarred a bark  the navigation however has been effected  but men used to the river still say that the chances would be fifty to one against any vessel which should attempt to repeat the experiment  the story of that wondrous voyage was as follows  a small steamer called the maid of the mist was built upon the river between the falls and the rapids and was used for taking adventurous tourists up amid the spray as near to the cataract as was possible  the maid of the mist plied in this way for a year or two and was i believe much patronized during the season  but in the early part of last summer an evil time had come  either the maid got into debt or her owner had embarked in other and less profitable speculations  at any rate he became subject to the law and tidings reached him that the sheriff would seize the maid  on most occasions the sheriff is bound to keep such intentions secret seeing that property is movable and that an insolvent debtor will not always await the officers of justice  but with the poor maid there was no need of such secrecy  there was but a mile or so of water on which she could ply and she was forbidden by the nature of her properties to make any way upon land the sheriffs prey therefore was easy and the poor maid was doomed  in any country in the world but america such would have been the case but an american would steam down phlegethon to save his property from the sheriffhe would steam down phlegethon or get some one else to do it for him  whether or no in this case the captain of the boat was the proprietor or whether as i was told he was paid for the job i do not know  but he determined to run the rapids and he procured two others to accompany him in the risk  he got up his steam and took the maid up amid the spray according to his custom  then suddenly turning on his course he with one of his companions fixed himself at the wheel while the other remained at his engine  i wish i could look into the mind of that man and understand what his thoughts were at that moment what were his thoughts and what his beliefs  as to one of the men i was told that he was carried down not knowing what he was about to do but i am inclined to believe that all the three were joined together in the attempt  i was told by a man who saw the boat pass under the bridge that she made one long leap down as she came thither that her funnel was at once knocked flat on the deck by the force of the blow that the waters covered her from stem to stern and that then she rose again and skimmed into the whirlpool a mile below  when there she rode with comparative ease upon the waters and took the sharp turn round into the river below without a struggle  the feat was done and the maid was rescued from the sheriff  it is said that she was sold below at the mouth of the river and carried from thence over lake ontario and down the st lawrence to quebec    chapter viii  north and west   from niagara we determined to proceed northwestas far to the northwest as we could go with any reasonable hope of finding american citizens in a state of political civilization and perhaps guided also in some measure by our hopes as to hotel accommodation looking to these two matters we resolved to get across to the mississippi and to go up that river as far as the town of st paul and the falls of st anthony which are some twelve miles above the town then to descend the river as far as the states of iowa on the west and illinois on the east and to return eastward through chicago and the large cities on the southern shores of lake erie from whence we would go across to albany the capital of new york state and down the hudson to new york the capital of the western world  for such a journey in which scenery was one great object we were rather late as we did not leave niagara till the 10th of october but though the winters are extremely cold through all this portion of the american continentfifteen twenty and even twentyfive degrees below zero being an ordinary state of the atmosphere in latitudes equal to those of florence nice and turinnevertheless the autumns are mild the noonday being always warm and the colors of the foliage are then in all their glory  i was also very anxious to ascertain if it might be in my power to do so with what spirit or true feeling as to the matter the work of recruiting for the now enormous army of the states was going on in those remote regions  that men should be on fire in boston and new york in philadelphia and along the borders of secession i could understand  i could understand also that they should be on fire throughout the cotton sugar and rice plantations of the south  but i could hardly understand that this political fervor should have communicated itself to the faroff farmers who had thinly spread themselves over the enormous wheatgrowing districts of the northwest  st paul the capital of minnesota is nine hundred miles directly north of st louis the most northern point to which slavery extends in the western states of the union and the farming lands of minnesota stretch away again for some hundreds of miles north and west of st paul  could it be that those scanty and faroff pioneers of agriculturethose frontier farmers who are nearly onehalf german and nearly the other half irish would desert their clearings and ruin their chances of progress in the world for distant wars of which the causes must as i thought be to them unintelligible  i had been told that distance had but lent enchantment to the view and that the war was even more popular in the remote and newlysettled states than in those which have been longer known as great political bodies  so i resolved that i would go and see  it may be as well to explain here that that great political union hitherto called the united states of america may be more properly divided into three than into two distinct interests in england we have long heard of north and south as pitted against each other and we have always understood that the southern politicians or democrats have prevailed over the northern politicians or republicans because they were assisted in their views by northern men of mark who have held southern principlesthat is by northern men who have been willing to obtain political power by joining themselves to the southern party  that as far as i can understand has been the general idea in england and in a broad way it has been true but as years have advanced and as the states have extended themselves westward a third large party has been formed which sometimes rejoices to call itself the great west and though at the present time the west and the north are joined together against the south the interests of the north and west are not i think more closely interwoven than are those of the west and south and when the final settlement of this question shall be made there will doubtless be great difficulty in satisfying the different aspirations and feelings of two great freesoil populations  the north i think will ultimately perceive that it will gain much by the secession of the south but it will be very difficult to make the west believe that secession will suit its views  i will attempt in a rough way to divide the states as they seem to divide themselves into these three parties  as to the majority of them there is no difficulty in locating them but this cannot be done with absolute certainty as to some few that lie on the borders  new england consists of six states of which all of course belong to the north  they are maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts rhode island and connecticutthe six states which should be most dear to england and in which the political success of the united states as a nation is to my eyes the most apparent but even in them there was till quite of late a strong section so opposed to the republican party as to give a material aid to the south  this i think was particularly so in new hampshire from whence president pierce came  he had been one of the senators from new hampshire and yet to him as president is affixed the disgracewhether truly affixed or not i do not sayof having first used his power in secretly organizing those arrangements which led to secession and assisted at its birth  in massachusetts itself also there was a strong democratic party of which massachusetts now seems to be somewhat ashamed  then to make up the north must be added the two great states of new york and pennsylvania and the small state of new jersey  the west will not agree even to this absolutely seeing that they claim all territory west of the alleghanies and that a portion of pennsylvania and some part also of new york lie westward of that range but in endeavoring to make these divisions ordinarily intelligible i may say that the north consists of the nine states above named  but the north will also claim maryland and delaware and the eastern half of virginia  the north will claim them though they are attached to the south by joint participation in the great social institution of slaveryfor maryland delaware and virginia are slave statesand i think that the north will ultimately make good its claim  maryland and delaware lie as it were behind the capital and eastern virginia is close upon the capital  and these regions are not tropical in their climate or influences  they are and have been slave states but will probably rid themselves of that taint and become a portion of the free north  the southern or slave states properly so called are easily defined  they are texas louisiana arkansas mississippi alabama florida georgia south carolina and north carolina  the south will also claim tennessee kentucky missouri virginia delaware and maryland and will endeavor to prove its right to the claim by the fact of the social institution being the law of the land in those states  of delaware maryland and eastern virginia i have already spoken  western virginia is i think so little tainted with slavery that as she stands even at present she properly belongs to the west  as i now write the struggle is going on in kentucky and missouri  in missouri the slave population is barely more than a tenth of the whole while in south carolina and mississippi it is more than half  and therefore i venture to count missouri among the western states although slavery is still the law of the land within its borders  it is surrounded on three sides by free states of the west and its soil let us hope must become free  kentucky i must leave as doubtful though i am inclined to believe that slavery will be abolished there also  kentucky at any rate will never throw in its lot with the southern states  as to tennessee it seceded heart and soul and i fear that it must be accounted as southern although the northern army has now in may 1862 possessed itself of the greater part of the state  to the great west remains an enormous territory of which however the population is as yet but scanty though perhaps no portion of the world has increased so fast in population as have these western states  the list is as follows ohio indiana illinois michigan wisconsin minnesota iowa kansas to which i would add missouri and probably the western half of virginia  we have then to account for the two already admitted states on the pacific california and oregon and also for the unadmitted territories dacotah nebraska washington utah new mexico colorado and nevada  i should be refining too much for my present very general purpose if i were to attempt to marshal these huge but thinlypopulated regions in either rank  of california and oregon it may probably be said that it is their ambition to form themselves into a separate divisiona division which may be called the farther west  i know that all statistical statements are tedious and i believe that but few readers believe them  i will however venture to give the populations of these states in the order i have named them seeing that power in america depends almost entirely on population  the census of 1860 gave the following results   in the north  maine               619000 new hampshire       326872 vermont             325827

                total                             31695923   each of the three interests would consider itself wronged by the division above made but the south would probably be the loudest in asserting its grievance  the south claims all the slave states and would point to secession in virginia to justify such claim and would point also to maryland and baltimore declaring that secession would be as strong there as at new orleans if secession were practicable  maryland and baltimore lie behind washington and are under the heels of the northern troops so that secession is not practicable but the south would say that they have seceded in heart  in this the south would have some show of reason for its assertion but nevertheless i shall best convey a true idea of the position of these states by classing them as doubtful  when secession shall have been accomplishedif ever it be accomplished it will hardly be possible that they should adhere to the south  it will be seen by the foregoing tables that the population of the west is nearly equal to that of the north and that therefore western power is almost as great as northern  it is almost as great already and as population in the west increases faster than it does in the north the two will soon be equalized  they are already sufficiently on a par to enable them to fight on equal terms and they will be prepared for fightingpolitical fighting if no otheras soon as they have established their supremacy over a common enemy  while i am on the subject of population i should explainthough the point is not one which concerns the present argumentthat the numbers given as they regard the south include both the whites and the blacks the free men and the slaves  the political power of the south is of course in the hands of the white race only and the total white population should therefore be taken as the number indicating the southern power  the political power of the south however as contrasted with that of the north has since the commencement of the union been much increased by the slave population  the slaves have been taken into account in determining the number of representatives which should be sent to congress by each state  that number depends on the population but it was decided in 1787 that in counting up the number of representatives to which each state should be held to be entitled five slaves should represent three white men  a southern population therefore of five thousand free men and five thousand slaves would claim as many representatives as a northern population of eight thousand free men although the voting would be confined to the free population  this has ever since been the law of the united states  the western power is nearly equal to that of the north and this fact somewhat exaggerated in terms is a frequent boast in the mouths of western men  we ran fremont for president they say and had it not been for northern men with southern principles we should have put him in the white house instead of the traitor buchanan  if that had been done there would have been no secession  how things might have gone had fremont been elected in lieu of buchanan i will not pretend to say but the nature of the argument shows the difference that exists between northern and western feeling  at the time that i was in the west general fremont was the great topic of public interest  every newspaper was discussing his conduct his ability as a soldier his energy and his fate  at that time general mcclellan was in command at washington on the potomac it being understood that he held his power directly under the president free from the exercise of control on the part of the veteran general scott though at that time general scott had not actually resigned his position as head of the army  and general fremont who some five years before had been run for president by the western states held another command of nearly equal independence in missouri  he had been put over general lyon in the western command and directly after this general lyon had fallen in battle at springfield in the first action in which the opposing armies were engaged in the west general fremont at once proceeded to carry matters with a very high hand on the 30th of august 1861 he issued a proclamation by which he declared martial law at st louis the city at which he held his headquarters and indeed throughout the state of missouri generally  in this proclamation he declared his intention of exercising a severity beyond that ever threatened as i believe in modern warfare  he defines the region presumed to be held by his army of occupation drawing his lines across the state and then declares that all persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within those lines shall be tried by courtmartial and if found guilty will be shot  he then goes on to say that he will confiscate all the property of persons in the state who shall have taken up arms against the union or shall have taken part with the enemies of the union and that he will make free all slaves belonging to such persons  this proclamation was not approved at washington and was modified by the order of the president  it was understood also that he issued orders for military expenditure which were not recognized at washington and men began to understand that the army in the west was gradually assuming that irresponsible military position which in disturbed countries and in times of civil war has so frequently resulted in a military dictatorship  then there arose a clamor for the removal of general fremont  a semiofficial account of his proceedings which had reached washington from an officer under his command was made public and also the correspondence which took place on the subject between the president and general fremonts wife  the officer in question was thereupon placed under arrest but immediately released by orders from washington  he then made official complaint of his general sending forward a list of charges in which fremont was accused of rashness incompetency want of fidelity of the interests of the government and disobedience to orders from headquarters  after awhile the secretary of war himself proceeded from washington to the quarters of general fremont at st louis and remained there for a day or two making or pretending to make inquiry into the matter  but when he returned he left the general still in command  during the whole month of october the papers were occupied in declaring in the morning that general fremont had been recalled from his command and in the evening that he was to remain  in the mean time they who befriended his cause and this included the whole west were hoping from day to day that he would settle the matter for himself and silence his accusers by some great military success  general price held the command opposed to him and men said that fremont would sweep general price and his army down the valley of the mississippi into the sea  but general price would not be so swept and it began to appear that a guerrilla warfare would prevail that general price if driven southward would reappear behind the backs of his pursuers and that general fremont would not accomplish all that was expected of him with that rapidity for which his friends had given him credit  so the newspapers still went on waging the war and every morning general fremont was recalled and every evening they who had recalled him were shown up as having known nothing of the matter  never mind he is a pioneer man and will do amost anything he puts his hand to his friends in the west still said  he understands the frontier  understanding the frontier is a great thing in western america across which the vanguard of civilization continues to march on in advance from year to year  and its he that is bound to sweep slavery from off the face of this continent hes the man and hes about the only man  i am not qualified to write the life of general fremont and can at present only make this slight reference to the details of his romantic career  that it has been full of romance and that the man himself is endued with a singular energy and a high romantic idea of what may be done by power and will there is no doubt  five times he has crossed the continent of north america from missouri to oregon and california enduring great hardships in the service of advancing civilization and knowledge  that he has considerable talent immense energy and strong selfconfidence i believe  he is a frontier manone of those who care nothing for danger and who would dare anything with the hope of accomplishing a great career but i have never heard that he has shown any practical knowledge of high military matters  it may be doubted whether a man of this stamp is well fitted to hold the command of a nations army for great national purposes  may it not even be presumed that a man of this class is of all men the least fitted for such a work  the officer required should be a man with two specialtiesa specialty for military tactics and a specialty for national duty  the army in the west was far removed from headquarters in washington and it was peculiarly desirable that the general commanding it should be one possessing a strong idea of obedience to the control of his own government  those frontier capabilitiesthat selfdependent energy for which his friends gave fremont and probably justly gave him such unlimited creditare exactly the qualities which are most dangerous in such a position  i have endeavored to explain the circumstances of the western command in missouri as they existed at the time when i was in the northwestern states in order that the double action of the north and west may be understood  i of course was not in the secret of any official persons but i could not but feel sure that the government in washington would have been glad to have removed fremont at once from the command had they not feared that by so doing they would have created a schism as it were in their own camp and have done much to break up the integrity or oneness of northern loyalty  the western people almost to a man desired abolition  the states there were sending out their tens of thousands of young men into the army with a prodigality as to their only source of wealth which they hardly recognized themselves because this to them was a fight against slavery  the western population has been increased to a wonderful degree by a german infusionso much so that the western towns appear to have been peopled with germans  i found regiments of volunteers consisting wholly of germans  and the germans are all abolitionists  to all the men of the west the name of fremont is dear  he is their hero and their hercules  he is to cleanse the stables of the southern king and turn the waters of emancipation through the foul stalls of slavery  and therefore though the cabinet in washington would have been glad for many reasons to have removed fremont in october last it was at first scared from committing itself to so strong a measure  at last however the charges made against him were too fully substantiated to allow of their being set on one side and early in november 1861 he was superseded  i shall be obliged to allude again to general fremonts career as i go on with my narrative  at this time the north was looking for a victory on the potomac but they were no longer looking for it with that impatience which in the summer had led to the disgrace at bulls run  they had recognized the fact that their troops must be equipped drilled and instructed and they had also recognized the perhaps greater fact that their enemies were neither weak cowardly nor badly officered  i have always thought that the tone and manner with which the north bore the defeat at bulls run was creditable to it it was never denied never explained away never set down as trifling  we have been whipped was what all northerners said weve got an almighty whipping and here we are  i have heard many englishmen complain of thissaying that the matter was taken almost as a joke that no disgrace was felt and that the licking was owned by a people who ought never to have allowed that they had been licked  to all this however i demur  their only chance of speedy success consisted in their seeing and recognizing the truth had they confessed the whipping and then sat down with their hands in their pocketshad they done as secondrate boys at school will do declare that they had been licked and then feel that all the trouble is overthey would indeed have been open to reproach  the old mother across the water would in such case have disowned her son  but they did the very reverse of this  i have been whipped jonathan said and he immediately went into training under a new system for another fight  and so all through september and october the great armies on the potomac rested comparatively in quietthe northern forces drawing to themselves immense levies  the general confidence in mcclellan was then very great and the cautious measures by which he endeavored to bring his vast untrained body of men under discipline were such as did at that time recommend themselves to most military critics  early in september the northern party obtained a considerable advantage by taking the fort at cape hatteras in north carolina situated on one of those long banks which lie along the shores of the southern states but toward the end of october they experienced a considerable reverse in an attack which was made on the secessionists by general stone and in which colonel baker was killed  colonel baker had been senator for oregon and was well known as an orator  taking all things together however nothing material had been done up to the end of october and at that time northern men were waitingnot perhaps impatiently considering the great hopes and perhaps great fears which filled their hearts but with eager expectationfor some event of which they might talk with pride  the man to whom they had trusted all their hopes was young for so great a command  i think that at this time october 1861 general mcclellan was not yet thirtyfive  he had served early in life in the mexican war having come originally from pennsylvania and having been educated at the military college at west point during our war with russia he was sent to the crimea by his own government in conjunction with two other officers of the united states army that they might learn all that was to be learned there as to military tactics and report especially as to the manner in which fortifications were made and attacked  i have been informed that a very able report was sent in by them to the government on their return and that this was drawn up by mcclellan  but in america a man is not only a soldier or always a soldier nor is he always a clergyman if once a clergyman he takes a spell at anything suitable that may be going  and in this way mcclellan was for some years engaged on the central illinois railway and was for a considerable time the head manager of that concern  we all know with what suddenness he rose to the highest command in the army immediately after the defeat at bulls run  i have endeavored to describe what were the feelings of the west in the autumn of 1861 with regard to the war  the excitement and eagerness there were very great and they were perhaps as great in the north  but in the north the matter seemed to me to be regarded from a different point of view  as a rule the men of the north are not abolitionists  it is quite certain that they were not so before secession began  they hate slavery as we in england hate it but they are aware as also are we that the disposition of four million of black men and women forms a question which cannot be solved by the chivalry of any modern orlando  the property invested in these four million slaves forms the entire wealth of the south  if they could be wafted by a philanthropic breeze back to the shores of africaa breeze of which the philanthropy would certainly not be appreciated by those so waftedthe south would be a wilderness  the subject is one as full of difficulty as any with which the politicians of these days are tormented  the northerners fully appreciate this and as a rule are not abolitionists in the western sense of the word  to them the war is recommended by precisely those feelings which animated us when we fought for our colonieswhen we strove to put down american independence secession is rebellion against the government and is all the more bitter to the north because that rebellion broke out at the first moment of northern ascendency  we submitted the north says to southern presidents and southern statesmen and southern councils because we obeyed the vote of the people  but as to youthe voice of the people is nothing in your estimation  at the first moment in which the popular vote places at washington a president with northern feelings you rebel  we submitted in your days and by heaven you shall submit in ours  we submitted loyally through love of the law and the constitution  you have disregarded the law and thrown over the constitution  but you shall be made to submit as a child is made to submit to its governor  it must also be remembered that on commercial questions the north and the west are divided  the morrill tariff is as odious to the west as it is to the south  the south and west are both agricultural productive regions desirous of sending cotton and corn to foreign countries and of receiving back foreign manufactures on the best terms  but the north is a manufacturing countrya poor manufacturing country as regards excellence of manufactureand therefore the more anxious to foster its own growth by protective laws  the morrill tariff is very injurious to the west and is odious there  i might add that its folly has already been so far recognized even in the north as to make it very generally odious there also  so much i have said endeavoring to make it understood how far the north and west were united in feeling against the south in the autumn of 1861 and how far there existed between them a diversity of interests    chapter ix  from niagara to the mississippi   from niagara we went by the canada great western railway to detroit the big city of michigan  it is an american institution that the states should have a commercial capitalor what i call their big cityas well as a political capital which may as a rule be called the states central city  the object in choosing the political capital is average nearness of approach from the various confines of the state but commerce submits to no such procrustean laws in selecting her capitals and consequently she has placed detroit on the borders of michigan on the shore of the neck of water which joins lake huron to lake erie through which all the trade must flow which comes down from lakes michigan superior and huron on its way to the eastern states and to europe  we had thought of going from buffalo across lake erie to detroit but we found that the better class of steamers had been taken off the waters for the winter  and we also found that navigation among these lakes is a mistake whenever the necessary journey can be taken by railway  their waters are by no means smooth and then there is nothing to be seen  i do not know whether others may have a feeling almost instinctive that lake navigation must be pleasantthat lakes must of necessity be beautiful  i have such a feeling but not now so strongly as formerly  such an idea should be kept for use in europe and never brought over to america with other traveling gear  the lakes in america are cold cumbrous uncouth and uninterestingintended by nature for the conveyance of cereal produce but not for the comfort of traveling men and women  so we gave up our plan of traversing the lake and passing back into canada by the suspension bridge at niagara we reached the detroit river at windsor by the great western line and passed thence by the ferry into the city of detroit  in making this journey at night we introduced ourselves to the thoroughly american institution of sleepingcarsthat is of cars in which beds are made up for travelers  the traveler may have a whole bed or half a bed or no bed at all as he pleases paying a dollar or half a dollar extra should he choose the partial or full fruition of a couch  i confess i have always taken a delight in seeing these beds made up and consider that the operations of the change are generally as well executed as the manoeuvres of any pantomime at drury lane  the work is usually done by negroes or colored men and the domestic negroes of america are always light handed and adroit  the nature of an american car is no doubt known to all men  it looks as far removed from all bedroom accommodation as the bakers barrow does from the steam engine into which it is to be converted by harlequins wand  but the negro goes to work much more quietly than the harlequin and for every four seats in the railway car he builds up four beds almost as quickly as the hero of the pantomime goes through his performance the great glory of the americans is in their wondrous contrivances in their patent remedies for the usually troublous operations of life  in their huge hotels all the bell ropes of each house ring on one bell only but a patent indicator discloses a number and the whereabouts of the ringer is shown  one fire heats every room passage hall and cupboard and does it so effectually that the inhabitants are all but stifled  sodawater bottles open themselves without any trouble of wire or strings  men and women go up and down stairs without motive power of their own  hot and cold water are laid on to all the chambers though it sometimes happens that the water from both taps is boiling and that when once turned on it cannot be turned off again by any human energy everything is done by a new and wonderful patent contrivance and of all their wonderful contrivances that of their railroad beds is by no means the least  for every four seats the negro builds up four bedsthat is four half beds or accommodation for four persons  two are supposed to be below on the level of the ordinary four seats and two up above on shelves which are let down from the roof  mattresses slip out from one nook and pillows from another  blankets are added and the bed is ready  any over particular individualan islander for instance who hugs his chainswill generally prefer to pay the dollar for the double accommodation  looking at the bed in the light of a bedtaking as it were an abstract view of itor comparing it with some other bed or beds with which the occupant may have acquaintance i cannot say that it is in all respects perfect  but distances are long in america and he who declines to travel by night will lose very much time  he who does so travel will find the railway bed a great relief  i must confess that the feeling of dirt on the following morning is rather oppressive  from windsor on the canada side we passed over to detroit in the state of michigan by a steam ferry  but ferries in england and ferries in america are very different  here on this detroit ferry some hundred of passengers who were going forward from the other side without delay at once sat down to breakfast  i may as well explain the way in which disposition is made of ones luggage as one takes these long journeys  the traveler when he starts has his baggage checked  he abandons his trunkgenerally a box studded with nails as long as a coffin and as high as a linen chestand in return for this he receives an iron ticket with a number on it  as he approaches the end of his first installment of travel and while the engine is still working its hardest a man comes up to him bearing with him suspended on a circular bar an infinite variety of other checks  the traveler confides to this man his wishes and if he be going farther without delay surrenders his check and receives a countercheck in return  then while the train is still in motion the new destiny of the trunk is imparted to it  but another man with another set of checks also comes the way walking leisurely through the train as he performs his work  this is the minister of the hotelomnibus institution his business is with those who do not travel beyond the next terminus  to him if such be your intention you make your confidence giving up your tallies and taking other tallies by way of receipt and your luggage is afterward found by you in the hall of your hotel  there is undoubtedly very much of comfort in this and the mind of the traveler is lost in amazement as he thinks of the futile efforts with which he would struggle to regain his luggage were there no such arrangement  enormous piles of boxes are disclosed on the platform at all the larger stations the numbers of which are roared forth with quick voice by some two or three railway denizens at once  a modest english voyager with six or seven small packages would stand no chance of getting anything if he were left to his own devices  as it is i am bound to say that the thing is well done  i have had my desk with all my money in it lost for a day and my black leather bag was on one occasion sent back over the line  they however were recovered and on the whole i feel grateful to the check system of the american railways  and then too one never hears of extra luggage  of weight they are quite regardless  on two or three occasions an overwrought official has muttered between his teeth that ten packages were a great many and that some of those light fixings might have been made up into one  and when i came to understand that the number of every check was entered in a book and re entered at every change i did whisper to my wife that she ought to do without a bonnet box  the ten however went on and were always duly protected  i must add however that articles requiring tender treatment will sometimes reappear a little the worse from the hardships of their journey  i have not much to say of detroitnot much that is beyond what i have to say of all the north  it is a large wellbuilt half finished city lying on a convenient waterway and spreading itself out with promises of a wide and still wider prosperity  it has about it perhaps as little of intrinsic interest as any of those large western towns which i visited  it is not so pleasant as milwaukee nor so picturesque as st paul nor so grand as chicago nor so civilized as cleveland nor so busy as buffalo  indeed detroit is neither pleasant nor picturesque at all  i will not say that it is uncivilized but it has a harsh crude unprepossessing appearance  it has some 70000 inhabitants and good accommodation for shipping  it was doing an enormous business before the war began and when these troublous times are over will no doubt again go ahead  i do not however think it well to recommend any englishman to make a special visit to detroit who may be wholly uncommercial in his views and travel in search of that which is either beautiful or interesting  from detroit we continued our course westward across the state of michigan through a country that was absolutely wild till the railway pierced it very much of it is still absolutely wild  for miles upon miles the road passes the untouched forest showing that even in michigan the great work of civilization has hardly more than been commenced  one thinks of the all but countless population which is before long to be fed from these regionsof the cities which will grow here and of the amount of government which in due time will be requiredone can hardly fail to feel that the division of the united states into separate nationalities is merely a part of the ordained work of creation as arranged for the wellbeing of mankind  the states already boast of thirty millions of inhabitantsnot of unnoticed and unnoticeable beings requiring little knowing little and doing little such as are the eastern hordes which may be counted by tens of millions but of men and women who talk loudly and are ambitious who eat beef who read and write and understand the dignity of manhood  but these thirty millions are as nothing to the crowds which will grow sleek and talk loudly and become aggressive on these wheat and meat producing levels  the country is as yet but touched by the pioneering hand of population  in the old countries agriculture following on the heels of pastoral patriarchal life preceded the birth of cities  but in this young world the cities have come first  the new jasons blessed with the experience of the old world adventurers have gone forth in search of their golden fleeces armed with all that the science and skill of the east had as yet produced and in settling up their new colchis have begun by the erection of first class hotels and the fabrication of railroads  let the old world bid them god speed in their work only it would be well if they could be brought to acknowledge from whence they have learned all that they know  our route lay right across the state to a place called grand haven on lake michigan from whence we were to take boat for milwaukee a town in wisconsin on the opposite or western shore of the lake michigan is sometimes called the peninsular state from the fact that the main part of its territory is surrounded by lakes michigan and huron by the little lake st clair and by lake erie  it juts out to the northward from the main land of indiana and ohio and is circumnavigable on the east north and west  these particulars however refer to a part of the state only for a portion of it lies on the other side of lake michigan between that and lake superior  i doubt whether any large inland territory in the world is blessed with such facilities of water carriage  on arriving at grand haven we found that there had been a storm on the lake and that the passengers from the trains of the preceding day were still remaining there waiting to be carried over to milwaukee  the water howeveror the sea as they all call itwas still very high and the captain declared his intention of remaining there that night whereupon all our fellowtravelers huddled themselves into the great lake steamboat and proceeded to carry on life there as though they were quite at home  the men took themselves to the barroom and smoked cigars and talked about the war with their feet upon the counter and the women got themselves into rockingchairs in the saloon and sat there listless and silent but not more listless and silent than they usually are in the big drawingrooms of the big hotels  there was supper there precisely at six oclockbeefsteaks and tea and apple jam and hot cakes and light fixings to all which luxuries an american deems himself entitled let him have to seek his meal where he may  and i was soon informed with considerable energy that let the boat be kept there as long as it might by stress of weather the beefsteaks and apple jam light fixings and heavy fixings must be supplied at the cost of the owners of the ship your first supper you pay for my informant told me because you eat that on your own account  what you consume after that comes of their doing because they dont start and if its three meals a day for a week its their look out  it occurred to me that under such circumstances a captain would be very apt to sail either in foul weather or in fair  it was a bright moonlight nightmoonlight such as we rarely have in englandand i started off by myself for a walk that i might see of what nature were the environs of grand haven  a more melancholy place i never beheld  the town of grand haven itself is placed on the opposite side of a creek and was to be reached by a ferry  on our side to which the railway came and from which the boat was to sail there was nothing to be seen but sand hills which stretched away for miles along the shore of the lake  there were great sand mountains and sand valleys on the surface of which were scattered the debris of dead trees scattered logs white with age and boughs half buried beneath the sand  grand haven itself is but a poor place not having succeeded in catching much of the commerce which comes across the lake from wisconsin and which takes itself on eastward by the railway  altogether it is a dreary place such as might break a mans heart should he find that inexorable fate required him there to pitch his tent  on my return i went down into the barroom of the steamer put my feet upon the counter lit my cigar and struck into the debate then proceeding on the subject of the war  i was getting west and general fremont was the hero of the hour  hes a frontier man and thats what we want  i guess hell about go through  yes sir  as for relieving general fremont with the accent always strongly on the mont i guess you may as well talk of relieving the whole west  they wont meddle with fremont  they are beginning to know in washington what stuff hes made of  why sir there are 50000 men in these states who will follow fremont who would not stir a foot after any other man  from which and the like of it in many other places i began to understand how difficult was the task which the statesmen in washington had in hand  i received no pecuniary advantage whatever from that law as to the steamboat meals which my new friend had revealed to me  for my one supper of course i paid looking forward to any amount of subsequent gratuitous provisions  but in the course of the night the ship sailed and we found ourselves at milwaukee in time for breakfast on the following morning  milwaukee is a pleasant town a very pleasant town containing 45000 inhabitants  how many of my readers can boast that they know anything of milwaukee or even have heard of it  to me its name was unknown until i saw it on huge railway placards stuck up in the smokingrooms and lounging halls of all american hotels  it is the big town of wisconsin whereas madison is the capital  it stands immediately on the western shore of lake michigan and is very pleasant  why it should be so and why detroit should be the contrary i can hardly tell only i think that the same verdict would be given by any english tourist  it must be always borne in mind that 10000 or 40000 inhabitants in an american town and especially in any new western town is a number which means much more than would be implied by any similar number as to an old town in europe  such a population in america consumes double the amount of beef which it would in england wears double the amount of clothes and demands double as much of the comforts of life  if a census could be taken of the watches it would be found i take it that the american population possessed among them nearly double as many as would the english and i fear also that it would be found that many more of the americans were readers and writers by habit in any large town in england it is probable that a higher excellence of education would be found than in milwaukee and also a style of life into which more of refinement and more of luxury had found its way  but the general level of these things of material and intellectual wellbeingof beef that is and book learningis no doubt infinitely higher in a new american than in an old european town  such an animal as a beggar is as much unknown as a mastodon  men out of work and in want are almost unknown  i do not say that there are none of the hardships of lifeand to them i will come byandbybut want is not known as a hardship in these towns nor is that dense ignorance in which so large a proportion of our town populations is still steeped  and then the town of 40000 inhabitants is spread over a surface which would suffice in england for a city of four times the size  our towns in englandand the towns indeed of europe generallyhave been built as they have been wanted  no aspiring ambition as to hundreds of thousands of people warmed the bosoms of their first founders  two or three dozen men required habitations in the same locality and clustered them together closely  many such have failed and died out of the worlds notice  others have thriven and houses have been packed on to houses till london and manchester dublin and glasgow have been produced  poor men have built or have had built for them wretched lanes and rich men have erected grand palaces  from the nature of their beginnings such has of necessity been the manner of their creation  but in america and especially in western america there has been no such necessity and there is no such result  the founders of cities have had the experience of the world before them  they have known of sanitary laws as they began  that sewerage and water and gas and good air would be needed for a thriving community has been to them as much a matter of fact as are the wellunderstood combinations between timber and nails and bricks and mortar  they have known that water carriage is almost a necessity for commercial success and have chosen their sites accordingly  broad streets cost as little while land by the foot is not as yet of value to be regarded as those which are narrow and therefore the sites of towns have been prepared with noble avenues and imposing streets a city at its commencement is laid out with an intention that it shall be populous  the houses are not all built at once but there are the places allocated for them  the streets are not made but there are the spaces  many an abortive attempt at municipal greatness has so been made and then all but abandoned  there are wretched villages with huge straggling parallel ways which will never grow into towns  they are the failuresfailures in which the pioneers of civilization frontier men as they call themselves have lost their tens of thousands of dollars  but when the success comes when the happy hit has been made and the ways of commerce have been truly foreseen with a cunning eye then a great and prosperous city springs up ready made as it were from the earth such a town is milwaukee now containing 45000 inhabitants but with room apparently for double that number with room for four times that number were men packed as closely there as they are with us  in the principal business streets of all these towns one sees vast buildings  they are usually called blocks and are often so denominated in large letters on their front as portland block devereux block buels block  such a block may face to two three or even four streets and as i presume has generally been a matter of one special speculation  it may be divided into separate houses or kept for a single purpose such as that of a hotel or grouped into shops below and into various sets of chambers above i have had occasion in various towns to mount the stairs within these blocks and have generally found some portion of them vacant have sometimes found the greater portion of them vacant  men build on an enormous scale three times ten times as much as is wanted  the only measure of size is an increase on what men have built before  monroe p jones the speculator is very probably ruined and then begins the world again nothing daunted  but joness block remains and gives to the city in its aggregate a certain amount of wealth  or the block becomes at once of service and finds tenants  in which case jones probably sells it and immediately builds two others twice as big  that monroe p jones will encounter ruin is almost a matter of course but then he is none the worse for being ruined  it hardly makes him unhappy  he is greedy of dollars with a terrible covetousness but he is greedy in order that he may speculate more widely  he would sooner have built joness tenth block with a prospect of completing a twentieth than settle himself down at rest for life as the owner of a chatsworth or a woburn  as for his children he has no desire of leaving them money  let the girls marry  and for the boysfor them it will be good to begin as he begun  if they cannot build blocks for themselves let them earn their bread in the blocks of other men  so monroe p jones with his million of dollars accomplished advances on to a new frontier goes to work again on a new city and loses it all  as an individual i differ very much from monroe p jones  the first block accomplished with an adequate rent accruing to me as the builder i fancy that i should never try a second  but jones is undoubtedly the man for the west it is that love of money to come joined to a strong disregard for money made which constitutes the vigorous frontier mind the true pioneering organization  monroe p jones would be a great man to all posterity if only he had a poet to sing of his valor  it may be imagined how large in proportion to its inhabitants will be a town which spreads itself in this way  there are great houses left untenanted and great gaps left unfilled  but if the place be successful if it promise success it will be seen at once that there is life all through it  omnibuses or street cars working on rails run hither and thither  the shops that have been opened are well filled  the great hotels are thronged  the quays are crowded with vessels and a general feeling of progress pervades the place it is easy to perceive whether or no an american town is going ahead  the days of my visit to milwaukee were days of civil war and national trouble but in spite of civil war and national trouble milwaukee looked healthy  i have said that there was but little povertylittle to be seen of real want in these thriving townsbut that they who labored in them had nevertheless their own hardships  this is so  i would not have any man believe that he can take himself to the western states of americato those states of which i am now speaking michigan wisconsin minnesota iowa or illinois and there by industry escape the ills to which flesh is heir  the laboring irish in these towns eat meat seven days a week but i have met many a laboring irishman among them who has wished himself back in his old cabin  industry is a good thing and there is no bread so sweet as that which is eaten in the sweat of a mans brow but labor carried to excess wearies the mind as well as body and the sweat that is ever running makes the bread bitter  there is i think no taskmaster over free labor so exacting as an american he knows nothing of hours and seems to have that idea of a man which a lady always has of a horse  he thinks that he will go forever  i wish those masons in london who strike for nine hours work with ten hours pay could be driven to the labor market of western america for a spell  and moreover which astonished me i have seen men driven and hurried as it were forced forward at their work in a manner which to an english workman would be intolerable  this surprised me much as it was at variance with ouror perhaps i should say with mypreconceived ideas as to american freedom  i had fancied that an american citizen would not submit to be driven that the spirit of the country if not the spirit of the individual would have made it impossible  i thought that the shoe would have pinched quite on the other foot  but i found that such driving did exist and american masters in the west with whom i had an opportunity of discussing the subject all admitted it  those menll never half move unless theyre driven a foreman said to me once as we stood together over some twenty men who were at their work  they kinder look for it and dont well know how to get along when they miss it  it was not his business at this moment to drivenor was he driving  he was standing at some little distance from the scene with me and speculating on the sight before him  i thought the men were working at their best but their movements did not satisfy his practiced eye and he saw at a glance that there was no one immediately over them  but there is worse even than this  wages in these regions are what we should call high  an agricultural laborer will earn perhaps fifteen dollars a month and his board and a town laborer will earn a dollar a day  a dollar may be taken as representing four shillings though it is in fact more  food in these parts is much cheaper than in england and therefore the wages must be considered as very good  in making however a just calculation it must be borne in mind that clothing is dearer than in england and that much more of it is necessary  the wages nevertheless are high and will enable the laborer to save money if only he can get them paid  the complaint that wages are held back and not even ultimately paid is very common  there is no fixed rule for satisfying all such claims once a week and thus debts to laborers are contracted and when contracted are ignored  with us there is a feeling that it is pitiful mean almost beyond expression to wrong a laborer of his hire  we have men who go in debt to tradesmen perhaps without a thought of paying them but when we speak of such a one who has descended into the lowest mire of insolvency we say that he has not paid his washerwoman  out there in the west the washerwoman is as fair game as the tailor the domestic servant as the wine merchant  if a man be honest he will not willingly take either goods or labor without payment and it may be hard to prove that he who takes the latter is more dishonest than he who takes the former but with us there is a prejudice in favor of ones washerwoman by which the western mind is not weakened  they certainly have to be smart to get it a gentleman said to me whom i had taxed on the subject  you see on the frontier a man is bound to be smart  if he aint smart hed better go back east perhaps as far as europe hell do there  i had got my answer and my friend had turned the question but the fact was admitted by him as it had been by many others  why this should be so is a question to answer which thoroughly would require a volume in itself  as to the driving why should men submit to it seeing that labor is abundant and that in all newlysettled countries the laborer is the true hero of the age in answer to this is to be alleged the fact that hired labor is chiefly done by fresh comers by irish and germans who have not as yet among them any combination sufficient to protect them from such usage  the men over them are new as masters masters who are rough themselves who themselves have been roughly driven and who have not learned to be gracious to those below them  it is a part of their contract that very hard work shall be exacted and the driving resolves itself into this that the master looking after his own interest is constantly accusing his laborer of a breach of his part of the contract  the men no doubt do become used to it and slacken probably in their endeavors when the tongue of the master or foreman is not heard  but as to that matter of non payment of wages the men must live and here as elsewhere the master who omits to pay once will hardly find laborers in future the matter would remedy itself elsewhere and does it not do so here  this of course is so and it is not to be understood that labor as a rule is defrauded of its hire  but the relation of the master and the man admit of such fraud here much more frequently than in england  in england the laborer who did not get his wages on the saturday could not go on for the next week  to him under such circumstances the world would be coming to an end  but in the western states the laborer does not live so completely from hand to mouth  he is rarely paid by the week is accustomed to give some credit and till hard pressed by bad circumstances generally has something by him  they do save money and are thus fattened up to a state which admits of victimization  i cannot owe money to the little village cobbler who mends my shoes because he demands and receives his payment when his job is done  but to my friend in regent street i extend my custom on a different system and when i make my start for continental life i have with him a matter of unsettled business to a considerable extent  the american laborer is in the condition of the regent street bootmaker excepting in this respect that he gives his credit under compulsion  but does not the law set him right  is there no law against debtors  the laws against debtors are plain enough as they are written down but seem to be anything but plain when called into action  they are perfectly understood and operations are carried on with the express purpose of evading them  if you proceed against a man you find that his property is in the hands of some one else  you work in fact for jones who lives in the street next to you but when you quarrel with jones about your wages you find that according to law you have been working for smith in another state  in all countries such dodges are probably practicable  but men will or will not have recourse to such dodges according to the light in which they are regarded by the community in the western states such dodges do not appear to be regarded as disgraceful  it behoves a frontier man to be smart sir  honesty is the best policy  that is a doctrine which has been widely preached and which has recommended itself to many minds as being one of absolute truth  it is not very ennobling in its sentiment seeing that it advocates a special virtue not on the ground that that virtue is in itself a thing beautiful but on account of the immediate reward which will be its consequence smith is enjoined not to cheat jones because he will in the long run make more money by dealing with jones on the square  this is not teaching of the highest order but it is teaching well adapted to human circumstances and has obtained for itself a wide credit one is driven however to doubt whether even this teaching is not too high for the frontier man  is it possible that a frontier man should be scrupulous and at the same time successful  hitherto those who have allowed scruples to stand in their way have not succeeded and they who have succeeded and made for themselves great names who have been the pioneers of civilization have not allowed ideas of exact honesty to stand in their way  from general jason down to general fremont there have been men of great aspirations but of slight scruples  they have been ambitious of power and desirous of progress but somewhat regardless how power and progress shall be attained  clive and warren hastings were great frontier men but we cannot imagine that they had ever realized the doctrine that honesty is the best policy  cortez and even columbus the prince of frontier men are in the same category  the names of such heroes is legion but with none of them has absolute honesty been a favorite virtue  it behoves a frontier man to be smart sir  such in that or other language has been the prevailing idea  such is the prevailing idea  and one feels driven to ask ones self whether such must not be the prevailing idea with those who leave the world and its rules behind them and go forth with the resolve that the world and its rules shall follow them  of filibustering annexation and polishing savages off the face of creation there has been a great deal and who can deny that humanity has been the gainer  it seems to those who look widely back over history that all such works have been carried on in obedience to gods laws  when jacob by rebeccas aid cheated his elder brother he was very smart but we cannot but suppose that a better race was by this smartness put in possession of the patriarchal scepter  esau was polished off and readers of scripture wonder why heaven with its thunder did not open over the heads of rebecca and her son  but jacob with all his fraud was the chosen one  perhaps the day may come when scrupulous honesty may be the best policy even on the frontier  i can only say that hitherto that day seems to be as distant as ever  i do not pretend to solve the problem but simply record my opinion that under circumstances as they still exist i should not willingly select a frontier life for my children  i have said that all great frontier men have been unscrupulous there is however an exception in history which may perhaps serve to prove the rule  the puritans who colonized new england were frontier men and were i think in general scrupulously honest they had their faults  they were stern austere men tyrannical at the backbone when power came in their way as are all pioneers hard upon vices for which they who made the laws had themselves no minds but they were not dishonest  at milwaukee i went up to see the wisconsin volunteers who were then encamped on open ground in the close vicinity of the town  of wisconsin i had heard beforeand have heard the same opinion repeated sincethat it was more backward in its volunteering than its neighbor states in the west  wisconsin has 760000 inhabitants and its tenth thousand of volunteers was not then made up whereas indiana with less than double its number had already sent out thirtysix thousand  iowa with a hundred thousand less of inhabitants had then made up fifteen thousand  but nevertheless to me it seemed that wisconsin was quite alive to its presumed duty in that respect  wisconsin with its threequarters of a million of people is as large as england  every acre of it may be made productive but as yet it is not half cleared  of such a country its young men are its hearts blood  ten thousand men fit to bear arms carried away from such a land to the horrors of civil war is a sight as full of sadness as any on which the eye can rest  ah me when will they return and with what altered hopes  it is i fear easier to turn the sickle into the sword than to recast the sword back again into the sickle  we found a completed regiment at wisconsin consisting entirely of germans  a thousand germans had been collected in that state and brought together in one regiment and i was informed by an officer on the ground that there are many germans in sundry other of the wisconsin regiments  it may be well to mention here that the number of germans through all these western states is very great their number and wellbeing were to me astonishing  that they form a great portion of the population of new york making the german quarter of that city the third largest german town in the world i have long known but i had no previous idea of their expansion westward  in detroit nearly every third shop bore a german name and the same remark was to be made at milwaukee and on all hands i heard praises of their morals of their thrift and of their new patriotism  i was continually told how far they exceeded the irish settlers  to me in all parts of the world an irishman is dear when handled tenderly he becomes a creature most lovable  but with all my judgment in the irishmans favor and with my prejudices leaning the same way i feel myself bound to state what i heard and what i saw as to the germans  but this regiment of germans and another not completed regiment called from the state generally were as yet without arms accouterments or clothing  there was the raw material of the regiment but there was nothing else  winter was coming onwinter in which the mercury is commonly twenty degrees below zeroand the men were in tents with no provision against the cold  these tents held each two men and were just large enough for two to lie  the canvas of which they were made seemed to me to be thin but was i think always double  at this camp there was a house in which the men took their meals but i visited other camps in which there was no such accommodation  i saw the german regiment called to its supper by tuck of drum and the men marched in gallantly armed each with a knife and spoon  i managed to make my way in at the door after them and can testify to the excellence of the provisions of which their supper consisted  a poor diet never enters into any combination of circumstances contemplated by an american  let him be where he will animal food is with him the first necessary of life and he is always provided accordingly  as to those wisconsin men whom i saw it was probable that they might be marched off down south to washington or to the doubtful glories of the western campaign under fremont before the winter commenced  the same might have been said of any special regiment but taking the whole mass of men who were collected under canvas at the end of the autumn of 1861 and who were so collected without arms or military clothing and without protection from the weather it did seem that the task taken in hand by the commissariat of the northern army was one not devoid of difficulty  the view from milwaukee over lake michigan is very pleasing  one looks upon a vast expanse of water to which the eye finds no bounds and therefore there are none of the common attributes of lake beauty but the color of the lake is bright and within a walk of the city the traveler comes to the bluffs or low roundtopped hills from which we can look down upon the shores  these bluffs form the beauty of wisconsin and minnesota and relieve the eye after the flat level of michigan  round detroit there is no rising ground and therefore perhaps it is that detroit is uninteresting  i have said that those who are called on to labor in these states have their own hardships and i have endeavored to explain what are the sufferings to which the town laborer is subject  to escape from this is the laborers great ambition and his mode of doing so consists almost universally in the purchase of land  he saves up money in order that he may buy a section of an allotment and thus become his own master  all his savings are made with a view to this independence  seated on his own land he will have to work probably harder than ever but he will work for himself  no task master can then stand over him and wound his pride with harsh words  he will be his own master will eat the food which he himself has grown and live in the cabin which his own hands have built  this is the object of his life and to secure this position he is content to work late and early and to undergo the indignities of previous servitude  the government price for land is about five shillings an acreone dollar and a quarterand the settler may get it for this price if he be contented to take it not only untouched as regards clearing but also far removed from any completed road  the traffic in these lands has been the great speculating business of western men  five or six years ago when the rage for such purchases was at its height land was becoming a scarce article in the market  individuals or companies bought it up with the object of reselling it at a profit and many no doubt did make money  railway companies were in fact companies combined for the purchase of land  they purchased land looking to increase the value of it fivefold by the opening of a railroad  it may easily be understood that a railway which could not be in itself remunerative might in this way become a lucrative speculation  no settler could dare to place himself absolutely at a distance from any thoroughfare  at first the margins of natures highways the navigable rivers and lakes were cleared  but as the railway system grew and expanded itself it became manifest that lands might be rendered quickly available which were not so circumstanced by nature  a company which had purchased an enormous territory from the united states government at five shillings an acre might well repay itself all the cost of a railway through that territory even though the receipts of the railway should do no more than maintain the current expenses  it is in this way that the thousands of miles of american railroads have been opened and here again must be seen the immense advantages which the states as a new country have enjoyed  with us the purchase of valuable land for railways together with the legal expenses which those compulsory purchases entailed have been so great that with all our traffic railways are not remunerative  but in the states the railways have created the value of the land  the states have been able to begin at the right end and to arrange that the districts which are benefited shall themselves pay for the benefit they receive  the government price of land is 125 cents or about five shillings an acre and even this need not be paid at once if the settler purchase directly from the government  he must begin by making certain improvements on the selected landclearing and cultivating some small portion building a hut and probably sinking a well when this has been donewhen he has thus given a pledge of his intentions by depositing on the land the value of a certain amount of labor he cannot be removed  he cannot be removed for a term of years and then if he pays the price of the land it becomes his own with an indefeasible title  many such settlements are made on the purchase of warrants for land  soldiers returning from the mexican wars were donated with warrants for landthe amount being 160 acres or the quarter of a section  the localities of such lands were not specified but the privilege granted was that of occupying any quartersection not hitherto tenanted  it will of course be understood that lands favorably situated would be tenanted  those contiguous to railways were of course so occupied seeing that the lines were not made till the lands were in the hands of the companies  it may therefore be understood of what nature would be the traffic in these warrants  the owner of a single warrant might find it of no value to him  to go back utterly into the woods away from river or road and there to commence with 160 acres of forest or even of prairie would be a hopeless task even to an american settler  some mode of transport for his produce must be found before his produce would be of valuebefore indeed he could find the means of living  but a company buying up a large aggregate of such warrants would possess the means of making such allotments valuable and of reselling them at greatly increased prices  the primary settler thereforewho however will not usually have been the primary ownergoes to work upon his land amid all the wildness of nature  he levels and burns the first trees and raises his first crop of corn amid stumps still standing four or five feet above the soil but he does not do so till some mode of conveyance has been found for him  so much i have said hoping to explain the mode in which the frontier speculator paves the way for the frontier agriculturist  but the permanent farmer very generally comes on the land as the third owner  the first settler is a rough fellow and seems to be so wedded to his rough life that he leaves his land after his first wild work is done and goes again farther off to some untouched allotment  he finds that he can sell his improvements at a profitable rate and takes the price he is a preparer of farms rather than a farmer  he has no love for the soil which his hand has first turned  he regards it merely as an investment and when things about him are beginning to wear an aspect of comfort when his property has become valuable he sells it packs up his wife and little ones and goes again into the woods  the western american has no love for his own soil or his own house  the matter with him is simply one of dollars  to keep a farm which he could sell at an advantage from any feeling of affectionfrom what we should call an association of ideaswould be to him as ridiculous as the keeping of a family pig would be in an english farmers establishment  the pig is a part of the farmers stock in trade and must go the way of all pigs  and so is it with house and land in the life of the frontier man in the western states  but yet this man has his romance his high poetic feeling and above all his manly dignity  visit him and you will find him without coat or waistcoat unshorn in ragged blue trowsers and old flannel shirt too often bearing on his lantern jaws the signs of ague and sickness but he will stand upright before you and speak to you with all the ease of a lettered gentleman in his own library  all the odious incivility of the republican servant has been banished  he is his own master standing on his own threshold and finds no need to assert his equality by rudeness he is delighted to see you and bids you sit down on his battered bench without dreaming of any such apology as an english cottier offers to a lady bountiful when she calls  he has worked out his independence and shows it in every easy movement of his body  he tells you of it unconsciously in every tone of his voice  you will always find in his cabin some newspaper some book some token of advance in education  when he questions you about the old country he astonishes you by the extent of his knowledge  i defy you not to feel that he is superior to the race from whence he has sprung in england or in ireland  to me i confess that the manliness of such a man is very charming  he is dirty and perhaps squalid his children are sick and he is without comforts  his wife is pale and you think you see shortness of life written in the faces of all the family  but over and above it all there is an independence which sits gracefully on their shoulders and teaches you at the first glance that the man has a right to assume himself to be your equal  it is for this position that the laborer works bearing hard words and the indignity of tyranny suffering also too often the dishonest ill usage which his superior power enables the master to inflict  i have lived very rough i heard a poor woman say whose husband had ill used and deserted her  i have known what it is to be hungry and cold and to work hard till my bones have ached  i only wish that i might have the same chance again  if i could have ten acres cleared two miles away from any living being i could be happy with my children  i find a kind of comfort when i am at work from daybreak to sundown and know that it is all my own  i believe that life in the backwoods has an allurement to those who have been used to it that dwellers in cities can hardly comprehend  from milwaukee we went across wisconsin and reached the mississippi at la crosse  from hence according to agreement we were to start by steamer at once up the river  but we were delayed again as had happened to us before on lake michigan at grand haven    chapter x  the upper mississippi   it had been promised to us that we should start from la crosse by the river steamer immediately on our arrival there but on reaching la crosse we found that the vessel destined to take us up the river had not yet come down  she was bringing a regiment from minnesota and under such circumstances some pardon might be extended to irregularities  this plea was made by one of the boat clerks in a very humble tone and was fully accepted by us  the wonder was that at such a period all means of public conveyance were not put absolutely out of gear  one might surmise that when regiments were constantly being moved for the purposes of civil warwhen the whole north had but the one object of collecting together a sufficient number of men to crush the southordinary traveling for ordinary purposes would be difficult slow and subject to sudden stoppages  such however was not the case either in the northern or western states  the trains ran much as usual and those connected with the boats and railways were just as anxious as ever to secure passengers  the boat clerk at la crosse apologized amply for the delay and we sat ourselves down with patience to await the arrival of the second minnesota regiment on its way to washington  during the four hours that we were kept waiting we were harbored on board a small steamer and at about eleven the terribly harsh whistle that is made by the mississippi boats informed us that the regiment was arriving  it came up to the quay in two steamers750 being brought in that which was to take us back and 250 in a smaller one  the moon was very bright and great flaming torches were lit on the vessels side so that all the operations of the men were visible  the two steamers had run close up thrusting us away from the quay in their passage but doing it so gently that we did not even feel the motion  these large boatsand their size may be understood from the fact that one of them had just brought down 750 menare moved so easily and so gently that they come gliding in among each other without hesitation and without pause on english waters we do not willingly run ships against each other and when we do so unwillingly they bump and crush and crash upon each other and timbers fly while men are swearing  but here there was neither crashing nor swearing and the boats noiselessly pressed against each other as though they were cased in muslin and crinoline  i got out upon the quay and stood close by the plank watching each man as he left the vessel and walked across toward the railway those whom i had previously seen in tents were not equipped but these men were in uniform and each bore his musket  taking them altogether they were as fine a set of men as i ever saw collected no man could doubt on seeing them that they bore on their countenances the signs of higher breeding and better education than would be seen in a thousand men enlisted in england  i do not mean to argue from this that americans are better than english  i do not mean to argue here that they are even better educated  my assertion goes to show that the men generally were taken from a higher level in the community than that which fills our own ranks it was a matter of regret to me here and on many subsequent occasions to see men bound for three years to serve as common soldiers who were so manifestly fitted for a better and more useful life  to me it is always a source of sorrow to see a man enlisted i feel that the individual recruit is doing badly with himself carrying himself and the strength and intelligence which belong to him to a bad market  i know that there must be soldiers but as to every separate soldier i regret that he should be one of them and the higher is the class from which such soldiers are drawn the greater the intelligence of the men so to be employed the deeper with me is that feeling of regret  but this strikes one much less in an old country than in a country that is new  in the old countries population is thick and food sometimes scarce  men can be spared and any employment may be serviceable even though that employment be in itself so unproductive as that of fighting battles or preparing for them  but in the western states of america every arm that can guide a plow is of incalculable value  minnesota was admitted as a state about three years before this time and its whole population is not much above 150000  of this number perhaps 40000 may be working men  and now this infant state with its huge territory and scanty population is called upon to send its hearts blood out to the war  and it has sent its hearts best blood  forth they camefine stalwart wellgrown fellowslooking to my eye as though they had as yet but faintly recognized the necessary severity of military discipline  to them hitherto the war had seemed to be an arena on which each might do something for his country which that country would recognize  to themselves as yetand to me also they were a band of heroes to be reduced by the compressing power of military discipline to the lower level but more necessary position of a regiment of soldiers  ah me how terrible to them has been the breaking up of that delusion  when a poor yokel in england is enlisted with a shilling and a promise of unlimited beer and glory one pities and if possible would save him  but with him the mode of life to which he goes may not be much inferior to that he leaves  it may be that for him soldiering is the best trade possible in his circumstances  it may keep him from the hen roosts and perhaps from his neighbors pantries and discipline may be good for him  population is thick with us and there are many whom it may be well to collect and make available under the strictest surveillance  but of these men whom i saw entering on their career upon the banks of the mississippi many were fathers of families many were owners of lands many were educated men capable of high aspirationsall were serviceable members of their state  there were probably there not three or four of whom it would be well that the state should be rid  as soldiers fit or capable of being made fit for the duties they had undertaken i could find but one fault with them  their average age was too high  there were men among them with grizzled beards and many who had counted thirty thirtyfive and forty years  they had i believe devoted themselves with a true spirit of patriotism  no doubt each had some ulterior hope as to himself as has every mortal patriot  regulus when he returned hopeless to carthage trusted that some horace would tell his story  each of these men from minnesota looked probably forward to his reward but the reward desired was of a high class  the first great misery to be endured by these regiments will be the military lesson of obedience which they must learn before they can be of any service  it always seemed to me when i came near them that they had not as yet recognized the necessary austerity of an officers duty  their idea of a captain was the stage idea of a leader of dramatic bandittia man to be followed and obeyed as a leader but to be obeyed with that free and easy obedience which is accorded to the reigning chief of the forty thieves  waal captain i have heard a private say to his officer as he sat on one seat in a railway car with his feet upon the back of another and the captain has looked as though he did not like it  the captain did not like it but the poor private was being fast carried to that destiny which he would like still less  from the first i have had faith in the northern army but from the first i have felt that the suffering to be endured by these free and independent volunteers would be very great  a man to be available as a private soldier must be compressed and belted in till he be a machine  as soon as the men had left the vessel we walked over the side of it and took possession  i am afraid your cabin wont be ready for a quarter of an hour said the clerk  such a body of men as that will leave some dirt after them  i assured him of course that our expectations under such circumstances were very limited and that i was fully aware that the boat and the boats company were taken up with matters of greater moment than the carriage of ordinary passengers  but to this he demurred altogether  the regiments were very little to them but occasioned much trouble everything however should be square in fifteen minutes  at the expiration of the time named the key of our stateroom was given to us and we found the appurtenances as clean as though no soldier had ever put his foot upon the vessel  from la crosse to st paul the distance up the river is something over 200 miles and from st paul down to dubuque in iowa to which we went on our return the distance is 450 miles  we were therefore for a considerable time on board these boatsmore so than such a journey may generally make necessary as we were delayed at first by the soldiers and afterward by accidents such as the breaking of a paddlewheel and other causes to which navigation on the upper mississippi seems to be liable  on the whole we slept on board four nights and lived on board as many days  i cannot say that the life was comfortable though i do not know that it could be made more so by any care on the part of the boat owners  my first complaint would be against the great heat of the cabins  the americans as a rule live in an atmosphere which is almost unbearable by an englishman  to this cause i am convinced is to be attributed their thin faces their pale skins their unenergetic temperamentunenergetic as regards physical motionand their early old age  the winters are long and cold in america and mechanical ingenuity is far extended  these two facts together have created a system of stoves hotair pipes steam chambers and heating apparatus so extensive that from autumn till the end of spring all inhabited rooms are filled with the atmosphere of a hot oven  an englishman fancies that he is to be baked and for awhile finds it almost impossible to exist in the air prepared for him  how the heat is engendered on board the river steamers i do not know but it is engendered to so great a degree that the sittingcabins are unendurable  the patient is therefore driven out at all hours into the outside balconies of the boat or on to the top rooffor it is a roof rather than a deck and there as he passes through the air at the rate of twenty miles an hour finds himself chilled to the very bones  that is my first complaint  but as the boats are made for americans and as americans like hot air i do not put it forward with any idea that a change ought to be effected  my second complaint is equally unreasonable and is quite as incapable of a remedy as the first ninetenths of the travelers carry children with them  they are not tourists engaged on pleasure excursions but men and women intent on the business of life  they are moving up and down looking for fortune and in search of new homes  of course they carry with them all their household goods  do not let any critic say that i grudge these young travelers their right to locomotion neither their right to locomotion is grudged by me nor any of those privileges which are accorded in america to the rising generation  the habits of their country and the choice of their parents give to them full dominion over all hours and over all places and it would ill become a foreigner to make such habits and such choice a ground of serious complaint  but nevertheless the uncontrolled energies of twenty children round ones legs do not convey comfort or happiness when the passing events are producing noise and storm rather than peace and sunshine  i must protest that american babies are an unhappy race  they eat and drink just as they please they are never punished they are never banished snubbed and kept in the background as children are kept with us and yet they are wretched and uncomfortable  my heart has bled for them as i have heard them squalling by the hour together in agonies of discontent and dyspepsia  can it be i wonder that children are happier when they are made to obey orders and are sent to bed at six oclock than when allowed to regulate their own conduct that bread and milk are more favorable to laughter and soft childish ways than beefsteaks and pickles three times a day that an occasional whipping even will conduce to rosy cheeks  it is an idea which i should never dare to broach to an american mother but i must confess that after my travels on the western continent my opinions have a tendency in that direction  beefsteaks and pickles certainly produce smart little men and women  let that be taken for granted  but rosy laughter and winning childish ways are i fancy the produce of bread and milk  but there was a third reason why traveling on these boats was not so pleasant as i had expected  i could not get my fellowtravelers to talk to me  it must be understood that our fellowtravelers were not generally of that class which we englishmen in our pride designate as gentlemen and ladies  they were people as i have said in search of new homes and new fortunes  but i protest that as such they would have been in those parts much more agreeable as companions to me than any gentlemen or any ladies if only they would have talked to me  i do not accuse them of any incivility  if addressed they answered me  if application was made by me for any special information trouble was taken to give it me  but i found no aptitude no wish for conversationnay even a disinclination to converse  in the western states i do not think that i was ever addressed first by an american sitting next to me at table indeed i never held any conversation at a public table in the west  i have sat in the same room with men for hours and have not had a word spoken to me  i have done my very best to break through this ice and have always failed  a western american man is not a talking man  he will sit for hours over a stove with a cigar in his mouth and his hat over his eyes chewing the cud of reflection a dozen will sit together in the same way and there shall not be a dozen words spoken between them in an hour  with the women ones chance of conversation is still worse  it seemed as though the cares of the world had been too much for them and that all talking excepting as to businessdemands for instance on the servants for pickles for their childrenhad gone by the board  they were generally hard dry and melancholy  i am speaking of course of aged femalesfrom five and twenty perhaps to thirtywho had long since given up the amusements and levities of life  i very soon abandoned any attempt at drawing a word from these ancient mothers of families but not the less did i ponder in my mind over the circumstances of their lives  had things gone with them so sadlywas the struggle for independence so hardthat all the softness of existence had been trodden out of them  in the cities too it was much the same  it seemed to me that a future mother of a family in those parts had left all laughter behind her when she put out her finger for the wedding ring  for these reasons i must say that life on board these steamboats was not as pleasant as i had hoped to find it but for our discomfort in this respect we found great atonement in the scenery through which we passed  i protest that of all the river scenery that i know that of the upper mississippi is by far the finest and the most continued  one thinks of course of the rhine but according to my idea of beauty the rhine is nothing to the upper mississippi  for miles upon milesfor hundreds of milesthe course of the river runs through low hills which are there called bluffs  these bluffs rise in every imaginable form looking sometimes like large straggling unwieldy castles and then throwing themselves into sloping lawns which stretch back away from the river till the eye is lost in their twists and turnings landscape beauty as i take it consists mainly in four attributes in water in broken land in scattered timber timber scattered as opposed to continuous forest timber and in the accident of color in all these particulars the banks of the upper mississippi can hardly be beaten  there are no high mountains but high mountains themselves are grand rather than beautiful  there are no high mountains but there is a succession of hills which group themselves forever without monotony  it is perhaps the ever variegated forms of these bluffs which chiefly constitute the wonderful loveliness of this river  the idea constantly occurs that some point on every hillside would form the most charming site ever yet chosen for a noble residence  i have passed up and down rivers clothed to the edge with continuous forest  this at first is grand enough but the eye and feeling soon become weary  here the trees are scattered so that the eye passes through them and ever and again a long lawn sweeps back into the country and up the steep side of a hill making the traveler long to stay there and linger through the oaks and climb the bluffs and lay about on the bold but easy summits  the boat however steams quickly up against the current and the happy valleys are left behind one quickly after another  the river is very various in its breadth and is constantly divided by islands  it is never so broad that the beauty of the banks is lost in the distance or injured by it it is rapid but has not the beautifully bright color of some european riversof the rhine for instance and the rhone  but what is wanting in the color of the water is more than compensated by the wonderful hues and luster of the shores  we visited the river in october and i must presume that they who seek it solely for the sake of scenery should go there in that month  it was not only that the foliage of the trees was bright with every imaginable color but that the grass was bronzed and that the rocks were golden  and this beauty did not last only for awhile and then cease  on the rhine there are lovely spots and special morsels of scenery with which the traveler becomes duly enraptured  but on the upper mississippi there are no special morsels  the position of the sun in the heavens will as it always does make much difference in the degree of beauty  the hour before and the half hour after sunset are always the loveliest for such scenes  but of the shores themselves one may declare that they are lovely throughout those four hundred miles which run immediately south from st paul  about half way between la crosse and st paul we came upon lake pepin and continued our course up the lake for perhaps fifty or sixty miles  this expanse of water is narrow for a lake and by those who know the lower courses of great rivers would hardly be dignified by that name  but nevertheless the breadth here lessens the beauty  there are the same bluffs the same scattered woodlands and the same colors  but they are either at a distance or else they are to be seen on one side only  the more that i see of the beauty of scenery and the more i consider its elements the stronger becomes my conviction that size has but little to do with it and rather detracts from it than adds to it  distance gives one of its greatest charms but it does so by concealing rather than displaying an expanse of surface  the beauty of distance arises from the romance the feeling of mystery which it creates it is like the beauty of woman which allures the more the more that it is vailed  but open uncovered land and water mountains which simply rise to great heights with long unbroken slopes wide expanses of lake and forests which are monotonous in their continued thickness are never lovely to me  a landscape should always be partly vailed and display only half its charms  to my taste the finest stretch of the river was that immediately above lake pepin but then at this point we had all the glory of the setting sun  it was like fairyland so bright were the golden hues so fantastic were the shapes of the hills so broken and twisted the course of the waters  but the noisy steamer went groaning up the narrow passages with almost unabated speed and left the fairy land behind all too quickly  then the bell would ring for tea and the children with the beefsteaks the pickled onions and the light fixings would all come over again  the care laden mothers would tuck the bibs under the chins of their tyrant children and some embryo senator of four years old would listen with concentrated attention while the negro servant recapitulated to him the delicacies of the suppertable in order that he might make his choice with due consideration  beefsteak the embryo fouryear old senator would lisp and stewed potato and buttered toast and corncake and coffeeandandandmother mind you get me the pickles  st paul enjoys the double privilege of being the commercial and political capital of minnesota  the same is the case with boston in massachusetts but i do not remember another instance in which it is so  it is built on the eastern bank of the mississippi though the bulk of the state lies to the west of the river  it is noticeable as the spot up to which the river is navigable immediately above st paul there are narrow rapids up which no boat can pass  north of this continuous navigation does not go but from st paul down to new orleans and the gulf of mexico it is uninterrupted  the distance to st louis in missouri a town built below the confluence of the three rivers mississippi missouri and illinois is 900 miles and then the navigable waters down to the gulf wash a southern country of still greater extent  no river on the face of the globe forms a highway for the produce of so wide an extent of agricultural land  the mississippi with its tributaries carried to market before the war the produce of wisconsin minnesota iowa illinois indiana ohio kentucky tennessee missouri kansas arkansas mississippi and louisiana this country is larger than england ireland scotland holland belgium france germany and spain together and is undoubtedly composed of much more fertile land  the states named comprise the great center valley of the continent and are the farming lands and garden grounds of the western world  he who has not seen corn on the ground in illinois or minnesota does not know to what extent the fertility of land may go or how great may be the weight of cereal crops  and for all this the mississippi was the highroad to market  when the crop of 1861 was garnered this highroad was stopped by the war  what suffering this entailed on the south i will not here stop to say but on the west the effect was terrible corn was in such plentyindiancorn that is or maizethat it was not worth the farmers while to prepare it for market  when i was in illinois the second quality of indiancorn when shelled was not worth more than from eight to ten cents a bushel  but the shelling and preparation is laborious and in some instances it was found better to burn it for fuel than to sell it  respecting the export of corn from the west i must say a further word or two in the next chapter but it seemed to be indispensable that i should point out here how great to the united states is the need of the mississippi  nor is it for corn and wheat only that its waters are needed  timber lead iron coal porkall find or should find their exit to the world at large by this road  there are towns on it and on its tributaries already holding more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants  the number of cincinnati exceeds that as also does the number of st louis  under these circumstances it is not wonderful that the states should wish to keep in their own hands the navigation of this river  it is not wonderful  but it will not i think be admitted by the politicians of the world that the navigation of the mississippi need be closed against the west even though the southern states should succeed in raising themselves to the power and dignity of a separate nationality  if the waters of the danube be not open to austria it is through the fault of austria  that the subject will be one of trouble no man can doubt and of course it would be well for the north to avoid that or any other trouble  in the mean time the importance of this right of way must be admitted and it must be admitted also that whatever may be the ultimate resolve of the north it will be very difficult to reconcile the west to a divided dominion of the mississippi  st paul contains about 14000 inhabitants and like all other american towns is spread over a surface of ground adapted to the accommodation of a very extended population  as it is belted on one side by the river and on the other by the bluffs which accompany the course of the river the site is pretty and almost romantic  here also we found a great hotel a huge square building such as we in england might perhaps place near to a railway terminus in such a city as glasgow or manchester but on which no living englishman would expend his money in a town even five times as big again as st paul  everything was sufficiently good and much more than sufficiently plentiful  the whole thing went on exactly as hotels do down in massachusetts or the state of new york  look at the map and see where st paul is  its distance from all known civilizationall civilization that has succeeded in obtaining acquaintance with the world at largeis very great even american travelers do not go up there in great numbers excepting those who intend to settle there  a stray sportsman or two american or english as the case may be makes his way into minnesota for the sake of shooting and pushes on up through st paul to the red river  some few adventurous spirits visit the indian settlements and pass over into the unsettled regions of dacotah and washington territory  but there is no throng of traveling  nevertheless a hotel has been built there capable of holding three hundred guests and other hotels exist in the neighborhood one of which is even larger than that at st paul who can come to them and create even a hope that such an enterprise may be remunerative  in america it is seldom more than hope for one always hears that such enterprises fail  when i was there the war was in hand and it was hardly to be expected that any hotel should succeed  the landlord told me that he held it at the present time for a very low rent and that he could just manage to keep it open without loss  the war which hindered people from traveling and in that way injured the innkeepers also hindered people from housekeeping and reduced them to the necessity of boarding out by which the innkeepers were of course benefited  at st paul i found that the majority of the guests were inhabitants of the town boarding at the hotel and thus dispensing with the cares of a separate establishment  i do not know what was charged for such accommodation at st paul but i have come across large houses at which a single man could get all that he required for a dollar a day  now americans are great consumers especially at hotels and all that a man requires includes three hot meals with a choice from about two dozen dishes at each  from st paul there are two waterfalls to be seen which we of course visited  we crossed the river at fort snelling a rickety illconditioned building standing at the confluence of the minnesota and mississippi rivers built there to repress the indians  it is i take it very necessary especially at the present moment as the indians seem to require repressing  they have learned that the attention of the federal government has been called to the war and have become bold in consequence  when i was at st paul i heard of a party of englishmen who had been robbed of everything they possessed and was informed that the farmers in the distant parts of the state were by no means secure  the indians are more to be pitied than the farmers  they are turning against enemies who will neither forgive nor forget any injuries done when the war is over they will be improved and polished and annexed till no indian will hold an acre of land in minnesota  at present fort snelling is the nucleus of a recruiting camp  on the point between the bluffs of the two rivers there is a plain immediately in front of the fort and there we saw the newlyjoined minnesota recruits going through their first military exercises they were in detachments of twenties and were rude enough at their goose step  the matter which struck me most in looking at them was the difference of condition which i observed in the men  there were the country lads fresh from the farms such as we see following the recruiting sergeant through english towns but there were also men in black coats and black trowsers with thin boots and trimmed beardsbeards which had been trimmed till very lately and some of them with beards which showed that they were no longer young  it was inexpressibly melancholy to see such men as these twisting and turning about at the corporals word each handling some stick in his hand in lieu of weapon  of course they were more awkward than the boys even though they were twice more assiduous in their efforts  of course they were sad and wretched i saw men there that were very wretchedall but heartbroken if one might judge from their faces  they should not have been there handling sticks and moving their unaccustomed legs in cramped paces  they were as razors for which no better purpose could be found than the cutting of blocks  when such attempts are made the block is not cut but the razor is spoiled  most unfit for the commencement of a soldiers life were some that i saw there but i do not doubt that they had been attracted to the work by the one idea of doing something for their country in its trouble  from fort snelling we went on to the falls of minnehaha minnehaha laughing water  such i believe is the interpretation the name in this case is more imposing than the fall  it is a pretty little cascade and might do for a picnic in fine weather but it is not a waterfall of which a man can make much when found so far away from home  going on from minnehaha we came to minneapolis at which place there is a fine suspension bridge across the river just above the falls of st anthony and leading to the town of that name  till i got there i could hardly believe that in these days there should be a living village called minneapolis by living men  i presume i should describe it as a town for it has a municipality and a postoffice and of course a large hotel  the interest of the place however is in the saw mills  on the opposite side of the water at st anthony is another very large hoteland also a smaller one  the smaller one may be about the size of the firstclass hotels at cheltenham or leamington  they were both closed and there seemed to be but little prospect that either would be opened till the war should be over  the sawmills however were at full work and to my eyes were extremely picturesque  i had been told that the beauty of the falls had been destroyed by the mills  indeed all who had spoken to me about st anthony had said so  but i did not agree with them  here as at ottawa the charm in fact consists not in an uninterrupted shoot of water but in a succession of rapids over a bed of broken rocks  among these rocks logs of loose timber are caught which have escaped from their proper courses and here they lie heaped up in some places and constructing themselves into bridges in others till the freshets of the spring carry them off the timber is generally brought down in logs to st anthony is sawn there and then sent down the mississippi in large rafts these rafts on other rivers are i think generally made of unsawn timber  such logs as have escaped in the manner above described are recognized on their passage down the river by their marks and are made up separately the original owners receiving the valueor not receiving it as the case may be  there is quite a trade going on with the loose lumber my informant told me  and from his tone i was led to suppose that he regarded the trade as sufficiently lucrative if not peculiarly honest  there is very much in the mode of life adopted by the settlers in these regions which creates admiration  the people are all intelligent  they are energetic and speculative conceiving grand ideas and carrying them out almost with the rapidity of magic  a suspension bridge half a mile long is erected while in england we should be fastening together a few planks for a foot passage progress mental as well as material is the demand of the people generally  everybody understands everything and everybody intends sooner or later to do everything  all this is very grand but then there is a terrible drawback  one hears on every side of intelligence but one hears also on every side of dishonesty  talk to whom you will of whom you will and you will hear some tale of successful or unsuccessful swindling  it seems to be the recognized rule of commerce in the far west that men shall go into the worlds markets prepared to cheat and to be cheated  it may be said that as long as this is acknowledged and understood on all sides no harm will be done  it is equally fair for all  when i was a child there used to be certain games at which it was agreed in beginning either that there should be cheating or that there should not  it may be said that out there in the western states men agree to play the cheating game and that the cheating game has more of interest in it than the other  unfortunately however they who agree to play this game on a large scale do not keep outsiders altogether out of the playground  indeed outsiders become very welcome to them and then it is not pleasant to hear the tone in which such outsiders speak of the peculiarities of the sport to which they have been introduced  when a beginner in trade finds himself furnished with a barrel of wooden nutmegs the joke is not so good to him as to the experienced merchant who supplies him  this dealing in wooden nutmegs this selling of things which do not exist and buying of goods for which no price is ever to be given is an institution which is much honored in the west  we call it swindlingand so do they  but it seemed to me that in the western states the word hardly seemed to leave the same impress on the mind that it does elsewhere  on our return down the river we passed la crosse at which we had embarked and went down as far as dubuque in iowa  on our way down we came to grief and broke one of our paddlewheels to pieces  we had no special accident  we struck against nothing above or below water  but the wheel went to pieces and we laid to on the river side for the greater part of a day while the necessary repairs were being made  delay in traveling is usually an annoyance because it causes the unsettlement of a settled purpose  but the loss of the day did us no harm and our accident had happened at a very pretty spot  i climbed up to the top of the nearest bluff and walked back till i came to the open country and also went up and down the river banks visiting the cabins of two settlers who live there by supplying wood to the river steamers  one of these was close to the spot at which we were lying and yet though most of our passengers came on shore i was the only one who spoke to the inmates of the cabin  these people must live there almost in desolation from one years end to another  once in a fortnight or so they go up to a market town in their small boats but beyond that they can have little intercourse with their fellowcreatures nevertheless none of these dwellers by the river side came out to speak to the men and women who were lounging about from eleven in the morning till four in the afternoon nor did one of the passengers except myself knock at the door or enter the cabin or exchange a word with those who lived there  i spoke to the master of the house whom i met outside and he at once asked me to come in and sit down  i found his father there and his mother his wife his brother and two young children  the wife who was cooking was a very pretty pale young woman who however could have circulated round her stove more conveniently had her crinoline been of less dimensions  she bade me welcome very prettily and went on with her cooking talking the while as though she were in the habit of entertaining guests in that way daily  the old woman sat in a corner knittingas old women always do  the old man lounged with a grandchild on his knee and the master of the house threw himself on the floor while the other child crawled over him  there was no stiffness or uneasiness in their manners nor was there anything approaching to that republican roughness which so often operates upon a poor well intending englishman like a slap on the cheek  i sat there for about an hour and when i had discussed with them english politics and the bearing of english politics upon the american war they told me of their own affairs  food was very plenty but life was very hard  take the year through each man could not earn above half a dollar a day by cutting wood  this however they owned did not take up all their time  working on favorable wood on favorable days they could each earn two dollars a day but these favorable circumstances did not come together very often  they did not deal with the boats themselves and the profits were eaten up by the middleman  he the middleman had a good thing of it because he could cheat the captains of the boats in the measurement of the wood  the chopper was obliged to supply a genuine cord of logstrue measure  but the man who took it off in the barge to the steamer could so pack it that fifteen true cords would make twentytwo false cords  it cuts up into a fine trade you see sir said the young man as he stroked back the little girls hair from her forehead  but the captains of course must find it out said i  this he acknowledged but argued that the captains on this account insisted on buying the wood so much cheaper and that the loss all came upon the chopper  i tried to teach him that the remedy lay in his own hands and the three men listened to me quite patiently while i explained to them how they should carry on their own trade  but the young father had the last word  i guess we dont get above the fifty cents a day any way  he knew at least where the shoe pinched him  he was a handsome manly noble looking fellow tall and thin with black hair and bright eyes but he had the hollow look about his jaws and so had his wife and so had his brother  they all owned to fever and ague  they had a touch of it most years and sometimes pretty sharply  it was a coarse place to live in the old woman said but there was no one to meddle with them and she guessed that it suited  they had books and newspapers tidy delf and clean glass upon their shelves and undoubtedly provisions in plenty  whether fever and ague yearly and cords of wood stretched from fifteen to twentytwo are more than a setoff for these good things i will leave every one to decide according to his own taste  in another cabin i found women and children only and one of the children was in the last stage of illness  but nevertheless the woman of the house seemed glad to see me and talked cheerfully as long as i would remain  she inquired what had happened to the vessel but it had never occurred to her to go out and see  her cabin was neat and well furnished and there also i saw newspapers and harpers everlasting magazine  she said it was a coarse desolate place for living but that she could raise almost anything in her garden  i could not then understand nor can i now understand why none of the numerous passengers out of the boat should have entered those cabins except myself and why the inmates of the cabins should not have come out to speak to any one  had they been surly morose people made silent by the specialties of their life it would have been explicable but they were delighted to talk and to listen the fact i take it is that the people are all harsh to each other  they do not care to go out of their way to speak to any one unless something is to be gained  they say that two englishmen meeting in the desert would not speak unless they were introduced the farther i travel the less true do i find this of englishmen and the more true of other people    chapter xi  ceres americana   we stopped at the julien house dubuque  dubuque is a city in iowa on the western shore of the mississippi and as the names both of the town and of the hotel sounded french in my ears i asked for an explanation  i was then told that julien dubuque a canadian frenchman had been buried on one of the bluffs of the river within the precincts of the present town that he had been the first white settler in iowa and had been the only man who had ever prevailed upon the indians to work  among them he had become a great medicine and seems for awhile to have had absolute power over them  he died i think in 1800 and was buried on one of the hills over the river  he was a bold bad man my informant told me and committed every sin under heaven  but he made the indians work  lead mines are the glory of dubuque and very large sums of money have been made from them  i was taken out to see one of them and to go down it but we found not altogether to my sorrow that the works had been stopped on account of the water  no effort has been made in any of these mines to subdue the water nor has steam been applied to the working of them  the lodes have been so rich with lead that the speculators have been content to take out the metal that was easily reached and to go off in search of fresh ground when disturbed by water  and are wages here paid pretty punctually i asked  well a man has to be smart you know and then my friend went on to acknowledge that it would be better for the country if smartness were not so essential  iowa has a population of 674000 souls and in october 1861 had already mustered eighteen regiments of one thousand men each  such a population would give probably 170000 men capable of bearing arms and therefore the number of soldiers sent had already amounted to more than a decimation of the available strength of the state  when we were at dubuque nothing was talked of but the army  it seemed that mines coalpits and cornfields were all of no account in comparison with the war  how many regiments could be squeezed out of the state was the one question which filled all minds and the general desire was that such regiments should be sent to the western army to swell the triumph which was still expected for general fremont and to assist in sweeping slavery out into the gulf of mexico  the patriotism of the west has been quite as keen as that of the north and has produced results as memorable but it has sprung from a different source and been conducted and animated by a different sentiment  national greatness and support of the law have been the idea of the north national greatness and abolition of slavery have been those of the west  how they are to agree as to terms when between them they have crushed the souththat is the difficulty  at dubuque in iowa i ate the best apple that i ever encountered i make that statement with the purpose of doing justice to the americans on a matter which is to them one of considerable importance  americans as rule do not believe in english apples they declare that there are none and receive accounts of devonshire cider with manifest incredulity  but at any rate there are no apples in england equal to ours  that is an assertion to which an englishman is called upon to give an absolute assent and i hereby give it  apples so excellent as some which were given to us at dubuque i have never eaten in england  there is a great jealousy respecting all the fruits of the earth  your peaches are fine to look at was said to me but they have no flavor  this was the assertion of a lady and i made no answer  my idea had been that american peaches had no flavor that french peaches had none that those of italy had none that little as there might be of which england could boast with truth she might at any rate boast of her peaches without fear of contradiction  indeed my idea had been that good peaches were to be got in england only  i am beginning to doubt whether my belief on the matter has not been the product of insular ignorance and idolatrous selfworship  it may be that a peach should be a combination of an apple and a turnip  my great objection to your country sir said another is that you have got no vegetables  had he told me that we had got no seaboard or no coals he would not have surprised me more no vegetables in england  i could not restrain myself altogether and replied by a confession that we raised no squash  squash is the pulp of the pumpkin and is much used in the states both as a vegetable and for pies  no vegetables in england  did my surprise arise from the insular ignorance and idolatrous self worship of a britisher or was my american friend laboring under a delusion  is covent garden well supplied with vegetables or is it not  do we cultivate our kitchengardens with success or am i under a delusion on that subject  do i dream or is it true that out of my own little patches at home i have enough for all domestic purposes of peas beans broccoli cauliflower celery beetroot onions carrots parsnips turnips seakale asparagus french beans artichokes vegetable marrow cucumbers tomatoes endive lettuce as well as herbs of many kinds cabbages throughout the year and potatoes  no vegetables  had the gentleman told me that england did not suit him because we had nothing but vegetables i should have been less surprised  from dubuque on the western shore of the river we passed over to dunleath in illinois and went on from thence by railway to dixon i was induced to visit this not very flourishing town by a desire to see the rolling prairie of illinois and to learn by eyesight something of the crops of corn or indian maize which are produced upon the land  had that gentleman told me that we knew nothing of producing corn in england he would have been nearer the mark for of corn in the profusion in which it is grown here we do not know much  better land than the prairies of illinois for cereal crops the worlds surface probably cannot show  and here there has been no necessity for the long previous labor of banishing the forest enormous prairies stretch across the state into which the plow can be put at once  the earth is rich with the vegetation of thousands of years and the farmers return is given to him without delay the land bursts with its own produce and the plenty is such that it creates wasteful carelessness in the gathering of the crop  it is not worth a mans while to handle less than large quantities up in minnesota i had been grieved by the loose manner in which wheat was treated  i have seen bags of it upset and left upon the ground  the labor of collecting it was more than it was worth there wheat is the chief crop and as the lands become cleared and cultivation spreads itself the amount coming down the mississippi will be increased almost to infinity  the price of wheat in europe will soon depend not upon the value of the wheat in the country which grows it but on the power and cheapness of the modes which may exist for transporting it  i have not been able to obtain the exact prices with reference to the carriage of wheat from st paul the capital of minnesota to liverpool but i have done so as regards indiancorn from the state of illinois  the following statement will show what proportion the value of the article at the place of its growth bears to the cost of the carriage and it shows also how enormous an effect on the price of corn in england would follow any serious decrease in the cost of carriage   a bushel of indiancorn at bloomington in illinois  cost in october 1861                             10 cents freight to chicago                                  10    storage                                              2    freight from chicago to buffalo                     22    elevating and canal freight to new york            19    transfer in new york and insurance                   3    ocean freight                                       23                                                         cost of a bushel of indiancorn at liverpool        89 cents   thus corn which in liverpool costs 3s 10d has been sold by the farmer who produced it for 5d  it is probable that no great reduction can be expected in the cost of ocean transit but it will be seen by the above figures that out of the liverpool price of 3s 10d or 89 cents considerably more than half is paid for carriage across the united states  all or nearly all this transit is by water and there can i think be no doubt but that a few years will see it reduced by fifty per cent  in october last the mississippi was closed the railways had not rolling stock sufficient for their work the crops of the two last years had been excessive and there existed the necessity of sending out the corn before the internal navigation had been closed by frost  the parties who had the transit in their hands put their heads together and were able to demand any prices that they pleased  it will be seen that the cost of carrying a bushel of corn from chicago to buffalo by the lakes was within one cent of the cost of bringing it from new york to liverpool  these temporary causes for high prices of transit will cease a more perfect system of competition between the railways and the water transit will be organized and the result must necessarily be both an increase of price to the producer and a decrease of price to the consumer  it certainly seems that the produce of cereal crops in the valleys of the mississippi and its tributaries increases at a faster rate than population increases  wheat and corn are sown by the thousand acres in a piece  i heard of one farmer who had 10000 acres of corn  thirty years ago grain and flour were sent westward out of the state of new york to supply the wants of those who had immigrated into the prairies and now we find that it will be the destiny of those prairies to feed the universe  chicago is the main point of exportation northwestward from illinois and at the present time sends out from its granaries more cereal produce than any other town in the world  the bulk of this passes in the shape of grain or flour from chicago to buffalo which latter place is as it were a gateway leading from the lakes or big waters to the canals or small waters  i give below the amount of grain and flour in bushels received into buffalo for transit in the month of october during four consecutive years   october 1858       4429055 bushels         1859       5523448             1860       6500864             1861      12483797       in 1860 from the opening to the close of navigation 30837632 bushels of grain and flour passed through buffalo  in 1861 the amount received up to the 31st of october was 51969142 bushels as the navigation would be closed during the month of november the above figures may be taken as representing not quite the whole amount transported for the year  it may be presumed the 52000000 of bushels as quoted above will swell itself to 60000000  i confess that to my own mind statistical amounts do not bring home any enduring idea  fifty million bushels of corn and flour simply seems to mean a great deal  it is a powerful form of superlative and soon vanishes away as do other superlatives in this age of strong words  i was at chicago and at buffalo in october 1861  i went down to the granaries and climbed up into the elevators  i saw the wheat running in rivers from one vessel into another and from the railroad vans up into the huge bins on the top stores of the warehousesfor these rivers of food run up hill as easily as they do down  i saw the corn measured by the fortybushel measure with as much ease as we measure an ounce of cheese and with greater rapidity  i ascertained that the work went on week day and sunday day and night incessantlyrivers of wheat and rivers of maize ever running  i saw the men bathed in corn as they distributed it in its flow  i saw bins by the score laden with wheat in each of which bins there was space for a comfortable residence  i breathed the flour and drank the flour and felt myself to be enveloped in a world of breadstuff  and then i believed understood and brought it home to myself as a fact that here in the cornlands of michigan and amid the bluffs of wisconsin and on the high table plains of minnesota and the prairies of illinois had god prepared the food for the increasing millions of the eastern world as also for the coming millions of the western  i do not find many minds constituted like my own and therefore i venture to publish the above figures  i believe them to be true in the main and they will show if credited that the increase during the last four years has gone on with more than fabulous rapidity for myself i own that those figures would have done nothing unless i had visited the spot myself  a man can not perhaps count up the results of such a work by a quick glance of his eye nor communicate with precision to another the conviction which his own short experience has made so strong within himself but to himself seeing is believing  to me it was so at chicago and at buffalo  i began then to know what it was for a country to overflow with milk and honey to burst with its own fruits and be smothered by its own riches  from st paul down the mississippi by the shores of wisconsin and iowa by the ports on lake pepin by la crosse from which one railway runs eastward by prairie du chien the terminus of a second by dunleath fulton and rock island from whence three other lines run eastward all through that wonderful state of illinois the farmers glory along the ports of the great lakes through michigan indiana ohio and further pennsylvania up to buffalo the great gate of the western ceres the loud cry was this how shall we rid ourselves of our corn and wheat  the result has been the passage of 60000000 bushels of breadstuffs through that gate in one year  let those who are susceptible of statistics ponder that  for them who are not i can only give this advice let them go to buffalo next october and look for themselves  in regarding the above figures and the increase shown between the years 1860 and 1861 it must of course be borne in mind that during the latter autumn no corn or wheat was carried into the southern states and that none was exported from new orleans or the mouth of the mississippi  the states of mississippi alabama and louisiana have for some time past received much of their supplies from the northwestern lands and the cutting off of this current of consumption has tended to swell the amount of grain which has been forced into the narrow channel of buffalo  there has been no southern exit allowed and the southern appetite has been deprived of its food  but taking this item for all that it is worthor taking it as it generally will be taken for much more than it can be worththe result left will be materially the same  the grand markets to which the western states look and have looked are those of new england new york and europe  already corn and wheat are not the common crops of new england  boston and hartford and lowell are fed from the great western states  the state of new york which thirty years ago was famous chiefly for its cereal produce is now fed from these states  new york city would be starved if it depended on its own state and it will soon be as true that england would be starved if it depended on itself  it was but the other day that we were talking of free trade in corn as a thing desirable but as yet doubtfulbut the other day that lord derby who may be prime minister tomorrow and mr disraeli who may be chancellor of the exchequer tomorrow were stoutly of opinion that the corn laws might be and should be maintainedbut the other day that the same opinion was held with confidence by sir robert peel who however when the day for the change came was not ashamed to become the instrument used by the people for their repeal  events in these days march so quickly that they leave men behind and our dear old protectionists at home will have grown sleek upon american flour before they have realized the fact that they are no longer fed from their own furrows  i have given figures merely as regards the trade of buffalo but it must not be presumed that buffalo is the only outlet from the great cornlands of northern america  in the first place no grain of the produce of canada finds its way to buffalo  its exit is by the st lawrence or by the grand trunk railway as i have stated when speaking of canada  and then there is the passage for large vessels from the upper lakeslake michigan lake huron and lake eriethrough the welland canal into lake ontario and out by the st lawrence  there is also the direct communication from lake erie by the new york and erie railway to new york  i have more especially alluded to the trade of buffalo because i have been enabled to obtain a reliable return of the quantity of grain and flour which passes through that town and because buffalo and chicago are the two spots which are becoming most famous in the cereal history of the western states  everybody has a map of north america  a reference to such a map will show the peculiar position of chicago  it is at the south or head of lake michigan and to it converge railways from wisconsin iowa illinois and indiana  at chicago is found the nearest water carriage which can be obtained for the produce of a large portion of these states  from chicago there is direct water conveyance round through the lakes to buffalo at the foot of lake erie  at milwaukee higher up on the lake certain lines of railway come in joining the lake to the upper mississippi and to the wheatlands of minnesota  thence the passage is round by detroit which is the port for the produce of the greatest part of michigan and still it all goes on toward buffalo  then on lake erie there are the ports of toledo cleveland and erie  at the bottom of lake erie there is this city of corn at which the grain and flour are transhipped into the canalboats and into the railway cars for new york and there is also the welland canal through which large vessels pass from the upper lakes without transhipment of their cargo  i have said above that cornmeaning maize or indiancornwas to be bought at bloomington in illinois for ten cents or five pence a bushel  i found this also to be the case at dixon and also that corn of inferior quality might be bought for four pence but i found also that it was not worth the farmers while to shell it and sell it at such prices  i was assured that farmers were burning their indiancorn in some places finding it more available to them as fuel than it was for the market  the labor of detaching a bushel of corn from the hulls or cobs is considerable as is also the task of carrying it to market  i have known potatoes in ireland so cheap that they would not pay for digging and carrying away for purposes of sale  there was then a glut of potatoes in ireland and in the same way there was in the autumn of 1861 a glut of corn in the western states  the best qualities would fetch a price though still a low price but corn that was not of the best quality was all but worthless  it did for fuel and was burned  the fact was that the produce had recreated itself quicker than mankind had multiplied  the ingenuity of man had not worked quick enough for its disposal  the earth had given forth her increase so abundantly that the lap of created humanity could not stretch itself to hold it  at dixon in 1861 corn cost four pence a bushel  in ireland in 1848 it was sold for a penny a pound a pound being accounted sufficient to sustain life for a day and we all felt that at that price food was brought into the country cheaper than it had ever been brought before  dixon is not a town of much apparent prosperity  it is one of those places at which great beginnings have been made but as to which the deities presiding over new towns have not been propitious  much of it has been burned down and more of it has never been built up  it had a straggling illconditioned uncommercial aspect very different from the look of detroit milwaukee or st paul  there was however a great hotel there as usual and a grand bridge over the rock river a tributary of the mississippi which runs by or through the town  i found that life might be maintained on very cheap terms at dixon  to me as a passing traveler the charges at the hotel were i take it the same as elsewhere  but i learned from an inmate there that he with his wife and horse were fed and cared for and attended for two dollars or eight shillings and four pence a day  this included a private sittingroom coals light and all the wants of lifeas my informant told meexcept tobacco and whisky  feeding at such a house means a succession of promiscuous hot meals as often as the digestion of the patient can face them  now i do not know any locality where a man can keep himself and his wife with all material comforts and the luxury of a horse and carriage on cheaper terms than that  whether or no it might be worth a mans while to live at all at such a place as dixon is altogether another question  we went there because it is surrounded by the prairie and out into the prairie we had ourselves driven  we found some difficulty in getting away from the corn though we had selected this spot as one at which the open rolling prairie was specially attainable  as long as i could see a cornfield or a tree i was not satisfied nor indeed was i satisfied at last  to have been thoroughly on the prairie and in the prairie i should have been a days journey from tilled land  but i doubt whether that could now be done in the state of illinois  i got out into various patches and brought away specimens of cornears bearing sixteen rows of grain with forty grains in each row each ear bearing a meal for a hungry man  at last we did find ourselves on the prairie amid the waving grass with the land rolling on before us in a succession of gentle sweeps never rising so as to impede the view or apparently changing in its general level but yet without the monotony of flatness  we were on the prairie but still i felt no satisfaction  it was private property divided among holders and pastured over by private cattle  salisbury plain is as wild and dartmoor almost wilder  deer they told me were to be had within reach of dixon but for the buffalo one has to go much farther afield than illinois  the farmer may rejoice in illinois but the hunter and the trapper must cross the big rivers and pass away into the western territories before he can find lands wild enough for his purposes  my visit to the cornfields of illinois was in its way successful but i felt as i turned my face eastward toward chicago that i had no right to boast that i had as yet made acquaintance with a prairie  all minds were turned to the war at dixon as elsewhere  in illinois the men boasted that as regards the war they were the leading state of the union  but the same boast was made in indiana and also in massachusetts and probably in half the states of the north and west  they the illinoisians call their country the warnest of the west  the population of the state is 1700000 and it had undertaken to furnish sixty volunteer regiments of 1000 men each  and let it be borne in mind that these regiments when furnished are really fullabsolutely containing the thousand men when they are sent away from the parent states the number of souls above named will give 420000 working men and if out of these 60000 are sent to the war the state which is almost purely agricultural will have given more than one man in eight  when i was in illinois over forty regiments had already been sentfortysix if i remember rightlyand there existed no doubt whatever as to the remaining number  from the next state indiana with a population of 1350000 giving something less than 350000 working men thirtysix regiments had been sent  i fear that i am mentioning these numbers usque ad nauseam but i wish to impress upon english readers the magnitude of the effort made by the states in mustering and equipping an army within six or seven months of the first acknowledgment that such an army would be necessary  the americans have complained bitterly of the want of english sympathy and i think they have been weak in making that complaint  but i would not wish that they should hereafter have the power of complaining of a want of english justice  there can be no doubt that a genuine feeling of patriotism was aroused throughout the north and west and that men rushed into the ranks actuated by that feeling men for whom war and army life a camp and fifteen dollars a month would not of themselves have had any attraction  it came to that that young men were ashamed not to go into the army  this feeling of course produced coercion and the movement was in that way tyrannical  there is nothing more tyrannical than a strong popular feeling among a democratic people during the period of enlistment this tyranny was very strong  but the existence of such a tyranny proves the passion and patriotism of the people  it got the better of the love of money of the love of children and of the love of progress  wives who with their bairns were absolutely dependent on their husbands labors would wish their husbands to be at the war  not to conduce in some special way toward the war to have neither father there nor brother nor son not to have lectured or preached or written for the war to have made no sacrifice for the war to have had no special and individual interest in the war was disgraceful  one sees at a glance the tyranny of all this in such a country as the states  one can understand how quickly adverse stories would spread themselves as to the opinion of any man who chose to remain tranquil at such a time  one shudders at the absolute absence of true liberty which such a passion throughout a democratic country must engender  but he who has observed all this must acknowledge that that passion did exist  dollars children progress education and political rivalry all gave way to the one strong national desire for the thrashing and crushing of those who had rebelled against the authority of the stars and stripes  when we were at dixon they were getting up the dement regiment the attempt at the time did not seem to be prosperous and the few men who had been collected had about them a forlorn ill conditioned look  but then as i was told dixon had already been decimated and redecimated by former recruiting colonels  colonel dement from whom the regiment was to be named and whose military career was only now about to commence had come late into the field  i did not afterward ascertain what had been his success but i hardly doubt that he did ultimately scrape together his thousand men  why dont you go i said to a burly irishman who was driving me  im not a sound man yer honor said the irishman im deficient in me liver  taking the irishmen however throughout the union they had not been found deficient in any of the necessaries for a career of war  i do not think that any men have done better than the irish in the american army  from dixon we went to chicago  chicago is in many respects the most remarkable city among all the remarkable cities of the union its growth has been the fastest and its success the most assured twentyfive years ago there was no chicago and now it contains 120000 inhabitants  cincinnati on the ohio and st louis at the junction of the missouri and mississippi are larger towns but they have not grown large so quickly nor do they now promise so excessive a development of commerce  chicago may be called the metropolis of american cornthe favorite city haunt of the american ceres  the goddess seats herself there amid the dust of her full barns and proclaims herself a goddess ruling over things political and philosophical as well as agricultural  not furrows only are in her thoughts but free trade also and brotherly love and within her own bosom there is a boast that even yet she will be stronger than mars  in chicago there are great streets and rows of houses fit to be the residences of a new cornexchange nobility they look out on the wide lake which is now the highway for breadstuffs and the merchant as he shaves at his window sees his rapid ventures as they pass away one after the other toward the east  i went over one great grain store in chicago possessed by gentlemen of the name of sturgess and buckenham  it was a world in itself and the dustiest of all the worlds  it contained when i was there half a million bushels of wheator a very great many as i might say in other language  but it was not as a storehouse that this great building was so remarkable but as a channel or a river course for the flooding freshets of corn  it is so built that both railway vans and vessels come immediately under its claws as i may call the great trunks of the elevators  out of the railway vans the corn and wheat is clawed up into the building and down similar trunks it is at once again poured out into the vessels  i shall be at buffalo in a page or two and then i will endeavor to explain more minutely how this is done  at chicago the corn is bought and does change hands and much of it therefore is stored there for some space of time shorter or longer as the case may be  when i was at chicago the only limit to the rapidity of its transit was set by the amount of boat accommodation  there were not bottoms enough to take the corn away from chicago nor indeed on the railway was there a sufficiency of rolling stock or locomotive power to bring it into chicago  as i said before the country was bursting with its own produce and smothered in its own fruits  at chicago the hotel was bigger than other hotels and grander there were pipes without end for cold water which ran hot and for hot water which would not run at all  the postoffice also was grander and bigger than other postoffices though the postmaster confessed to me that that matter of the delivery of letters was one which could not be compassed  just at that moment it was being done as a private speculation but it did not pay and would be discontinued  the theater too was large handsome and convenient but on the night of my attendance it seemed to lack an audience  a good comic actor it did not lack and i never laughed more heartily in my life  there was something wrong too just at that timei could not make out whatin the constitution of illinois and the present moment had been selected for voting a new constitution  to us in england such a necessity would be considered a matter of importance but it did not seem to be much thought of here some slight alteration probably i suggested no said my informant one of the judges of their courts it is to be a thorough radical change of the whole constitution  they are voting the delegates today  i went to see them vote the delegates but unfortunately got into a wrong placeby invitationand was turned out not without some slight tumult  i trust that the new constitution was carried through successfully  from these little details it may perhaps be understood how a town like chicago goes on and prospers in spite of all the drawbacks which are incident to newness  men in those regions do not mind failures and when they have failed instantly begin again  they make their plans on a large scale and they who come after them fill up what has been wanting at first  those taps of hot and cold water will be made to run by the next owner of the hotel if not by the present owner  in another ten years the letters i do not doubt will all be delivered  long before that time the theater will probably be full  the new constitution is no doubt already at work and if found deficient another will succeed to it without any trouble to the state or any talk on the subject through the union  chicago was intended as a town of export for corn and therefore the corn stores have received the first attention  when i was there they were in perfect working order  from chicago we went on to cleveland a town in the state of ohio on lake erie again traveling by the sleepingcars  i found that these cars were universally mentioned with great horror and disgust by americans of the upper class  they always declared that they would not travel in them on any account  noise and dirt were the two objections  they are very noisy but to us belonged the happy power of sleeping down noise  i invariably slept all through the night and knew nothing about the noise  they are also very dirty extremely dirtydirty so as to cause much annoyance  but then they are not quite so dirty as the day cars  if dirt is to be a bar against traveling in america men and women must stay at home for myself i dont much care for dirt having a strong reliance on soap and water and scrubbingbrushes  no one regards poisons who carries antidotes in which he has perfect faith  cleveland is another pleasant townpleasant as milwaukee and portland  the streets are handsome and are shaded by grand avenues of trees  one of these streets is over a mile in length and throughout the whole of it there are trees on each sidenot little paltry trees as are to be seen on the boulevards of paris but spreading elms the beautiful american elm which not only spreads but droops also and makes more of its foliage than any other tree extant  and there is a square in cleveland well sized as large as russell square i should say with open paths across it and containing one or two handsome buildings  i cannot but think that all men and women in london would be great gainers if the iron rails of the squares were thrown down and the grassy inclosures thrown open to the public  of course the edges of the turf would be worn and the paths would not keep their exact shapes  but the prison look would be banished and the somber sadness of the squares would be relieved  i was particularly struck by the size and comfort of the houses at cleveland  all down that street of which i have spoken they do not stand continuously together but are detached and separatehouses which in england would require some fifteen or eighteen hundred a year for their maintenance  in the states however men commonly expend upon house rent a much greater proportion of their income than they do in england  with us it is i believe thought that a man should certainly not apportion more than a seventh of his spending income to his house rentsome say not more than a tenth but in many cities of the states a man is thought to live well within bounds if he so expends a fourth  there can be no doubt as to americans living in better houses than englishmen making the comparison of course between men of equal incomes  but the englishman has many more incidental expenses than the american  he spends more on wine on entertainments on horses and on amusements  he has a more numerous establishment and keeps up the adjuncts and outskirts of his residence with a more finished neatness  these houses in cleveland were very good as indeed they are in most northern towns but some of them have been erected with an amount of bad taste that is almost incredible  it is not uncommon to see in front of a square brick house a wooden quasigreek portico with a pediment and ionic columns equally high with the house itself  wooden columns with greek capitals attached to the doorways and wooden pediments over the windows are very frequent as a rule these are attached to houses which without such ornamentation would be simple unpretentious square roomy residences  an ionic or corinthian capital stuck on to a log of wood called a column and then fixed promiscuously to the outside of an ordinary house is to my eye the vilest of architectural pretenses  little turrets are better than this or even brown battlements made of mortar  except in america i do not remember to have seen these vicious bits of white timbertimber painted white plastered on to the fronts and sides of red brick houses  again we went on by rail to buffalo  i have traveled some thousands of miles by railway in the states taking long journeys by night and longer journeys by day but i do not remember that while doing so i ever made acquaintance with an american  to an american lady in a railway car i should no more think of speaking than i should to an unknown female in the next pew to me at a london church  it is hard to understand from whence come the laws which govern societies in this respect but there are different laws in different societies which soon obtain recognition for themselves  american ladies are much given to talking and are generally free from all mauvaise honte  they are collected in manner well instructed and resolved to have their share of the social advantages of the world  in this phase of life they come out more strongly than english women  but on a railway journey be it ever so long they are never seen speaking to a stranger english women however on english railways are generally willing to converse they will do so if they be on a journey but will not open their mouths if they be simply passing backward and forward between their homes and some neighboring town  we soon learn the rules on these subjects but who make the rules  if you cross the atlantic with an american lady you invariably fall in love with her before the journey is over  travel with the same woman in a railway car for twelve hours and you will have written her down in your own mind in quite other language than that of love  and now for buffalo and the elevators  i trust i have made it understood that corn comes into buffalo not only from chicago of which i have spoken specially but from all the ports round the lakes racine milwaukee grand haven port sarnia detroit toledo cleveland and many others  at these ports the produce is generally bought and sold but at buffalo it is merely passed through a gateway  it is taken from vessels of a size fitted for the lakes and placed in other vessels fitted for the canal  this is the erie canal which connects the lakes with the hudson river and with new york  the produce which passes through the welland canalthe canal which connects lake erie and the upper lakes with lake ontario and the st lawrenceis not transhipped seeing that the welland canal which is less than thirty miles in length gives a passage to vessels of 500 tons  as i have before said 60000000 bushels of breadstuff were thus pushed through buffalo in the open months of the year 1861  these open months run from the middle of april to the middle of november but the busy period is that of the last two monthsthe time that is which intervenes between the full ripening of the corn and the coming of the ice  an elevator is as ugly a monster as has been yet produced  in uncouthness of form it outdoes those obsolete old brutes who used to roam about the semiaqueous world and live a most uncomfortable life with their great hungering stomachs and huge unsatisfied maws the elevator itself consists of a big movable trunkmovable as is that of an elephant but not pliable and less graceful even than an elephants  this is attached to a huge granary or barn but in order to give altitude within the barn for the necessary moving up and down of this trunkseeing that it cannot be curled gracefully to its purposes as the elephants is curledthere is an awkward box erected on the roof of the barn giving some twenty feet of additional height up into which the elevator can be thrust  it will be understood then that this big movable trunk the head of which when it is at rest is thrust up into the box on the roof is made to slant down in an oblique direction from the building to the river for the elevator is an amphibious institution and flourishes only on the banks of navigable waters  when its head is ensconced within its box and the beast of prey is thus nearly hidden within the building the unsuspicious vessel is brought up within reach of the creatures trunk and down it comes like a musquitos proboscis right through the deck in at the open aperture of the hole and so into the very vitals and bowels of the ship  when there it goes to work upon its food with a greed and an avidity that is disgusting to a beholder of any taste or imagination  and now i must explain the anatomical arrangement by which the elevator still devours and continues to devour till the corn within its reach has all been swallowed masticated and digested  its long trunk as seen slanting down from out of the building across the wharf and into the ship is a mere wooden pipe but this pipe is divided within  it has two departments and as the grainbearing troughs pass up the one on a pliable band they pass empty down the other  the system therefore is that of an ordinary dredging machine only that corn and not mud is taken away and that the buckets or troughs are hidden from sight  below within the stomach of the poor bark three or four laborers are at work helping to feed the elevator  they shovel the corn up toward its maw so that at every swallow he should take in all that he can hold  thus the troughs as they ascend are kept full and when they reach the upper building they empty themselves into a shoot over which a porter stands guard moderating the shoot by a door which the weight of his finger can open and close  through this doorway the corn runs into a measure and is weighed  by measures of forty bushels each the tale is kept  there stands the apparatus with the figures plainly marked over against the porters eye and as the sum mounts nearly up to forty bushels he closes the door till the grains run thinly through hardly a handful at a time so that the balance is exactly struck  then the teller standing by marks down his figure and the record is made the exact porter touches the string of another door and the forty bushels of corn run out at the bottom of the measure disappear down another shoot slanting also toward the water and deposit themselves in the canal boat  the transit of the bushels of corn from the larger vessel to the smaller will have taken less than a minute and the cost of that transit will have beena farthing  but i have spoken of the rivers of wheat and i must explain what are those rivers  in the working of the elevator which i have just attempted to describe the two vessels were supposed to be lying at the same wharf on the same side of the building in the same water the smaller vessel inside the larger one  when this is the case the corn runs direct from the weighing measure into the shoot that communicates with the canal boat  but there is not room or time for confining the work to one side of the building  there is water on both sides and the corn or wheat is elevated on the one side and reshipped on the other  to effect this the corn is carried across the breadth of the building but nevertheless it is never handled or moved in its direction on trucks or carriages requiring the use of mens muscles for its motion  across the floor of the building are two gutters or channels and through these small troughs on a pliable band circulate very quickly they which run one way in one channel are laden they which return by the other channel are empty  the corn pours itself into these and they again pour it into the shoot which commands the other water  and thus rivers of corn are running through these buildings night and day  the secret of all the motion and arrangement consists of course in the elevation  the corn is lifted up and when lifted up can move itself and arrange itself and weigh itself and load itself  i should have stated that all this wheat which passes through buffalo comes loose in bulk  nothing is known of sacks or bags to any spectator at buffalo this becomes immediately a matter of course but this should be explained as we in england are not accustomed to see wheat traveling in this open unguarded and plebeian manner  wheat with us is aristocratic and travels always in its private carriage  over and beyond the elevators there is nothing specially worthy of remark at buffalo  it is a fine city like all other american cities of its class  the streets are broad the blocks are high and cars on tramways run all day and nearly all night as well    chapter xii  buffalo to new york   we had now before us only two points of interest before we should reach new yorkthe falls of trenton and west point on the hudson river  we were too late in the year to get up to lake george which lies in the state of new york north of albany and is in fact the southern continuation of lake champlain  lake george i know is very lovely and i would fain have seen it but visitors to it must have some hotel accommodation and the hotel was closed when we were near enough to visit it  i was in its close neighborhood three years since in june but then the hotel was not yet opened  a visitor to lake george must be very exact in his time  july and august are the monthswith perhaps the grace of a week in september  the hotel at trenton was also closed as i was told  but even if there were no hotel at trenton it can be visited without difficulty  it is within a carriage drive of utica and there is moreover a direct railway from utica with a station at the trenton falls  utica is a town on the line of railway from buffalo to new york via albany and is like all the other towns we had visited  there are broad streets and avenues of trees and large shops and excellent houses  a general air of fat prosperity pervades them all and is strong at utica as elsewhere  i remember to have been told thirty years ago that a traveler might go far and wide in search of the picturesque without finding a spot more romantic in its loveliness than trenton falls  the name of the river is canada creek west but as that is hardly euphonious the course of the water which forms the falls has been called after the town or parish  this course is nearly two miles in length and along the space of this two miles it is impossible to say where the greatest beauty exists  to see trenton aright one must be careful not to have too much water  a sufficiency is no doubt desirable and it may be that at the close of summer before any of the autumnal rains have fallen there may occasionally be an insufficiency  but if there be too much the passage up the rocks along the river is impossible  the way on which the tourist should walk becomes the bed of the stream and the great charm of the place cannot be enjoyed  that charm consists in descending into the ravine of the river down amid the rocks through which it has cut its channel and in walking up the bed against the stream in climbing the sides of the various falls and sticking close to the river till an envious block is reached which comes sheer down into the water and prevents farther progress  this is nearly two miles above the steps by which the descent is made and not a foot of this distance but is wildly beautiful  when the river is very low there is a pathway even beyond that block but when this is the case there can hardly be enough of water to make the fall satisfactory  there is no one special cataract at trenton which is in itself either wonderful or preeminently beautiful  it is the position form color and rapidity of the river which gives the charm  it runs through a deep ravine at the bottom of which the water has cut for itself a channel through the rocks the sides of which rise sometimes with the sharpness of the walls of a stone sarcophagus they are rounded too toward the bed as i have seen the bottom of a sarcophagus  along the side of the right bank of the river there is a passage which when the freshets come is altogether covered this passage is sometimes very narrow but in the narrowest parts an iron chain is affixed into the rock  it is slippery and wet and it is well for ladies when visiting the place to be provided with outside indiarubber shoes which keep a hold upon the stone if i remember rightly there are two actual cataractsone not far above the steps by which the descent is made into the channel and the other close under a summerhouse near to which the visitors reascend into the wood  but these cataracts though by no means despicable as cataracts leave comparatively a slight impression they tumble down with sufficient violence and the usual fantastic disposition of their forces but simply as cataracts within a days journey of niagara they would be nothing  up beyond the summer house the passage along the river can be continued for another mile but it is rough and the climbing in some places rather difficult for ladies  every man however who has the use of his legs should do it for the succession of rapids and the twistings of the channels and the forms of the rocks are as wild and beautiful as the imagination can desire  the banks of the river are closely wooded on each side and though this circumstance does not at first seem to add much to the beauty seeing that the ravine is so deep that the absence of wood above would hardly be noticed still there are broken clefts ever and anon through which the colors of the foliage show themselves and straggling boughs and rough roots break through the rocks here and there and add to the wildness and charm of the whole  the walk back from the summerhouse through the wood is very lovely but it would be a disappointing walk to visitors who had been prevented by a flood in the river from coming up the channel for it indicates plainly how requisite it is that the river should be seen from below and not from above  the best view of the larger fall itself is that seen from the wood  and here again i would point out that any male visitor should walk the channel of the river up and down  the descent is too slippery and difficult for bipeds laden with petticoats  we found a small hotel open at trenton at which we got a comfortable dinner and then in the evening were driven back to utica  albany is the capital of the state of new york and our road from trenton to west point lay through that town but these political state capitals have no interest in themselves  the state legislature was not sitting and we went on merely remarking that the manner in which the railway cars are made to run backward and forward through the crowded streets of the town must cause a frequent loss of human life  one is led to suppose that children in albany can hardly have a chance of coming to maturity  such accidents do not become the subject of longcontinued and strong comment in the states as they do with us but nevertheless i should have thought that such a state of things as we saw there would have given rise to some remark on the part of the philanthropists  i cannot myself say that i saw anybody killed and therefore should not be justified in making more than this passing remark on the subject  when first the americans of the northern states began to talk much of their country their claims as to fine scenery were confined to niagara and the hudson river  of niagara i have spoken and all the world has acknowledged that no claim made on that head can be regarded as exaggerated  as to the hudson i am not prepared to say so much generally though there is one spot upon it which cannot be beaten for sweetness  i have been up and down the hudson by water and confess that the entire river is pretty  but there is much of it that is not preeminently pretty among rivers  as a whole it cannot be named with the upper mississippi with the rhine with the moselle or with the upper rhone  the palisades just out of new york are pretty and the whole passage through the mountains from west point up to catskill and hudson is interesting  but the glory of the hudson is at west point itself and thither on this occasion we went direct by railway and there we remained for two days  the catskill mountains should be seen by a detour from off the river  we did not visit them because here again the hotel was closed  i will leave them therefore for the new hand book which mr murray will soon bring out  of west point there is something to be said independently of its scenery  it is the sandhurst of the states  here is their military school from which officers are drafted to their regiments and the tuition for military purposes is i imagine of a high order  it must of course be borne in mind that west point even as at present arranged is fitted to the wants of the old army and not to that of the army now required  it can go but a little way to supply officers for 500000 men but would do much toward supplying them for 40000  at the time of my visit to west point the regular army of the northern states had not even then swelled itself to the latter number  i found that there were 220 students at west point that about forty graduate every year each of whom receives a commission in the army that about 120 pupils are admitted every year and that in the course of every year about eighty either resign or are called upon to leave on account of some deficiency or fail in their final examination  the result is simply this that onethird of those who enter succeeds and that twothirds fail  the number of failures seemed to me to be terribly largeso large as to give great ground of hesitation to a parent in accepting a nomination for the college  i especially inquired into the particulars of these dismissals and resignations and was assured that the majority of them take place in the first year of the pupilage  it is soon seen whether or no a lad has the mental and physical capacities necessary for the education and future life required of him and care is taken that those shall be removed early as to whom it may be determined that the necessary capacity is clearly wanting  if this is doneand i do not doubt itthe evil is much mitigated  the effect otherwise would be very injurious  the lads remain till they are perhaps one and twenty and have then acquired aptitudes for military life but no other aptitudes  at that age the education cannot be commenced anew and moreover at that age the disgrace of failure is very injurious  the period of education used to be five years but has now been reduced to four  this was done in order that a double class might be graduated in 1861 to supply the wants of the war  i believe it is considered that but for such necessity as that the fifth year of education can be ill spared  the discipline to our english ideas is very strict  in the first place no kind of beer wine or spirits is allowed at west point the law upon this point may be said to be very vehement for it debars even the visitors at the hotel from the solace of a glass of beer  the hotel is within the bounds of the college and as the lads might become purchasers at the bar there is no bar allowed any breach of this law leads to instant expulsion or i should say rather any detection of such breach  the officer who showed us over the college assured me that the presence of a glass of wine in a young mans room would secure his exclusion even though there should be no evidence that he had tasted it  he was very firm as to this but a little bird of west point whose information though not official or probably accurate in words seemed to me to be worthy of reliance in general told me that eyes were wont to wink when such glasses of wine made themselves unnecessarily visible let us fancy an english mess of young men from seventeen to twenty one at which a mug of beer would be felony and a glass of wine high treason  but the whole management of the young with the americans differs much from that in vogue with us  we do not require so much at so early an age either in knowledge in morals or even in manliness  in america if a lad be under control as at west point he is called upon for an amount of labor and a degree of conduct which would be considered quite transcendental and out of the question in england  but if he be not under control if at the age of eighteen he be living at home or be from his circumstances exempt from professorial power he is a fullfledged man with his pipe apparatus and his bar acquaintances  and then i was told at west point how needful and yet how painful it was that all should be removed who were in any way deficient in credit to the establishment  our rules are very exact my informant told me but the carrying out of our rules is a task not always very easy  as to this also i had already heard something from that little bird of west point but of course i wisely assented to my informant remarking that discipline in such an establishment was essentially necessary  the little bird had told me that discipline at west point had been rendered terribly difficult by political interference  a young man will be dismissed by the unanimous voice of the board and will be sent away  and then after a week or two he will be sent back with an order from washington that another trial shall be given him  the lad will march back into the college with all the honors of a victory and will be conscious of a triumph over the superintendent and his officers  and is that common i asked  not at the present moment i was told  but it was common before the war while mr buchanan and mr pierce and mr polk were presidents no officer or board of officers then at west point was able to dismiss a lad whose father was a southerner and who had friends among the government  not only was this true of west point but the same allegation is true as to all matters of patronage throughout the united states during the three or four last presidencies and i believe back to the time of jackson there has been an organized system of dishonesty in the management of all beneficial places under the control of the government  i doubt whether any despotic court of europe has been so corrupt in the distribution of placesthat is in the selection of public officersas has been the assemblage of statesmen at washington  and this is the evil which the country is now expiating with its blood and treasure  it has allowed its knaves to stand in the high places and now it finds that knavish works have brought about evil results  but of this i shall be constrained to say something further hereafter  we went into all the schools of the college and made ourselves fully aware that the amount of learning imparted was far above our comprehension  it always occurs to me in looking through the new schools of the present day that i ought to be thankful to persons who know so much for condescending to speak to me at all in plain english  i said a word to the gentleman who was with me about horses seeing a lot of lads going to their riding lesson  but he was down upon me and crushed me instantly beneath the weight of my own ignorance  he walked me up to the image of a horse which he took to pieces bit by bit taking off skin muscle flesh nerves and bones till the animal was a heap of atoms and assured me that the anatomy of the horse throughout was one of the necessary studies of the place  we afterward went to see the riding  the horses themselves were poor enough  this was accounted for by the fact that such of them as had been found fit for military service had been taken for the use of the army  there is a gallery in the college in which are hung sketches and pictures by former students  i was greatly struck with the merit of many of these  there were some copies from wellknown works of art of very high excellence when the age is taken into account of those by whom they were done  i dont know how far the art of drawing as taught generally and with no special tendency to military instruction may be necessary for military training but if it be necessary i should imagine that more is done in that direction at west point than at sandhurst  i found however that much of that in the gallery which was good had been done by lads who had not obtained their degree and who had shown an aptitude for drawing but had not shown any aptitude for other pursuits necessary to their intended career  and then we were taken to the chapel and there saw displayed as trophies two of our own dear old english flags  i have seen many a banner hung up in token of past victory and many a flag taken on the field of battle mouldering by degrees into dust on some chapels wallbut they have not been the flags of england  till this day i had never seen our own colors in any position but one of selfassertion and independent power  from the tone used by the gentleman who showed them to me i could gather that he would have passed them by had he not foreseen that he could not do so without my notice  i dont know that we are right to put them there he said  quite right was my reply as long as the world does such things  in private life it is vulgar to triumph over ones friends and malicious to triumph over ones enemies  we have not got so far yet in public life but i hope we are advancing toward it  in the mean time i did not begrudge the americans our two flags  if we keep flags and cannons taken from our enemies and show them about as signs of our own prowess after those enemies have become friends why should not others do so as regards us  it clearly would not be well for the world that we should always beat other nations and never be beaten  i did not begrudge that chapel our two flags  but nevertheless the sight of them made me sick in the stomach and uncomfortable  as an englishman i do not want to be ascendant over any one  but it makes me very ill when any one tries to be ascendant over me  i wish we could send back with our compliments all the trophies that we hold carriage paid and get back in return those two flags and any other flag or two of our own that may be doing similar duty about the world  i take it that the parcel sent away would be somewhat more bulky than that which would reach us in return  the discipline at west point seemed as i have said to be very severe but it seemed also that that severity could not in all cases be maintained  the hours of study also were long being nearly continuous throughout the day  english lads of that age could not do it i said thus confessing that english lads must have in them less power of sustained work than those of america they must do it here said my informant or else leave us  and then he took us off to one of the young gentlemens quarters in order that we might see the nature of their rooms  we found the young gentleman fast asleep on his bed and felt uncommonly grieved that we should have thus intruded on him  as the hour was one of those allocated by my informant in the distribution of the day to private study i could not but take the present occupation of the embryo warrior as an indication that the amount of labor required might be occasionally too much even for an american youth  the heat makes one so uncommonly drowsy said the young man  i was not the least surprised at the exclamation  the air of the apartment had been warmed up to such a pitch by the hotpipe apparatus of the building that prolonged life to me would i should have thought be out of the question in such an atmosphere  do you always have it as hot as this i asked  the young man swore that it was so and with considerable energy expressed his opinion that all his health and spirits and vitality were being baked out of him  he seemed to have a strong opinion on the matter for which i respected him but it had never occurred to him and did not then occur to him that anything could be done to moderate that deathly flow of hot air which came up to him from the neighboring infernal regions  he was pale in the face and all the lads there were pale  american lads and lasses are all pale  men at thirty and women at twentyfive have had all semblance of youth baked out of them  infants even are not rosy and the only shades known on the cheeks of children are those composed of brown yellow and white  all this comes of those damnable hotair pipes with which every tenement in america is infested  we cannot do without them they say  our cold is so intense that we must heat our houses throughout  open fireplaces in a few rooms would not keep our toes and fingers from the frost  there is much in this  the assertion is no doubt true and thereby a great difficulty is created  it is no doubt quite within the power of american ingenuity to moderate the heat of these stoves and to produce such an atmosphere as may be most conducive to health  in hospitals no doubt this will be done perhaps is done at presentthough even in hospitals i have thought the air hotter than it should be  but hotair drinking is like dramdrinking  there is the machine within the house capable of supplying any quantity and those who consume it unconsciously increase their draughts and take their drains stronger and stronger till a breath of fresh air is felt to be a blast direct from boreas  west point is at all points a military colony and as such belongs exclusively to the federal government as separate from the government of any individual state  it is the purchased property of the united states as a whole and is devoted to the necessities of a military college  no man could take a house there or succeed in getting even permanent lodgings unless he belonged to or were employed by the establishment  there is no intercourse by road between west point and other towns or villages on the river side and any such intercourse even by water is looked upon with jealousy by the authorities  the wish is that west point should be isolated and kept apart for military instruction to the exclusion of all other purposes whateverespecially lovemaking purposes  the coming over from the other side of the water of young ladies by the ferry is regarded as a great hinderance  they will come and then the military students will talk to them  we all know to what such talking leads  a lad when i was there had been tempted to get out of barracks in plain clothes in order that he might call on a young lady at the hotel and was in consequence obliged to abandon his commission and retire from the academy  will that young lady ever again sleep quietly in her bed  i should hope not  an opinion was expressed to me that there should be no hotel in such a placethat there should be no ferry no roads no means by which the attention of the students should be distractedthat these military rasselases should live in a happy military valley from which might be excluded both strong drinks and female charmsthose two poisons from which youthful military ardor is supposed to suffer so much  it always seems to me that such training begins at the wrong end i will not say that nothing should be done to keep lads of eighteen from strong drinks  i will not even say that there should not be some line of moderation with reference to feminine allurements but as a rule the restraint should come from the sense good feeling and education of him who is restrained  there is no embargo on the beershops either at harrow or at oxfordand certainly none upon the young ladies  occasional damage may accrue from habits early depraved or a heart too early and too easily susceptible but the injury so done is not i think equal to that inflicted by a draconian code of morals which will probably be evaded and will certainly create a desire for its evasion  nevertheless i feel assured that west point taken as a whole is an excellent military academy and that young men have gone forth from it and will go forth from it fit for officers as far as training can make men fit  the fault if fault there be is that which is to be found in so many of the institutions of the united states and is one so allied to a virtue that no foreigner has a right to wonder that it is regarded in the light of a virtue by all americans  there has been an attempt to make the place too perfect  in the desire to have the establishment selfsufficient at all points more has been attempted than human nature can achieve  the lad is taken to west point and it is presumed that from the moment of his reception he shall expend every energy of his mind and body in making himself a soldier  at fifteen he is not to be a boy at twenty he is not to be a young man  he is to be a gentleman a soldier and an officer  i believe that those who leave the college for the army are gentlemen soldiers and officers and therefore the result is good  but they are also young men and it seems that they have become so not in accordance with their training but in spite of it  but i have another complaint to make against the authorities of west point which they will not be able to answer so easily as that already preferred  what right can they have to take the very prettiest spot on the hudsonthe prettiest spot on the continent one of the prettiest spots which nature with all her vagaries ever formedand shut it up from all the world for purposes of war would not any plain however ugly do for military exercises cannot broadsword goosestep and doublequick time be instilled into young hands and legs in any field of thirty forty or fifty acres  i wonder whether these lads appreciate the fact that they are studying fourteen hours a day amid the sweetest river rock and mountain scenery that the imagination can conceive  of course it will be said that the world at large is not excluded from west point that the ferry to the place is open and that there is even a hotel there closed against no man or woman who will consent to become a teetotaller for the period of his visit  i must admit that this is so but still one feels that one is only admitted as a guest  i want to go and live at west point and why should i be prevented  the government had a right to buy it of course but government should not buy up the prettiest spots on a countrys surface  if i were an american i should make a grievance of this but americans will suffer things from their government which no englishmen would endure  it is one of the peculiarities of west point that everything there is in good taste  the point itself consists of a bluff of land so formed that the river hudson is forced to run round three sides of it  it is consequently a peninsula and as the surrounding country is mountainous on both sides of the river it may be imagined that the site is good  the views both up and down the river are lovely and the mountains behind break themselves so as to make the landscape perfect  but this is not all  at west point there is much of buildings much of military arrangement in the way of cannons forts and artillery yards  all these things are so contrived as to group themselves well into pictures  there is no picture of architectural grandeur but everything stands well and where it should stand and the eye is not hurt at any spot  i regard west point as a delightful place and was much gratified by the kindness i received there  from west point we went direct to new york    chapter xiii  an apology for the war   i think it may be received as a fact that the northern states taken together sent a full tenth of their ablebodied men into the ranks of the army in the course of the summer and autumn of 1861 the south no doubt sent a much larger proportion but the effect of such a drain upon the south would not be the same because the slaves were left at home to perform the agricultural work of the country  i very much doubt whether any other nation ever made such an effort in so short a time  to a people who can do this it may well be granted that they are in earnest and i do not think it should be lightly decided by any foreigner that they are wrong the strong and unanimous impulse of a great people is seldom wrong and let it be borne in mind that in this case both people may be rightthe people both of north and south  each may have been guided by a just and noble feeling though each was brought to its present condition by bad government and dishonest statesmen  there can be no doubt that since the commencement of the war the american feeling against england has been very bitter  all americans to whom i spoke on the subject admitted that it was so i as an englishman felt strongly the injustice of this feeling and lost no opportunity of showing or endeavoring to show that the line of conduct pursued by england toward the states was the only line which was compatible with her own policy and just interests and also with the dignity of the states government  i heard much of the tender sympathy of russia  russia sent a flourishing general message saying that she wished the north might win and ending with some good general advice proposing peace  it was such a message as strong nations send to those which are weaker  had england ventured on such counsel the diplomatic paper would probably have been returned to her  it is i think manifest that an absolute and disinterested neutrality has been the only course which could preserve england from deserved rebukea neutrality on which her commercial necessity for importing cotton or exporting her own manufactures should have no effect  that our government would preserve such a neutrality i have always insisted and i believe it has been done with a pure and strict disregard to any selfish views on the part of great britain  so far i think england may feel that she has done well in this matter  but i must confess that i have not been so proud of the tone of all our people at home as i have been of the decisions of our statesmen  it seems to me that some of us never tire in abusing the americans and calling them names for having allowed themselves to be driven into this civil war  we tell them that they are fools and idiots we speak of their doings as though there had been some plain course by which the war might have been avoided and we throw it in their teeth that they have no capability for war  we tell them of the debt which they are creating and point out to them that they can never pay it  we laugh at their attempt to sustain loyalty and speak of them as a steady father of a family is wont to speak of some unthrifty prodigal who is throwing away his estate and hurrying from one ruinous debauchery to another  and alas we too frequently allow to escape from us some expression of that satisfaction which one rival tradesman has in the downfall of another  here you are with all your boasting is what we say you were going to whip all creation the other day and it has come to this  brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better  pray remember that if ever you find yourselves on your legs again that little advice about the two dogs is very well and was not altogether inapplicable  but this is not the time in which it should be given  putting aside slight asperities we will all own that the people of the states have been and are our friends and that as friends we cannot spare them  for one englishman who brings home to his own heart a feeling of cordiality for francea belief in the affection of our french alliancethere are ten who do so with reference to the states  now in these days of their trouble i think that we might have borne with them more tenderly  and how was it possible that they should have avoided this war  i will not now go into the cause of it or discuss the course which it has taken but will simply take up the fact of the rebellion the south rebelled against the north and such being the case was it possible that the north should yield without a war  it may very likely be well that hungary should be severed from austria or poland from russia or venice from austria  taking englishmen in a lump they think that such separation would be well  the subject people do not speak the language of those that govern them or enjoy kindred interests  but yet when military efforts are made by those who govern hungary poland and venice to prevent such separation we do not say that russia and austria are fools  we are not surprised that they should take up arms against the rebels but would be very much surprised indeed if they did not do so  we know that nothing but weakness would prevent their doing so  but if austria and russia insist on tying to themselves a people who do not speak their language or live in accordance with their habits and are not considered unreasonable in so insisting how much more thoroughly would they carry with them the sympathy of their neighbors in preventing any secession by integral parts of their own nationalities  would england let ireland walk off by herself if she wished it  in 1843 she did wish it  threefourths of the irish population would have voted for such a separation but england would have prevented such a secession vi et armis had ireland driven her to the necessity of such prevention  i will put it to any reader of history whether since government commenced it has not been regarded as the first duty of government to prevent a separation of the territories governed and whether also it has not been regarded as a point of honor with all nationalities to preserve uninjured each its own greatness and its own power  i trust that i may not be thought to argue that all governments or even all nationalities should succeed in such endeavors  few kings have fallen in my day in whose fate i have not rejoicednone i take it except that poor citizen king of the french  and i can rejoice that england lost her american colonies and shall rejoice when spain has been deprived of cuba  but i hold that citizen king of the french in small esteem seeing that he made no fight and i know that england was bound to struggle when the boston people threw her tea into the water  spain keeps a tighter hand on cuba than we thought she would some ten years since and therefore she stands higher in the worlds respect  it may be well that the south should be divided from the north  i am inclined to think that it would be wellat any rate for the north but the south must have been aware that such division could only be effected in two ways either by agreement in which case the proposition must have been brought forward by the south and discussed by the north or by violence  they chose the latter way as being the readier and the surer as most seceding nations have done  oconnell when struggling for the secession of ireland chose the other and nothing came of it  the south chose violence and prepared for it secretly and with great adroitness  if that be not rebellion there never has been rebellion since history began and if civil war was ever justified in one portion of a nation by turbulence in another it has now been justified in the northern states of america  what was the north to do this foolish north which has been so liberally told by us that she has taken up arms for nothing that she is fighting for nothing and will ruin herself for nothing when was she to take the first step toward peace  surely every englishman will remember that when the earliest tidings of the coming quarrel reached us on the election of mr lincoln we all declared that any division was impossible it was a mere madness to speak of it  the states which were so great in their unity would never consent to break up all their prestige and all their power by a separation  would it have been well for the north then to say if the south wish it we will certainly separate  after that when mr lincoln assumed the power to which he had been elected and declared with sufficient manliness and sufficient dignity also that he would make no war upon the south but would collect the customs and carry on the government did we turn round and advise him that he was wrong  no  the idea in england then was that his message was if anything too mild  if he means to be president of the whole union england said he must come out with something stronger than that  then came mr sewards speech which was in truth weak enough  mr seward had ran mr lincoln very hard for the presidents chair on the republican interest and was most unfortunately as i think made secretary of state by mr lincoln or by his party  the secretary of state holds the highest office in the united states government under the president  he cannot be compared to our prime minister seeing that the president himself exercises political power and is responsible for its exercise  mr sewards speech simply amounted to a declaration that separation was a thing of which the union would neither hear speak nor if possible think  things looked very like it but no they could never come to that  the world was too good and especially the american world  mr seward had no specific against secession but let every free man strike his breast look up to heaven determine to be good and all would go right  a great deal had been expected from mr seward and when this speech came out we in england were a little disappointed and nobody presumed even then that the north would let the south go  it will be argued by those who have gone into the details of american politics that an acceptance of the crittenden compromise at this point would have saved the war  what is or was the crittenden compromise i will endeavor to explain hereafter but the terms and meaning of that compromise can have no bearing on the subject  the republican party who were in power disapproved of that compromise and could not model their course upon it  the republican party may have been right or may have been wrong but surely it will not be argued that any political party elected to power by a majority should follow the policy of a minority lest that minority should rebel  i can conceive of no government more lowly placed than one which deserts the policy of the majority which supports it fearing either the tongues or arms of a minority  as the next scene in the play the state of south carolina bombarded fort sumter  was that to be the moment for a peaceable separation  let us suppose that oconnell had marched down to the pigeon house at dublin and had taken it in 1843 let us say would that have been an argument to us for allowing ireland to set up for herself  is that the way of mens minds or of the minds of nations  the powers of the president were defined by law as agreed upon among all the states of the union and against that power and against that law south carolina raised her hand and the other states joined her in rebellion  when circumstances had come to that it was no longer possible that the north should shun the war  to my thinking the rights of rebellion are holy  where would the world have been or where would the world hope to be without rebellion  but let rebellion look the truth in the face and not blanch from its own consequences  she has to judge her own opportunities and to decide on her own fitness  success is the test of her judgment  but rebellion can never be successful except by overcoming the power against which she raises herself  she has no right to expect bloodless triumphs and if she be not the stronger in the encounter which she creates she must bear the penalty of her rashness  rebellion is justified by being better served than constituted authority but cannot be justified otherwise  now and again it may happen that rebellions cause is so good that constituted authority will fall to the ground at the first glance of her sword  this was so the other day in naples when garibaldi blew away the kings armies with a breath  but this is not so often  rebellion knows that it must fight and the legalized power against which rebels rise must of necessity fight also  i cannot see at what point the north first sinned nor do i think that had the north yielded england would have honored her for her meekness  had she yielded without striking a blow she would have been told that she had suffered the union to drop asunder by her supineness  she would have been twitted with cowardice and told that she was no match for southern energy  it would then have seemed to those who sat in judgment on her that she might have righted everything by that one blow from which she had abstained but having struck that one blow and having found that it did not suffice could she then withdraw give way and own herself beaten has it been so usually with anglosaxon pluck  in such case as that would there have been no mention of those two dogs brag and holdfast  the man of the northern states knows that he has braggedbragged as loudly as his english forefathers  in that matter of bragging the british lion and the starspangled banner may abstain from throwing mud at each other  and now the northern man wishes to show that he can hold fast also  looking at all this i cannot see that peace has been possible to the north  as to the question of secession and rebellion being one and the same thing the point to me does not seem to bear an argument  the confederation of states had a common army a common policy a common capital a common government and a common debt  if one might secede any or all might secede and where then would be their property their debt and their servants  a confederation with such a license attached to it would have been simply playing at national power  if new york had secededa state which stretches from the atlantic to british north americait would have cut new england off from the rest of the union  was it legally within the power of new york to place the six states of new england in such a position  and why should it be assumed that so suicidal a power of destroying a nationality should be inherent in every portion of the nation  the slates are bound together by a written compact but that compact gives each state no such power  surely such a power would have been specified had it been intended that it should be given  but there are axioms in politics as in mathematics which recommend themselves to the mind at once and require no argument for their proof  men who are not argumentative perceive at once that they are true  a part cannot be greater than the whole  i think it is plain that the remnant of the union was bound to take up arms against those states which had illegally torn themselves off from her and if so she could only do so with such weapons as were at her hand  the united states army had never been numerous or well appointed and of such officers and equipments as it possessed the more valuable part was in the hands of the southerners  it was clear enough that she was ill provided and that in going to war she was undertaking a work as to which she had still to learn many of the rudiments  but englishmen should be the last to twit her with such ignorance  it is not yet ten years since we were all boasting that swords and guns were useless things and that military expenditure might be cut down to any minimum figure that an economizing chancellor of the exchequer could name  since that we have extemporized two if not three armies  there are our volunteers at home and the army which holds india can hardly be considered as one with that which is to maintain our prestige in europe and the west  we made some natural blunders in the crimea but in making those blunders we taught ourselves the trade  it is the misfortune of the northern states that they must learn these lessons in fighting their own countrymen  in the course of our history we have suffered the same calamity more than once  the roundheads who beat the cavaliers and created english liberty made themselves soldiers on the bodies of their countrymen  but england was not ruined by that civil war nor was she ruined by those which preceded it  from out of these she came forth stronger than she entered themstronger better and more fit for a great destiny in the history of nations  the northern states had nearly five hundred thousand men under arms when the winter of 1861 commenced and for that enormous multitude all commissariat requirements were well supplied  camps and barracks sprang up through the country as though by magic clothing was obtained with a rapidity that has i think never been equaled  the country had not been prepared for the fabrication of arms and yet arms were put into the mens hands almost as quickly as the regiments could be mustered  the eighteen millions of the northern states lent themselves to the effort as one man  each state gave the best it had to give  newspapers were as rabid against each other as ever but no newspaper could live which did not support the war  the south has rebelled against the law and the law shall be supported  this has been the cry and the heartfelt feeling of all men and it is a feeling which cannot but inspire respect  we have heard much of the tyranny of the present government of the united states and of the tyranny also of the people  they have both been very tyrannical  the habeas corpus has been suspended by the word of one man  arrests have been made on men who have been hardly suspected of more than secession principles  arrests have i believe been made in cases which have been destitute even of any fair ground for such suspicion  newspapers have been stopped for advocating views opposed to the feelings of the north as freely as newspapers were ever stopped in france for opposing the emperor  a man has not been safe in the streets who was known to be a secessionist  it must be at once admitted that opinion in the northern states was not free when i was there  but has opinion ever been free anywhere on all subjects  in the best built strongholds of freedom have there not always been questions on which opinion has not been free and must it not always be so when the decision of a people on any matter has become so to say unanimouswhen it has shown itself to be so general as to be clearly the expression of the nations voice as a single chorus that decision becomes holy and may not be touched  could any newspaper be produced in england which advocated the overthrow of the queen  and why may not the passion for the union be as strong with the northern states as the passion for the crown is strong with us  the crown with us is in no danger and therefore the matter is at rest  but i think we must admit that in any nation let it be ever so free there may be points on which opinion must be held under restraint  and as to those summary arrests and the suspension of the habeas corpus is there not something to be said for the states government on that head also  military arrests are very dreadful and the soul of a nations liberty is that personal freedom from arbitrary interference which is signified to the world by those two unintelligible latin words  a mans body shalt not be kept in duress at any mans will but shall be brought up into open court with uttermost speed in order that the law may say whether or no it should be kept in duress  that i take it is the meaning of habeas corpus and it is easy to see that the suspension of that privilege destroys all freedom and places the liberty of every individual at the mercy of him who has the power to suspend it  nothing can be worse than this and such suspension if extended over any long period of years will certainly make a nation weak mean spirited and poor  but in a period of civil war or even of a widelyextended civil commotion things cannot work in their accustomed grooves  a lady does not willingly get out of her bedroomwindow with nothing on but her nightgown but when her house is on fire she is very thankful for an opportunity of doing so  it is not long since the habeas corpus was suspended in parts of ireland and absurd arrests were made almost daily when that suspension first took effect  it was grievous that there should be necessity for such a step and it is very grievous now that such necessity should be felt in the northern states  but i do not think that it becomes englishmen to bear hardly upon americans generally for what has been done in that matter  mr seward in an official letter to the british minister at washingtonwhich letter through official dishonesty found its way to the pressclaimed for the president the right of suspending the habeas corpus in the states whenever it might seem good to him to do so  if this be in accordance with the law of the land which i think must be doubted the law of the land is not favorable to freedom  for myself i conceive that mr lincoln and mr seward have been wrong in their law and that no such right is given to the president by the constitution of the united states  this i will attempt to prove in some subsequent chapter  but i think it must be felt by all who have given any thought to the constitution of the states that let what may be the letter of the law the presidents of the united states have had no such power  it is because the states have been no longer united that mr lincoln has had the power whether it be given to him by the law or no  and then as to the debt it seems to me very singular that we in england should suppose that a great commercial people would be ruined by a national debt  as regards ourselves i have always looked on our national debt as the ballast in our ship  we have a great deal of ballast but then the ship is very big  the states also are taking in ballast at a rather rapid rate and we too took it in quickly when we were about it  but i cannot understand why their ship should not carry without shipwreck that which our ship has carried without damage and as i believe with positive advantage to its sailing  the ballast if carried honestly will not i think bring the vessel to grief  the fear is lest the ballast should be thrown overboard  so much i have said wishing to plead the cause of the northern states before the bar of english opinion and thinking that there is ground for a plea in their favor  but yet i cannot say that their bitterness against englishmen has been justified or that their tone toward england has been dignified  their complaint is that they have received no sympathy from england but it seems to me that a great nation should not require an expression of sympathy during its struggle  sympathy is for the weak rather than for the strong  when i hear two powerful men contending together in argument i do not sympathize with him who has the best of it but i watch the precision of his logic and acknowledge the effects of his rhetoric  there has been a whining weakness in the complaints made by americans against england which has done more to lower them as a people in my judgment than any other part of their conduct during the present crisis  when we were at war with russia the feeling of the states was strongly against us  all their wishes were with our enemies  when the indian mutiny was at its worst the feeling of france was equally adverse to us  the joy expressed by the french newspapers was almost ecstatic  but i do not think that on either occasion we bemoaned ourselves sadly on the want of sympathy shown by our friends  on each occasion we took the opinion expressed for what it was worth and managed to live it down  we listened to what was said and let it pass by when in each case we had been successful there was an end of our friends croakings  but in the northern states of america the bitterness against england has amounted almost to a passion  the playersthose chroniclers of the timehave had no hits so sure as those which have been aimed at englishmen as cowards fools and liars  no paper has dared to say that england has been true in her american policy  the name of an englishman has been made a byword for reproach  in private intercourse private amenities have remained i at any rate may boast that such has been the case as regards myself  but even in private life i have been unable to keep down the feeling that i have always been walking over smothered ashes  it may be that when the civil war in america is over all this will pass by and there will be nothing left of international bitterness but its memory  it is sincerely to be hoped that this may be sothat even the memory of the existing feeling may fade away and become unreal  i for one cannot think that two nations situated as are the states and england should permanently quarrel and avoid each other  but words have been spoken which will i fear long sound in mens ears and thoughts have sprung up which will not easily allow themselves to be extinguished    chapter xiv  new york   speaking of new york as a traveler i have two faults to find with it  in the first place there is nothing to see and in the second place there is no mode of getting about to see anything nevertheless new york is a most interesting city  it is the third biggest city in the known world for those chinese congregations of unwinged ants are not cities in the known world  in no other city is there a population so mixed and cosmopolitan in their modes of life  and yet in no other city that i have seen are there such strong and ever visible characteristics of the social and political bearings of the nation to which it belongs  new york appears to me as infinitely more american than boston chicago or washington it has no peculiar attribute of its own as have those three citiesboston in its literature and accomplished intelligence chicago in its internal trade and washington in its congressional and state politics  new york has its literary aspirations its commercial grandeur and heaven knows it has its politics also but these do not strike the visitor as being specially characteristic of the city  that it is preeminently american is its glory or its disgrace as men of different ways of thinking may decide upon it  free institutions general education and the ascendency of dollars are the words written on every pavingstone along fifth avenue down broadway and up wall street  every man can vote and values the privilege  every man can read and uses the privilege  every man worships the dollar and is down before his shrine from morning to night  as regards voting and reading no american will be angry with me for saying so much of him and no englishman whatever may be his ideas as to the franchise in his own country will conceive that i have said aught to the dishonor of an american  but as to that dollarworshiping it will of course seem that i am abusing the new yorkers  we all know what a wretchedly wicked thing money ishow it stands between us and heavenhow it hardens our hearts and makes vulgar our thoughts  dives has ever gone to the devil while lazarus has been laid up in heavenly lavender  the hand that employs itself in compelling gold to enter the service of man has always been stigmatized as the ravisher of things sacred  the world is agreed about that and therefore the new yorker is in a bad way  there are very few citizens in any town known to me which under this dispensation are in a good way but the new yorker is in about the worst way of all  other men the world over worship regularly at the shrine with matins and vespers nones and complines and whatever other daily services may be known to the religious houses but the new yorker is always on his knees  that is the amount of the charge which i bring against new york and now having laid on my paint thickly i shall proceed like an unskillful artist to scrape a great deal of it off again  new york has been a leading commercial city in the world for not more than fifty or sixty years  as far as i can learn its population at the close of the last century did not exceed 60000 and ten years later it had not reached 100000  in 1860 it had reached nearly 800000 in the city of new york itself  to this number must be added the numbers of brooklyn williamsburg and jersey city in order that a true conception may be had of the population of this american metropolis seeing that those places are as much a part of new york as southwark is of london  by this the total will be swelled to considerably above a million  it will no doubt be admitted that this growth has been very fast and that new york may well be proud of it  increase of population is i take it the only trustworthy sign of a nations success or of a citys success we boast that london has beaten the other cities of the world and think that that boast is enough to cover all the social sins for which london has to confess her guilt  new york beginning with 60000 sixty years since has now a million soulsa million mouths all of which eat a sufficiency of bread all of which speak ore rotundo and almost all of which can read  and this has come of its love of dollars  for myself i do not believe that dives is so black as he is painted or that his peril is so imminent  to reconcile such an opinion with holy writ might place me in some difficulty were i a clergyman  clergymen in these days are surrounded by difficulties of this naturefinding it necessary to explain away many oldestablished teachings which narrowed the christian church and to open the door wide enough to satisfy the aspirations and natural hopes of instructed men  the brethren of dives are now so many and so intelligent that they will no longer consent to be damned without looking closely into the matter themselves  i will leave them to settle the matter with the church merely assuring them of my sympathy in their little difficulties in any case in which mere money causes the hitch  to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow was mans curse in adams day but is certainly mans blessing in our day  and what is eating ones bread in the sweat of ones brow but making money  i will believe no man who tells me that he would not sooner earn two loaves than oneand if two then two hundred  i will believe no man who tells me that he would sooner earn one dollar a day than twoand if two then two hundred  that is in the very nature of the argument caeteris paribus  when a man tells me that he would prefer one honest loaf to two that are dishonest i will in all possible cases believe him  so also a man may prefer one quiet loaf to two that are unquiet  but under circumstances that are the same and to a man who is sane a whole loaf is better than half and two loaves are better than one  the preachers have preached well but on this matter they have preached in vain  dives has never believed that he will be damned because he is dives  he has never even believed that the temptations incident to his position have been more than a fair counterpoise or even so much as a fair counterpoise to his opportunities for doing good  all men who work desire to prosper by their work and they so desire by the nature given to them from god  wealth and progress must go on hand in hand together let the accidents which occasionally divide them for a time happen as often as they may  the progress of the americans has been caused by their aptitude for moneymaking and that continual kneeling at the shrine of the coined goddess has carried them across from new york to san francisco  men who kneel at that shrine are called on to have ready wits and quick hands and not a little aptitude for selfdenial  the new yorker has been true to his dollar because his dollar has been true to him  but not on this account can i nor on this account will any englishman reconcile himself to the savor of dollars which pervades the atmosphere of new york  the ars celare artem is wanting  the making of money is the work of man but he need not take his work to bed with him and have it ever by his side at table amid his family in church while he disports himself as he declares his passion to the girl of his heart in the moments of his softest bliss and at the periods of his most solemn ceremonies  that many do so elsewhere than in new yorkin london for instance in paris among the mountains of switzerland and the steppes of russiai do not doubt  but there is generally a vail thrown over the object of the worshipers idolatry  in new york ones ear is constantly filled with the fanatics voice as he prays ones eyes are always on the familiar altar  the frankincense from the temple is ever in ones nostrils  i have never walked down fifth avenue alone without thinking of money  i have never walked there with a companion without talking of it  i fancy that every man there in order to maintain the spirit of the place should bear on his forehead a label stating how many dollars he is worth and that every label should be expected to assert a falsehood  i do not think that new york has been less generous in the use of its money than other cities or that the men of new york generally are so  perhaps i might go farther and say that in no city has more been achieved for humanity by the munificence of its richest citizens than in new york  its hospitals asylums and institutions for the relief of all ailments to which flesh is heir are very numerous and beyond praise in the excellence of their arrangements  and this has been achieved in a great degree by private liberality  men in america are not as a rule anxious to leave large fortunes to their children  the millionaire when making his will very generally gives back a considerable portion of the wealth which he has made to the city in which he made it  the rich citizen is always anxious that the poor citizen shall be relieved  it is a point of honor with him to raise the character of his municipality and to provide that the deaf and dumb the blind the mad the idiots the old and the incurable shall have such alleviation in their misfortune as skill and kindness can afford  nor is the new yorker a huggermugger with his money  he does not hide up his dollars in old stockings and keep rolls of gold in hidden pots  he does not even invest it where it will not grow but only produce small though sure fruit  he builds houses he speculates largely he spreads himself in trade to the extent of his wingsand not seldom somewhat farther  he scatters his wealth broadcast over strange fields trusting that it may grow with an increase of a hundredfold but bold to bear the loss should the strange field prove itself barren  his regret at losing his money is by no means commensurate with his desire to make it  in this there is a living spirit which to me divests the dollarworshiping idolatry of something of its ugliness  the hand when closed on the gold is instantly reopened  the idolator is anxious to get but he is anxious also to spend  he is energetic to the last and has no comfort with his stock unless it breeds with transatlantic rapidity of procreation  so much i say being anxious to scrape off some of that daub of black paint with which i have smeared the face of my new yorker but not desiring to scrape it all off  for myself i do not love to live amid the clink of gold and never have a good time as the americans say when the price of shares and percentages come up in conversation  that state of mens minds here which i have endeavored to explain tends i think to make new york disagreeable  a stranger there who has no great interest in percentages soon finds himself anxious to escape  by degrees he perceives that he is out of his element and had better go away he calls at the bank and when he shows himself ignorant as to the price at which his sovereigns should be done he is conscious that he is ridiculous  he is like a man who goes out hunting for the first time at forty years of age  he feels himself to be in the wrong place and is anxious to get out of it  such was my experience of new york at each of the visits that i paid to it  but yet i say again no other american city is so intensely american as new york  it is generally considered that the inhabitants of new england the yankees properly so called have the american characteristics of physiognomy in the fullest degree the lantern jaws the thin and lithe body the dry face on which there has been no tint of the rose since the babys longclothes were first abandoned the harsh thick hair the thin lips the intelligent eyes the sharp voice with the nasal twangnot altogether harsh though sharp and nasalall these traits are supposed to belong especially to the yankee  perhaps it was so once but at present they are i think more universally common in new york than in any other part of the states  go to wall street the front of the astor house and the regions about trinity church and you will find them in their fullest perfection  what circumstances of blood or food of early habit or subsequent education have created for the latterday american his present physiognomy  it is as completely marked as much his own as is that of any race under the sun that has bred in and in for centuries  but the american owns a more mixed blood than any other race known  the chief stock is english which is itself so mixed that no man can trace its ramifications  with this are mingled the bloods of ireland holland france sweden and germany  all this has been done within but a few years so that the american may be said to have no claim to any national type of face  nevertheless no man has a type of face so clearly national as the american  he is acknowledged by it all over the continent of europe and on his own side of the water is gratified by knowing that he is never mistaken for his english visitor  i think it comes from the hot air pipes and from dollar worship  in the jesuit his mode of dealing with things divine has given a peculiar cast of countenance and why should not the american be similarly moulded by his special aspirations  as to the hotair pipes there can i think be no doubt that to them is to be charged the murder of all rosy cheeks throughout the states  if the effect was to be noticed simply in the dry faces of the men about wall street i should be very indifferent to the matter  but the young ladies of fifth avenue are in the same category  the very pith and marrow of life is baked out of their young bones by the hotair chambers to which they are accustomed  hot air is the great destroyer of american beauty  in saying that there is very little to be seen in new york i have also said that there is no way of seeing that little  my assertion amounts to this that there are no cabs  to the reading world at large this may not seem to be much but let the reading world go to new york and it will find out how much the deficiency means  in london in paris in florence in rome in the havana or at grand cairo the cabdriver or attendant does not merely drive the cab or belabor the donkey but he is the visitors easiest and cheapest guide  in london the tower westminster abbey and madame tussaud are found by the stranger without difficulty and almost without a thought because the cabdriver knows the whereabouts and the way space is moreover annihilated and the huge distances of the english metropolis are brought within the scope of mortal power but in new york there is no such institution  in new york there are street omnibuses as we havethere are street cars such as last year we declined to have and there are very excellent public carriages but none of these give you the accommodation of a cab nor can all of them combined do so  the omnibuses though clean and excellent were to me very unintelligible  they have no conductor to them  to know their different lines and usages a man should have made a scientific study of the city  to those going up and down broadway i became accustomed but in them i was never quite at my ease  the money has to be paid through a little hole behind the drivers back and should as i learned at last be paid immediately on entrance  but in getting up to do this i always stumbled about and it would happen that when with considerable difficulty i had settled my own account two or three ladies would enter and would hand me without a word some coins with which i had no lifelong familiarity in order that i might go through the same ceremony on their account  the change i would usually drop into the straw and then there would arise trouble and unhappiness  before i became aware of that law as to instant payment bells used to be rung at me which made me uneasy  i knew i was not behaving as a citizen should behave but could not compass the exact points of my delinquency  and then when i desired to escape the door being strapped up tight i would halloo vainly at the driver through the little hole whereas had i known my duty i should have rung a bell or pulled a strap according to the nature of the omnibus in question  in a month or two all these things may possibly be learned but the visitor requires his facilities for locomotion at the first moment of his entrance into the city  i heard it asserted by a lecturer in boston mr wendell phillips whose name is there a household word that citizens of the united states carried brains in their fingers as well as in their heads whereas common people by which mr phillips intended to designate the remnant of mankind beyond the united states were blessed with no such extended cerebral development  having once learned this fact from mr phillips i understood why it was that a new york omnibus should be so disagreeable to me and at the same time so suitable to the wants of the new yorkers  and then there are street carsvery long omnibuseswhich run on rails but are dragged by horses  they are capable of holding forty passengers each and as far as my experience goes carry an average load of sixty  the fare of the omnibus is six cents or three pence  that of the street car five cents or two pence halfpenny they run along the different avenues taking the length of the city  in the upper or new part of the town their course is simple enough but as they descend to the bowery peck slip and pearl street nothing can be conceived more difficult or devious than their courses  the broadway omnibus on the other hand is a straightforward honest vehicle in the lower part of the town becoming however dangerous and miscellaneous when it ascends to union square and the vicinities of fashionable life  the street cars are manned with conductors and therefore are free from many of the perils of the omnibus but they have perils of their own  they are always quite full  by that i mean that every seat is crowded that there is a double row of men and women standing down the center and that the drivers platform in front is full and also the conductors platform behind  that is the normal condition of a street car in the third avenue  you as a stranger in the middle of the car wish to be put down at let us say 89th street  in the map of new york now before me the cross streets running from east to west are numbered up northward as far as 154th street  it is quite useless for you to give the number as you enter  even an american conductor with brains all over him and an anxious desire to accommodate as is the case with all these men cannot remember  you are left therefore in misery to calculate the number of the street as you move along vainly endeavoring through the misty glass to decipher the small numbers which after a day or two you perceive to be written on the lamp posts  but i soon gave up all attempts at keeping a seat in one of these cars  it became my practice to sit down on the outside iron rail behind and as the conductor generally sat in my lap i was in a measure protected  as for the inside of these vehicles the women of new york were i must confess too much for me  i would no sooner place myself on a seat than i would be called on by a mute unexpressive but still impressive stare into my face to surrender my place  from cowardice if not from gallantry i would always obey and as this led to discomfort and an irritated spirit i preferred nursing the conductor on the hard bar in the rear  and here if i seem to say a word against women in america i beg that it may be understood that i say that word only against a certain class and even as to that class i admit that they are respectable intelligent and as i believe industrious  their manners however are to me more odious than those of any other human beings that i ever met elsewhere  nor can i go on with that which i have to say without carrying my apology further lest perchance i should be misunderstood by some american women whom i would not only exclude from my censure but would include in the very warmest eulogium which words of mine could express as to those of the female sex whom i love and admire the most  i have known do know and mean to continue to know as far as in me may lie american ladies as bright as beautiful as graceful as sweet as mortal limits for brightness beauty grace and sweetness will permit  they belong to the aristocracy of the land by whatever means they may have become aristocrats  in america one does not inquire as to their birth their training or their old names  the fact of their aristocratic power comes out in every word and look it is not only so with those who have traveled or with those who are rich  i have found female aristocrats with families and slender means who have as yet made no grand tour across the ocean these women are charming beyond expression  it is not only their beauty  had he been speaking of such wendell phillips would have been right in saying that they have brains all over them  so much for those who are bright and beautiful who are graceful and sweet and now a word as to those who to me are neither bright nor beautiful and who can be to none either graceful or sweet  it is a hard task that of speaking ill of any woman but it seems to me that he who takes upon himself to praise incurs the duty of dispraising also where dispraise is or to him seems to be deserved  the trade of a novelist is very much that of describing the softness sweetness and loving dispositions of women and this he does copying as best he can from nature  but if he only sings of that which is sweet whereas that which is not sweet too frequently presents itself his song will in the end be untrue and ridiculous  women are entitled to much observance from men but they are entitled to no observance which is incompatible with truth  women by the conventional laws of society are allowed to exact much from men but they are allowed to exact nothing for which they should not make some adequate return  it is well that a man should kneel in spirit before the grace and weakness of a woman but it is not well that he should kneel either in spirit or body if there be neither grace nor weakness  a man should yield everything to a woman for a word for a smileto one look of entreaty  but if there be no look of entreaty no word no smile i do not see that he is called upon to yield much  the happy privileges with which women are at present blessed have come to them from the spirit of chivalry  that spirit has taught man to endure in order that women may be at their ease and has generally taught women to accept the ease bestowed on them with grace and thankfulness  but in america the spirit of chivalry has sunk deeper among men than it has among women  it must be borne in mind that in that country material wellbeing and education are more extended than with us and that therefore men there have learned to be chivalrous who with us have hardly progressed so far the conduct of men to women throughout the states is always gracious  they have learned the lesson  but it seems to me that the women have not advanced as far as the men have done  they have acquired a sufficient perception of the privileges which chivalry gives them but no perception of that return which chivalry demands from them  women of the class to which i allude are always talking of their rights but seem to have a most indifferent idea of their duties  they have no scruple at demanding from men everything that a man can be called on to relinquish in a womans behalf but they do so without any of that grace which turns the demand made into a favor conferred  i have seen much of this in various cities of america but much more of it in new york than elsewhere  i have heard young americans complain of it swearing that they must change the whole tenor of their habits toward women  i have heard american ladies speak of it with loathing and disgust  for myself i have entertained on sundry occasions that sort of feeling for an american woman which the close vicinity of an unclean animal produces  i have spoken of this with reference to street cars because in no position of life does an unfortunate man become more liable to these antifeminine atrocities than in the center of one of these vehicles  the woman as she enters drags after her a misshapen dirty mass of battered wirework which she calls her crinoline and which adds as much to her grace and comfort as a log of wood does to a donkey when tied to the animals leg in a paddock  of this she takes much heed not managing it so that it may be conveyed up the carriage with some decency but striking it about against mens legs and heaving it with violence over peoples knees  the touch of a real womans dress is in itself delicate but these blows from a harpys fins are as loathsome as a snakes slime  if there be two of them they talk loudly together having a theory that modesty has been put out of court by womens rights  but though not modest the woman i describe is ferocious in her propriety  she ignores the whole world around her as she sits with a raised chin and face flattened by affectation she pretends to declare aloud that she is positively not aware that any man is even near her  she speaks as though to her in her womanhood the neighborhood of men was the same as that of dogs or cats  they are there but she does not hear them see them or even acknowledge them by any courtesy of motion  but her own face always gives her the lie  in her assumption of indifference she displays her nasty consciousness and in each attempt at a wouldbe propriety is guilty of an immodesty  who does not know the timid retiring face of the young girl who when alone among men unknown to her feels that it becomes her to keep herself secluded  as many men as there are around her so many knights has such a one ready bucklered for her service should occasion require such services should it not she passes on unmolestedbut not as she herself will wrongly think unheeded  but as to her of whom i am speaking we may say that every twist of her body and every tone of her voice is an unsuccessful falsehood  she looks square at you in the face and you rise to give her your seat  you rise from a deference to your own old convictions and from that courtesy which you have ever paid to a womans dress let it be worn with ever such hideous deformities  she takes the place from which you have moved without a word or a bow  she twists herself round banging your shins with her wires while her chin is still raised and her face is still flattened and she directs her friends attention to another seated man as though that place were also vacant and necessarily at her disposure  perhaps the man opposite has his own ideas about chivalry  i have seen such a thing and have rejoiced to see it  you will meet these women daily hourly everywhere in the streets now and again you will find them in society making themselves even more odious there than elsewhere  who they are whence they come and why they are so unlike that other race of women of which i have spoken you will settle for yourself  do we not all say of our chance acquaintances after half an hours conversation nay after half an hour spent in the same room without conversation that this woman is a lady and that that other woman is not  they jostle each other even among us but never seem to mix  they are closely allied but neither imbues the other with her attributes  both shall be equally well born or both shall be equally ill born but still it is so  the contrast exists in england but in america it is much stronger  in england women become ladylike or vulgar  in the states they are either charming or odious  see that female walking down broadway  she is not exactly such a one as her i have attempted to describe on her entrance into the street car for this lady is well dressed if fine clothes will make well dressing  the machinery of her hoops is not battered and altogether she is a personage much more distinguished in all her expenditures  but yet she is a copy of the other woman  look at the train which she drags behind her over the dirty pavement where dogs have been and chewers of tobacco and everything concerned with filth except a scavenger  at every hundred yards some unhappy man treads upon the silken swab which she trails behind herloosening it dreadfully at the girth one would say and then see the style of face and the expression of features with which she accepts the sinners half muttered apology  the world she supposes owes her everything because of her silken train even room enough in a crowded thoroughfare to drag it along unmolested but according to her theory she owes the world nothing in return she is a woman with perhaps a hundred dollars on her back and having done the world the honor of wearing them in the worlds presence expects to be repaid by the worlds homage and chivalry but chivalry owes her nothingnothing though she walk about beneath a hundred times a hundred dollarsnothing even though she be a woman  let every woman learn this that chivalry owes her nothing unless she also acknowledges her debt to chivalry  she must acknowledge it and pay it and then chivalry will not be backward in making good her claims upon it  all this has come of the street cars  but as it was necessary that i should say it somewhere it is as well said on that subject as on any other  and now to continue with the street cars  they run as i have said the length of the town taking parallel lines  they will take you from the astor house near the bottom of the town for miles and miles northwardhalf way up the hudson riverfor i believe five pence  they are very slow averaging about five miles an hour but they are very sure  for regular inhabitants who have to travel five or six miles perhaps to their daily work they are excellent  i have nothing really to say against the street cars  but they do not fill the place of cabs  there are however public carriagesroomy vehicles dragged by two horses clean and nice and very well suited to ladies visiting the city  but they have none of the attributes of the cab  as a rule they are not to be found standing about  they are very slow they are very dear  a dollar an hour is the regular charge but one cannot regulate ones motion by the hour  going out to dinner and back costs two dollars over a distance which in london would cost two shillings  as a rule the cost is four times that of a cab and the rapidity half that of a cab  under these circumstances i think i am justified in saying that there is no mode of getting about in new york to see anything  and now as to the other charge against new york of there being nothing to see  how should there be anything there to see of general interest  in other large citiescities as large in name as new yorkthere are works of art fine buildings ruins ancient churches picturesque costumes and the tombs of celebrated men but in new york there are none of these things  art has not yet grown up there  one or two fine figures by crawford are in the town especially that of the sorrowing indian at the rooms of the historical society but art is a luxury in a city which follows but slowly on the heels of wealth and civilization  of fine buildings which indeed are comprised in artthere are none deserving special praise or remark  it might well have been that new york should ere this have graced herself with something grand in architecture but she has not done so  some good architectural effect there is and much architectural comfort  of ruins of course there can be nonenone at least of such ruins as travelers admire though perhaps some of that sort which disgraces rather than decorates  churches there are plenty but none that are ancient  the costume is the same as our own and i need hardly say that it is not picturesque  and the time for the tombs of celebrated men has not yet come  a great mans ashes are hardly of value till they have all but ceased to exist  the visitor to new york must seek his gratification and obtain his instruction from the habits and manners of men  the american though he dresses like an englishman and eats roast beef with a silver forkor sometimes with a steel knifeas does an englishman is not like an englishman in his mind in his aspirations in his tastes or in his politics  in his mind he is quicker more universally intelligent more ambitious of general knowledge less indulgent of stupidity and ignorance in others harder sharper brighter with the surface brightness of steel than is an englishman but he is more brittle less enduring less malleable and i think less capable of impressions  the mind of the englishman has more imagination but that of the american more incision  the american is a great observer but he observes things material rather than things social or picturesque  he is a constant and ready speculator but all speculations even those which come of philosophy are with him more or less material  in his aspirations the american is more constant than an englishman or i should rather say he is more constant in aspiring  every citizen of the united states intends to do something  every one thinks himself capable of some effort  but in his aspirations he is more limited than an englishman  the ambitious american never soars so high as the ambitious englishman  he does not even see up to so great a height and when he has raised himself somewhat above the crowd becomes sooner dizzy with his own altitude  an american of mark though always anxious to show his mark is always fearful of a fall  in his tastes the american imitates the frenchman  who shall dare to say that he is wrong seeing that in general matters of design and luxury the french have won for themselves the foremost name  i will not say that the american is wrong but i cannot avoid thinking that he is so  i detest what is called french taste but the world is against me  when i complained to a landlord of a hotel out in the west that his furniture was useless that i could not write at a marble table whose outside rim was curved into fantastic shapes that a gold clock in my bedroom which did not go would give me no aid in washing myself that a heavy immovable curtain shut out the light and that papiermache chairs with small fluffy velvet seats were bad to sit on he answered me completely by telling me that his house had been furnished not in accordance with the taste of england but with that of france  i acknowledged the rebuke gave up my pursuits of literature and cleanliness and hurried out of the house as quickly as i could  all america is now furnishing itself by the rules which guided that hotelkeeper  i do not merely allude to actual household furnitureto chairs tables and detestable gilt clocks  the taste of america is becoming french in its conversation french in its comforts and french in its discomforts french in its eating and french in its dress french in its manners and will become french in its art  there are those who will say that english taste is taking the same direction  i do not think so  i strongly hope that it is not so  and therefore i say that an englishman and an american differ in their tastes  but of all differences between an englishman and an american that in politics is the strongest and the most essential  i cannot here in one paragraph define that difference with sufficient clearness to make my definition satisfactory but i trust that some idea of that difference may be conveyed by the general tenor of my book  the american and the englishman are both republicans  the governments of the states and of england are probably the two purest republican governments in the world  i do not of course here mean to say that the governments are more pure than others but that the systems are more absolutely republican  and yet no men can be much farther asunder in politics than the englishman and the american  the american of the present day puts a ballotbox into the hands of every citizen and takes his stand upon that and that only  it is the duty of an american citizen to vote and when he has voted he need trouble himself no further till the time for voting shall come round again  the candidate for whom he has voted represents his will if he have voted with the majority and in that case he has no right to look for further influence  if he have voted with the minority he has no right to look for any influence at all  in either case he has done his political work and may go about his business till the next year or the next two or four years shall have come round  the englishman on the other hand will have no ballotbox and is by no means inclined to depend exclusively upon voters or upon voting  as far as voting can show it he desires to get the sense of the country but he does not think that that sense will be shown by universal suffrage he thinks that property amounting to a thousand pounds will show more of that sense than property amounting to a hundred but he will not on that account go to work and apportion votes to wealth  he thinks that the educated can show more of that sense than the uneducated but he does not therefore lay down any rule about reading writing and arithmetic or apportion votes to learning  he prefers that all these opinions of his shall bring themselves out and operate by their own intrinsic weight  nor does he at all confine himself to voting in his anxiety to get the sense of the country  he takes it in any way that it will show itself uses it for what it is worth or perhaps far more than it is worth and welds it into that gigantic lever by which the political action of the country is moved  every man in great britain whether he possesses any actual vote or no can do that which is tantamount to voting every day of his life by the mere expression of his opinion  public opinion in america has hitherto been nothing unless it has managed to express itself by a majority of ballotboxes  public opinion in england is everything let votes go as they may  let the people want a measure and there is no doubt of their obtaining it  only the people must want itas they did want catholic emancipation reform and cornlaw repeal and as they would want war if it were brought home to them that their country was insulted  in attempting to describe this difference in the political action of the two countries i am very far from taking all praise for england or throwing any reproach on the states  the political action of the states is undoubtedly the more logical and the clearer  that indeed of england is so illogical and so little clear that it would be quite impossible for any other nation to assume it merely by resolving to do so  whereas the political action of the states might be assumed by any nation tomorrow and all its strength might be carried across the water in a few written rules as are the prescriptions of a physician or the regulations of an infirmary  with us the thing has grown of habit has been fostered by tradition has crept up uncared for and in some parts unnoticed  it can be written in no book can be described in no words can be copied by no statesmen and i almost believe can be understood by no people but that to whose peculiar uses it has been adapted  in speaking as i have here done of american taste and american politics i must allude to a special class of americans who are to be met more generally in new york than elsewheremen who are educated who have generally traveled who are almost always agreeable but who as regards their politics are to me the most objectionable of all men  as regards taste they are objectionable to me also  but that is a small thing and as they are quite as likely to be right as i am i will say nothing against their taste but in politics it seems to me that these men have fallen into the bitterest and perhaps into the basest of errors  of the man who begins his life with mean political ideas having sucked them in with his mothers milk there may be some hope  the evil is at any rate the fault of his forefathers rather than of himself  but who can have hope of him who having been thrown by birth and fortune into the running river of free political activity has allowed himself to be drifted into the stagnant level of general political servility  there are very many such americans  they call themselves republicans and sneer at the idea of a limited monarchy but they declare that there is no republic so safe so equal for all men so purely democratic as that now existing in france  under the french empire all men are equal  there is no aristocracy no oligarchy no overshadowing of the little by the great  one superior is admittedadmitted on earth as a superior is also admitted in heaven  under him everything is level and provided he be not impeded everything is free  he knows how to rule and the nation allowing him the privilege of doing so can go along its course safely can eat drink and be merry  if few men can rise high so also can few men fall low  political equality is the one thing desirable in a commonwealth and by this arrangement political equality is obtained  such is the modern creed of many an educated republican of the states  to me it seems that such a political state is about the vilest to which a man can descend  it amounts to a tacit abandonment of the struggle which men are making for political truth and political beneficence in order that bread and meat may be eaten in peace during the score of years or so that are at the moment passing over us  the politicians of this class have decided for themselves that the summum bonum is to be found in bread and the circus games  if they be free to eat free to rest free to sleep free to drink little cups of coffee while the world passes before them on a boulevard they have that freedom which they covet  but equality is necessary as well as freedom  there must be no towering trees in this parterre to overshadow the clipped shrubs and destroy the uniformity of a growth which should never mount more than two feet above the earth  the equality of this politician would forbid any to rise above him instead of inviting all to rise up to him  it is the equality of fear and of selfishness and not the equality of courage and philanthropy  and brotherhood too must be invoked fraternity as we may better call it in the jargon of the school such politicians tell one much of fraternity and define it too it consists in a general raising of the hat to all mankind in a daily walk that never hurries itself into a jostling trot inconvenient to passengers on the pavement in a placid voice a soft smile and a small cup of coffee on a boulevard  it means all this but i could never find that it meant any more  there is a nation for which one is almost driven to think that such political aspirations as these are suitable but that nation is certainly not the states of america  and yet one finds many american gentlemen who have allowed themselves to be drifted into such a theory  they have begun the world as republican citizens and as such they must go on  but in their travels and their studies and in the luxury of their life they have learned to dislike the rowdiness of their countrys politics  they want things to be soft and easy as republican as you please but with as little noise as possible  the president is there for four years  why not elect him for eight for twelve or for lifefor eternity if it were possible to find one who could continue to live  it is to this way of thinking that americans are driven when the polish of europe has made the roughness of their own elections odious to them  have you seen any of our great institootions sir  that of course is a question which is put to every englishman who has visited new york and the englishman who intends to say that he has seen new york should visit many of them  i went to schools hospitals lunatic asylums institutes for deaf and dumb water works historical societies telegraph offices and large commercial establishments  i rather think that i did my work in a thorough and conscientious manner and i owe much gratitude to those who guided me on such occasions  perhaps i ought to describe all these institutions but were i to do so i fear that i should inflict fifty or sixty very dull pages on my readers  if i could make all that i saw as clear and intelligible to others as it was made to me who saw it i might do some good  but i know that i should fail  i marveled much at the developed intelligence of a room full of deaf and dumb pupils and was greatly astonished at the performance of one special girl who seemed to be brighter and quicker and more rapidly easy with her pen than girls generally are who can hear and talk but i cannot convey my enthusiasm to others  on such a subject a writer may be correct may be exhaustive may be statistically great but he can hardly be entertaining and the chances are that he will not be instructive  in all such matters however new york is preeminently great  all through the states suffering humanity receives so much attention that humanity can hardly be said to suffer  the daily recurring boast of our glorious institootions sir always provokes the ridicule of an englishman  the words have become ridiculous and it would i think be well for the nation if the term institution could be excluded from its vocabulary  but in truth they are glorious  the country in this respect boasts but it has done that which justifies a boast  the arrangements for supplying new york with water are magnificent  the drainage of the new part of the city is excellent  the hospitals are almost alluring  the lunatic asylum which i saw was perfectthough i did not feel obliged to the resident physician for introducing me to all the worst patients as countrymen of my own  an english lady mr trollope  ill introduce you  quite a hopeless case  two old women  theyve been here fifty years  theyre english  another gentleman from england mr trollope  a very interesting case  confirmed inebriety  and as to the schools it is almost impossible to mention them with too high a praise  i am speaking here specially of new york though i might say the same of boston or of all new england  i do not know any contrast that would be more surprising to an englishman up to that moment ignorant of the matter than that which he would find by visiting first of all a free school in london and then a free school in new york  if he would also learn the number of children that are educated gratuitously in each of the two cities and also the number in each which altogether lack education he would if susceptible of statistics be surprised also at that  but seeing and hearing are always more effective than mere figures  the female pupil at a free school in london is as a rule either a ragged pauper or a charity girl if not degraded at least stigmatized by the badges and dress of the charity  we englishmen know well the type of each and have a fairly correct idea of the amount of education which is imparted to them  we see the result afterward when the same girls become our servants and the wives of our grooms and porters  the female pupil at a free school in new york is neither a pauper nor a charity girl  she is dressed with the utmost decency  she is perfectly cleanly  in speaking to her you cannot in any degree guess whether her father has a dollar a day or three thousand dollars a year  nor will you be enabled to guess by the manner in which her associates treat her  as regards her own manner to you it is always the same as though her father were in all respects your equal  as to the amount of her knowledge i fairly confess that it is terrific  when in the first room which i visited a slight slim creature was had up before me to explain to me the properties of the hypothenuse i fairly confess that as regards education i backed down and that i resolved to confine my criticisms to manner dress and general behavior  in the next room i was more at my ease finding that ancient roman history was on the tapis  why did the romans run away with the sabine women asked the mistress herself a young woman of about three and twenty  because they were pretty simpered out a little girl with a cherry mouth  the answer did not give complete satisfaction and then followed a somewhat abstruse explanation on the subject of population  it was all done with good faith and a serious intent and showed what it was intended to showthat the girls there educated had in truth reached the consideration of important subjects and that they were leagues beyond that terrible repetition of a b c to which i fear that most of our free metropolitan schools are still necessarily confined  you and i reader were we called on to superintend the education of girls of sixteen might not select as favorite points either the hypothenuse or the ancient methods of populating young colonies there may be and to us on the european side of the atlantic there will be a certain amount of absurdity in the transatlantic idea that all knowledge is knowledge and that it should be imparted if it be not knowledge of evil  but as to the general result no fairminded man or woman can have a doubt  that the lads and girls in these schools are excellently educated comes home as a fact to the mind of any one who will look into the subject  that girl could not have got as fair at the hypothenuse without a competent and abiding knowledge of much that is very far beyond the outside limits of what such girls know with us  it was at least manifest in the other examination that the girls knew as well as i did who were the romans and who were the sabine women  that all this is of use was shown in the very gestures and bearings of the girl emollit mores as colonel newcombe used to say  that young woman whom i had watched while she cooked her husbands dinner upon the banks of the mississippi had doubtless learned all about the sabine women and i feel assured that she cooked her husbands dinner all the better for that knowledgeand faced the hardships of the world with a better front than she would have done had she been ignorant on the subject  in order to make a comparison between the schools of london and those of new york i have called them both free schools  they are in fact more free in new york than they are in london because in new york every boy and girl let his parentage be what it may can attend these schools without any payment  thus an education as good as the american mind can compass prepared with every care carried on by highlypaid tutors under ample surveillance provided with all that is most excellent in the way of rooms desks books charts maps and implements is brought actually within the reach of everybody  i need not point out to englishmen how different is the nature of schools in london  it must not however be supposed that these are charity schools  such is not their nature  let us say what we may as to the beauty of charity as a virtue the recipient of charity in its customary sense among us is ever more or less degraded by the position  in the states that has been fully understood and the schools to which i allude are carefully preserved from any such taint  throughout the states a separate tax is levied for the maintenance of these schools and as the taxpayer supports them he is of course entitled to the advantage which they confer  the child of the nontaxpayer is also entitled and to him the boon if strictly analyzed will come in the shape of a charity  but under the system as it is arranged this is not analyzed  it is understood that the school is open to all in the ward to which it belongs and no inquiry is made whether the pupils parent has or has not paid anything toward the schools support  i found this theory carried out so far that at the deaf and dumb school where some of the poorer children are wholly provided by the institution care is taken to clothe them in dresses of different colors and different make in order that nothing may attach to them which has the appearance of a badge political economists will see something of evil in this  but philanthropists will see very much that is good  it is not without a purpose that i have given this somewhat glowing account of a girls school in new york so soon after my little picture of new york women as they behave themselves in the streets and street cars  it will of course be said that those women of whom i have spoken by no means in terms of admiration are the very girls whose education has been so excellent  this of course is so but i beg to remark that i have by no means said that an excellent school education will produce all female excellencies the fact i take it is this that seeing how high in the scale these girls have been raised one is anxious that they should be raised higher  one is surprised at their pert vulgarity and hideous airs not because they are so low in our general estimation but because they are so high  women of the same class in london are humble enough and therefore rarely offend us who are squeamish  they show by their gestures that they hardly think themselves good enough to sit by us they apologize for their presence they conceive it to be their duty to be lowly in their gesture  the question is which is best the crouching and crawling or the impudent unattractive selfcomposure  not my reader which action on her part may the better conduce to my comfort or to yours  that is by no means the question  which is the better for the woman herself  that i take it is the point to be decided  that there is something better than either we shall all agreebut to my thinking the crouching and crawling is the lowest type of all  at that school i saw some five or six hundred girls collected in one room and heard them sing  the singing was very pretty and it was all very nice but i own that i was rather startled and to tell the truth somewhat abashed when i was invited to say a few words to them  no idea of such a suggestion had dawned upon me and i felt myself quite at a loss  to be called up before five hundred men is bad enough but how much worse before that number of girls  what could i say but that they were all very pretty  as far as i can remember i did say that and nothing else  very pretty they were and neatly dressed and attractive but among them all there was not a pair of rosy cheeks  how should there be when every room in the building was heated up to the condition of an oven by those damnable hotair pipes  in england a taste for very large shops has come up during the last twenty years  a firm is not doing a good business or at any rate a distinguished business unless he can assert in his trade card that he occupies at least half a dozen housesnos 105 106 107 108 109 and 110  the old way of paying for what you want over the counter is gone and when you buy a yard of tape or a new carriage for either of which articles you will probably visit the same establishmentyou go through about the same amount of ceremony as when you sell a thousand pounds out of the stocks in propria persona  but all this is still further exaggerated in new york mr stewarts store there is perhaps the handsomest institution in the city and his hall of audience for new carpets is a magnificent saloon  you have nothing like that in england my friend said to me as he walked me through it in triumph  i wish we had nothing approaching to it i answered  for i confess to a liking for the oldfashioned private shops  harpers establishment for the manufacture and sale of books is also very wonderful  everything is done on the premises down to the very coloring of the paper which lines the covers and places the gilding on their backs  the firm prints engraves electroplates sews binds publishes and sells wholesale and retail  i have no doubt that the authors have rooms in the attics where the other slight initiatory step is taken toward the production of literature  new york is built upon an island which is i believe about ten miles long counting from the southern point at the battery up to carmansville to which place the city is presumed to extend northward  this island is called manhattan a name which i have always thought would have been more graceful for the city than that of new york  it is formed by the sound or east river which divides the continent from long island by the hudson river which runs into the sound or rather joins it at the city foot and by a small stream called the harlem river which runs out of the hudson and meanders away into the sound at the north of the city thus cutting the city off from the mainland  the breadth of the island does not much exceed two miles and therefore the city is long and not capable of extension in point of breadth  in its old days it clustered itself round about the point and stretched itself up from there along the quays of the two waters  the streets down in this part of the town are devious enough twisting themselves about with delightful irregularity but as the city grew there came the taste for parallelograms and the upper streets are rectangular and numbered  broadway the street of new york with which the world is generally best acquainted begins at the southern point of the town and goes northward through it  for some two miles and a half it walks away in a straight line and then it turns to the left toward the hudson  from that time broadway never again takes a straight course but crosses the various avenues in an oblique direction till it becomes the bloomingdale road and under that name takes itself out of town  there are eleven socalled avenues which descend in absolutely straight lines from the northern and at present unsettled extremity of the new town making their way southward till they lose themselves among the old streets  these are called first avenue second avenue and so on  the town had already progressed two miles up northward from the battery before it had caught the parallelogramic fever from philadelphia for at about that distance we find first street  first street runs across the avenues from water to water and then second street  i will not name them all seeing that they go up to 154th street they do so at least on the map and i believe on the lampposts but the houses are not yet built in order beyond 50th or 60th street  the other hundred streets each of two miles long with the avenues which are mostly unoccupied for four or five miles is the ground over which the young new yorkers are to spread themselves  i do not in the least doubt that they will occupy it all and that 154th street will find itself too narrow a boundary for the population  i have said that there was some good architectural effect in new york and i alluded chiefly to that of the fifth avenue  the fifth avenue is the belgrave square the park lane and the pall mall of new york  it is certainly a very fine street  the houses in it are magnificentnot having that aristocratic look which some of our detached london residences enjoy or the palatial appearance of an oldfashioned hotel in paris but an air of comfortable luxury and commercial wealth which is not excelled by the best houses of any other town that i know  they are houses not hotels or palaces but they are very roomy houses with every luxury that complete finish can give them  many of them cover large spaces of the ground and their rent will sometimes go up as high as 800 pounds and 1000 pounds a year  generally the best of these houses are owned by those who live in them and rent is not therefore paid  but this is not always the case and the sums named above may be taken as expressing their value  in england a man should have a very large income indeed who could afford to pay 1000 pounds a year for his house in london  such a one would as a matter of course have an establishment in the country and be an earl or a duke or a millionaire  but it is different in new york  the resident there shows his wealth chiefly by his house and though he may probably have a villa at newport or a box somewhere up the hudson he has no second establishment  such a house therefore will not represent a total expenditure of above 4000 pounds a year  there are churches on each side of fifth avenueperhaps five or six within sight at one timewhich add much to the beauty of the street  they are well built and in fairly good taste  these added to the general wellbeing and splendid comfort of the place give it an effect better than the architecture of the individual houses would seem to warrant  i own that i have enjoyed the vista as i have walked up and down fifth avenue and have felt that the city had a right to be proud of its wealth  but the greatness and beauty and glory of wealth have on such occasions been all in all with me  i know no great man no celebrated statesman no philanthropist of peculiar note who has lived in fifth avenue that gentleman on the right made a million of dollars by inventing a shirt collar this one on the left electrified the world by a lotion as to the gentleman at the corner there there are rumors about him and the cuban slave trade but my informant by no means knows that they are true  such are the aristocracy of fifth avenue i can only say that if i could make a million dollars by a lotion i should certainly be right to live in such a house as one of those  the suburbs of new york are by the nature of the localities divided from the city by water  jersey city and hoboken are on the other side of the hudson and in another state  williamsburg and brooklyn are on long island which is a part of the state of new york  but these places are as easily reached as lambeth is reached from westminster  steam ferries ply every three or four minutes and into these boats coaches carts and wagons of any size or weight are driven  in fact they make no other stoppage to the commerce than that occasioned by the payment of a few cents  such payment no doubt is a stoppage and therefore it is that jersey city brooklyn and williamsburg are at any rate in appearance very dull and uninviting  they are however very populous  many of the quieter citizens prefer to live there and i am told that the brooklyn tea parties consider themselves to be in esthetic feeling very much ahead of anything of the kind in the more opulent centers of the city  in beauty of scenery staten island is very much the prettiest of the suburbs of new york  the view from the hillside in staten island down upon new york harbor is very lovely  it is the only really good view of that magnificent harbor which i have been able to find  as for appreciating such beauty when one is entering a port from sea or leaving it for sea i do not believe in any such power  the ship creeps up or creeps out while the mind is engaged on other matters  the passenger is uneasy either with hopes or fears and then the grease of the engines offends ones nostrils  but it is worth the tourists while to look down upon new york harbor from the hillside in staten island  when i was there fort lafayette looked black in the center of the channel and we knew that it was crowded with the victims of secession  fort tompkins was being built to guard the passworthy of a name of richer sound and fort something else was bristling with new cannon  fort hamilton on long island opposite was frowning at us and immediately around us a regiment of volunteers was receiving regimental stocks and boots from the hands of its officers  everything was bristling with war and one could not but think that not in this way had new york raised herself so quickly to her present greatness  but the glory of new york is the central parkits glory in the minds of all new yorkers of the present day  the first question asked of you is whether you have seen the central park and the second is as to what you think of it  it does not do to say simply that it is fine grand beautiful and miraculous  you must swear by cock and pie that it is more fine more grand more beautiful more miraculous than anything else of the kind anywhere  here you encounter in its most annoying form that necessity for eulogium which presses you everywhere  for in truth taken as it is at present the central park is not fine nor grand nor beautiful as to the miracle let that pass  it is perhaps as miraculous as some other great latterday miracles  but the central park is a very great fact and affords a strong additional proof of the sense and energy of the people  it is very large being over three miles long and about threequarters of a mile in breadth  when it was found that new york was extending itself and becoming one of the largest cities of the world a space was selected between fifth and seventh avenues immediately outside the limits of the city as then built but nearly in the center of the city as it is intended to be built  the ground around it became at once of great value and i do not doubt that the present fashion of fifth avenue about twentieth street will in course of time move itself up to fifth avenue as it looks or will look over the park at seventieth eightieth and ninetieth streets  the great waterworks of the city bring the croton river whence new york is supplied by an aqueduct over the harlem river into an enormous reservoir just above the park and hence it has come to pass that there will be water not only for sanitary and useful purposes but also for ornament  at present the park to english eyes seems to be all road  the trees are not grown up and the new embankments and new lakes and new ditches and new paths give to the place anything but a picturesque appearance  the central park is good for what it will be rather than for what it is  the summer heat is so very great that i doubt much whether the people of new york will ever enjoy such verdure as our parks show but there will be a pleasant assemblage of walks and waterworks with fresh air and fine shrubs and flowers immediately within the reach of the citizens  all that art and energy can do will be done and the central park doubtless will become one of the great glories of new york  when i was expected to declare that st jamess park green park hyde park and kensington gardens altogether were nothing to it i confess that i could only remain mute  those who desire to learn what are the secrets of society in new york i would refer to the potiphar papers  the potiphar papers are perhaps not as well known in england as they deserve to be they were published i think as much as seven or eight years ago but are probably as true now as they were then  what i saw of society in new york was quiet and pleasant enough but doubtless i did not climb into that circle in which mrs potiphar held so distinguished a position  it may be true that gentlemen habitually throw fragments of their supper and remnants of their wine on to their hosts carpets but if so i did not see it  as i progress in my work i feel that duty will call upon me to write a separate chapter on hotels in general and i will not therefore here say much about those in new york  i am inclined to think that few towns in the world if any afford on the whole better accommodation but there are many in which the accommodation is cheaper  of the railways also i ought to say something  the fact respecting them which is most remarkable is that of their being continued into the center of the town through the streets the cars are not dragged through the city by locomotive engines but by horses the pace therefore is slow but the convenience to travelers in being brought nearer to the center of trade must be much felt  it is as though passengers from liverpool and passengers from bristol were carried on from euston square and paddington along the new road portland place and regent street to pall mall or up the city road to the bank  as a general rule however the railways railway cars and all about them are ill managed  they are monopolies and the public through the press has no restraining power upon them as it has in england  a parcel sent by express over a distance of forty miles will not be delivered within twentyfour hours  i once made my plaint on this subject at the bar or office of a hotel and was told that no remonstrance was of avail  it is a monopoly the man told me and if we say anything we are told that if we do not like it we need not use it  in railway matters and postal matters time and punctuality are not valued in the states as they are with us and the public seem to acknowledge that they must put up with defects that they must grin and bear them in america as the public no doubt do in austria where such affairs are managed by a government bureau  in the beginning of this chapter i spoke of the population of new york and i cannot end it without remarking that out of that population more than oneeighth is composed of germans  it is i believe computed that there are about 120000 germans in the city and that only two other german cities in the world vienna and berlin have a larger german population than new york  the germans are good citizens and thriving men and are to be found prospering all over the northern and western parts of the union  it seems that they are excellently well adapted to colonization though they have in no instance become the dominant people in a colony or carried with them their own language or their own laws  the french have done so in algeria in some of the west india islands and quite as essentially into lower canada where their language and laws still prevail  and yet it is i think beyond doubt that the french are not good colonists as are the germans  of the ultimate destiny of new york as one of the ruling commercial cities of the world it is i think impossible to doubt  whether or no it will ever equal london in population i will not pretend to say even should it do so should its numbers so increase as to enable it to say that it had done so the question could not very well be settled  when it comes to pass that an assemblage of men in one socalled city have to be counted by millions there arises the impossibility of defining the limits of that city and of saying who belong to it and who do not  an arbitrary line may be drawn but that arbitrary line though perhaps false when drawn as including too much soon becomes more false as including too little  ealing acton fulham putney norwood sydenham blackheath woolwich greenwich stratford highgate and hampstead are in truth component parts of london and very shortly brighton will be as much so    chapter xv  the constitution of the state of new york   as new york is the most populous state of the union having the largest representation in congresson which account it has been called the empire statei propose to state as shortly as may be the nature of its separate constitution as a state  of course it will be understood that the constitutions of the different states are by no means the same  they have been arranged according to the judgment of the different people concerned and have been altered from time to time to suit such altered judgment  but as the states together form one nation and on such matters as foreign affairs war customs and postoffice regulations are bound together as much as are the english counties it is of course necessary that the constitution of each should in most matters assimilate itself to those of the others  these constitutions are very much alike a governor with two houses of legislature generally called the senate and the house of representatives exists in each state  in the state of new york the lower house is called the assembly  in most states the governor is elected annually but in some states for two years as in new york  in pennsylvania he is elected for three years  the house of representatives or the assembly is i think always elected for one session only but as in many of the states the legislature only sits once in two years the election recurs of course at the same interval  the franchise in all the states is nearly universal but in no state is it perfectly so the governor lieutenantgovernor and other officers are elected by vote of the people as well as the members of the legislature of course it will be understood that each state makes laws for itselfthat they are in nowise dependent on the congress assembled at washington for their lawsunless for laws which refer to matters between the united states as a nation and other nations or between one state and another  each state declares with what punishment crimes shall be visited what taxes shall be levied for the use of the state what laws shall be passed as to education what shall be the state judiciary  with reference to the judiciary however it must be understood that the united states as a nation have separate national law courts before which come all cases litigated between state and state and all cases which do not belong in every respect to any one individual state  in a subsequent chapter i will endeavor to explain this more fully  in endeavoring to understand the constitution of the united states it is essentially necessary that we should remember that we have always to deal with two different political arrangementsthat which refers to the nation as a whole and that which belongs to each state as a separate governing power in itself  what is law in one state is not law in another nevertheless there is a very great likeness throughout these various constitutions and any political student who shall have thoroughly mastered one will not have much to learn in mastering the others  this state now called new york was first settled by the dutch in 1614 on manhattan island  they established a government in 1629 under the name of the new netherlands  in 1664 charles ii granted the province to his brother james ii then duke of york and possession was taken of the country on his behalf by one colonel nichols  in 1673 it was recaptured by the dutch but they could not hold it and the duke of york again took possession by patent a legislative body was first assembled during the reign of charles ii in 1683 from which it will be seen that parliamentary representation was introduced into the american colonies at a very early date  the declaration of independence was made by the revolted colonies in 1776 and in 1777 the first constitution was adopted by the state of new york  in 1822 this was changed for another and the one of which i now purport to state some of the details was brought into action in 1847  in this constitution there is a provision that it shall be overhauled and remodeled if needs be once in twenty years  article xiii sec 2  at the general election to be held in 1806 and in each twentieth year thereafter the question shall there be a convention to revise the constitution and amend the same shall be decided by the electors qualified to vote for members of the legislature  so that the new yorkers cannot be twitted with the presumption of finality in reference to their legislative arrangements  the present constitution begins with declaring the inviolability of trial by jury and of habeas corpusunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require its suspension  it does not say by whom it may be suspended or who is to judge of the public safety but at any rate it may be presumed that such suspension was supposed to come from the powers of the state which enacted the law  at the present moment the habeas corpus is suspended in new york and this suspension has proceeded not from the powers of the state but from the federal government without the sanction even of the federal congress  every citizen may freely speak write and publish his sentiments on all subjects being responsible for the abuse of that right and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press  art i sec 8  but at the present moment liberty of speech and of the press is utterly abrogated in the state of new york as it is in other states  i mention this not as a reproach against either the state or the federal government but to show how vain all laws are for the protection of such rights if they be not protected by the feelings of the peopleif the people are at any time or from any cause willing to abandon such privileges no written laws will preserve them  in article i sec 14 there is a proviso that no landland that is used for agricultural purposesshall be let on lease for a longer period than twelve years  no lease or grant of agricultural land for a longer period than twelve years hereafter made in which shall be reserved any rent or service of any kind shall be valid  i do not understand the intended virtue of this proviso but it shows very clearly how different are the practices with reference to land in england and america  farmers in the states almost always are the owners of the land which they farm and such tenures as those by which the occupiers of land generally hold their farms with us are almost unknown  there is no such relation as that of landlord and tenant as regards agricultural holdings  every male citizen of new york may vote who is twentyone who has been a citizen for ten days who has lived in the state for a year and for four months in the county in which he votes  he can vote for all officers that now are or hereafter may be elective by the people  art ii sec 1  but the section goes on to say no man of color unless he shall have been for three years a citizen of the state and for one year next preceding any election shall have been possessed of a freehold estate of the value of 250 dollars 50l and shall have been actually rated and paid a tax thereon shall be entitled to vote at such election  this is the only embargo with which universal suffrage is laden in the state of new york  the third article provides for the election of the senate and the assembly  the senate consists of thirtytwo members  and it may here be remarked that large as is the state of new york and great as is its population its senate is less numerous than that of many other states  in massachusetts for instance there are forty senators though the population of massachusetts is barely one third that of new york  in virginia there are fifty senators whereas the free population is not onethird of that of new york as a consequence the senate of new york is said to be filled with men of a higher class than are generally found in the senates of other states  then follows in the article a list of the districts which are to return the senators  these districts consist of one two three or in one case four counties according to the population  the article does not give the number of members of the lower house nor does it even state what amount of population shall be held as entitled to a member  it merely provides for the division of the state into districts which shall contain an equal number not of population but of voters  the house of assembly does consist of 128 members  it is then stipulated that every member of both houses shall receive three dollars a day or twelve shillings for their services during the sitting of the legislature but this sum is never to exceed 300 dollars or sixty pounds in one year unless an extra session be called  there is also an allowance for the traveling expenses of members  it is i presume generally known that the members of the congress at washington are all paid and that the same is the case with reference to the legislatures of all the states  no member of the new york legislature can also be a member of the washington congress or hold any civil or military office under the general states government  a majority of each house must be present or as the article says shall constitute a quorum to do business  each house is to keep a journal of its proceedings  the doors are to be openexcept when the public welfare shall require secrecy  a singular proviso this in a country boasting so much of freedom  for no speech or debate in either house shall the legislator be called in question in any other place  the legislature assembles on the first tuesday in january and sits for about three months  its seat is at albany  the executive power article iv is to be vested in a governor and a lieutenantgovernor both of whom shall be chosen for two years the governor must be a citizen of the united states must be thirty years of age and have lived for the last four years in the state he is to be commanderinchief of the military and naval forces of the state as is the president of those of the union  i see that this is also the case in inland states which one would say can have no navies  and with reference to some states it is enacted that the governor is commanderinchief of the army navy and militia showing that some army over and beyond the militia may be kept by the state  in tennessee which is an inland state it is enacted that the governor shall be commanderinchief of the army and navy of this state and of the militia except when they shall be called into the service of the united states  in ohio the same is the case except that there is no mention of militia  in new york there is no proviso with reference to the service of the united states  i mention this as it bears with some strength on the question of the right of secession and indicates the jealousy of the individual states with reference to the federal government the governor can convene extra sessions of one house or of both he makes a message to the legislature when it meetsa sort of queens speech and he receives for his services a compensation to be established by law  in new york this amounts to 800l a year in some states this is as low as 200l and 300l  in virginia it is 1000l  in california 1200l  the governor can pardon except in cases of treason  he has also a veto upon all bills sent up by the legislature  if he exercise this veto he returns the bill to the legislature with his reasons for so doing  if the bill on reconsideration by the houses be again passed by a majority of twothirds in each house it becomes law in spite of the governors veto  the veto of the president at washington is of the same nature  such are the powers of the governor  but though they are very full the governor of each state does not practically exercise any great political power nor is he even politically a great man  you might live in a state during the whole term of his government and hardly hear of him there is vested in him by the language of the constitution a much wider power than that intrusted to the governor of our colonies but in our colonies everybody talks and thinks and knows about the governor  as far as the limits of the colony the governor is a great man  but this is not the case with reference to the governors in the different states  the next article provides that the governors ministers viz the secretary of state the controller treasurer and attorney general shall be chosen every two years at a general election  in this respect the state constitution differs from that of the national constitution  the president at washington names his own ministerssubject to the approbation of the senate  he makes many other appointments with the same limitation and the senate i believe is not slow to interfere but with reference to the ministers it is understood that the names sent in by the president shall stand  of the secretary of state controller etc belonging to the different states and who are elected by the people in a general way one never hears  no doubt they attend their offices and take their pay but they are not political personages  the next article no vi refers to the judiciary and is very complicated  as i cannot understand it i will not attempt to explain it  moreover it is not within the scope of my ambition to convey here all the details of the state constitution  in sec 20 of this article it is provided that no judicial officer except justices of the peace shall receive to his own use any fees or perquisites of office  how pleasantly this enactment must sound in the ears of the justices of the peace  article vii refers to fiscal matters and is more especially interesting as showing how greatly the state of new york has depended on its canals for its wealth  these canals are the property of the state and by this article it seems to be provided that they shall not only maintain themselves but maintain to a considerable extent the state expenditure also and stand in lieu of taxation  it is provided section 6 that the legislature shall not sell lease or otherwise dispose of any of the canals of the state but that they shall remain the property of the state and under its management forever  but in spite of its canals the state does not seem to be doing very well for i see that in 1860 its income was 4780000 dollars and its expenditure 5100000 whereas its debt was 32500000 dollars  of all the states pennsylvania is the most indebted virginia the second and new york the third  new hampshire connecticut vermont delaware and texas owe no state debts  all the other state ships have taken in ballast  the militia is supposed to consist of all men capable of bearing arms under fortyfive years of age  but no one need be enrolled who from scruples of conscience is averse to bearing arms  at the present moment such scruples do not seem to be very general  then follows in article xi a detailed enactment as to the choosing of militia officers  it may be perhaps sufficient to say that the privates are to choose the captains and the subalterns the captains and subalterns are to choose the field officers and the field officers the brigadiergenerals and inspectors of brigade the governor however with the consent of the senate shall nominate all majorgenerals  now that real soldiers have unfortunately become necessary the above plan has not been found to work well  such is the constitution of the state of new york which has been intended to work and does work quite separately from that of the united states  it will be seen that the purport has been to make it as widely democratic as possibleto provide that all power of all description shall come directly from the people and that such power shall return to the people at short intervals  the senate and the governor each remain for two years but not for the same two years  if a new senate commence its work in 1861 a new governor will come in in 1862  but nevertheless there is in the form of government as thus established an absence of that close and immediate responsibility which attends our ministers  when a man has been voted in it seems that responsibility is over for the period of the required service  he has been chosen and the country which has chosen him is to trust that he will do his best i do not know that this matters much with reference to the legislature or governments of the different states for their state legislatures and governments are but puny powers but in the legislature and government at washington it does matter very much but i shall have another opportunity of speaking on that subject  nothing has struck me so much in america as the fact that these state legislatures are puny powers  the absence of any tidings whatever of their doings across the water is a proof of this  who has heard of the legislature of new york or of massachusetts  it is boasted here that their insignificance is a sign of the well being of the people that the smallness of the power necessary for carrying on the machine shows how beautifully the machine is organized and how well it works  it is better to have little governors than great governors an american said to me once  it is our glory that we know how to live without having great men over us to rule us  that glory if ever it were a glory has come to an end  it seems to me that all these troubles have come upon the states because they have not placed high men in high places  the less of laws and the less of control the better providing a people can go right with few laws and little control  one may say that no laws and no control would be best of allprovided that none were needed  but this is not exactly the position of the american people  the two professions of lawmaking and of governing have become unfashionable low in estimation and of no repute in the states the municipal powers of the cities have not fallen into the hands of the leading men  the word politician has come to bear the meaning of political adventurer and almost of political blackleg if a calls b a politician a intends to vilify b by so calling him whether or no the best citizens of a state will ever be induced to serve in the state legislature by a nobler consideration than that of pay or by a higher tone of political morals than that now existing i cannot say  it seems to me that some great decrease in the numbers of the state legislators should be a first step toward such a consummation  there are not many men in each state who can afford to give up two or three months of the year to the state service for nothing but it may be presumed that in each state there are a few  those who are induced to devote their time by the payment of 60l can hardly be the men most fitted for the purpose of legislation  it certainly has seemed to me that the members of the state legislatures and of the state governments are not held in that respect and treated with that confidence to which in the eyes of an englishman such functionaries should be held as entitled    chapter xvi  boston   from new york we returned to boston by hartford the capital or one of the capitals of connecticut  this proud little state is composed of two old provinces of which hartford and new haven were the two metropolitan towns  indeed there was a third colony called saybrook which was joined to hartford  as neither of the two could of course give way when hartford and new haven were made into one the houses of legislature and the seat of government are changed about year by year  connecticut is a very proud little state and has a pleasant legend of its own stanchness in the old colonial days  in 1662 the colonies were united and a charter was given to them by charles ii  but some years later in 1686 when the bad days of james ii had come this charter was considered to be too liberal and order was given that it should be suspended one sir edmund andross had been appointed governor of all new england and sent word from boston to connecticut that the charter itself should be given up to him  this the men of connecticut refused to do  whereupon sir edmund with a military following presented himself at their assembly declared their governing powers to be dissolved and after much palaver caused the charter itself to be laid upon the table before him  the discussion had been long having lasted through the day into the night and the room had been lighted with candles  on a sudden each light disappeared and sir edmund with his followers were in the dark as a matter of course when the light was restored the charter was gone and sir edmund the governorgeneral was baffled as all governorsgeneral and all sir edmunds always are in such cases the charter was gone a gallant captain wadsworth having carried it off and hidden it in an oaktree  the charter was renewed when william iii came to the throne and now hangs triumphantly in the state house at hartford  the charter oak has alas succumbed to the weather but was standing a few years since  the men of hartford are very proud of their charter and regard it as the parent of their existing liberties quite as much as though no national revolution of their own had intervened  and indeed the northern states of the unionespecially those of new englandrefer all their liberties to the old charters which they held from the mother country  they rebelled as they themselves would seem to say and set themselves up as a separate people not because the mother country had refused to them by law sufficient liberty and sufficient selfcontrol but because the mother country infringed the liberties and powers of selfcontrol which she herself had given  the mother country so these states declare had acted the part of sir edmund androsshad endeavored to take away their charters  so they also put out the lights and took themselves to an oaktree of their ownwhich is still standing though winds from the infernal regions are now battering its branches  long may it stand  whether the mother country did or did not infringe the charters she had given i will not here inquire  as to the nature of those alleged infringements are they not written down to the number of twentyseven in the declaration of independence  they mostly begin with he  he has done this and he has done that  the he is poor george iii whose twentyseven mortal sins against his transatlantic colonies are thus recapitulated  it would avail nothing to argue now whether those deeds were sins or virtues nor would it have availed then  the child had grown up and was strong and chose to go alone into the world  the young bird was fledged and flew away  poor george iii with his cackling was certainly not efficacious in restraining such a flight  but it is gratifying to see how this new people when they had it in their power to change all their laws to throw themselves upon any utopian theory that the folly of a wild philanthropy could devise to discard as abominable every vestige of english rule and english powerit is gratifying to see that when they could have done all this they did not do so but preferred to cling to things english  their old colonial limits were still to be the borders of their states their old charters were still to be regarded as the sources from whence their state powers had come  the old laws were to remain in force  the precedents of the english courts were to be held as legal precedents in the courts of the new nation and are now so held  it was still to be england but england without a king making his last struggle for political power  this was the idea of the people and this was their feeling and that idea has been carried out and that feeling has remained  in the constitution of the state of new york nothing is said about the religion of the people  it was regarded as a subject with which the constitution had no concern whatever  but as soon as we come among the stricter people of new england we find that the constitutionmakers have not been able absolutely to ignore the subject  in connecticut it is enjoined that as it is the duty of all men to worship the supreme being and their right to render that worship in the mode most consistent with their consciences no person shall be by law compelled to join or be classed with any religious association  the line of argument is hardly logical the conclusion not being in accordance with or hanging on the first of the two premises  but nevertheless the meaning is clear  in a free country no man shall be made to worship after any special fashion but it is decreed by the constitution that every man is bound by duty to worship after some fashion  the article then goes on to say how they who do worship are to be taxed for the support of their peculiar church  i am not quite clear whether the new yorkers have not managed this difficulty with greater success when we come to the old bay stateto massachusettswe find the christian religion spoken of in the constitution as that which in some one of its forms should receive the adherence of every good citizen  hartford is a pleasant little town with englishlooking houses and an englishlooking country around it  here as everywhere through the states one is struck by the size and comfort of the residences  i sojourned there at the house of a friend and could find no limit to the number of spacious sittingrooms which it contained  the modest diningroom and drawingroom which suffice with us for men of seven or eight hundred a year would be regarded as very mean accommodation by persons of similar incomes in the states  i found that hartford was all alive with trade and that wages were high because there are there two factories for the manufacture of arms  colts pistols come from hartford as also do sharpes rifles  wherever arms can be prepared or gunpowder where clothes or blankets fit for soldiers can be made or tents or standards or things appertaining in any way to warfare there trade was still brisk  no being is more costly in his requirements than a soldier and no soldier so costly as the american  he must eat and drink of the best and have good boots and warm bedding and good shelter there were during the christmas of 1861 above half a million of soldiers so to be providedthe president in his message made in december to congress declared the number to be above six hundred thousandand therefore in such places as hartford trade was very brisk  i went over the rifle factory and was shown everything but i do not know that i brought away much with me that was worth any readers attention  the best of rifles i have no doubt were being made with the greatest rapidity and all were sent to the army as soon as finished  i saw some murderouslooking weapons with swords attached to them instead of bayonets but have since been told by soldiers that the oldfashioned bayonet is thought to be more serviceable  immediately on my arrival in boston i heard that mr emerson was going to lecture at the tremont hall on the subject of the war and i resolved to go and hear him  i was acquainted with mr emerson and by reputation knew him well  among us in england he is regarded as transcendental and perhaps even as mystic in his philosophy  his representative men is the work by which he is best known on our side of the water and i have heard some readers declare that they could not quite understand mr emersons representative men  for myself i confess that i had broken down over some portions of that book  since i had become acquainted with him i had read others of his writings especially his book on england and had found that he improved greatly on acquaintance  i think that he has confined his mysticism to the book above named in conversation he is very clear and by no means above the small practical things of the world  he would i fancy know as well what interest he ought to receive for his money as though he were no philosopher and i am inclined to think that if he held land he would make his hay while the sun shone as might any common farmer before i had met mr emerson when my idea of him was formed simply on the representative men i should have thought that a lecture from him on the war would have taken his hearers all among the clouds  as it was i still had my doubts and was inclined to fear that a subject which could only be handled usefully at such a time before a large audience by a combination of common sense high principles and eloquence would hardly be safe in mr emersons hands  i did not doubt the high principles but feared much that there would be a lack of common sense  so many have talked on that subject and have shown so great a lack of common sense  as to the eloquence that might be there or might not  mr emerson is a massachusetts man very well known in boston and a great crowd was collected to hear him  i suppose there were some three thousand persons in the room  i confess that when he took his place before us my prejudices were against him  the matter in hand required no philosophy  it required common sense and the very best of common sense  it demanded that he should be impassioned for of what interest can any address be on a matter of public politics without passion  but it demanded that the passion should be winnowed and free from all rodomontade  i fancied what might be said on such a subject as to that overlauded starspangled banner and how the starspangled flag would look when wrapped in a mist of mystic platonism  but from the beginning to the end there was nothing mysticno platonism and if i remember rightly the starspangled banner was altogether omitted  to the national eagle he did allude  your american eagle he said is very well  protect it here and abroad  but beware of the american peacock  he gave an account of the war from the beginning showing how it had arisen and how it had been conducted and he did so with admirable simplicity and truth  he thought the north were right about the war and as i thought so also i was not called upon to disagree with him  he was terse and perspicuous in his sentences practical in his advice and above all things true in what he said to his audience of themselves  they who know america will understand how hard it is for a public man in the states to practice such truth in his addresses  fluid compliments and highflown national eulogium are expected  in this instance none were forthcoming  the north had risen with patriotism to make this effort and it was now warned that in doing so it was simply doing its national duty  and then came the subject of slavery  i had been told that mr emerson was an abolitionist and knew that i must disagree with him on that head if on no other  to me it has always seemed that to mix up the question of general abolition with this war must be the work of a man too ignorant to understand the real subject of the war or too false to his country to regard it  throughout the whole lecture i was waiting for mr emersons abolition doctrine but no abolition doctrine came  the words abolition and compensation were mentioned and then there was an end of the subject  if mr emerson be an abolitionist he expressed his views very mildly on that occasion  on the whole the lecture was excellent and that little advice about the peacock was in itself worth an hours attention  that practice of lecturing is quite an institution in the states so it is in england my readers will say  but in england it is done in a different way with a different object and with much less of result  with us if i am not mistaken lectures are mostly given gratuitously by the lecturer  they are got up here and there with some philanthropical object and in the hope that an hour at the disposal of young men and women may be rescued from idleness the subjects chosen are social literary philanthropic romantic geographical scientific religiousanything rather than political  the lecturerooms are not usually filled to overflowing and there is often a question whether the real good achieved is worth the trouble taken  the most popular lectures are given by big people whose presence is likely to be attractive and the whole thing i fear we must confess is not preeminently successful  in the northern states of america the matter stands on a very different footing  lectures there are more popular than either theaters or concerts  enormous halls are built for them tickets for long courses are taken with avidity  very large sums are paid to popular lecturers so that the profession is lucrative more so i am given to understand than is the cognate profession of literature  the whole thing is done in great style  music is introduced  the lecturer stands on a large raised platform on which sit around him the bald and hoaryheaded and superlatively wise  ladies come in large numbers especially those who aspire to soar above the frivolities of the world  politics is the subject most popular and most general  the men and women of boston could no more do without their lectures than those of paris could without their theaters  it is the decorous diversion of the best ordered of her citizens  the fast young men go to clubs and the fast young women to dances as fast young men and women do in other places that are wicked but lecturing is the favorite diversion of the steadyminded bostonian  after all i do not know that the result is very good  it does not seem that much will be gained by such lectures on either side of the atlanticexcept that respectable killing of an evening which might otherwise be killed less respectably  it is but an industrious idleness an attempt at a royal road to information that habit of attending lectures  let any man or woman say what he has brought away from any such attendance  it is attractive that idea of being studious without any of the labor of study but i fear it is illusive  if an evening can be so passed without ennui i believe that that may be regarded as the best result to be gained  but then it so often happens that the evening is not passed without ennui  of course in saying this i am not alluding to lectures given in special places as a course of special study  medical lectures are or may be a necessary part of medical education  as many as two or three thousand often attend these popular lectures in boston but i do not know whether on that account the popular subjects are much better understood  nevertheless i resolved to hear more hoping that i might in that way teach myself to understand what were the popular politics in new england  whether or no i may have learned this in any other way i do not perhaps know but at any rate i did not learn it in this way  the next lecture which i attended was also given in the tremont hall and on this occasion also the subject of the war was to be treated  the special treachery of the rebels was i think the matter to be taken in hand  on this occasion also the room was full and my hopes of a pleasant hour ran high  for some fifteen minutes i listened and i am bound to say that the gentleman discoursed in excellent english  he was master of that wonderful fluency which is peculiarly the gift of an american  he went on from one sentence to another with rhythmic tones and unerring pronunciation  he never faltered never repeated his words never fell into those vile halfmuttered hems and haws by which an englishman in such a position so generally betrays his timidity but during the whole time of my remaining in the room he did not give expression to a single thought  he went on from one soft platitude to another and uttered words from which i would defy any one of his audience to carry away with them anything  and yet it seemed to me that his audience was satisfied  i was not satisfied and managed to escape out of the room  the next lecturer to whom i listened was mr everett  mr everetts reputation as an orator is very great and i was especially anxious to hear him  i had long since known that his power of delivery was very marvelous that his tones elocution and action were all great and that he was able to command the minds and sympathies of his audience in a remarkable manner  his subject also was the waror rather the causes of the war and its qualification  had the north given to the south cause of provocation  had the south been fair and honest in its dealings to the north  had any compromise been possible by which the war might have been avoided and the rights and dignity of the north preserved  seeing that mr everett is a northern man and was lecturing to a boston audience one knew well how these questions would be answered but the manner of the answering would be everything  this lecture was given at roxbury one of the suburbs of boston  so i went out to roxbury with a party and found myself honored by being placed on the platform among the baldheaded ones and the superlatively wise  this privilege is naturally gratifying but it entails on him who is so gratified the inconvenience of sitting at the lecturers back whereas it is perhaps better for the listener to be before his face  i could not but be amused by one little scenic incident  when we all went upon the platform some one proposed that the clergymen should lead the way out of the little waitingroom in which we baldheaded ones and superlatively wise were assembled  but to this the manager of the affair demurred  he wanted the clergymen for a purpose he said  and so the profane ones led the way and the clergymen of whom there might be some six or seven clustered in around the lecturer at last  early in his discourse mr everett told us what it was that the country needed at this period of her trial  patriotism courage the bravery of the men the good wishes of the women the selfdenial of alland continued the lecturer turning to his immediate neighbors the prayers of these holy men whom i see around me  it had not been for nothing that the clergymen were detained  mr everett lectures without any book or paper before him and continues from first to last as though the words came from him on the spur of the moment  it is known however that it is his practice to prepare his orations with great care and commit them entirely to memory as does an actor  indeed he repeats the same lecture over and over again i am told without the change of a word or of an action  i did not like mr everetts lecture  i did not like what he said or the seeming spirit in which it was framed  but i am bound to admit that his power of oratory is very wonderful  those among his countrymen who have criticised his manner in my hearing have said that he is too florid that there is an affectation in the motion of his hands and that the intended pathos of his voice sometimes approaches too near the precipice over which the fall is so deep and rapid and at the bottom of which lies absolute ridicule  judging for myself i did not find it so  my position for seeing was not good but my ear was not offended  critics also should bear in mind that an orator does not speak chiefly to them or for their approval  he who writes or speaks or sings for thousands must write speak or sing as those thousands would have him  that to a dainty connoisseur will be false music which to the general ear shall be accounted as the perfection of harmony  an eloquence altogether suited to the fastidious and hypercritical would probably fail to carry off the hearts and interest the sympathies of the young and eager  as regards manners tone and choice of words i think that the oratory of mr everett places him very high  his skill in his work is perfect  he never falls back upon a word  he never repeats himself  his voice is always perfectly under command  as for hesitation or timidity the days for those failings have long passed by with him  when he makes a point he makes it well and drives it home to the intelligence of every one before him  even that appeal to the holy men around him sounded wellor would have done so had i not been present at that little arrangement in the anteroom  on the audience at large it was manifestly effective  but nevertheless the lecture gave me but a poor idea of mr everett as a politician though it made me regard him highly as an orator it was impossible not to perceive that he was anxious to utter the sentiments of the audience rather than his own that he was making himself an echo a powerful and harmonious echo of what he conceived to be public opinion in boston at that moment that he was neither leading nor teaching the people before him but allowing himself to be led by them so that he might best play his present part for their delectation  he was neither bold nor honest as emerson had been and i could not but feel that every tyro of a politician before him would thus recognize his want of boldness and of honesty  as a statesman or as a critic of statecraft and of other statesmen he is wanting in backbone  for many years mr everett has been not even inimical to southern politics and southern courses nor was he among those who during the last eight years previous to mr  lincolns election fought the battle for northern principles  i do not say that on this account he is now false to advocate the war  but he cannot carry men with him when at his age he advocates it by arguments opposed to the tenor of his long political life  his abuse of the south and of southern ideas was as virulent as might be that of a young lad now beginning his political career or of one who had through life advocated abolition principles  he heaped reproaches on poor virginia whose position as the chief of the border states has given to her hardly the possibility of avoiding a scylla of ruin on the one side or a charybdis of rebellion on the other  when he spoke as he did of virginia ridiculing the idea of her sacred soil even i englishman as i am could not but think of washington of jefferson of randolph and of madison  he should not have spoken of virginia as he did speak for no man could have known better virginias difficulties  but virginia was at a discount in boston and mr everett was speaking to a boston audience  and then he referred to england and to europe  mr everett has been minister to england and knows the people  he is a student of history and must i think know that englands career has not been unhappy or unprosperous  but england also was at a discount in boston and mr everett was speaking to a boston audience  they are sending us their advice across the water said mr everett  and what is their advice to us  that we should come down from the high place we have built for ourselves and be even as they are  they screech at us from the low depths in which they are wallowing in their misery and call on us to join them in their wretchedness  i am not quoting mr everetts very words for i have not them by me but i am not making them stronger nor so strong as he made them  as i thought of mr everetts reputation and of his years of study of his long political life and unsurpassed sources of information i could not but grieve heartily when i heard such words fall from him  i could not but ask myself whether it were impossible that under the present circumstances of her constitution this great nation of america should produce an honest highminded statesman  when lincoln and hamlin the existing president and vicepresident of the states were in 1860 as yet but the candidates of the republican party bell and everett also were the candidates of the old whig conservative party their express theory was thisthat the question of slavery should not be touched  their purpose was to crush agitation and restore harmony by an impartial balance between the north and south a fine purposethe finest of all purposes had it been practicable  but such a course of compromise was now at a discount in boston and mr everett was speaking to a boston audience  as an orator mr everetts excellence is i think not to be questioned but as a politician i cannot give him a high rank  after that i heard mr wendell phillips  of him too as an orator all the world of massachusetts speaks with great admiration and i have no doubt so speaks with justice  he is however known as the hottest and most impassioned advocate of abolition  not many months since the cause of abolition as advocated by him was so unpopular in boston that mr phillips was compelled to address his audience surrounded by a guard of policemen  of this gentleman i may at any rate say that he is consistent devoted and disinterested  he is an abolitionist by profession and seeks to find in every turn of the tide of politics some stream on which he may bring himself nearer to his object  in the old days previous to the selection of mr lincoln in days so old that they are now nearly eighteen months past mr phillips was an antiunion man  he advocated strongly the disseverance of the union so that the country to which he belonged might have hands clean from the taint of slavery  he had probably acknowledged to himself that while the north and south were bound together no hope existed of emancipation but that if the north stood alone the south would become too weak to foster and keep alive the social institution  in which if such were his opinions i am inclined to agree with him  but now he is all for the union thinking that a victorious north can compel the immediate emancipation of southern slaves  as to which i beg to say that i am bold to differ from mr phillips altogether  it soon became evident to me that mr phillips was unwell and lecturing at a disadvantage  his manner was clearly that of an accustomed orator but his voice was weak and he was not up to the effect which he attempted to make  his hearers were impatient repeatedly calling upon him to speak out and on that account i tried hard to feel kindly toward him and his lecture  but i must confess that i failed  to me it seemed that the doctrine he preached was one of rapine bloodshed and social destruction  he would call upon the government and upon congress to enfranchise the slaves at oncenow during the warso that the southern power might be destroyed by a concurrence of misfortunes  and he would do so at once on the spur of the moment fearing lest the south should be before him and themselves emancipate their own bondsmen i have sometimes thought that there is no being so venomous so bloodthirsty as a professed philanthropist and that when the philanthropists ardor lies negroward it then assumes the deepest die of venom and bloodthirstiness  there are four millions of slaves in the southern states none of whom have any capacity for selfmaintenance or selfcontrol  four millions of slaves with the necessities of children with the passions of men and the ignorance of savages  and mr phillips would emancipate these at a blow would were it possible for him to do so set them loose upon the soil to tear their masters destroy each other and make such a hell upon the earth as has never even yet come from the uncontrolled passions and unsatisfied wants of men  but congress cannot do this  all the members of congress put together cannot according to the constitution of the united states emancipate a single slave in south carolina not if they were all unanimous  no emancipation in a slave state can come otherwise than by the legislative enactment of that state  but it was then thought that in this coming winter of 186061 the action of congress might be set aside  the north possessed an enormous army under the control of the president  the south was in rebellion and the president could pronounce and the army perhaps enforce the confiscation of all property held in slaves  if any who held them were not disloyal the question of compensation might be settled afterward how those four million slaves should live and how white men should live among them in some states or parts of states not equal to the blacks in numberas to that mr phillips did not give us his opinion  and mr phillips also could not keep his tongue away from the abominations of englishmen and the miraculous powers of his own countrymen  it was on this occasion that he told us more than once how yankees carried brains in their fingers whereas common peoplealluding by that name to europeanshad them only if at all inside their brainpans  and then he informed us that lord palmerston had always hated america  among the radicals there might be one or two who understood and valued the institutions of america but it was a wellknown fact that lord palmerston was hostile to the country  nothing but hidden enmityenmity hidden or not hiddencould be expected from england  that the people of boston or of massachusetts or of the north generally should feel sore against england is to me intelligible  i know how the minds of men are moved in masses to certain feelings and that it ever must be so  men in common talk are not bound to weigh their words to think and speculate on their results and be sure of the premises on which their thoughts are founded  but it is different with a man who rises before two or three thousand of his countrymen to teach and instruct them  after that i heard no more political lectures in boston  of course i visited bunker hill and went to lexington and concord from the top of the monument on bunker hill there is a fine view of boston harbor and seen from thence the harbor is picturesque  the mouth is crowded with islands and jutting necks and promontories and though the shores are in no place rich enough to make the scenery grand the general effect is good  the monument however is so constructed that one can hardly get a view through the windows at the top of it and there is no outside gallery round it immediately below the monument is a marble figure of major warren who fell therenot from the top of the monument as some one was led to believe when informed that on that spot the major had fallen  bunker hill which is little more than a mound is at charlestowna dull populous respectable and very unattractive suburb of boston  bunker hill has obtained a considerable name and is accounted great in the annals of american history  in england we have all heard of bunker hill and some of us dislike the sound as much as frenchmen do that of waterloo  in the states men talk of bunker hill as we may perhaps talk of agincourt and such favorite fields  but after all little was done at bunker hill and as far as i can learn no victory was gained there by either party the road from boston to the town of concord on which stands the village of lexington is the true scene of the earliest and greatest deeds of the men of boston  the monument at bunker hill stands high and commands attention while those at lexington and concord are very lowly and command no attention  but it is of that road and what was done on it that massachusetts should be proud when the colonists first began to feel that they were oppressed and a half resolve was made to resist that oppression by force they began to collect a few arms and some gunpowder at concord a small town about eighteen miles from boston  of this preparation the english governor received tidings and determined to send a party of soldiers to seize the arms  this he endeavored to do secretly but he was too closely watched and word was sent down over the waters by which boston was then surrounded that the colonists might be prepared for the soldiers  at that time boston neck as it was and is still called was the only connection between the town and the mainland and the road over boston neck did not lead to concord  boats therefore were necessarily used and there was some difficulty in getting the soldiers to the nearest point  they made their way however to the road and continued their route as far as lexington without interruption here however they were attacked and the first blood of that war was shed  they shot three or four of therebels i suppose i should in strict language call them and then proceeded on to concord  but at concord they were stopped and repulsed and along the road back from concord to lexington they were driven with slaughter and dismay  and thus the rebellion was commenced which led to the establishment of a people which let us englishmen say and think what we may of them at this present moment has made itself one of the five great nations of the earth and has enabled us to boast that the two out of the five who enjoy the greatest liberty and the widest prosperity speak the english language and are known by english names  for all that has come and is like to come i say again long may that honor remain  i could not but feel that that road from boston to concord deserves a name in the worlds history greater perhaps than has yet been given to it  concord is at present to be noted as the residence of mr emerson and of mr hawthorne two of those many men of letters of whose presence boston and its neighborhood have reason to be proud  of mr emerson i have already spoken  the author of the scarlet letter i regard as certainly the first of american novelists  i know what men will say of mr cooperand i also am an admirer of coopers novels  but i cannot think that mr coopers powers were equal to those of mr hawthorne though his mode of thought may have been more genial and his choice of subjects more attractive in their day  in point of imagination which after all is the novelists greatest gift i hardly know any living author who can be accounted superior to mr hawthorne  very much has undoubtedly been done in boston to carry out that theory of colonel newcomesemollit mores by which the colonel meant to signify his opinion that a competent knowledge of reading writing and arithmetic with a taste for enjoying those accomplishments goes very far toward the making of a man and will by no means mar a gentleman  in boston nearly every man woman and child has had his or her manners so far softened and though they may still occasionally be somewhat rough to the outer touch the inward effect is plainly visible  with us especially among our agricultural population the absence of that inner softening is as visible  i went to see a public library in the city which if not founded by mr bates whose name is so well known in london as connected with the house of messrs baring has been greatly enriched by him it is by his money that it has been enabled to do its work  in this library there is a certain number of thousands of volumesa great many volumes as there are in most public libraries  there are books of all classes from ponderous unreadable folios of which learned men know the titlepages down to the lightest literature  novels are by no means eschewedare rather if i understood aright considered as one of the staples of the library from this library any book excepting such rare volumes as in all libraries are considered holy is given out to any inhabitant of boston without any payment on presentation of a simple request on a prepared form  in point of fact it is a gratuitous circulating library open to all boston rich or poor young or old  the books seemed in general to be confided to young children who came as messengers from their fathers and mothers or brothers and sisters no question whatever is asked if the applicant is known or the place of his residence undoubted  if there be no such knowledge or there be any doubt as to the residence the applicant is questioned the object being to confine the use of the library to the bona fide inhabitants of the city  practically the books are given to those who ask for them whoever they may be  boston contains over 200000 inhabitants and all those 200000 are entitled to them  some twenty men and women are kept employed from morning till night in carrying on this circulating library and there is moreover attached to the establishment a large reading room supplied with papers and magazines open to the public of boston on the same terms  of course i asked whether a great many of the books were not lost stolen and destroyed and of course i was told that there were no losses no thefts and no destruction  as to thefts the librarian did not seem to think that any instance of such an occurrence could be found  among the poorer classes a book might sometimes be lost when they were changing their lodgings but anything so lost was more than replaced by the fines  a book is taken out for a week and if not brought back at the end of that weekwhen the loan can be renewed if the reader wishesa fine i think of two cents is incurred  the children when too late with the books bring in the two cents as a matter of course and the sum so collected fully replaces all losses  it was all couleur de rose the librarianesses looked very pretty and learned and if i remember aright mostly wore spectacles the head librarian was enthusiastic the nice instructive books were properly dogseared my own productions were in enormous demand the call for books over the counter was brisk and the readingroom was full of readers  it has i dare say occurred to other travelers to remark that the proceedings at such institutions when visited by them on their travels are always rose colored  it is natural that the bright side should be shown to the visitor  it may be that many books are called for and returned unread that many of those taken out are so taken by persons who ought to pay for their novels at circulating libraries that the librarian and librarianesses get very tired of their long hours of attendance for i found that they were very long and that many idlers warm themselves in that readingroom nevertheless the fact remainsthe library is public to all the men and women in boston and books are given out without payment to all who may choose to ask for them  why should not the great mr mudie emulate mr bates and open a library in london on the same system  the librarian took me into one special room of which he himself kept the key to show me a present which the library had received from the english government  the room was filled with volumes of two sizes all bound alike containing descriptions and drawings of all the patents taken out in england  according to this librarian such a work would be invaluable as to american patents but he conceived that the subject had become too confused to render any such an undertaking possible  i never allow a single volume to be used for a moment without the presence of myself or one of my assistants said the librarian and then he explained to me when i asked him why he was so particular that the drawings would as a matter of course be cut out and stolen if he omitted his care but they may be copied i said  yes but if jones merely copies one smith may come after him and copy it also  jones will probably desire to hinder smith from having any evidence of such a patent  as to the ordinary borrowing and returning of books the poorest laborers child in boston might be trusted as honest but when a question of trade came upof commercial competitionthen the librarian was bound to bethink himself that his countrymen are very smart  i hope said the librarian you will let them know in england how grateful we are for their present  and i hereby execute that librarians commission  i shall always look back to social life in boston with great pleasure  i met there many men and women whom to know is a distinction and with whom to be intimate is a great delight  it was a puritan city in which strict old roundhead sentiments and laws used to prevail but nowadays ginger is hot in the mouth there and in spite of the war there were cakes and ale  there was a law passed in massachusetts in the old days that any girl should be fined and imprisoned who allowed a young man to kiss her that law has now i think fallen into abeyance and such matters are regulated in boston much as they are in other large towns farther eastward  it still i conceive calls itself a puritan city but it has divested its puritanism of austerity and clings rather to the politics and public bearing of its old fathers than to their social manners and pristine severity of intercourse  the young girls are no doubt much more comfortable under the new dispensationand the elderly men also as i fancy  sunday as regards the outer streets is sabbatical  but sunday evenings within doors i always found to be what my friends in that country call quite a good time  it is not the thing in boston to smoke in the streets during the day but the wisest the sagest and the most holyeven those holy men whom the lecturer saw around him seldom refuse a cigar in the diningroom as soon as the ladies have gone  perhaps even the wicked weed would make its appearance before that sad eclipse thereby postponing or perhaps absolutely annihilating the melancholy period of widowhood to both parties and would light itself under the very eyes of those who in sterner cities will lend no countenance to such lightings  ah me it was very pleasant  i confess i like this abandonment of the stricter rules of the more decorous world  i fear that there is within me an aptitude to the milder debaucheries which makes such deviations pleasant  i like to drink and i like to smoke but i do not like to turn women out of the room  then comes the question whether one can have all that one likes together  in some small circles in new england i found people simple enough to fancy that they could  in massachusetts the maine liquor law is still the law of the land but like that other law to which i have alluded it has fallen very much out of use  at any rate it had not reached the houses of the gentlemen with whom i had the pleasure of making acquaintance  but here i must guard myself from being misunderstood  i saw but one drunken man through all new england and he was very respectable  he was however so uncommonly drunk that he might be allowed to count for two or three  the puritans of boston are of course simple in their habits and simple in their expenses  champagne and canvasback ducks i found to be the provisions most in vogue among those who desired to adhere closely to the manner of their forefathers  upon the whole i found the ways of life which had been brought over in the mayflower from the stern sects of england and preserved through the revolutionary war for liberty to be very pleasant ways and i made up my mind that a yankee puritan can be an uncommonly pleasant fellow  i wish that some of them did not dine so early for when a man sits down at halfpast two that keeping up of the afterdinner recreations till bedtime becomes hard work  in boston the houses are very spacious and excellent and they are always furnished with those luxuries which it is so difficult to introduce into an old house  they have hot and cold water pipes into every room and baths attached to the bedchambers  it is not only that comfort is increased by such arrangements but that much labor is saved  in an old english house it will occupy a servant the best part of the day to carry water up and down for a large family  everything also is spacious commodious and well lighted i certainly think that in housebuilding the americans have gone beyond us for even our new houses are not commodious as are theirs  one practice which they have in their cities would hardly suit our limited london spaces  when the body of the house is built they throw out the diningroom behind  it stands alone as it were with no other chamber above it and removed from the rest of the house  it is consequently behind the double drawingrooms which form the ground floor and is approached from them and also from the back of the hall  the second entrance to the diningroom is thus near the top of the kitchen stairs which no doubt is its proper position  the whole of the upper part of the house is thus kept for the private uses of the family  to me this plan of building recommended itself as being very commodious  i found the spirit for the war quite as hot at boston now in november if not hotter than it was when i was there ten weeks earlier and i found also to my grief that the feeling against england was as strong  i can easily understand how difficult it must have been and still must be to englishmen at home to understand this and see how it has come to pass  it has not arisen as i think from the old jealousy of england  it has not sprung from that source which for years has induced certain newspapers especially the new york herald to vilify england  i do not think that the men of new england have ever been as regards this matter in the same boat with the new york herald  but when this war between the north and south first broke out even before there was as yet a war the northern men had taught themselves to expect what they called british sympathy meaning british encouragement  they regarded and properly regarded the action of the south as a rebellion and said among themselves that so staid and conservative a nation as great britain would surely countenance them in quelling rebels  if not should it come to pass that great britain should show no such countenance and sympathy for northern law if great britain did not respond to her friend as she was expected to respond then it would appear that cotton was king at least in british eyes  the war did come and great britain regarded the two parties as belligerents standing as far as she was concerned on equal grounds  this it was that first gave rise to that fretful anger against england which has gone so far toward ruining the northern cause  we know how such passions are swelled by being ventilated and how they are communicated from mind to mind till they become national  politiciansamerican politicians i here meanhave their own future careers ever before their eyes and are driven to make capital where they can  hence it is that such men as mr seward in the cabinet and mr everett out of it can reconcile it to themselves to speak as they have done of england  it was but the other day that mr everett spoke in one of his orations of the hope that still existed that the flag of the united states might still float over the whole continent of north america  what would he say of an english statesman who should speak of putting up the union jack on the state house in boston  such words tell for the moment on the hearers and help to gain some slight popularity but they tell for more than a moment on those who read them and remember them  and then came the capture of messrs slidell and mason  i was at boston when those men were taken out of the trent by the san jacinto and brought to fort warren in boston harbor  captain wilkes was the officer who had made the capture and he immediately was recognized as a hero  he was invited to banquets and feted speeches were made to him as speeches are commonly made to high officers who come home after many perils victorious from the wars  his health was drunk with great applause and thanks were voted to him by one of the houses of congress  it was said that a sword was to be given to him but i do not think that the gift was consummated  should it not have been a policemans truncheon  had he at the best done any thing beyond a policemans work  of captain wilkes no one would complain for doing policemans duty if his country were satisfied with the manner in which he did it england if she quarreled at all would not quarrel with him  it may now and again become the duty of a brave officer to do work of so low a caliber  it is a pity that an ambitious sailor should find himself told off for so mean a task but the world would know that it is not his fault  no one could blame captain wilkes for acting policeman on the seas  but who ever before heard of giving a man glory for achievements so little glorious  how captain wilkes must have blushed when those speeches were made to him when that talk about the sword came up when the thanks arrived to him from congress  an officer receives his countrys thanks when he has been in great peril and has borne himself gallantly through his danger when he has endured the brunt of war and come through it with victory when he has exposed himself on behalf of his country and singed his epaulets with an enemys fire  captain wilkes tapped a merchantman on the shoulder in the high seas and told him that his passengers were wanted  in doing this he showed no lack of spirit for it might be his duty but where was his spirit when he submitted to be thanked for such work  and then there arose a clamor of justification among the lawyers judges and exjudges flew to wheaton phillimore and lord stowell before twentyfour hours were over every man and every woman in boston were armed with precedents  then there was the burning of the caroline  england had improperly burned the caroline on lake erie or rather in one of the american ports on lake erie and had then begged pardon  if the states had been wrong they would beg pardon but whether wrong or right they would not give up slidell and mason  but the lawyers soon waxed stronger  the men were manifestly ambassadors and as such contraband of war  wilkes was quite right only he should have seized the vessel also  he was quite right for though slidell and mason might not be ambassadors they were undoubtedly carrying dispatches  in a few hours there began to be a doubt whether the men could be ambassadors because if called ambassadors then the power that sent the embassy must be presumed to be recognized  that captain wilkes had taken no dispatches was true but the captain suggested a way out of this difficulty by declaring that he had regarded the two men themselves as an incarnated embodiment of dispatches  at any rate they were clearly contraband of war  they were going to do an injury to the north  it was pretty to hear the charming women of boston as they became learned in the law of nations wheaton is quite clear about it one young girl said to me  it was the first i had ever heard of wheaton and so far was obliged to knock under  all the world ladies and lawyers expressed the utmost confidence in the justice of the seizure but it was clear that all the world was in a state of the profoundest nervous anxiety on the subject  to me it seemed to be the most suicidal act that any party in a lifeanddeath struggle ever committed all americans on both sides had felt from the beginning of the war that any assistance given by england to one or the other would turn the scale  the government of mr lincoln must have learned by this time that england was at least true in her neutrality that no desire for cotton would compel her to give aid to the south as long as she herself was not ill treated by the north  but it seemed as though mr seward the presidents prime minister had no better work on hand than that of showing in every way his indifference as to courtesy with england  insults offered to england would he seemed to think strengthen his hands  he would let england know that he did not care for her  when our minister lord lyons appealed to him regarding the suspension of the habeas corpus mr seward not only answered him with insolence but instantly published his answer in the papers  he instituted a system of passports especially constructed so as to incommode englishmen proceeding from the states across the atlantic  he resolved to make every englishman in america feel himself in some way punished because england had not assisted the north  and now came the arrest of slidell and mason out of an english mail steamer and mr seward took care to let it be understood that happen what might those two men should not be given up  nothing during all this time astonished me so much as the estimation in which mr seward was then held by his own party  it is perhaps the worst defect in the constitution of the states that no incapacity on the part of a minister no amount of condemnation expressed against him by the people or by congress can put him out of office during the term of the existing presidency  the president can dismiss him but it generally happens that the president is brought in on a platform which has already nominated for him his cabinet as thoroughly as they have nominated him  mr seward ran mr lincoln very hard for the position of candidate for the presidency on the republican interest  on the second voting of the republican delegates at the convention at chicago mr seward polled 184 to mr lincolns 181 but as a clear half of the total number of votes was necessary that is 233 out of 465there was necessarily a third polling and mr lincoln won the day  on that occasion mr chase and mr cameron both of whom became members of mr lincolns cabinet were also candidates for the white house on the republican side  i mention this here to show that though the president can in fact dismiss his ministers he is in a great manner bound to them and that a minister in mr sewards position is hardly to be dismissed but from the 1st of november 1861 till the day on which i left the states i do not think that i heard a good word spoken of mr seward as a minister even by one of his own party  the radical or abolitionist republicans all abused him  the conservative or anti abolition republicans to whose party he would consider himself as belonging spoke of him as a mistake  he had been prominent as senator from new york and had been governor of the state of new york but had none of the aptitudes of a statesman  he was there and it was a pity  he was not so bad as mr cameron the minister for war that was the best his own party could say for him even in his own state of new york  as to the democrats their language respecting him was as harsh as any that i have heard used toward the southern leaders  he seemed to have no friends no one who trusted him and yet he was the presidents chief minister and seemed to have in his own hands the power of mismanaging all foreign relations as he pleased  but in truth the states of america great as they are and much as they have done have not produced statesmen  that theory of governing by the little men rather than by the great has not been found to answer and such follies as those of mr seward have been the consequence  at boston and indeed elsewhere i found that there was even then at the time of the capture of these two menno true conception of the neutrality of england with reference to the two parties  when any argument was made showing that england who had carried these messengers from the south would undoubtedly have also carried messengers from the north the answer always wasbut the southerners are all rebels  will england regard us who are by treaty her friend as she does a people that is in rebellion against its own government  that was the old story over again and as it was a very long story it was hardly of use to go back through all its details  but the fact was that unless there had been such absolute neutralitysuch equality between the parties in the eyes of englandeven captain wilkes would not have thought of stopping the trent or the government at washington of justifying such a proceeding  and it must be remembered that the government at washington had justified that proceeding  the secretary of the navy had distinctly done so in his official report and that report had been submitted to the president and published by his order  it was because england was neutral between the north and south that captain wilkes claimed to have the right of seizing those two men it had been the presidents intention some month or so before this affair to send mr everett and other gentlemen over to england with objects as regards the north similar to those which had caused the sending of slidell and mason with reference to the south  what would mr everett have thought had he been refused a passage from dover to calais because the carrying of him would have been toward the south a breach of neutrality  it would never have occurred to him that he could become subject to such stoppage  how should we have been abused for southern sympathies had we so acted  we forsooth who carry passengers about the world from china and australia round to chili and peru who have the charge of the worlds passengers and letters and as a nation incur out of our pocket annually loss of some half million of pounds sterling for the privilege of doing so are to inquire the business of every american traveler before we let him on board and be stopped in our work if we take anybody on one side whose journeyings may be conceived by the other side to be to them prejudicial  not on such terms will englishmen be willing to spread civilization across the ocean  i do not pretend to understand wheaton and phillimore or even to have read a single word of any international law  i have refused to read any such knowing that it would only confuse and mislead me  but i have my common sense to guide me  two men living in one street quarrel and shy brickbats at each other and make the whole street very uncomfortable  not only is no one to interfere with them but they are to have the privilege of deciding that their brickbats have the right of way rather than the ordinary intercourse of the neighborhood  if that be national law national law must be changed  it might do for some centuries back but it cannot do now  up to this period my sympathies had been with the north  i thought and still think that the north had no alternative that the war had been forced upon them and that they had gone about their work with patriotic energy  but this stopping of an english mail steamer was too much for me  what will they do in england was now the question  but for any knowledge as to that i had to wait till i reached washington    chapter xvii  cambridge and lowell   the two places of most general interest in the vicinity of boston are cambridge and lowell  cambridge is to massachusetts and i may almost say is to all the northern states what cambridge and oxford are to england  it is the seat of the university which gives the highest education to be attained by the highest classes in that country  lowell also is in little to massachusetts and to new england what manchester is to us in so great a degree  it is the largest and most prosperous cottonmanufacturing town in the states  cambridge is not above three or four miles from boston  indeed the town of cambridge properly so called begins where boston ceases  the harvard collegethat is its name taken from one of its original foundersis reached by horsecars in twenty minutes from the city  an englishman feels inclined to regard the place as a suburb of boston but if he so expresses himself he will not find favor in the eyes of the men of cambridge  the university is not so large as i had expected to find it  it consists of harvard college as the undergraduates department and of professional schools of law medicine divinity and science in the few words that i will say about it i will confine myself to harvard college proper conceiving that the professional schools connected with it have not in themselves any special interest  the average number of undergraduates does not exceed 450 and these are divided into four classes  the average number of degrees taken annually by bachelors of art is something under 100  four years residence is required for a degree and at the end of that period a degree is given as a matter of course if the candidates conduct has been satisfactory  when a young man has pursued his studies for that period going through the required examinations and lectures he is not subjected to any final examination as is the case with a candidate for a degree at oxford and cambridge  it is perhaps in this respect that the greatest difference exists between the english universities and harvard college  with us a young man may i take it still go through his three or four years with a small amount of study  but his doing so does not insure him his degree  if he have utterly wasted his time he is plucked and late but heavy punishment comes upon him  at cambridge in massachusetts the daily work of the men is made more obligatory but if this be gone through with such diligence as to enable the student to hold his own during the four years he has his degree as a matter of course  there are no degrees conferring special honor a man cannot go out in honors as he does with us  there are no firsts or double firsts no wranglers no senior opts or junior opts  nor are there prizes of fellowships and livings to be obtained  it is i think evident from this that the greatest incentives to high excellence are wanting at harvard college there is neither the reward of honor nor of money  there is none of that great competition which exists at our cambridge for the high place of senior wrangler and consequently the degree of excellence attained is no doubt lower than with us  but i conceive that the general level of the university education is higher there than with us that a young man is more sure of getting his education and that a smaller percentage of men leaves harvard college utterly uneducated than goes in that condition out of oxford or cambridge  the education at harvard college is more diversified in its nature and study is more absolutely the business of the place than it is at our universities  the expense of education at harvard college is not much lower than at our colleges with us there are no doubt more men who are absolutely extravagant than at cambridge massachusetts  the actual authorized expenditure in accordance with the rules is only 50l per annum ie 249 dollars but this does not by any means include everything  some of the richer young men may spend as much as 300l per annum but the largest number vary their expenditure from 100l to 180l per annum and i take it the same thing may be said of our universities  there are many young men at harvard college of very small means  they will live on 70l per annum and will earn a great portion of that by teaching in the vacations there are thirtysix scholarships attached to the university varying in value from 20l to 60l per annum and there is also a beneficiary fund for supplying poor scholars with assistance during their collegiate education  many are thus brought up at cambridge who have no means of their own and i think i may say that the consideration in which they are held among their brother students is in no degree affected by their position  i doubt whether we can say so much of the sizars and bible clerks at our universities  at harvard college there is of course none of that oldfashioned timehonored delicious medieval life which lends so much grace and beauty to our colleges  there are no gates no porters lodges no butteries no halls no battels and no common rooms there are no proctors no bulldogs no bursers no deans no morning and evening chapel no quads no surplices no caps and gowns  i have already said that there are no examinations for degrees and no honors and i can easily conceive that in the absence of all these essentials many an englishman will ask what right harvard college has to call itself a university  i have said that there are no honors and in our sense there are none  but i should give offense to my american friends if i did not explain that there are prizes giveni think all in money and that they vary from fifty to ten dollars  these are called deturs the degrees are given on commencement day at which occasion certain of the expectant graduates are selected to take parts in a public literary exhibition  to be so selected seems to be tantamount to taking a degree in honors  there is also a dinner on commencement day at which however no wine or other intoxicating drink shall be served  it is required that every student shall attend some place of christian worship on sundays but he or his parents for him may elect what denomination of church he shall attend  there is a university chapel on the university grounds which belongs if i remember aright to the episcopalian church  the young men for the most part live in college having rooms in the college buildings but they do not board in those rooms  there are establishments in the town under the patronage of the university at which dinner breakfast and supper are provided and the young men frequent one of these houses or another as they or their friends for them may arrange  every young man not belonging to a family resident within a hundred miles of cambridge and whose parents are desirous to obtain the protection thus provided is placed as regards his pecuniary management under the care of a patron and this patron acts by him as a father does in england by a boy at school  he pays out his money for him and keeps him out of debt  the arrangement will not recommend itself to young men at oxford quite so powerfully as it may do to the fathers of some young men who have been there  the rules with regard to the lodging and boarding houses are very stringent  any festive entertainment is to be reported to the president  no wine or spirituous liquors may be used etc  it is not a picturesque system this but it has its advantages  there is a handsome library attached to the college which the young men can use but it is not as extensive as i had expected  the university is not well off for funds by which to increase it  the new museum in the college is also a handsome building  the edifices used for the undergraduates chambers and for the lecture rooms are by no means handsome  they are very ugly red brick houses standing here and there without order  there are seven such and they are called brattle house college house divinity hall hollis hall holsworthy hall massachusetts hall and stoughton hall  it is almost astonishing that buildings so ugly should have been erected for such a purpose  these together with the library the museum and the chapel stand on a large green which might be made pretty enough if it were kept well mown like the gardens of our cambridge colleges but it is much neglected here again the want of fundsthe augusta res domimust be pleaded as an excuse  on the same green but at some little distance from any other building stands the presidents pleasant house  the immediate direction of the college is of course mainly in the hands of the president who is supreme  but for the general management of the institution there is a corporation of which he is one  it is stated in the laws of the university that the corporation of the university and its overseers constitute the government of the university  the corporation consists of the president five fellows so called and a treasurer  these fellows are chosen as vacancies occur by themselves subject to the concurrence of the overseers  but these fellows are in nowise like to the fellows of our colleges having no salaries attached to their offices  the board of overseers consists of the state governor other state officers the president and treasurer of harvard college and thirty other persons men of note chosen by vote  the faculty of the college in which is vested the immediate care and government of the undergraduates is composed of the president and the professors  the professors answer to the tutors of our colleges and upon them the education of the place depends i cannot complete this short notice of harvard college without saying that it is happy in the possession of that distinguished natural philosopher professor agassiz  m agassiz has collected at cambridge a museum of such things as natural philosophers delight to show which i am told is all but invaluable  as my ignorance on all such matters is of a depth which the professor can hardly imagine and which it would have shocked him to behold i did not visit the museum  taking the university of harvard college as a whole i should say that it is most remarkable in thisthat it does really give to its pupils that education which it professes to give  of our own universities other good things may be said but that one special good thing cannot always be said  cambridge boasts itself as the residence of four or five men well known to fame on the american and also on the european side of the ocean  president feltons name is very familiar to us and wherever greek scholarship is held in repute that is known  so also is the name of professor agassiz of whom i have spoken russell lowell is one of the professors of the collegethat russell lowell who sang of birdofredum sawin and whose biglow papers were edited with such an ardor of love by our tom brown birdofredum is worthy of all the ardor  mr dana is also a cambridge manhe who was two years before the mast and who since that has written to us of cuba  but mr dana though residing at cambridge is not of cambridge and though a literary man he does not belong to literature  he iscould he help ita special attorney  i must not however degrade him for in the states barristers and attorneys are all one  i cannot but think that he could help it and that he should not give up to law what was meant for mankind  i fear however that successful law has caught him in her intolerant clutches and that literature who surely would be the nobler mistress must wear the willow  last and greatest is the poetlaureate of the west for mr longfellow also lives at cambridge    since these words were written president felton has diedi as i returned on my way homeward had the melancholy privilege of being present at his funeral  i feel bound to record here the great kindness with which mr felton assisted me in obtaining such information as i needed respecting the institution over which he presided   i am not at all aware whether the nature of the manufacturing corporation of lowell is generally understood by englishmen  i confess that until i made personal acquaintance with the plan i was absolutely ignorant on the subject  i knew that lowell was a manufacturing town at which cotton is made into calico and at which calico is printedas is the case at manchester but i conceived this was done at lowell as it is done at manchester by individual enterprisethat i or any one else could open a mill at lowell and that the manufacturers there were ordinary traders as they are at other manufacturing towns  but this is by no means the case  that which most surprises an english visitor on going through the mills at lowell is the personal appearance of the men and women who work at them  as there are twice as many women as there are men it is to them that the attention is chiefly called  they are not only better dressed cleaner and better mounted in every respect than the girls employed at manufactories in england but they are so infinitely superior as to make a stranger immediately perceive that some very strong cause must have created the difference  we all know the class of young women whom we generally see serving behind counters in the shops of our larger cities  they are neat well dressed careful especially about their hair composed in their manner and sometimes a little supercilious in the propriety of their demeanor  it is exactly the same class of young women that one sees in the factories at lowell  they are not sallow nor dirty nor ragged nor rough  they have about them no signs of want or of low culture  many of us also know the appearance of those girls who work in the factories in england and i think it will be allowed that a second glance at them is not wanting to show that they are in every respect inferior to the young women who attend our shops  the matter indeed requires no argument  any young woman at a shop would be insulted by being asked whether she had worked at a factory  the difference with regard to the men at lowell is quite as strong though not so striking  working men do not show their status in the world by their outward appearance as readily as women and as i have said before the number of the women greatly exceeded that of the men  one would of course be disposed to say that the superior condition of the workers must have been occasioned by superior wages and this to a certain extent has been the cause  but the higher payment is not the chief cause  womens wages including all that they receive at the lowell factories average about 14s a week which is i take it fully a third more than women can earn in manchester or did earn before the loss of the american cotton began to tell upon them  but if wages at manchester were raised to the lowell standard the manchester women would not be clothed fed cared for and educated like the lowell women  the fact is that the workmen and the workwomen at lowell are not exposed to the chances of an open labor market  they are taken in as it were to a philanthropical manufacturing college and then looked after and regulated more as girls and lads at a great seminary than as hands by whose industry profit is to be made out of capital  this is all very nice and pretty at lowell but i am afraid it could not be done at manchester  there are at present twelve different manufactories at lowell each of which has what is called a separate corporation  the merrimack manufacturing company was incorporated in 1822 and thus lowell was commenced  the lowell machineshop was incorporated in 1845 and since that no new establishment has been added  in 1821 a certain boston manufacturing company which had mills at waltham near boston was attracted by the waterpower of the river merrimack on which the present town of lowell is situated  a canal called the pawtucket canal had been made for purposes of navigation from one reach of the river to another with the object of avoiding the pawtucket falls and this canal with the adjacent waterpower of the river was purchased for the boston company  the place was then called lowell after one of the partners in that company  it must be understood that waterpower alone is used for preparing the cotton and working the spindles and looms of the cotton mills steam is applied in the two establishments in which the cottons are printed for the purposes of printing but i think nowhere else when the mills are at full work about two and a half million yards of cotton goods are made every week and nearly a million pounds of cotton are consumed per week i e 842000 lbs but the consumption of coal is only 30000 tons in the year  this will give some idea of the value of the waterpower  the pawtucket canal was as i say bought and lowell was commenced  the town was incorporated in 1826 and the railway between it and boston was opened in 1835 under the superintendence of mr jackson the gentleman by whom the purchase of the canal had in the first instance been made  lowell now contains about 40000 inhabitants  the following extract is taken from the handbook to lowell mr f c lowell had in his travels abroad observed the effect of large manufacturing establishments on the character of the people and in the establishment at waltham the founders looked for a remedy for these defects  they thought that education and good morals would even enhance the profit and that they could compete with great britain by introducing a more cultivated class of operatives  for this purpose they built boardinghouses which under the direct supervision of the agent were kept by discreet matronsi can answer for the discreet matrons at lowellmostly widows no boarders being allowed except operatives  agents and overseers of high moral character were selected regulations were adopted at the mills and boardinghouses by which only respectable girls were employed  the mills were nicely painted and swepti can also answer for the painting and sweeping at lowelltrees set out in the yards and along the streets habits of neatness and cleanliness encouraged and the result justified the expenditure at lowell the same policy has been adopted and extended more spacious mills and elegant boardinghouses have been erected as to the elegance it may be a matter of taste but as to the comfort there is no questionthe same care as to the classes employed more capital has been expended for cleanliness and decoration a hospital has been established for the sick where for a small price they have an experienced physician and skillful nurses  an institute with an extensive library for the use of the mechanics has been endowed  the agents have stood forward in the support of schools churches lectures and lyceums and their influence contributed highly to the elevation of the moral and intellectual character of the operatives  talent has been encouraged brought forward and recommended  for some considerable time the young women wrote edited and published a newspaper among themselves called the lowell offering  and lowell has supplied agents and mechanics for the later manufacturing places who have given tone to society and extended the beneficial influence of lowell through the united states girls from the country with a true yankee spirit of independence and confident in their own powers pass a few years here and then return to get married with a dower secured by their exertions with more enlarged ideas and extended means of information and their places are supplied by younger relatives  a large proportion of the female population of new england has been employed at some time in manufacturing establishments and they are not on this account less good wives mothers or educators of families  then the account goes on to tell how the health of the girls has been improved by their attendance at the mills how they put money into the savings banks and buy railway shares and farms how there are thirty churches in lowell a library banks and insurance office how there is a cemetery and a park and how everything is beautiful philanthropic profitable and magnificent  thus lowell is the realization of a commercial utopia  of all the statements made in the little book which i have quoted i cannot point out one which is exaggerated much less false  i should not call the place elegant in other respects i am disposed to stand by the book  before i had made any inquiry into the cause of the apparent comfort it struck me at once that some great effort at excellence was being made  i went into one of the discreet matrons residences and perhaps may give but an indifferent idea of her discretion when i say that she allowed me to go into the bedrooms  if you want to ascertain the inner ways or habits of life of any man woman or child see if it be practicable to do so his or her bedroom  you will learn more by a minutes glance round that holy of holies than by any conversation  looking glasses and such like suspended dresses and toiletbelongings if taken without notice cannot lie or even exaggerate  the discreet matron at first showed me rooms only prepared for use for at the period of my visit lowell was by no means full but she soon became more intimate with me and i went through the upper part of the house  my report must be altogether in her favor and in that of lowell  everything was cleanly well ordered and feminine  there was not a bed on which any woman need have hesitated to lay herself if occasion required it  i fear that this cannot be said of the lodgings of the manufacturing classes at manchester  the boarders all take their meals together  as a rule they have meat twice a day  hot meat for dinner is with them as much a matter of course or probably more so than with any englishman or woman who may read this book  for in the states of america regulations on this matter are much more rigid than with us  cold meat is rarely seen and to live a day without meat would be as great a privation as to pass a night without bed  the rules for the guidance of these boardinghouses are very rigid the houses themselves belong to the corporations or different manufacturing establishments and the tenants are altogether in the power of the managers  none but operatives are to be taken in the tenants are answerable for improper conduct  the doors are to be closed at ten oclock  any boarders who do not attend divine worship are to be reported to the managers  the yards and walks are to be kept clean and snow removed at once and the inmates must be vaccinated etc etc etc  it is expressly stated by the hamilton companyand i believe by all the companiesthat no one shall be employed who is habitually absent from public worship on sunday or who is known to be guilty of immorality it is stated that the average wages of the women are two dollars or eight shillings a week besides their board  i found when i was there that from three dollars to three and a half a week were paid to the women of which they paid one dollar and twentyfive cents for their board  as this would not fully cover the expense of their keep twentyfive cents a week for each was also paid to the boardinghouse keepers by the mill agents  this substantially came to the same thing as it left the two dollars a week or eight shillings with the girls over and above their cost of living  the board included washing lights food bed and attendanceleaving a surplus of eight shillings a week for clothes and saving  now let me ask any one acquainted with manchester and its operatives whether that is not utopia realized  factory girls for whom every comfort of life is secured with 21l a year over for saving and dress  one sees the failing however at a moment  it is utopia any lady bountiful can tutor three or four peasants and make them luxuriously comfortable  but no lady bountiful can give luxurious comfort to half a dozen parishes  lowell is now nearly forty years old and contains but 40000 inhabitants  from the very nature of its corporations it cannot spread itself  chicago which has grown out of nothing in a much shorter period and which has no factories has now 120000 inhabitants  lowell is a very wonderful place and shows what philanthropy can do but i fear it also shows what philanthropy cannot do  there are however other establishments conducted on the same principle as those at lowell which have had the same amount or rather the same sort of success  lawrence is now a town of about 15000 inhabitants and manchester of about 24000 if i remember rightly and at those places the mills are also owned by corporations and conducted as are those at lowell  but it seems to me that as new england takes her place in the world as a great manufacturing countrywhich place she undoubtedly will take sooner or latershe must abandon the hothouse method of providing for her operatives with which she has commenced her work  in the first place lowell is not open as a manufacturing town to the capitalists even of new england at large  stock may i presume be bought in the corporations but no interloper can establish a mill there  it is a close manufacturing community bolstered up on all sides and has none of that capacity for providing employment for a thickly growing population which belongs to such places as manchester and leeds  that it should under its present system have been made in any degree profitable reflects great credit on the managers but the profit does reach an amount which in america can be considered as remunerative  the total capital invested by the twelve corporations is thirteen million and a half of dollars or about two million seven hundred thousand pounds  in only one of the corporations that of the merrimack company does the profit amount to twelve per cent  in one that of the booth company it falls below seven per cent  the average profit of the various establishments is something below nine per cent  i am of course speaking of lowell as it was previous to the war  american capitalists are not as a rule contented with so low a rate of interest as this  the states in these matters have had a great advantage over england  they have been able to begin at the beginning manufactories have grown up among us as our cities grewfrom the necessities and chances of the times  when labor was wanted it was obtained in the ordinary way and so when houses were built they were built in the ordinary way  we had not the experience and the results either for good or bad of other nations to guide us  the americans in seeing and resolving to adopt our commercial successes have resolved also if possible to avoid the evils which have attended those successes  it would be very desirable that all our factory girls should read and write wear clean clothes have decent beds and eat hot meat every day  but that is now impossible  gradually with very uphill work but still i trust with sure work much will be done to improve their position and render their life respectable but in england we can have no lowells  in our thickly populated island any commercial utopia is out of the question  nor can as i think lowell be taken as a type of the future manufacturing towns of new england  when new england employs millions in her factories instead of thousandsthe hands employed at lowell when the mills are at full work are about 11000she must cease to provide for them their beds and meals their churchgoing proprieties and orderly modes of life in such an attempt she has all the experience of the world against her  but nevertheless i think she will have done much good  the tone which she will have given will not altogether lose its influence  employment in a factory is now considered reputable by a farmer and his children and this idea will remain  factory work is regarded as more respectable than domestic service and this prestige will not wear itself altogether out  those now employed have a strong conception of the dignity of their own social position and their successors will inherit much of this even though they may find themselves excluded from the advantages of the present utopia  the thing has begun well but it can only be regarded as a beginning  steam it may be presumed will become the motive power of cotton mills in new england as it is with us and when it is so the amount of work to be done at any one place will not be checked by any such limit as that which now prevails at lowell  waterpower is very cheap but it cannot be extended and it would seem that no place can become large as a manufacturing town which has to depend chiefly upon water  it is not improbable that steam may be brought into general use at lowell and that lowell may spread itself  if it should spread itself widely it will lose its utopian characteristics  one cannot but be greatly struck by the spirit of philanthropy in which the system of lowell was at first instituted  it may be presumed that men who put their money into such an undertaking did so with the object of commercial profit to themselves but in this case that was not their first object  i think it may be taken for granted that when messrs jackson and lowell went about their task their grand idea was to place factory work upon a respectable footingto give employment in mills which should not be unhealthy degrading demoralizing or hard in its circumstances  throughout the northern states of america the same feeling is to be seen good and thoughtful men have been active to spread education to maintain health to make work compatible with comfort and personal dignity and to divest the ordinary lot of man of the sting of that curse which was supposed to be uttered when our first father was ordered to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow  one is driven to contrast this feeling of which on all sides one sees such ample testimony with that sharp desire for profit that anxiety to do a stroke of trade at every turn that acknowledged necessity of being smart which we must own is quite as general as the nobler propensity  i believe that both phases of commercial activity may be attributed to the same characteristic  men in trade in america are not more covetous than tradesmen in england nor probably are they more generous or philanthropical  but that which they do they are more anxious to do thoroughly and quickly  they desire that every turn taken shall be a great turnor at any rate that it shall be as great as possible  they go ahead either for bad or good with all the energy they have  in the institutions at lowell i think we may allow that the good has very much prevailed  i went over two of the mills those of the merrimack corporation and of the massachusetts  at the former the printing establishment only was at work the cotton mills were closed  i hardly know whether it will interest any one to learn that something under half a million yards of calico are here printed annually  at the lowell bleachery fifteen million yards are dyed annually  the merrimack cotton mills were stopped and so had the other mills at lowell been stopped till some short time before my visit  trade had been bad and there had of course been a lack of cotton  i was assured that no severe suffering had been created by this stoppage  the greater number of hands had returned into the countryto the farms from whence they had come and though a discontinuance of work and wages had of course produced hardship there had been no actual privationno hunger and want  those of the workpeople who had no homes out of lowell to which to betake themselves and no means at lowell of living had received relief before real suffering had begun  i was assured with something of a smile of contempt at the question that there had been nothing like hunger  but as i said before visitors always see a great deal of rose color and should endeavor to allay the brilliancy of the tint with the proper amount of human shading  but do not let any visitor mix in the browns with too heavy a hand  at the massachusetts cotton mills they were working with about two thirds of their full number of hands and this i was told was about the average of the number now employed throughout lowell working at this rate they had now on hand a supply of cotton to last them for six months  their stocks had been increased lately and on asking from whence i was informed that that last received had come to them from liverpool  there is i believe no doubt but that a considerable quantity of cotton has been shipped back from england to the states since the civil war began  i asked the gentleman to whose care at lowell i was consigned whether he expected to get cotton from the southfor at that time beaufort in south carolina had just been taken by the naval expedition  he had he said a political expectation of a supply of cotton but not a commercial expectation  that at least was the gist of his reply and i found it to be both intelligent and intelligible  the massachusetts mills when at full work employ 1300 females and 400 males and turn out 540000 yards of calico per week  on my return from lowell in the smoking car an old man came and squeezed in next to me  the place was terribly crowded and as the old man was thin and clean and quiet i willingly made room for him so as to avoid the contiguity of a neighbor who might be neither thin nor clean nor quiet  he began talking to me in whispers about the war and i was suspicious that he was a southerner and a secessionist  under such circumstances his company might not be agreeable unless he could be induced to hold his tongue  at last he said i come from canada you know and youyoure an englishman and therefore i can speak to you openly and he gave me an affectionate grip on the knee with his old skinny hand  i suppose i do look more like an englishman than an american but i was surprised at his knowing me with such certainty  there is no mistaking you he said with your round face and your red cheeks  they dont look like that here and he gave me another grip  i felt quite fond of the old man and offered him a cigar    chapter xviii  the rights of women   we all know that the subject which appears above as the title of this chapter is a very favorite subject in america  it is i hope a very favorite subject here also and i am inclined to think has been so for many years past  the rights of women as contradistinguished from the wrongs of women has perhaps been the most precious of the legacies left to us by the feudal ages  how amid the rough darkness of old teuton rule women began to receive that respect which is now their dearest right is one of the most interesting studies of history  it came i take it chiefly from their own conduct  the women of the old classic races seem to have enjoyed but a small amount of respect or of rights and to have deserved as little  it may have been very well for one caesar to have said that his wife should be above suspicion but his wife was put away and therefore either did not have her rights or else had justly forfeited them  the daughter of the next caesar lived in rome the life of a messalina and did not on that account seem to have lost her position in society till she absolutely declined to throw any vail whatever over her propensities  but as the roman empire fell chivalry began  for a time even chivalry afforded but a dull time to the women  during the musical period of the troubadours ladies i fancy had but little to amuse them save the music  but that was the beginning and from that time downward the rights of women have progressed very favorably  it may be that they have not yet all that should belong to them  if that be the case let the men lose no time in making up the difference  but it seems to me that the women who are now making their claims may perhaps hardly know when they are well off  it will be an ill movement if they insist on throwing away any of the advantages they have won  as for the women in america especially i must confess that i think they have a good time  i make them my compliments on their sagacity intelligence and attractions but i utterly refuse to them any sympathy for supposed wrongs  o fortunatas sua si bona norint  whether or no were i an american married man and father of a family i should not go in for the rights of manthat is altogether another question  this question of the rights of women divides itself into two heads one of which is very important worthy of much consideration capable perhaps of much philanthropic action and at any rate affording matter for grave discussion  this is the question of womens work how far the work of the world which is now borne chiefly by men should be thrown open to women further than is now done  the other seems to me to be worthy of no consideration to be capable of no action to admit of no grave discussion  this refers to the political rights of women how far the political working of the world which is now entirely in the hands of men should be divided between them and women  the first question is being debated on our side of the atlantic as keenly perhaps as on the american side  as to that other question i do not know that much has ever been said about it in europe  you are doing nothing in england toward the employment of females a lady said to me in one of the states soon after my arrival in america  pardon me i answered i think we are doing much perhaps too much  at any rate we are doing something  i then explained to her how miss faithful had instituted a printing establishment in london how all the work in that concern was done by females except such heavy tasks as those for which women could not be fitted and i handed to her one of miss faithfuls cards ah said my american friend poor creatures  i have no doubt their very flesh will be worked off their bones  i thought this a little unjust on her part but nevertheless it occurred to me as an answer not unfit to be made by some other ladyby some woman who had not already advocated the increased employment of women  let miss faithful look to that  not that she will work the flesh off her young womens bones or allow such terrible consequences to take place in coram street not that she or that those connected with her in that enterprise will do aught but good to those employed therein  it will not even be said of her individually or of her partners that they have worked the flesh off womens bones but may it not come to this that when the tasks now done by men have been shifted to the shoulders of women women themselves will so complain  may it not go further and come even to this that women will have cause for such complaint  i do not think that such a result will come because i do not think that the object desired by those who are active in the matter will be attained  men as a general rule among civilized nations have elected to earn their own bread and the bread of the women also and from this resolve on their part i do not think that they will be beaten off  we know that mrs dall an american lady has taken up this subject and has written a book on it in which great good sense and honesty of purpose is shown  mrs dall is a strong advocate for the increased employment of women and i with great deference disagree with her  i allude to her book now because she has pointed out i think very strongly the great reason why women do not engage themselves advantageously in trade pursuits  she by no means overpraises her own sex and openly declares that young women will not consent to place themselves in fair competition with men they will not undergo the labor and servitude of long study at their trades  they will not give themselves up to an apprenticeship  they will not enter upon their tasks as though they were to be the tasks of their lives  they may have the same physical and mental aptitudes for learning a trade as men but they have not the same devotion to the pursuit and will not bind themselves to it thoroughly as men do  in all which i quite agree with mrs dall and the english of it isthat the young women want to get married  god forbid that they should not so want  indeed god has forbidden in a very express way that there should be any lack of such a desire on the part of women  there has of late years arisen a feeling among masses of the best of our english ladies that this feminine propensity should be checked  we are told that unmarried women may be respectable which we always knew that they may be useful which we also acknowledgethinking still that if married they would be more useful and that they may be happy which we trustfeeling confident however that they might in another position be more happy  but the question is not only as to the respectability usefulness and happiness of womankind but as to that of men also  if women can do without marriage can men do so and if not how are the men to get wives if the women elect to remain single  it will be thought that i am treating the subject as though it were simply jocose but i beg to assure my reader that such is not my intention  it certainly is the fact that that disinclination to an apprenticeship and unwillingness to bear the long training for a trade of which mrs dall complains on the part of young women arise from the fact that they have other hopes with which such apprenticeships would jar and it is also certain that if such disinclination be overcome on the part of any great number it must be overcome by the destruction or banishment of such hopes  the question is whether good or evil would result from such a change it is often said that whatever difficulty a woman may have in getting a husband no man need encounter difficulty in finding a wife  but in spite of this seeming fact i think it must be allowed that if women are withdrawn from the marriage market men must be withdrawn from it also to the same extent  in any broad view of this matter we are bound to look not on any individual case and the possible remedies for such cases but on the position in the world occupied by women in generalon the general happiness and welfare of the aggregate feminine world and perhaps also a little on the general happiness and welfare of the aggregate male world  when ladies and gentlemen advocate the right of women to employment they are taking very different ground from that on which stand those less extensive philanthropists who exert themselves for the benefit of distressed needlewomen for instance or for the alleviation of the more bitter misery of governesses the two questions are in fact absolutely antagonistic to each other  the rightsofwomen advocate is doing his best to create that position for women from the possible misfortunes of which the friend of the needlewomen is struggling to relieve them  the one is endeavoring to throw work from off the shoulders of men on to the shoulders of women and the other is striving to lessen the burden which women are already bearing  of course it is good to relieve distress in individual cases  that song of the shirt which i regard as poetry of the immortal kind has done an amount of good infinitely wider than poor hood ever ventured to hope  of all such efforts i would speak not only with respect but with loving admiration  but of those whose efforts are made to spread work more widely among womento call upon them to make for us our watches to print our books to sit at our desks as clerks and to add up our accountsmuch as i may respect the individual operators in such a movement i can express no admiration for their judgment  i have seen women with ropes round their necks drawing a harrow over plowed ground  no one will i suppose say that they approve of that  but it would not have shocked me to see men drawing a harrow  i should have thought it slow unprofitable work but my feelings would not have been hurt  there must therefore be some limit but if we men teach ourselves to believe that work is good for women where is the limit to be drawn and who shall draw it it is true that there is now no actually defined limit  there is much work that is commonly open to both sexes  personal domestic attendance is so and the attendance in shops  the use of the needle is shared between men and women and few i take it know where the seamstress ends and where the tailor begins  in many trades a woman can be and very often is the owner and manager of the business  painting is as much open to women as to men as also is literature  there can be no defined limit but nevertheless there is at present a quasi limit which the rightsofwomen advocates wish to move and so to move that women shall do more work and not less  a woman now could not well be a cabdriver in london but are these advocates sure that no woman will be a cab driver when success has attended their efforts  and would they like to see a woman driving a cab  for my part i confess i do not like to see a woman acting as roadkeeper on a french railway  i have seen a woman acting as hostler at a public stage in ireland i knew the circumstanceshow her husband had become ill and incapable and how she had been allowed to earn the wages but nevertheless the sight was to me disagreeable and seemed as far as it went to degrade the sex  chivalry has been very active in raising women from the hard and hardening tasks of the world and through this action they have become soft tender and virtuous it seems to me that they of whom i am now speaking are desirous of undoing what chivalry has done  the argument used is of course plain enough  it is said that women are left destitute in the worlddestitute unless they can be self dependent and that to women should be given the same open access to wages that men possess in order that they may be as self dependent as men  why should a young woman for whom no father is able to provide not enjoy those means of provision which are open to a young man so circumstanced  but i think the answer is very simple  the young man under the happiest circumstances which may befall him is bound to earn his bread  the young woman is only so bound when happy circumstances do not befall her  should we endeavor to make the recurrence of unhappy circumstances more general or less so  what does any tradesman any professional man any mechanic wish for his children  is it not this that his sons shall go forth and earn their bread and that his daughters shall remain with him till they are married  is not that the mothers wish  is it not notorious that such is the wish of us all as to our daughters  in advocating the rights of women it is of other mens girls that we think never of our own  but nevertheless what shall we do for those women who must earn their bread by their own work  whatever we do do not let us willfully increase their number  by opening trades to women by making them printers watchmakers accountants or what not we shall not simply relieve those who must now earn their bread by some such work or else starve  it will not be within our power to stop ourselves exactly at a certain point to arrange that those women who under existing circumstances may now be in want shall be thus placed beyond want but that no others shall be affected men i fear will be too willing to relieve themselves of some portion of their present burden should the worlds altered ways enable them to do so  at present a lawyers clerk may earn perhaps his two guineas a week and he with his wife live on that in fair comfort  but if his wife as well as he has been brought up as a lawyers clerk he will look to her also for some amount of wages i doubt whether the two guineas would be much increased but i do not doubt at all that the womans position would be injured  it seems to me that in discussing this subject philanthropists fail to take hold of the right end of the argument  money returns from work are very good and work itself is good as bringing such returns and occupying both body and mind but the worlds work is very hard and workmen are too often overdriven  the question seems to me to be thisof all this work have the men got on their own backs too heavy a share for them to bear and should they seek relief by throwing more of it upon women  it is the rights of man that we are in fact debating  these watches are weary to make and this type is troublesome to set we have battles to fight and speeches to make and our hands altogether are too full  the women are idlemany of them  they shall make the watches for us and set the type and when they have done that why should they not make nails as they do sometimes in worcestershire or clean horses or drive the cabs  they have had an easy time of it for these years past but well change that  and then it would come to pass that with ropes round their necks the women would be drawing harrows across the fields  i dont think this will come to pass  the women generally do know when they are well off and are not particularly anxious to accept the philanthropy proffered to themas mrs dall says they do not wish to bind themselves as apprentices to independent moneymaking this cry has been louder in america than with us but even in america it has not been efficacious for much  there is in the states no doubt a sort of hankering after increased influence a desire for that prominence of position which men attain by loud voices and brazen foreheads a desire in the female heart to be up and doing something if the female heart only knew what but even in the states it has hardly advanced beyond a few feminine lectures  in many branches of work women are less employed than in england  they are not so frequent behind counters in the shops and are rarely seen as servants in hotels  the fires in such houses are lighted and the rooms swept by men  but the american girls may say they do not desire to light fires and sweep rooms they are ambitious of the higher classes of work  but those higher branches of work require study apprenticeship a devotion of youth and that they will not give  it is very well for a young man to bind himself for four years and to think of marrying four years after that apprenticeship be over  but such a prospectus will not do for a girl  while the sun shines the hay must be made and her sun shines earlier in the day than that of him who is to be her husband  let him go through the apprenticeship and the work and she will have sufficient on her hands if she looks well after his household  under natures teaching she is aware of this and will not bind herself to any other apprenticeship let mrs dall preach as she may  i remember seeing either at new york or boston a wooden figure of a neat young woman as large as life standing at a desk with a ledger before her and looking as though the beau ideal of human bliss were realized in her employment  under the figure there was some notice respecting female accountants  nothing could be nicer than the ladys figure more flowing than the broad lines of her drapery or more attractive than her auburn ringlets  there she stood at work earning her bread without any impediment to the natural operation of her female charms and adjusting the accounts of some great firm with as much facility as grace  i wonder whether he who designed that figure had ever sat or stood at a desk for six hours whether he knew the dull hum of the brain which comes from long attention to another mans figures whether he had ever soiled his own fingers with the everlasting work of office hours or worn his sleeves threadbare as he leaned weary in body and mind upon his desk  work is a grand thingthe grandest thing we have but work is not picturesque graceful and in itself alluring  it sucks the sap out of mens bones and bends their backs and sometimes breaks their hearts but though it be so i for one would not wish to throw any heavier share of it on to a womans shoulders  it was pretty to see those young women with spectacles at the boston library but when i heard that they were there from eight in the morning till nine at night i pitied them their loss of all the softness of home and felt that they would not willingly be there if necessity were less stern  say that by advocating the rights of women philanthropists succeed in apportioning more work to their share will they eat more wear better clothes lie softer and have altogether more of the fruits of work than they do now  that some would do so there can be no doubt but as little that some would have less  if on the whole they would not have more for what good result is the movement made  the first question is whether at the present time they have less than their proper share  there are unquestionably terrible cases of female want and so there are also of want among men alas do we not all feel that it must be so let the philanthropists be ever so energetic  and if a woman be left destitute without the assistance of father brother or husband it would be hard if no means of earning subsistence were open to her  but the object now sought is not that of relieving such distress  it has a much wider tendency or at any rate a wider desire  the idea is that women will ennoble themselves by making themselves independent by working for their own bread instead of eating bread earned by men  it is in that that these new philosophers seem to me to err so greatly  humanity and chivalry have succeeded after a long struggle in teaching the man to work for the woman and now the woman rebels against such teachingnot because she likes the work but because she desires the influence which attends it  but in this i wrong the womaneven the american woman  it is not she who desires it but her philanthropical philosophical friends who desire it for her  if work were more equally divided between the sexes some women would of course receive more of the good things of the world but women generally would not do so  the tendency then would be to force young women out upon their own exertions  fathers would soon learn to think that their daughters should be no more dependent on them than their sons men would expect their wives to work at their own trades brothers would be taught to think it hard that their sisters should lean on them and thus women driven upon their own resources would hardly fare better than they do at present  after all it is a question of money and a contest for that power and influence which money gives  at present men have the position of the lower house of parliamentthey have to do the harder work but they hold the purse  even in england there has grown up a feeling that the old law of the land gives a married man too much power over the joint pecuniary resources of him and his wife and in america this feeling is much stronger and the old law has been modified  why should a married woman be able to possess nothing and if such be the law of the land is it worth a womans while to marry and put herself in such a position  those are the questions asked by the friends of the rights of women  but the young women do marry and the men pour their earnings into their wives laps  if little has as yet been done in extending the rights of women by giving them a greater share of the work of the world still less has been done toward giving them their portion of political influence  in the states there are many men of mark and women of mark also who think that women should have votes for public elections  mr wendell phillips the boston lecturer who advocates abolition is an apostle in this cause also and while i was at boston i read the provisions of a will lately left by a millionaire in which he bequeathed some very large sums of money to be expended in agitation on this subject  a woman is subject to the law why then should she not help to make the law  a child is subject to the law and does not help to make it but the child lacks that discretion which the woman enjoys equally with the man that i take it is the amount of the argument in favor of the political rights of women  the logic of this is so conclusive that i am prepared to acknowledge that it admits of no answer  i will only say that the mutual good relations between men and women which are so indispensable to our happiness require that men and women should not take to voting at the same time and on the same result  if it be decided that women shall have political power let them have it all to themselves for a season  if that be so resolved i think we may safely leave it to them to name the time at which they will begin  i confess that in the states i have sometimes been driven to think that chivalry has been carried too farthat there is an attempt to make women think more of the rights of their womanhood than is needful  there are ladies doors at hotels and ladies drawing rooms ladies sides on the ferryboats ladies windows at the postoffice for the delivery of letterswhich bytheby is an atrocious institution as anybody may learn who will look at the advertisements called personal in some of the new york papers  why should not young ladies have their letters sent to their houses instead of getting them at a private window  the postoffice clerks can tell stories about those ladies windows  but at every turn it is necessary to make separate provision for ladies  from all this it comes to pass that the bakers daughter looks down from a great height on her papa and by no means thinks her brother good enough for her associate  nature the great restorer comes in and teaches her to fall in love with the butchers son  thus the evil is mitigated but i cannot but wish that the young woman should not see herself denominated a lady so often and should receive fewer lessons as to the extent of her privileges  i would save her if i could from working at the oven i would give to her bread and meat earned by her fathers care and her brothers sweat but when she has received these good things i would have her proud of the one and by no means ashamed of the other  let women say what they will of their rights or men who think themselves generous say what they will for them the question has all been settled both for them and for us men by a higher power they are the nursing mothers of mankind and in that law their fate is written with all its joys and all its privileges  it is for men to make those joys as lasting and those privileges as perfect as may be  that women should have their rights no man will deny  to my thinking neither increase of work nor increase of political influence are among them  the best right a woman has is the right to a husband and that is the right to which i would recommend every young woman here and in the states to turn her best attention  on the whole i think that my doctrine will be more acceptable than that of mrs dall or mr wendell phillips    chapter xix  education   the one matter in which as far as my judgment goes the people of the united states have excelled us englishmen so as to justify them in taking to themselves praise which we cannot take to ourselves or refuse to them is the matter of education  in saying this i do not think that i am proclaiming anything disgraceful to england though i am proclaiming much that is creditable to america  to the americans of the states was given the good fortune of beginning at the beginning  the french at the time of their revolution endeavored to reorganize everything and to begin the world again with new habits and grand theories but the french as a people were too old for such a change and the theories fell to the ground  but in the states after their revolution an anglosaxon people had an opportunity of making a new state with all the experience of the world before them and to this matter of education they were from the first aware that they must look for their success  they did so and unrivaled population wealth and intelligence has been the result and with these looking at the whole masses of the peoplei think i am justified in saying unrivaled comfort and happiness  it is not that you my reader to whom in this matter of education fortune and your parents have probably been bountiful would have been more happy in new york than in london  it is not that i who at any rate can read and write have cause to wish that i had been an american  but it is this if you and i can count up in a day all those on whom our eyes may rest and learn the circumstances of their lives we shall be driven to conclude that ninetenths of that number would have had a better life as americans than they can have in their spheres as englishmen  the states are at a discount with us now in the beginning of this year of grace 1862 and englishmen were not very willing to admit the above statement even when the states were not at a discount  but i do not think that a man can travel through the states with his eyes open and not admit the fact  many things will conspire to induce him to shut his eyes and admit no conclusion favorable to the americans  men and women will sometimes be impudent to him the better his coat the greater the impudence  he will be pelted with the braggadocio of equality the corns of his old world conservatism will be trampled on hourly by the purposely vicious herd of uncouth democracy  the fact that he is paymaster will go for nothing and will fail to insure civility  i shall never forget my agony as i saw and heard my desk fall from a porters hand on a railway station as he tossed it from him seven yards off on to the hard pavement  i heard its poor weak intestines rattle in their death struggle and knowing that it was smashed i forgot my position on american soil and remonstrated  its my desk and you have utterly destroyed it i said  ha ha ha laughed the porter  youve destroyed my property i rejoined and its no laughing matter  and then all the crowd laughed  guess youd better get it glued said one so i gathered up the broken article and retired mournfully and crestfallen into a coach  this was very sad and for the moment i deplored the ill luck which had brought me to so savage a country such and such like are the incidents which make an englishman in the states unhappy and rouse his gall against the institutions of the country these things and the continued appliance of the irritating ointment of american braggadocio with which his sores are kept open  but though i was badly off on that railway platform worse off than i should have been in england all that crowd of porters round me were better off than our english porters they had a good time of it  and this o my english brother who has traveled through the states and returned disgusted is the fact throughout  those men whose familiarity was so disgusting to you are having a good time of it  they might be a little more civil you say and yet read and write just as well  true but they are arguing in their minds that civility to you will be taken by you for subservience or for an acknowledgment of superiority and looking at your habits of lifeyours and mine togetheri am not quite sure that they are altogether wrong  have you ever realized to yourself as a fact that the porter who carries your box has not made himself inferior to you by the very act of carrying that box if not that is the very lesson which the man wishes to teach you  if a man can forget his own miseries in his journeyings and think of the people he comes to see rather than of himself i think he will find himself driven to admit that education has made life for the million in the northern states better than life for the million is with us  they have begun at the beginning and have so managed that every one may learn to read and writehave so managed that almost every one does learn to read and write  with us this cannot now be done  population had come upon us in masses too thick for management before we had as yet acknowledged that it would be a good thing that these masses should be educated  prejudices too had sprung up and habits and strong sectional feelings all antagonistic to a great national system of education  we are i suppose now doing all that we can do but comparatively it is little  i think i saw some time since that the cost for gratuitous education or education in part gratuitous which had fallen upon the nation had already amounted to the sum of 800000l and i think also that i read in the document which revealed to me this fact a very strong opinion that government could not at present go much further  but if this matter were regarded in england as it is regarded in massachusetts or rather had it from some prosperous beginning been put upon a similar footing 800000l would not have been esteemed a great expenditure for free education simply in the city of london  in 1857 the public schools of boston cost 70000l and these schools were devoted to a population of about 180000 souls  taking the population of london at two and a half millions the whole sum now devoted to england would if expended in the metropolis make education there even cheaper than it is in boston  in boston during 1857 there were above 24000 pupils at these public schools giving more than oneeighth of the whole population  but i fear it would not be practicable for us to spend 800000l on the gratuitous education of london  rich as we are we should not know where to raise the money  in boston it is raised by a separate tax  it is a thing understood acknowledged and made easy by being habitualas is our national debt  i do not know that boston is peculiarly blessed but i quote the instance as i have a record of its schools before me  at the three high schools in boston at which the average of pupils is 526 about 13l per head is paid for free education  the average price per annum of a childs schooling throughout these schools in boston is about 3l for each  to the higher schools any boy or girl may attain without any expense and the education is probably as good as can be given and as far advanced  the only question is whether it is not advanced further than may be necessary  here as at new york i was almost startled by the amount of knowledge around me and listened as i might have done to an examination in theology among young brahmins  when a young lad explained in my hearing all the properties of the different levers as exemplified by the bones of the human body i bowed my head before him in unaffected humility  we at our english schools never got beyond the use of those bones which he described with such accurate scientific knowledge  in one of the girls schools they were reading milton and when we entered were discussing the nature of the pool in which the devil is described as wallowing  the question had been raised by one of the girls  a pool so called was supposed to contain but a small amount of water and how could the devil being so large get into it  then came the origin of the word poolfrom palus a marsh as we were told some dictionary attesting to the fact and such a marsh might cover a large expanse  the palus maeotis was then quoted  and so we went on till satans theory of political liberty        better to reign in hell than serve in heaven   was thoroughly discussed and understood  these girls of sixteen and seventeen got up one after another and gave their opinions on the subjecthow far the devil was right and how far he was manifestly wrong  i was attended by one of the directors or guardians of the schools and the teacher i thought was a little embarrassed by her position  but the girls themselves were as easy in their demeanor as though they were stitching handkerchiefs at home  it is impossible to refrain from telling all this and from making a little innocent fun out of the superexcellencies of these schools but the total result on my mind was very greatly in their favor  and indeed the testimony came in both ways  not only was i called on to form an opinion of what the men and women would become from the education which was given to the boys and girls but also to say what must have been the education of the boys and girls from what i saw of the men and women  of course it will be understood that i am not here speaking of those i met in society or of their children but of the working peopleof that class who find that a gratuitous education for their children is needful if any considerable amount of education is to be given  the result is to be seen daily in the whole intercourse of life  the coachman who drives you the man who mends your window the boy who brings home your purchases the girl who stitches your wifes dressthey all carry with them sure signs of education and show it in every word they utter  it will of course be understood that this is in the separate states a matter of state law indeed i may go further and say that it is in most of the states a matter of state constitution it is by no means a matter of federal constitution  the united states as a nation takes no heed of the education of its people all that is left to the judgment of the separate states  in most of the thirteen original states provision is made in the written constitution for the general education of the people but this is not done in all  i find that it was more frequently done in the northern or freesoil states than in those which admitted slavery as might have been expected  in the constitutions of south carolina and virginia i find no allusion to the public provision for education but in those of north carolina and georgia it is enjoined  the fortyfirst section of the constitution for north carolina enjoins that schools shall be established by the legislature for the convenient instruction of youth with such salaries to the masters paid by the public as may enable them to instruct at low pricesshowing that the intention here was to assist education and not provide it altogether gratuitously  i think that provision for public education is enjoined in the constitutions of all the states admitted into the union since the first federal knot was tied except in that of illinois  vermont was the first so admitted in 1791 and vermont declares that a competent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town for the convenient instruction of youth  ohio was the second in 1802 and ohio enjoins that the general assembly shall make such provisions by taxation or otherwise as with the income arising from the school trust fund will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state but no religions or other sect or sects shall ever have any exclusive right or control of any part of the school funds of this state  in indiana admitted in 1816 it is required that the general assembly shall provide by law for a general and uniform system of common schools illinois was admitted next in 1818 but the constitution of illinois is silent on the subject of education  it enjoins however in lieu of this that no person shall fight a duel or send a challenge  if he do he is not only to be punished but to be deprived forever of the power of holding any office of honor or profit in the state  i have no reason however for supposing that education is neglected in illinois or that dueling has been abolished  in maine it is demanded that the townsthe whole country is divided into what are called townsshall make suitable provision at their own expense for the support and maintenance of public schools  some of these constitutional enactments are most magniloquently worded but not always with precise grammatical correctness  that for the famous bay state of massachusetts runs as follows wisdom and knowledge as well as virtue diffused generally among the body of the people being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the various parts of the country and among the different orders of the people it shall be the duty of the legislatures and magistrates in all future periods of this commonwealth to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences and of all seminaries of them especially the university at cambridge public schools and grammar schools in the towns to encourage private societies and public institutions by rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture arts sciences commerce trades manufactures and a natural history of the country to countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence public and private charity industry and frugality honesty and punctuality in all their dealings sincerity good humor and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people  i must confess that had the words of that little constitutional enactment been made known to me before i had seen its practical results i should not have put much faith in it  of all the public schools i have ever seenby public schools i mean schools for the people at large maintained at public costthose of massachusetts are i think the best  but of all the educational enactments which i ever read that of the same state is i should say the worst  in texas now of which as a state the people of massachusetts do not think much they have done it better a general diffusion of knowledge being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people it shall be the duty of the legislature of this state to make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of public schools  so say the texans but then the texans had the advantage of a later experience than any which fell in the way of the constitution makers of massachusetts  there is something of the magniloquence of the french styleof the liberty equality and fraternity mode of eloquencein the preambles of most of these constitutions which but for their success would have seemed to have prophesied loudly of failure those of new york and pennsylvania are the least so and that of massachusetts by far the most violently magniloquent  they generally commence by thanking god for the present civil and religious liberty of the people and by declaring that all men are born free and equal  new york and pennsylvania however refrain from any such very general remarks  i am well aware that all these constitutional enactments are not likely to obtain much credit in england  it is not only that grand phrases fail to convince us but that they carry to our senses almost an assurance of their own inefficiency  when we hear that a people have declared their intention of being henceforward better than their neighbors and going upon a new theory that shall lead them direct to a terrestrial paradise we button up our pockets and lock up our spoons  and that is what we have done very much as regards the americans  we have walked with them and talked with them and bought with them and sold with them but we have mistrusted them as to their internal habits and modes of life thinking that their philanthropy was pretentious and that their theories were vague  many cities in the states are but skeletons of towns the streets being there and the houses numberedbut not one house built out of ten that have been so counted up  we have regarded their institutions as we regard those cities and have been specially willing so to consider them because of the fine language in which they have been paraded before us  they have been regarded as the skeletons of philanthropical systems to which blood and flesh and muscle and even skin are wanting  but it is at least but fair to inquire how far the promise made has been carried out  the elaborate wordings of the constitutions made by the french politicians in the days of their great revolution have always been to us no more than so many written grimaces but we should not have continued so to regard them had the political liberty which they promised followed upon the promises so magniloquently made  as regards education in the statesat any rate in the northern and western statesi think that the assurances put forth in the various written constitutions have been kept  if this be so an american citizen let him be ever so arrogant ever so impudent if you will is at any rate a civilized being and on the road to that cultivation which will sooner or later divest him of his arrogance  emollit mores  we quote here our old friend the colonel again  if a gentleman be compelled to confine his classical allusions to one quotation he cannot do better than hang by that  but has education been so general and has it had the desired result  in the city of boston as i have said i found that in 1857 about oneeighth of the whole population were then on the books of the free public schools as pupils and that about one ninth of the population formed the average daily attendance  to these numbers of course must be added all pupils of the richer classesthose for whose education their parents chose to pay  as nearly as i can learn the average duration of each pupils schooling is six years and if this be figured out statistically i think it will show that education in boston reaches a very large majorityi might almost say the wholeof the population  that the education given in other towns of massachusetts is not so good as that given in boston i do not doubt but i have reason to believe that it is quite as general  i have spoken of one of the schools of new york  in that city the public schools are apportioned to the wards and are so arranged that in each ward of the city there are public schools of different standing for the gratuitous use of the children  the population of the city of new york in 1857 was about 650000 and in that year it is stated that there were 135000 pupils in the schools  by this it would appear that one person in five throughout the city was then under process of educationwhich statement however i cannot receive with implicit credence  it is however also stated that the daily attendances averaged something less than 50000 a day and this latter statement probably implies some mistake in the former one  taking the two together for what they are worth they show i think that school teaching is not only brought within the reach of the population generally but is used by almost all classes  at new york there are separate free schools for colored children  at philadelphia i did not see the schools but i was assured that the arrangements there were equal to those at new york and boston  indeed i was told that they were infinitely better but then i was so told by a philadelphian  in the state of connecticut the public schools are certainly equal to those in any part of the union  as far as i could learn educationwhat we should call advanced educationis brought within the reach of all classes in the northern and western states of americaand i would wish to add here to those of the canadas also  so much for the schools and now for the results  i do not know that anything impresses a visitor more strongly with the amount of books sold in the states than the practice of selling them as it has been adopted in the railway cars  personally the traveler will find the system very disagreeableas is everything connected with these cars  a young man enters during the journeyfor the trade is carried out while the cars are traveling as is also a very brisk trade in lollipops sugarcandy apples and ham sandwiches the young tradesman enters the car firstly with a pile of magazines or of novels bound like magazines  these are chiefly the atlantic published at boston harpers magazine published at new york and a cheap series of novels published at philadelphia  as he walks along he flings one at every passenger an englishman when he is first introduced to this manner of trade becomes much astonished  he is probably reading and on a sudden he finds a fat fluffy magazine very unattractive in its exterior dropped on to the page he is perusing  i thought at first that it was a present from some crazed philanthropist who was thus endeavoring to disseminate literature  but i was soon undeceived the bookseller having gone down the whole car and the next returned and beginning again where he had begun before picked up either his magazine or else the price of it  then in some half hour he came again with an armful or basket of books and distributed them in the same way  they were generally novels but not always  i do not think that any endeavor is made to assimilate the book to the expected customer  the object is to bring the book and the man together and in this way a very large sale is effected  the same thing is done with illustrated newspapers  the sale of political newspapers goes on so quickly in these cars that no such enforced distribution is necessary  i should say that the average consumption of newspapers by an american must amount to about three a day  at washington i begged the keeper of my lodgings to let me have a paper regularlyone american newspaper being much the same to me as anotherand my host supplied me daily with four  but the numbers of the popular books of the day printed and sold afford the most conclusive proof of the extent to which education is carried in the states  the readers of tennyson mackay dickens bulwer collins hughes and martin tupper are to be counted by tens of thousands in the states to the thousands by which they may be counted in our own islands  i do not doubt that i had fully fifteen copies of the silver cord thrown at my head in different railway cars on the continent of america  nor is the taste by any means confined to the literature of england longfellow curtis holmes hawthorne lowell emerson and mrs stowe are almost as popular as their english rivals  i do not say whether or no the literature is well chosen but there it is  it is printed sold and read  the disposal of ten thousand copies of a work is no large sale in america of a book published at a dollar but in england it is a very large sale of a book brought out at five shillings  i do not remember that i ever examined the rooms of an american without finding books or magazines in them  i do not speak here of the houses of my friends as of course the same remark would apply as strongly in england but of the houses of persons presumed to earn their bread by the labor of their hands  the opportunity for such examination does not come daily but when it has been in my power i have made it and have always found signs of education men and women of the classes to which i allude talk of reading and writing as of arts belonging to them as a matter of course quite as much as are the arts of eating and drinking  a porter or a farmers servant in the states is not proud of reading and writing it is to him quite a matter of course  the coachmen on their boxes and the boots as they set in the halls of the hotels have newspapers constantly in their hands  the young women have them also and the children  the fact comes home to one at every turn and at every hour that the people are an educated people  the whole of this question between north and south is as well understood by the servants as by their masters is discussed as vehemently by the private soldiers as by the officers  the politics of the country and the nature of its constitution are familiar to every laborer  the very wording of the declaration of independence is in the memory of every lad of sixteen  boys and girls of a younger age than that know why slidell and mason were arrested and will tell you why they should have been given up or why they should have been held in durance  the question of the war with england is debated by every native pavior and hodman of new york  i know what englishmen will say in answer to this  they will declare that they do not want their paviors and hodmen to talk politics that they are as well pleased that their coachmen and cooks should not always have a newspaper in their hands that private soldiers will fight as well and obey better if they are not trained to discuss the causes which have brought them into the field  an english gentleman will think that his gardener will be a better gardener without than with any excessive political ardor and the english lady will prefer that her housemaid shall not have a very pronounced opinion of her own as to the capabilities of the cabinet ministers  but i would submit to all englishmen and english women who may look at these pages whether such an opinion or feeling on their part bears much or even at all upon the subject  i am not saying that the man who is driven in the coach is better off because his coachman reads the paper but that the coachman himself who reads the paper is better off than the coachman who does not and cannot  i think that we are too apt in considering the ways and habits of any people to judge of them by the effect of those ways and habits on us rather than by their effects on the owners of them  when we go among garlic eaters we condemn them because they are offensive to us but to judge of them properly we should ascertain whether or no the garlic be offensive to them  if we could imagine a nation of vegetarians hearing for the first time of our habits as flesh eaters we should feel sure that they would be struck with horror at our bloodstained banquets but when they came to argue with us we should bid them inquire whether we flesh eaters did not live longer and do more than the vegetarians  when we express a dislike to the shoeboy reading his newspaper i apprehend we do so because we fear that the shoeboy is coming near our own heels  i know there is among us a strong feeling that the lower classes are better without politics as there is also that they are better without crinoline and artificial flowers but if politics and crinoline and artificial flowers are good at all they are good for all who can honestly come by them and honestly use them  the political coachman is perhaps less valuable to his master as a coachman than he would be without his politics but he with his politics is more valuable to himself  for myself i do not like the americans of the lower orders  i am not comfortable among them  they tread on my corns and offend me  they make my daily life unpleasant  but i do respect them  i acknowledge their intelligence and personal dignity  i know that they are men and women worthy to be so called i see that they are living as human beings in possession of reasoning faculties and i perceive that they owe this to the progress that education has made among them  after all what is wanted in this world  is it not that men should eat and drink and read and write and say their prayers  does not that include everything providing that they eat and drink enough read and write without restraint and say their prayers without hypocrisy  when we talk of the advances of civilization do we mean anything but this that men who now eat and drink badly shall eat and drink well and that those who cannot read and write now shall learn to do sothe prayers following as prayers will follow upon such learning  civilization does not consist in the eschewing of garlic or the keeping clean of a mans fingernails  it may lead to such delicacies and probably will do so  but the man who thinks that civilization cannot exist without them imagines that the church cannot stand without the spire  in the states of america men do eat and drink and do read and write  but as to saying their prayers  that as far as i can see has come also though perhaps not in a manner altogether satisfactory or to a degree which should be held to be sufficient  englishmen of strong religious feeling will often be startled in america by the freedom with which religious subjects are discussed and the ease with which the matter is treated but he will very rarely be shocked by that utter absence of all knowledge on the subjectthat total darkness which is still so common among the lower orders in our own country  it is not a common thing to meet an american who belongs to no denomination of christian worship and who cannot tell you why he belongs to that which he has chosen  but it will be said all the intelligence and education of this people have not saved them from falling out among themselves and their friends and running into troubles by which they will be ruined  their political arrangements have been so bad that in spite of all their reading and writing they must go to the wall i venture to express an opinion that they will by no means go to the wall and that they will be saved from such a destiny if in no other way then by their education  of their political arrangements as i mean before long to rush into that perilous subject i will say nothing here  but no political convulsions should such ariseno revolution in the constitution should such be necessarywill have any wide effect on the social position of the people to their serious detriment  they have the great qualities of the anglosaxon raceindustry intelligence and selfconfidence and if these qualities will no longer suffice to keep such a people on their legs the world must be coming to an end  i have said that it is not a common thing to meet an american who belongs to no denomination of christian worship  this i think is so but i would not wish to be taken as saying that religion on that account stands on a satisfactory footing in the states  of all subjects of discussion this is the most difficult  it is one as to which most of us feel that to some extent we must trust to our prejudices rather than our judgments  it is a matter on which we do not dare to rely implicitly on our own reasoning faculties and therefore throw ourselves on the opinions of those whom we believe to have been better men and deeper thinkers than ourselves for myself i love the name of state and church and believe that much of our english wellbeing has depended on it  i have made up my mind to think that union good and am not to be turned away from that conviction  nevertheless i am not prepared to argue the matter  one does not always carry ones proof at ones finger ends  but i feel very strongly that much of that which is evil in the structure of american politics is owing to the absence of any national religion and that something also of social evil has sprung from the same cause  it is not that men do not say their prayers  for aught i know they may do so as frequently and as fervently or more frequently and more fervently than we do but there is a rowdiness if i may be allowed to use such a word in their manner of doing so which robs religion of that reverence which is if not its essence at any rate its chief protection  it is a part of their system that religion shall be perfectly free and that no man shall be in any way constrained in that matter consequently the question of a mans religion is regarded in a freeandeasy way  it is well for instance that a young lad should go somewhere on a sunday but a sermon is a sermon and it does not much concern the lads father whether his son hear the discourse of a freethinker in the musichall or the eloquent but lengthy outpouring of a preacher in a methodist chapel  everybody is bound to have a religion but it does not much matter what it is  the difficulty in which the first fathers of the revolution found themselves on this question is shown by the constitutions of the different states  there can be no doubt that the inhabitants of the new england states were as things went a strictly religious community  they had no idea of throwing over the worship of god as the french had attempted to do at their revolution  they intended that the new nation should be preeminently composed of a godfearing people but they intended also that they should be a people free in everythingfree to choose their own forms of worship  they intended that the nation should be a protestant people but they intended also that no mans conscience should be coerced in the matter of his own religion  it was hard to reconcile these two things and to explain to the citizens that it behooved them to worship godeven under penalties for omission but that it was at the same time open to them to select any form of worship that they pleased however that form might differ from the practices of the majority  in connecticut it is declared that it is the duty of all men to worship the supreme being the creator and preserver of the universe but that it is their right to render that worship in the mode most consistent with the dictates of their consciences  and then a few lines further down the article skips the great difficulty in a manner somewhat disingenuous and declares that each and every society of christians in the state shall have and enjoy the same and equal privileges  but it does not say whether a jew shall be divested of those privileges or if he be divested how that treatment of him is to be reconciled with the assurance that it is every mans right to worship the supreme being in the mode most consistent with the dictates of his own conscience  in rhode island they were more honest  it is there declared that every man shall be free to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience and to profess and by argument to maintain his opinion in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge or affect his civil capacity  here it is simply presumed that every man will worship a god and no allusion is made even to christianity  in massachusetts they are again hardly honest  it is the right says the constitution as well as the duty of all men in society publicly and at stated seasons to worship the supreme being the great creator and preserver of the universe  and then it goes on to say that every man may do so in what form he pleases but further down it declares that every denomination of christians demeaning themselves peaceably and as good subjects of the commonwealth shall be equally under the protection of the law but what about those who are not christians  in new hampshire it is exactly the same  it is enacted that every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience and reason  and that every denomination of christians demeaning themselves quietly and as good citizens of the state shall be equally under the protection of the law  from all which it is i think manifest that the men who framed these documents desirous above all things of cutting themselves and their people loose from every kind of trammel still felt the necessity of enforcing religionof making it to a certain extent a matter of state duty  in the first constitution of north carolina it is enjoined that no person who shall deny the being of god or the truth of the protestant religion shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit  but this was altered in the year 1836 and the words christian religion were substituted for protestant religion  in new england the congregationalists are i think the dominant sect  in massachusetts and i believe in the other new england states a man is presumed to be a congregationalist if he do not declare himself to be anything else as with us the church of england counts all who do not specially have themselves counted elsewhere  the congregationalist as far as i can learn is very near to a presbyterian  in new england i think the unitarians would rank next in number but a unitarian in america is not the same as a unitarian with us  here if i understand the nature of his creed a unitarian does not recognize the divinity of our saviour  in america he does do so but throws over the doctrine of the trinity  the protestant episcopalians muster strong in all the great cities and i fancy that they would be regarded as taking the lead of the other religious denominations in new york  their tendency is to highchurch doctrines  i wish they had not found it necessary to alter the forms of our prayerbook in so many little matters as to which there was no national expediency for such changes  but it was probably thought necessary that a new people should show their independence in all things  the roman catholics have a very strong partyas a matter of courseseeing how great has been the emigration from ireland but here as in irelandand as indeed is the case all the world overthe roman catholics are the hewers of wood and drawers of water  the germans who have latterly flocked into the states in such swarms that they have almost germanized certain states have of course their own churches  in every town there are places of worship for baptists presbyterians methodists anabaptists and every denomination of christianity and the meetinghouses prepared for these sects are not as with us hideous buildings contrived to inspire disgust by the enormity of their ugliness nor are they called salem ebenezer and sion nor do the ministers within them look in any way like the deputyshepherd  the churches belonging to those sects are often handsome  this is especially the case in new york and the pastors are not unfrequently among the best educated and most agreeable men whom the traveler will meet  they are for the most part well paid and are enabled by their outward position to hold that place in the worlds ranks which should always belong to a clergyman  i have not been able to obtain information from which i can state with anything like correctness what may be the average income of ministers of the gospel in the northern states but that it is much higher than the average income of our parish clergymen admits i think of no doubt  the stipends of clergymen in the american towns are higher than those paid in the country  the opposite to this i think as a rule is the case with us  i have said that religion in the states is rowdy  by that i mean to imply that it seems to me to be divested of that reverential order and strictness of rule which according to our ideas should be attached to matters of religion  one hardly knows where the affairs of this world end or where those of the next begin  when the holy men were had in at the lecture were they doing stagework or churchwork  on hearing sermons one is often driven to ask ones self whether the discourse from the pulpit be in its nature political or religious  i heard an episcopalian protestant clergyman talk of the scoffing nations of europe because at that moment he was angry with england and france about slidell and mason  i have heard a chapter of the bible read in congress at the desire of a member and very badly read  after which the chapter itself and the reading of it became a subject of debate partly jocose and partly acrimonious  it is a common thing for a clergyman to change his profession and follow any other pursuit  i know two or three gentlemen who were once in that line of life but have since gone into other trades  there is i think an unexpressed determination on the part of the people to abandon all reverence and to regard religion from an altogether worldly point of view  they are willing to have religion as they are willing to have laws but they choose to make it for themselves  they do not object to pay for it but they like to have the handling of the article for which they pay  as the descendants of puritans and other godly protestants they will submit to religious teaching but as republicans they will have no priestcraft  the french at their revolution had the latter feeling without the former and were therefore consistent with themselves in abolishing all worship  the americans desire to do the same thing politically but infidelity has had no charms for them  they say their prayers and then seem to apologize for doing so as though it were hardly the act of a free and enlightened citizen justified in ruling himself as he pleases  all this to me is rowdy  i know no other word by which i can so well describe it  nevertheless the nation is religious in its tendencies and prone to acknowledge the goodness of god in all things  a man there is expected to belong to some church and is not i think well looked on if he profess that he belongs to none  he may be a swedenborgian a quaker a muggletoniananything will do but it is expected of him that he shall place himself under some flag and do his share in supporting the flag to which he belongs  this duty is i think generally fulfilled    chapter xx  from boston to washington   from boston on the 27th of november my wife returned to england leaving me to prosecute my journey southward to washington by myself  i shall never forget the political feeling which prevailed in boston at that time or the discussions on the subject of slidell and mason in which i felt myself bound to take a part  up to that period i confess that my sympathies had been strongly with the northern side in the general question and so they were still as far as i could divest the matter of its english bearings  i have always thought and do think that a war for the suppression of the southern rebellion could not have been avoided by the north without an absolute loss of its political prestige  mr lincoln was elected president of the united states in the autumn of 1860 and any steps taken by him or his party toward a peaceable solution of the difficulties which broke out immediately on his election must have been taken before he entered upon his office  south carolina threatened secession as soon as mr lincolns election was known while yet there were four months left of mr buchanans government  that mr buchanan might during those four months have prevented secession few men i think will doubt when the history of the time shall be written  but instead of doing so he consummated secession  mr buchanan is a northern man a pennsylvanian but he was opposed to the party which had brought in mr lincoln having thriven as a politician by his adherence to southern principles  now when the struggle came he could not forget his party in his duty as president  general jacksons position was much the same when mr calhoun on the question of the tariff endeavored to produce secession in south carolina thirty years ago in 1832excepting in this that jackson was himself a southern man  but jackson had a strong conception of the position which he held as president of the united states  he put his foot on secession and crushed it forcing mr calhoun as senator from south carolina to vote for that compromise as to the tariff which the government of the day proposed  south carolina was as eager in 1832 for secession as she was in 185960 but the government was in the hands of a strong man and an honest one  mr calhoun would have been hung had he carried out his threats  but mr buchanan had neither the power nor the honesty of general jackson and thus secession was in fact consummated during his presidency  but mr lincolns party it is saidand i believe truly said might have prevented secession by making overtures to the south or accepting overtures from the south before mr lincoln himself had been inaugurated  that is to say if mr lincoln and the band of politicians who with him had pushed their way to the top of their party and were about to fill the offices of state chose to throw overboard the political convictions which had bound them together and insured their successif they could bring themselves to adopt on the subject of slavery the ideas of their opponentsthen the war might have been avoided and secession also avoided  i do believe that had mr lincoln at that time submitted himself to a compromise in favor of the democrats promising the support of the government to certain acts which would in fact have been in favor of slavery south carolina would again have been foiled for the time  for it must be understood that though south carolina and the gulf states might have accepted certain compromises they would not have been satisfied in so accepting them  the desired secession and nothing short of secession would in truth have been acceptable to them  but in doing so mr lincoln would have been the most dishonest politician even in america  the north would have been in arms against him and any true spirit of agreement between the cottongrowing slave states and the manufacturing states of the north or the agricultural states of the west would have been as far off and as improbable as it is now  mr crittenden who proffered his compromise to the senate in december 1860 was at that time one of the two senators from kentucky a slave state  he now sits in the lower house of congress as a member from the same state  kentucky is one of those border states which has found it impossible to secede and almost equally impossible to remain in the union  it is one of the states into which it was most probable that the war would be carriedvirginia kentucky and missouri being the three states which have suffered the most in this way  of mr crittendens own family some have gone with secession and some with the union  his name had been honorably connected with american politics for nearly forty years and it is not surprising that he should have desired a compromise his terms were in fact thesea return to the missouri compromise under which the union pledged itself that no slavery should exist north of 3630 degrees n lat unless where it had so existed prior to the date of that compromise a pledge that congress would not interfere with slavery in the individual stateswhich under the constitution it cannot do and a pledge that the fugitive slave law should be carried out by the northern states  such a compromise might seem to make very small demand on the forbearance of the republican party which was now dominant  the repeal of the missouri compromise had been to them a loss and it might be said that its reenactment would be a gain  but since that compromise had been repealed vast territories south of the line in question had been added to the union and the reenactment of that compromise would hand those vast regions over to absolute slavery as had been done with texas  this might be all very well for mr crittenden in the slave state of kentuckyfor mr crittenden although a slave owner desired to perpetuate the union but it would not have been well for new england or for the west  as for the second proposition it is well understood that under the constitution congress cannot interfere in any way in the question of slavery in the individual states  congress has no more constitutional power to abolish slavery in maryland than she has to introduce it into massachusetts  no such pledge therefore was necessary on either side  but such a pledge given by the north and west would have acted as an additional tie upon them binding them to the finality of a constitutional enactment to which as was of course well known they strongly object  there was no question of congress interfering with slavery with the purport of extending its area by special enactment and therefore by such a pledge the north and west could gain nothing but the south would in prestige have gained much  but that third proposition as to the fugitive slave law and the faithful execution of that law by the northern and western states would if acceded to by mr lincolns party have amounted to an unconditional surrender of everything  what  massachusetts and connecticut carry out the fugitive slave law  ohio carry out the fugitive slave law after the dred scott decision and all its consequences  mr crittenden might as well have asked connecticut massachusetts and ohio to introduce slavery within their own lands  the fugitive slave law was then as it is now the law of the land it was the law of the united states as voted by congress and passed by the president and acted on by the supreme judge of the united states court  but it was a law to which no free state had submitted itself or would submit itself  what the english reader will say sundry states in the union refuse to obey the laws of the unionrefuse to submit to the constitutional action of their own congress  yes  such has been the position of this country  to such a dead lock has it been brought by the attempted but impossible amalgamation of north and south  mr crittendens compromise was moonshine  it was utterly out of the question that the free states should bind themselves to the rendition of escaped slaves or that mr lincoln who had just been brought in by their voices should agree to any compromise which should attempt so to bind them  lord palmerston might as well attempt to reenact the corn laws  then comes the question whether mr lincoln or his government could have prevented the war after he had entered upon his office in march 1861  i do not suppose that any one thinks that he could have avoided secession and avoided the war also that by any ordinary effort of government he could have secured the adhesion of the gulf states to the union after the first shot had been fired at fort sumter  the general opinion in england is i take it this that secession then was manifestly necessary and that all the bloodshed and moneyshed and all this destruction of commerce and of agriculture might have been prevented by a graceful adhesion to an indisputable fact  but there are some facts even some indisputable facts to which a graceful adherence is not possible could king bomba have welcomed garibaldi to naples  can the pope shake hands with victor emmanuel  could the english have surrendered to their rebel colonists peaceable possession of the colonies  the indisputability of a fact is not very easily settled while the circumstances are in course of action by which the fact is to be decided  the men of the northern states have not believed in the necessity of secession but have believed it to be their duty to enforce the adherence of these states to the union  the american governments have been much given to compromises but had mr lincoln attempted any compromise by which any one southern state could have been let out of the union he would have been impeached  in all probability the whole constitution would have gone to ruin and the presidency would have been at an end  at any rate his presidency would have been at an end  when secession or in other words rebellion was once commenced he had no alternative but the use of coercive measures for putting it downthat is he had no alternative but war  it is not to be supposed that he or his ministry contemplated such a war as has existedwith 600000 men in arms on one side each man with his whole belongings maintained at a cost of 150l per annum or ninety millions sterling per annum for the army  nor did we when we resolved to put down the french revolution think of such a national debt as we now owe  these things grow by degrees and the mind also grows in becoming used to them but i cannot see that there was any moment at which mr lincoln could have stayed his hand and cried peace it is easy to say now that acquiescence in secession would have been better than war but there has been no moment when he could have said so with any avail  it was incumbent on him to put down rebellion or to be put down by it  so it was with us in america in 1776  i do not think that we in england have quite sufficiently taken all this into consideration  we have been in the habit of exclaiming very loudly against the war execrating its cruelty and anathematizing its results as though the cruelty were all superfluous and the results unnecessary  but i do not remember to have seen any statement as to what the northern states should have donewhat they should have done that is as regards the south or when they should have done it  it seems to me that we have decided as regards them that civil war is a very bad thing and that therefore civil war should be avoided  but bad things cannot always be avoided  it is this feeling on our part that has produced so much irritation in them against usreproducing of course irritation on our part against them  they cannot understand that we should not wish them to be successful in putting down a rebellion nor can we understand why they should be outrageous against us for standing aloof and keeping our hands if it be only possible out of the fire  when slidell and mason were arrested my opinions were not changed but my feelings were altered  i seemed to acknowledge to myself that the treatment to which england had been subjected and the manner in which that treatment was discussed made it necessary that i should regard the question as it existed between england and the states rather than in its reference to the north and south  i had always felt that as regarded the action of our government we had been sans reproche that in arranging our conduct we had thought neither of money nor political influence but simply of the justice of the casepromising to abstain from all interference and keeping that promise faithfully  it had been quite clear to me that the men of the north and the women also had failed to appreciate this looking as men in a quarrel always do look for special favor on their side  everything that england did was wrong  if a private merchant at his own risk took a cargo of rifles to some southern port that act to northern eyes was an act of english interferenceof favor shown to the south by england as a nation but twenty shiploads of rifles sent from england to the north merely signified a brisk trade and a desire for profit  the james adger a northern manofwar was refitted at southampton as a matter of course  there was no blame to england for that but the nashville belonging to the confederates should not have been allowed into english waters  it was useless to speak of neutrality  no northerner would understand that a rebel could have any mutual right  the south had no claim in his eyes as a belligerent though the north claimed all those rights which he could only enjoy by the fact of there being a recognized war between him and his enemy the south  the north was learning to hate england and day by day the feeling grew upon me that much as i wished to espouse the cause of the north i should have to espouse the cause of my own country  then slidell and mason were arrested and i began to calculate how long i might remain in the country  there is no danger  we are quite right the lawyers said  there are vattel and puffendorff and stowell and phillimore and wheaton said the ladies  ambassadors are contraband all the world overmore so than gunpowder and if taken in a neutral bottom etc  i wonder why ships are always called bottoms when spoken of with legal technicality  but neither the lawyers nor the ladies convinced me  i know that there are matters which will be read not in accordance with any written law but in accordance with the bias of the readers mind  such laws are made to be strained any way  i knew how it would be  all the legal acumen of new england declared the seizure of slidell and mason to be right  the legal acumen of old england has declared it to be wrong and i have no doubt that the ladies of old england can prove it to be wrong out of yattel puffendorff stowell phillimore and wheaton  but theres grotius i said to an elderly female at new york who had quoted to me some half dozen writers on international law thinking thereby that i should trump her last card  ive looked into grotius too said she and as far as i can see etc etc etc  so i had to fall back again on the convictions to which instinct and common sense had brought me  i never doubted for a moment that those convictions would be supported by english lawyers  i left boston with a sad feeling at my heart that a quarrel was imminent between england and the states and that any such quarrel must be destructive to the cause of the north  i had never believed that the states of new england and the gulf states would again become parts of one nation but i had thought that the terms of separation would be dictated by the north and not by the south i had felt assured that south carolina and the gulf states across from the atlantic to texas would succeed in forming themselves into a separate confederation but i had still hoped that maryland virginia kentucky and missouri might be saved to the grander empire of the north and that thus a great blow to slavery might be the consequence of this civil war  but such ascendency could only fall to the north by reason of their command of the sea  the northern ports were all open and the southern ports were all closed  but if this should be reversed  if by englands action the southern ports should be opened and the northern ports closed the north could have no fair expectation of success  the ascendency in that case would all be with the south  up to that momentthe christmas of 1861maryland was kept in subjection by the guns which general dix had planted over the city of baltimore twothirds of virginia were in active rebellion coerced originally into that position by her dependence for the sale of her slaves on the cotton states  kentucky was doubtful and divided  when the federal troops prevailed kentucky was loyal when the confederate troops prevailed kentucky was rebellious  the condition in missouri was much the same  these four states by two of which the capital with its district of columbia is surrounded might be gained or might be lost  and these four states are susceptible of white laboras much so as ohio and illinoisare rich in fertility and rich also in all associations which must be dear to americans  without virginia maryland and kentucky without the potomac the chesapeake and mount vernon the north would indeed be shorn of its glory  but it seemed to be in the power of the north to say under what terms secession should take place and where should be the line  a senator from south carolina could never again sit in the same chamber with one from massachusetts but there need be no such bar against the border states  so much might at any rate be gained and might stand hereafter as the product of all that money spent on 600000 soldiers  but if the northerners should now elect to throw themselves into a quarrel with england if in the gratification of a shameless braggadocio they should insist on doing what they liked not only with their own but with the property of all others also it certainly did seem as though utter ruin must await their cause  with england or one might say with europe against them secession must be accomplished not on northern terms but on terms dictated by the south  the choice was then for them to make and just at that time it seemed as though they were resolved to throw away every good card out of their hand  such had been the ministerial wisdom of mr seward  i remember hearing the matter discussed in easy terms by one of the united states senators  remember mr trollope he said to me we dont want a war with england  if the choice is given to us we had rather not fight england  fighting is a bad thing  but remember this also mr trollope that if the matter is pressed on us we have no great objection  we had rather not but we dont care much one way or the other  what one individual may say to another is not of much moment but this senator was expressing the feelings of his constituents who were the legislature of the state from whence he came  he was expressing the general idea on the subject of a large body of americans  it was not that he and his state had really no objection to the war such a war loomed terribly large before the minds of them all they know it to be fraught with the saddest consequences  it was so regarded in the mind of that senator  but the braggadocio could not be omitted  had be omitted it he would have been untrue to his constituency  when i left boston for washington nothing was as yet known of what the english government or the english lawyers might say  this was in the first week in december and the expected voice from england could not be heard till the end of the second week  it was a period of great suspense and of great sorrow also to the more soberminded americans  to me the idea of such a war was terrible it seemed that in these days all the hopes of our youth were being shattered  that poetic turning of the sword into a sickle which gladdened our hearts ten or twelve years since had been clean banished from mens minds  to belong to a peace party was to be either a fanatic an idiot or a driveler  the arts of war had become everything  armstrong guns themselves indestructible but capable of destroying everything within sight and most things out of sight were the only recognized results of mans inventive faculties  to build bigger stronger and more ships than the french was englands glory  to hit a speck with a rifle bullet at 800 yards distance was an englishmans first duty  the proper use for a young mans leisure hours was the practice of drilling  all this had come upon us with very quick steps since the beginning of the russian war  but if fighting must needs be done one did not feel special grief at fighting a russian  that the indian mutiny should be put down was a matter of course  that those chinese rascals should be forced into the harness of civilization was a good thing  that england should be as strong as franceor perhaps if possible a little strongerrecommended itself to an englishmans mind as a state necessity  but a war with the states of america  in thinking of it i began to believe that the world was going backward  over sixty millions sterling of stockrailway stock and such likeare held in america by englishmen and the chances would be that before such a war could be finished the whole of that would be confiscated  family connections between the states and the british isles are almost as close as between one of those islands and another  the commercial intercourse between the two countries has given bread to millions of englishmen and a break in it would rob millions of their bread  these people speak our language use our prayers read our books are ruled by our laws dress themselves in our image are warm with our blood  they have all our virtues and their vices are our own too loudly as we call out against them  they are our sons and our daughters the source of our greatest pride and as we grow old they should be the staff of our age  such a war as we should now wage with the states would be an unloosing of hell upon all that is best upon the worlds surface  if in such a war we beat the americans they with their proud stomachs would never forgive us  if they should be victors we should never forgive ourselves  i certainly could not bring myself to speak of it with the equanimity of my friend the senator  i went through new york to philadelphia and made a short visit to the latter town  philadelphia seems to me to have thrown off its quaker garb and to present itself to the world in the garments ordinarily assumed by large citiesby which i intend to express my opinion that the philadelphians are not in these latter days any better than their neighbors  i am not sure whether in some respects they may not perhaps be worse  quakersquakers absolutely in the very flesh of close bonnets and brown knee breechesare still to be seen there but they are not numerous and would not strike the eye if one did not specially look for a quaker at philadelphia  it is a large town with a very large hotelthere are no doubt half a dozen large hotels but one of them is specially greatwith long straight streets good shops and markets and decent comfortablelooking houses  the houses of philadelphia generally are not so large as those of other great cities in the states  they are more modest than those of new york and less commodious than those of boston  their most striking appendage is the marble steps at the front doors  two doors as a rule enjoy one set of steps on the outer edges of which there is generally no parapet or raised curbstone  this to my eye gave the houses an unfinished appearanceas though the marble ran short and no further expenditure could be made  the frost came when i was there and then all these steps were covered up in wooden cases  the city of philadelphia lies between the two rivers the delaware and the schuylkill  eight chief streets run from river to river and twentyfour principal crossstreets bisect the eight at right angles  the crossstreets are all called by their numbers  in the long streets the numbers of the houses are not consecutive but follow the numbers of the crossstreets so that a person living on chestnut street between tenth street and eleventh street and ten doors from tenth street would live at no 1010  the opposite house would be no  1011  it thus follows that the number of the house indicates the exact block of houses in which it is situated i do not like the rightangled building of these towns nor do i like the sound of twentieth street and thirtieth street but i must acknowledge that the arrangement in philadelphia has its convenience  in new york i found it by no means an easy thing to arrive at the desired locality  they boast in philadelphia that they have half a million inhabitants  if this be taken as a true calculation philadelphia is in size the fourth city in the worldputting out of the question the cities of china as to which we have heard so much and believe so little  but in making this calculation the citizens include the population of a district on some sides ten miles distant from philadelphia  it takes in other towns connected with it by railway but separated by large spaces of open country american cities are very proud of their population but if they all counted in this way there would soon be no rural population left at all  there is a very fine bank at philadelphia and philadelphia is a town somewhat celebrated in its banking history my remarks here however apply simply to the external building and not to its internal honesty and wisdom or to its commercial credit  in philadelphia also stands the old house of congressthe house in which the congress of the united states was held previous to 1800 when the government and the congress with it were moved to the new city of washington  i believe however that the first congress properly so called was assembled at new york in 1789 the date of the inauguration of the first president  it was however here in this building at philadelphia that the independence of the union was declared in 1776 and that the constitution of the united states was framed  pennsylvania with philadelphia for its capital was once the leading state of the union leading by a long distance  at the end of the last century it beat all the other states in population but has since been surpassed by new york in all respectsin population commerce wealth and general activity  of course it is known that pennsylvania was granted to william penn the quaker by charles ii  i cannot completely understand what was the meaning of such grantshow far they implied absolute possession in the territory or how far they confirmed simply the power of settling and governing a colony  in this case a very considerable property was confirmed as the claim made by penns children after penns death was bought up by the commonwealth of pennsylvania for 130000l which in those days was a large price for almost any landed estate on the other side of the atlantic  pennsylvania lies directly on the borders of slave land being immediately north of maryland  mason and dixons line of which we hear so often and which was first established as the division between slave soil and free soil runs between pennsylvania and maryland  the little state of delaware which lies between maryland and the atlantic is also tainted with slavery but the stain is not heavy nor indelible  in a population of a hundred and twelve thousand there are not two thousand slaves and of these the owners generally would willingly rid themselves if they could it is however a point of honor with these owners as it is also in maryland not to sell their slaves and a man who cannot sell his slaves must keep them  were he to enfranchise them and send them about their business they would come back upon his hands were he to enfranchise them and pay them wages for work they would get the wages but he would not get the work  they would get the wages but at the end of three months they would still fall back upon his hands in debt and distress looking to him for aid and comfort as a child looks for it  it is not easy to get rid of a slave in a slave state  that question of enfranchising slaves is not one to be very readily solved  in pennsylvania the right of voting is confined to free white men in new york the colored free men have the right to vote providing they have a certain small property qualification and have been citizens for three years in the state whereas a white man need have been a citizen but for ten days and need have no property qualificationfrom which it is seen that the position of the negro becomes worse or less like that of a white man as the border of slave land is more nearly reached  but in the teeth of this embargo on colored men the constitution of pennsylvania asserts broadly that all men are born equally free and independent  one cannot conceive how two clauses can have found their way into the same document so absolutely contradictory to each other  the first clause says that white men shall vote and that black men shall notwhich means that all political action shall be confined to white men  the second clause says that all men are born equally free and independent  in philadelphia i for the first time came across live secessionistssecessionists who pronounced themselves to be such i will not say that i had met in other cities men who falsely declared themselves true to the union but i had fancied in regard to some that their words were a little stronger than their feelings  when a mans breadand much more when the bread of his wife and childrendepends on his professing a certain line of political conviction it is very hard for him to deny his assent to the truth of the argument  one feels that a man under such circumstances is bound to be convinced unless he be in a position which may make a stanch adherence to opposite politics a matter of grave public importance  in the north i had fancied that i could sometimes read a secessionist tendency under a cloud of unionist protestations  but in philadelphia men did not seem to think it necessary to have recourse to such a cloud  i generally found in mixed society that even there the discussion of secession was not permitted but in society that was not mixed i heard very strong opinions expressed on each side  with the unionists nothing was so strong as the necessity of keeping of slidell and mason when i suggested that the english government would probably require their surrender i was talked down and ridiculed  never thatcome what may  then within half an hour i would be told by a secessionist that england must demand reparation if she meant to retain any place among the great nations of the world but he also would declare that the men would not be surrendered  she must make the demand the secessionists would say and then there will be war and after that we shall see whose ports will be blockaded  the southerner has ever looked to england for some breach of the blockade quite as strongly as the north has looked to england for sympathy and aid in keeping it  the railway from philadelphia to baltimore passes along the top of chesapeake bay and across the susquehanna river at least the railway cars do so  on one side of that river they are run on to a huge ferryboat and are again run off at the other side  such an operation would seem to be one of difficulty to us under any circumstances but as the susquehanna is a tidal river rising and falling a considerable number of feet the natural impediment in the way of such an enterprise would i think have staggered us we should have built a bridge costing two or three millions sterling on which no conceivable amount of traffic would pay a fair dividend  here in crossing the susquehanna the boat is so constructed that its deck shall be level with the line of the railway at half tide so that the inclined plane from the shore down to the boat or from the shore up to the boat shall never exceed half the amount of the rise or fall  one would suppose that the most intricate machinery would have been necessary for such an arrangement but it was all rough and simple and apparently managed by two negroes  we would employ a small corps of engineers to conduct such an operation and men and women would be detained in their carriages under all manner of threats as to the peril of life and limb but here everybody was expected to look out for himself  the cars were dragged up the inclined plane by a hawser attached to an engine which hawser had the stress broken it as i could not but fancy probable would have flown back and cut to pieces a lot of us who were standing in front of the car  but i do not think that any such accident would have caused very much attention  life and limbs are not held to be so precious here as they are in england  it may be a question whether with us they are not almost too precious  regarding railways in america generally as to the relative safety of which when compared with our own we have not in england a high opinion i must say that i never saw any accident or in any way became conversant with one  it is said that large numbers of men and women are slaughtered from time to time on different lines but if it be so the newspapers make very light of such cases  i myself have seen no such slaughter nor have i even found myself in the vicinity of a broken bone  beyond the susquehanna we passed over a creek of chesapeake bay on a long bridge  the whole scenery here is very pretty and the view up the susquehanna is fine  this is the bay which divides the state of maryland into two parts and which is blessed beyond all other bays by the possession of canvasback ducks  nature has done a great deal for the state of maryland but in nothing more than in sending thither these webfooted birds of paradise  nature has done a great deal for maryland and fortune also has done much for it in these latter days in directing the war from its territory  but for the peculiar position of washington as the capital all that is now being done in virginia would have been done in maryland and i must say that the marylanders did their best to bring about such a result  had the presence of the war been regarded by the men of baltimore as an unalloyed benefit they could not have made a greater struggle to bring it close to them nevertheless fate has so far spared them  as the position of maryland and the course of events as they took place in baltimore on the commencement of secession had considerable influence both in the north and in the south i will endeavor to explain how that state was affected and how the question was affected by that state  maryland as i have said before is a slave state lying immediately south of mason and dixons line  small portions both of virginia and of delaware do run north of maryland but practically maryland is the frontier state of the slave states  it was therefore of much importance to know which way maryland would go in the event of secession among the slave states becoming general and of much also to ascertain whether it could secede if desirous of doing so  i am inclined to think that as a state it was desirous of following virginia though there are many in maryland who deny this very stoutly  but it was at once evident that if loyalty to the north could not be had in maryland of its own free will adherence to the north must be enforced upon maryland  otherwise the city of washington could not be maintained as the existing capital of the nation  the question of the fidelity of the state to the union was first tried by the arrival at baltimore of a certain commissioner from the state of mississippi who visited that city with the object of inducing secession  it must be understood that baltimore is the commercial capital of maryland whereas annapolis is the seat of government and the legislatureor is in other terms the political capital  baltimore is a city containing 230000 inhabitants and is considered to have as strong and perhaps as violent a mob as any city in the union  of the above number 30000 are negroes and 2000 are slaves  the commissioner made his appeal telling his tale of southern grievances declaring among other things that secession was not intended to break up the government but to perpetuate it and asked for the assistance and sympathy of maryland  this was in december 1860  the commissioner was answered by governor hicks who was placed in a somewhat difficult position  the existing legislature of the state was presumed to be secessionist but the legislature was not sitting nor in the ordinary course of things would that legislature have been called on to sit again  the legislature of maryland is elected every other year and in the ordinary course sits only once in the two years  that session had been held and the existing legislature was therefore exempt from further workunless specially summoned for an extraordinary session  to do this is within the power of the governor  but governor hicks who seems to have been mainly anxious to keep things quiet and whose individual politics did not come out strongly was not inclined to issue the summons  let us show moderation as well as firmness he said and that was about all he did say to the commissioner from mississippi  the governor after that was directly called on to convene the legislature but this he refused to do alleging that it would not be safe to trust the discussion of such a subject as secession to excited politicians many of whom having nothing to lose from the destruction of the government may hope to derive some gain from the ruin of the state  i quote these words coming from the head of the executive of the state and spoken with reference to the legislature of the state with the object of showing in what light the political leaders of a state may be held in that very state to which they belong  if we are to judge of these legislators from the opinion expressed by governor hicks they could hardly have been fit for their places  that plan of governing by the little men has certainly not answered  it need hardly be said that governor hicks having expressed such an opinion of his states legislature refused to call them to an extraordinary session  on the 18th of april 1860 governor hicks issued a proclamation to the people of maryland begging them to be quiet the chief object of which however was that of promising that no troops should be sent from their state unless with the object of guarding the neighboring city of washingtona promise which he had no means of fulfilling seeing that the president of the united states is the commanderinchief of the army of the nation and can summon the militia of the several states  this proclamation by the governor to the state was immediately backed up by one from the mayor of baltimore to the city in which he congratulates the citizens on the governors promise that none of their troops are to be sent to another state and then he tells them that they shall be preserved from the horrors of civil war  but on the very next day the horrors of civil war began in baltimore  by this time president lincoln was collecting troops at washington for the protection of the capital and that army of the potomac which has ever since occupied the virginian side of the river was in course of construction  to join this certain troops from massachusetts were sent down by the usual route via new york philadelphia and baltimore but on their reaching baltimore by railway the mob of that town refused to allow them to pass throughand a fight began  nine citizens were killed and two soldiers and as many more were wounded  this i think was the first blood spilt in the civil war and the attack was first made by the mob of the first slave city reached by the northern soldiers  this goes far to show not that the border states desired secession but that when compelled to choose between secession and union when not allowed by circumstances to remain neutral their sympathies were with their sister slave states rather than with the north  then there was a great running about of official men between baltimore and washington and the president was besieged with entreaties that no troops should be sent through baltimore  now this was hard enough upon president lincoln seeing that he was bound to defend his capital that he could get no troops from the south and that baltimore is on the highroad from washington both to the west and to the north but nevertheless he gave way  had he not done so all baltimore would have been in a blaze of rebellion and the scene of the coming contest must have been removed from virginia to maryland and congress and the government must have traveled from washington north to philadelphia  they shall not come through baltimore said mr lincoln  but they shall come through the state of maryland  they shall be passed over chesapeake bay by water to annapolis and shall come up by rail from thence  this arrangement was as distasteful to the state of maryland as the other but annapolis is a small town without a mob and the marylanders had no means of preventing the passage of the troops  attempts were made to refuse the use of the annapolis branch railway but general butler had the arranging of that  general butler was a lawyer from boston and by no means inclined to indulge the scruples of the marylanders who had so roughly treated his fellowcitizens from massachusetts  the troops did therefore pass by annapolis much to the disgust of the state on the 27th of april governor hicks having now had a sufficiency of individual responsibility summoned the legislature of which he had expressed so bad an opinion but on this occasion he omitted to repeat that opinion and submitted his views in very proper terms to the wisdom of the senators and representatives  he entertains as he says an honest conviction that the safety of maryland lies in preserving a neutral position between the north and the south certainly governor hicks if it were only possible  the legislature again went to work to prevent if it might be prevented the passage of troops through their state but luckily for them they failed  the president was bound to defend washington and the marylanders were denied their wish of having their own fields made the fighting ground of the civil war  that which appears to me to be the most remarkable feature in all this is the antagonism between united states law and individual state feeling  through the whole proceeding the governor and the state of maryland seemed to have considered it quite reasonable to oppose the constitutional power of the president and his government  it is argued in all the speeches and written documents that were produced in maryland at the time that maryland was true to the union and yet she put herself in opposition to the constitutional military power of the president  certain commissioners went from the state legislature to washington in may and from their report it appears that the president had expressed himself of opinion that maryland might do this or that as long as she had not taken and was not about to take a hostile attitude to the federal government  from which we are to gather that a denial of that military power given to the president by the constitution was not considered as an attitude hostile to the federal government  at any rate it was direct disobedience to federal law  i cannot but revert from this to the condition of the fugitive slave law  federal law and indeed the original constitution plainly declare that fugitive slaves shall be given up by the freesoil states  massachusetts proclaims herself to be specially a federal lawloving state  but every man in massachusetts knows that no judge no sheriff no magistrate no policeman in that state would at this time or then when that civil war was beginning have lent a hand in any way to the rendition of a fugitive slave  the federal law requires the state to give up the fugitive but the state law does not require judge sheriff magistrate or policeman to engage in such work and no judge sheriff or magistrate will do so consequently that federal law is dead in massachusetts as it is also in every freesoil statedead except in as much as there was life in it to create ill blood as long as the north and south remained together and would be life in it for the same effect if they should again be brought under the same flag  on the 10th of may the maryland legislature having received the report of their commissioners above mentioned passed the following resolution  whereas the war against the confederate states is unconstitutional and repugnant to civilization and will result in a bloody and shameful overthrow of our constitution and while recognizing the obligations of maryland to the union we sympathize with the south in the struggle for their rights for the sake of humanity we are for peace and reconciliation and solemnly protest against this war and will take no part in it  resolved that maryland implores the president in the name of god to cease this unholy war at least until congress assembles a period of above six months  that maryland desires and consents to the recognition of the independence of the confederate states the military occupation of maryland is unconstitutional and she protests against it though the violent interference with the transit of the federal troops is discountenanced  that the vindication of her rights be left to time and reason and that a convention under existing circumstances is inexpedient  from which it is plain that maryland would have seceded as effectually as georgia seceded had she not been prevented by the interposition of washington between her and the confederate statesthe happy intervention seeing that she has thus been saved from becoming the battleground of the contest  but the legislature had to pay for its rashness  on the 13th of september thirteen of its members were arrested as were also two editors of newspapers presumed to be secessionists  a member of congress was also arrested at the same time and a candidate for governor hickss place who belonged to the secessionist party  previously in the last days of june and beginning of july the chief of the police at baltimore and the members of the board of police had been arrested by general banks who then held baltimore in his power  i should be sorry to be construed as saying that republican institutions or what may more properly be called democratic institutions have been broken down in the states of america  i am far from thinking that they have broken down  taking them and their work as a whole i think that they have shown and still show vitality of the best order  but the written constitution of the united states and of the several states as bearing upon each other are not equal to the requirements made upon them  that i think is the conclusion to which a spectator should come  it is in that doctrine of finality that our friends have broken downa doctrine not expressed in their constitutions and indeed expressly denied in the constitution of the united states which provides the mode in which amendments shall be madebut appearing plainly enough in every word of selfgratulation which comes from them political finality has ever proved a delusionas has the idea of finality in all human institutions  i do not doubt but that the republican form of government will remain and make progress in north america but such prolonged existence and progress must be based on an acknowledgment of the necessity for change and must much depend on the facilities for change which shall be afforded  i have described the condition of baltimore as it was early in may 1861  i reached that city just seven months later and its condition was considerably altered  there was no question then whether troops should pass through baltimore or by an awkward round through annapolis or not pass at all through maryland general dix who had succeeded general banks was holding the city in his grip and martial law prevailed  in such times as those it was bootless to inquire as to that promise that no troops should pass southward through baltimore  what have such assurances ever been worth in such days  baltimore was now a military depot in the hands of the northern army and general dix was not a man to stand any trifling  he did me the honor to take me to the top of federal hill a suburb of the city on which he had raised great earthworks and planted mighty cannons and built tents and barracks for his soldiery and to show me how instantaneously he could destroy the town from his exalted position  this hill was made for the very purpose said general dix and no doubt he thought so  generals when they have fine positions and big guns and prostrate people lying under their thumbs are inclined to think that gods providence has specially ordained them and their points of vantage it is a good thing in the mind of a general so circumstanced that 200000 men should be made subject to a dozen big guns  i confess that to me having had no military education the matter appeared in a different light and i could not work up my enthusiasm to a pitch which would have been suitable to the generals courtesy that hill on which many of the poor of baltimore had lived was desecrated in my eyes by those columbiads  the neat earthworks were ugly as looked upon by me and though i regarded general dix as energetic and no doubt skillful in the work assigned to him i could not sympathize with his exultation  previously to the days of secession baltimore had been guarded by fort mchenry which lies on a spit of land running out into the bay just below the town  hither i went with general dix and he explained to me how the cannon had heretofore been pointed solely toward the sea that however now was all changed and the mouths of his bombs and great artillery were turned all the other way the commandant of the fort was with us and other officers and they all spoke of this martial tenure as a great blessing  hearing them one could hardly fail to suppose that they had lived their forty fifty or sixty years of life in full reliance on the powers of a military despotism  but not the less were they american republicans who twelve months since would have dilated on the allsufficiency of their republican institutions and on the absence of any military restraint in their country with that peculiar pride which characterizes the citizens of the states there are however some lessons which may be learned with singular rapidity  such was the state of baltimore when i visited that city  i found nevertheless that cakes and ale still prevailed there  i am inclined to think that cakes and ale prevail most freely in times that are perilous and when sources of sorrow abound  i have seen more reckless joviality in a town stricken by pestilence than i ever encountered elsewhere  there was general dix seated on federal hill with his cannon and there beneath his artillery were gentlemen hotly professing themselves to be secessionists men whose sons and brothers were in the southern army and women alas whose brothers would be in one army and their sons in another that was the part of it which was most heartrending in this border land  in new england and new york mens minds at any rate were bent all in the same directionas doubtless they were also in georgia and alabama  but here fathers were divided from sons and mothers from daughters  terrible tales were told of threats uttered by one member of a family against another  old ties of friendship were broken up  society had so divided itself that one side could hold no terms of courtesy with the other  when this is over one gentleman said to me every man in baltimore will have a quarrel to the death on his hands with some friend whom he used to love  the complaints made on both sides were eager and open mouthed against the other  late in the autumn an election for a new legislature of the state had taken place and the members returned were all supposed to be unionists  that they were prepared to support the government is certain  but no known or presumed secessionist was allowed to vote without first taking the oath of allegiance  the election therefore even if the numbers were true cannot be looked upon as a free election  voters were stopped at the poll and not allowed to vote unless they would take an oath which would on their parts undoubtedly have been false  it was also declared in baltimore that men engaged to promote the northern party were permitted to vote five or six times over and the enormous number of votes polled on the government side gave some coloring to the statement at any rate an election carried under general dixs guns cannot be regarded as an open election  it was out of the question that any election taken under such circumstances should be worth anything as expressing the minds of the people  red and white had been declared to be the colors of the confederates and red and white had of course become the favorite colors of the baltimore ladies then it was given out that red and white would not be allowed in the streets  ladies wearing red and white were requested to return home  children decorated with red and white ribbons were stripped of their bits of finerymuch to their infantile disgust and dismay  ladies would put red and white ornaments in their windows and the police would insist on the withdrawal of the colors  such was the condition of baltimore during the past winter nevertheless cakes and ale abounded and though there was deep grief in the city and wailing in the recesses of many houses and a feeling that the good times were gone never to return within the days of many of them still there existed an excitement and a consciousness of the importance of the crisis which was not altogether unsatisfactory  men and women can endure to be ruined to be torn from their friends to be overwhelmed with avalanches of misfortune better than they can endure to be dull  baltimore is or at any rate was an aspiring city proud of its commerce and proud of its society  it has regarded itself as the new york of the south and to some extent has forced others so to regard it also  in many respects it is more like an english town than most of its transatlantic brethren and the ways of its inhabitants are english  in old days a pack of fox hounds was kept hereor indeed in days that are not yet very old for i was told of their doings by a gentleman who had long been a member of the hunt  the country looks as a hunting country should look whereas no man that ever crossed a field after a pack of hounds would feel the slightest wish to attempt that process in new england or new york  there is in baltimore an old inn with an old sign standing at the corner of eutaw and franklin streets just such as may still be seen in the towns of somersetshire and before it there are to be seen old wagons covered and soiled and battered about to return from the city to the country just as the wagons do in our own agricultural counties  i have seen nothing so thoroughly english in any other part of the union  but canvasback ducks and terrapins are the great glories of baltimore  of the nature of the former bird i believe all the world knows something  it is a wild duck which obtains the peculiarity of its flavor from the wild celery on which it feeds this celery grows on the chesapeake bay and i believe on the chesapeake bay only  at any rate baltimore is the headquarters of the canvasbacks and it is on the chesapeake bay that they are shot  i was kindly invited to go down on a shootingparty but when i learned that i should have to ensconce myself alone for hours in a wet wooden box on the waters edge waiting there for the chance of a duck to come to me i declined  the fact of my never having as yet been successful in shooting a bird of any kind conduced somewhat perhaps to my decision i must acknowledge that the canvasback duck fully deserves all the reputation it has acquired  as to the terrapin i have not so much to say  the terrapin is a small turtle found on the shores of maryland and virginia out of which a very rich soup is made  it is cooked with wines and spices and is served in the shape of a hash with heaps of little bones mixed through it  it is held in great repute and the guest is expected as a matter of course to be helped twice the man who did not eat twice of terrapin would be held in small repute as the londoner is held who at a city banquet does not partake of both thick and thin turtle  i must however confess that the terrapin for me had no surpassing charms  maryland was so called from henrietta maria the wife of charles i by which king in 1632 the territory was conceded to the roman catholic lord baltimore  it was chiefly peopled by roman catholics but i do not think that there is now any such specialty attaching to the state  there are in it two or three old roman catholic families but the people have come down from the north and have no peculiar religious tendencies  some of lord baltimores descendants remained in the state up to the time of the revolution  from baltimore i went on to washington   end of vol i
